1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
This is yet another introduction to the show known as PTBP.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,680
The good numbers follow, 694.2.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,960
I'm Wolf the dog, the dog father, the dog mother, the dog puppy.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,560
Many more nicknames follow.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm glad you can be here with us today, whatever today is, whenever today is.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,320
And speaking of today, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Dean in the UK.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,000
Dean writes,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,760
Hello Mr. Wolf.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,080
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,600
It's time for more sickly sweet dumps to dive in.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,400
Anyway, enough about my weekend.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,760
I just wanted to give a big shout out to the fine fellas from Contention

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,440
doing their absolute best to keep us safe and sane.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,440
You, yes you too, Mr. Wolf, have brought such joy, delight, and revulsion into my life.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,440
And I couldn't be happier.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,040
Just a shout out to my wife, Ellen, for trusting in me and listening to the show.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,680
Two avid listeners from the UK.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
Much love, y'all.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,040
Signed, Dean, a fool.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
Well, hello Dean, if that is your real name.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,680
I'm glad you forced our show upon your spouse, Ellen, if that is her real name.

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,960
And do us all a favor and keep converting more and more people to be disciples of the wolf, the dog.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,240
If you want to write up something for your dog mother to howl,

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,200
please submit your memorandum as a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,680
And I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP.

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,120
Ocean City, New Jersey's sloppiest and creamiest radio station.

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,200
Would you like that, dear listener?

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,680
Either way, I got some news for you.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,840
It's time for the news.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,560
In the early morning of March 22nd, Daniel M. White,

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,240
an active Delta Green agent and the former partner of Arvon Chilton,

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,760
received a phone call at 4.55 AM from an unknown number.

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,200
Neighbors in his apartment complex reported they heard shouting, then weeping,

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,520
and finally watched as Arvon Chilton chased Daniel White from the building.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,000
White was found by a jogger three hours later on a trail behind the apartments.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,520
He had been stabbed 25 times and his eyes had been meticulously cut out.

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,160
Neither of his eyes had been located.

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,160
The McCarty case and the White case was soon connected.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,920
Arvon Chilton is still at large and he is still dangerous.

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,920
I've got to make a quick correction here as I drop this next track.

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:05,120
Last time, I said Brian Bolger, bowl like a bowl of slop and grr like an upset dog.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,640
But I have since realized his name is Brian Bolger,

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,960
bowl like load one up and grr like the prefix to cough.

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,400
So go ahead, load a bowl and jerk off.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,320
It's Brian Bolger with Bad in a Good Way.

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,880
And the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind.

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:53,040
I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

48
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,480
I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

49
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,720
Alexander Duchene looks at Agent Sparrow.

50
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,760
He is 79 years of age.

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,320
He is clothed in old often mended clothing and a pork pie hat.

52
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,320
And he has a long winding scar up the right half of his face.

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,360
It's clear that he drinks due to the large nose with burst capillaries,

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,920
just filling this big, almost like pulsating thing on the tip of his nose.

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,680
And he moves slowly, seemingly with great pain,

56
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
as he kind of like pops his head around the side and is like,

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,440
Arvin said that it would be fitting.

58
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
And as he says that, a massive thunderclap hits

59
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
and rain starts to begin pouring down outside

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,280
and you can see it drizzling through the window.

61
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,160
Can I do an intelligence check about what As You Like It's about?

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,800
Sure, yeah.

63
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,960
I hope you pass before he does, well...

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
I pass with an 84 on an 85.

65
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,680
Shit, amazing.

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,400
Before anybody clarifies what it is, Agent Sparrow, Sparrow Agnew,

67
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,960
Agent Sparrow wants to ask,

68
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
and have you read it?

69
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
Did you find it to be fitting?

70
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,680
I haven't had time.

71
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
I just, I haven't had any time.

72
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,160
Do you know what he found?

73
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,840
Did he clarify?

74
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,280
Why do you think he found it fitting?

75
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know.

76
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,160
People who are into that kind of thing, you know, they're nerds.

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,400
And I'm not really much of a reader.

78
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,640
Elwood kind of perks up at the idea of nerd, nerdom.

79
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,120
I am.

80
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,400
I've read it.

81
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,200
I've read them all.

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,840
All?

83
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,720
All of Shakespeare.

84
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,840
So what's it about?

85
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,200
Well, it boils down to a bunch of people were pretending to be other people.

86
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,760
Yeah.

87
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,720
That does sound fitting.

88
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,440
People pretending to be people.

89
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,040
That's the gist of it.

90
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,200
Yeah.

91
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,840
That's how it works.

92
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,400
Agent Sparrow, your phone starts ringing.

93
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,240
It is the Ocean City Police Department.

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,720
Uh, yeah.

95
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,560
Hey, uh, Agent Sparrow, Detective Quinlan is actually back from lunch and she's interested

96
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,360
in talking to you guys.

97
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
She's the Newark police on the case.

98
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,080
All right.

99
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,760
Please tell her we'll be there soon.

100
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,560
Thank you.

101
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,600
Do you have any other questions for an old man before you go out?

102
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,000
Really?

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,920
I must insist.

104
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Arvin is innocent.

105
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,480
How long did Arvin live here with you?

106
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,200
Five years.

107
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,360
Did he have a key to your apartment?

108
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,080
Yes.

109
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,720
Yes.

110
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,160
Maybe we should look around to see if he hid anything in here.

111
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,960
If he hid anything in here?

112
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,080
And he looks around at the place and he's like, no, I don't think Arvin would have

113
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
hid anything in my apartment.

114
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,080
It's always a possibility.

115
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,040
So if you don't mind, my associates are going to start looking around.

116
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,000
Um, while they do that, would you tell me the significance of these baseballs?

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,120
Oh, uh, yes.

118
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,440
I'm a big fan.

119
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,480
Who's your favorite team?

120
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,360
Yankees.

121
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
Where do they play?

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,280
The New York.

123
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,240
The new one.

124
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,720
That's right.

125
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,880
Did you play baseball as a child?

126
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,520
Who didn't?

127
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,600
Did you?

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:41,840
Yes.

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,280
All right.

130
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,840
Were you good?

131
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,480
Hey, you look at this like five foot seven, 210 pound man.

132
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,800
And he's just like, no.

133
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,920
I was a bit of a ball magnet crowd, the plate and hope they hit me.

134
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,560
Cause I wasn't much of a contact hitter.

135
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,960
I don't know much about sports.

136
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,160
I find that they take away from value funds that could be applied to youth academics.

137
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
He rolls his eyes at Elwood.

138
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,160
I think Elwood would kind of agree with this.

139
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,640
He's like wanting some sort of, you know, camaraderie there.

140
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,280
Not getting it.

141
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,640
Okay.

142
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Well, you guys should go on out and, um, you know, take, take your call, talk to whoever

143
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,360
you want to, but keep in mind, you should be looking for someone who is not Chilton.

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,280
There's a, there's been a change in the voice.

145
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,880
Do we clock that or is that Zach?

146
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,800
He will human.

147
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,300
Okay.

148
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,760
That's a 100.

149
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,120
Oh yeah.

150
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
There's clearly something wrong.

151
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,160
There's clearly something wrong with this old man.

152
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,360
You're like convinced now with a fail.

153
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
Could I ask him, do you have something in your throat?

154
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
It's been allergies, spring allergies.

156
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,640
They come in.

157
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,400
It makes me talk weird.

158
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,800
I know.

159
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,280
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,400
That's seasonally appropriate, but no, this is what I always sound like in spring.

161
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,400
I can hear glimpses of your, the voice we heard you with before peek through.

162
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,320
It sounds like it's kind of come over you.

163
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,360
It's up here.

164
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
It's it's still here.

165
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,360
This is when I'm like really trying to hold back a cough.

166
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,920
And then down here is more so when I feel more comfortable, but I'm holding in a cough.

167
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,000
If I accidentally cough, I might have an accident if I'm being honest.

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,120
And I just don't like wearing them.

169
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,920
The diapers.

170
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,480
You're saying you suffer from incontinence, sir?

171
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,040
Yeah.

172
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
The bandages smell.

173
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,040
Do we see bandages on him?

174
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,960
No, he's well covered up though.

175
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,280
He, uh, he's wearing like a long sleeved shirt and pants.

176
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,880
And if I did like a medicine roll, do you think I could determine maybe what caused his scar?

177
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,040
Yeah, go ahead and roll medicine.

178
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
36 on a 60.

179
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,760
Okay.

180
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Uh, yeah, it seems to have come from you think maybe some piece of metal.

181
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,920
How'd you get that scar, Mr. Duchesne?

182
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,480
How did I get these, this scar?

183
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
Uh, a horse.

184
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,400
A horse.

185
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,520
I fell off a horse.

186
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,320
Of course.

187
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,880
On two.

188
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,440
I fell.

189
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,560
And as I was falling, I got, I got kind of, you know, that, that horse kind of BDSM stuff

190
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,200
that they wear.

191
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,660
Yeah.

192
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,960
I think it's called Tack.

193
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,600
Tack, yeah.

194
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:57,840
Yeah.

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,800
Uh, there is a slice of metal, uh, you know, kind of shanked off the side and it got me

196
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,080
as I fell off.

197
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,960
Can I humid that?

198
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,460
Yeah.

199
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,960
One.

200
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,680
Oh yeah.

201
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
This is a lie.

202
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Why are you lying to me, Mr. Duchesne?

203
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,800
His face gets super serious.

204
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
As you look into his eyes, he looks past you.

205
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,000
Who are you?

206
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,200
Who are you?

207
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,800
Why are you in my house?

208
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,920
Kevin gets scared.

209
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Special agent Clarissa Sparrow.

210
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,640
And he's like kind of shuddering and hiding from you a little bit.

211
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,440
And he's like, get out.

212
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,200
Get out of my house.

213
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,960
Get out.

214
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,800
You invited us in Mr. Duchesne.

215
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,520
Okay.

216
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm just not comfortable right now.

217
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
Please leave.

218
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,840
Please leave.

219
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,880
Now you meant that.

220
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,380
Yeah.

221
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
20.

222
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,100
Pass.

223
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,080
He's fucking with you.

224
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,240
You can drop the act, Mr. Duchesne.

225
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,520
What, what, what act?

226
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,640
This act.

227
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,760
Something about my line of questioning has made you uncomfortable.

228
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
And then you lied to her about the scar.

229
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,440
And I kind of make eyes at Kevin.

230
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,400
He starts weeping.

231
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,280
Kevin puts his hand on Duchesne's shoulder.

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,880
Not like to hurt him, but like it is shoulders.

233
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,040
Like it covers his hands kind of like around the back of his neck and on his shoulders.

234
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,960
My memory is so good.

235
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,800
Stop crying.

236
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,200
It is.

237
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,080
Mr. Duchesne.

238
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,920
My memory is just so shy.

239
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,800
I want to tell you that I don't know.

240
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,560
I don't know.

241
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,840
Not to just keep going at him at that.

242
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,340
Yeah.

243
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,180
12.

244
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,560
He is telling the truth.

245
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,720
He does not remember how he got this scar.

246
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,280
Mr. Duchesne, you have some problems with your memory.

247
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,680
Please have, have an olive.

248
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,800
She sees that he's like got his eyes clenched with tears and she kind of like motions to

249
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
plop one in her mouth and just throws it behind her back.

250
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,240
All right.

251
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,480
I accept your hospitality, Mr. Duchesne.

252
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
Thank you very much for that.

253
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,840
Have a good day.

254
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,960
Thank you for your spread.

255
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,480
Have a good day.

256
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,960
And you guys head back to the Ocean City Police Department.

257
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,840
Can I ask real fast when, when he passed his medicine,

258
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,280
could he maybe have gotten like a timeline on how old the scar is?

259
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,320
Yeah, that's a good question.

260
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,440
That is a good question.

261
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,400
Probably that scar happened when he was still growing.

262
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,120
Okay, cool.

263
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
So definitely childhood or early childhood.

264
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,240
Okay.

265
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,480
All right.

266
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah, I think we're.

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,120
So back at the PD.

268
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,400
Going back to the police department.

269
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
We've got to meet the Newark Police Department.

270
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,440
Well, she was detective, right?

271
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,920
Detective Mara Quinlan.

272
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,520
And she's PD, not.

273
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,320
She is PD.

274
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,560
Yeah.

275
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,280
And when you guys arrive, the woman at the front desk points you off to a separate hallway

276
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,800
where Quinlan is set up in a smaller room than the FBI.

277
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,680
The FBI guy was set up in this big conference room with an entire conference table,

278
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,040
and he's sitting at it by himself.

279
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,320
And Mara Quinlan is in a closet.

280
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,280
This is not her department, her police department.

281
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,720
No, she's from Newark, but she's been brought in because

282
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
part of the case took place in her jurisdiction.

283
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,880
So there's some cross lines.

284
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,120
When you open up this small closet, you see an immaculately dressed police officer.

285
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,840
Her hair is done very, very neatly.

286
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,960
Her makeup is done very neatly.

287
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,120
Her nails are done very neatly.

288
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,600
She's just a very well put together person and professionally addresses you

289
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,720
when you enter the room.

290
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,040
She says, Hello, Mara Quinlan, detective, Newark PD.

291
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
Nice to meet the FBI on this case.

292
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,920
Before they can say anything or like extend a mannae's hand.

293
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,040
Sparrow's very quickly like, Pleasure to meet you, Detective Quinlan.

294
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,000
Pleasure's on my agent.

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
Agent Clarissa Sparrow.

296
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,160
These are my associates.

297
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,640
Sparrow.

298
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,440
Agent Boyd.

299
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,160
Hi, Kevin.

300
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,560
Agent Kevin.

301
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,680
Elwood just nods.

302
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,640
Okay, I learned that you guys already spoke to Garza.

303
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,280
Is that right?

304
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,840
Yeah.

305
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,120
The stinky fat guy.

306
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,420
That's her.

307
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,240
She like laughs.

308
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,720
Clarissa elbows you hard.

309
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,120
She laughs and she's like, Yeah, you know, he seems like a nice guy.

310
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,640
I don't think he's on the right path with this case, by the way.

311
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,320
Like his whole idea that it's a kidnapping thing.

312
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,520
I'm not for that.

313
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,960
I think that this is a crime of passion clearly committed by Chilton.

314
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,240
Eileen McCarty is the body who died in her own home.

315
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,400
Her husband is the body that died in his own home.

316
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,840
We don't really have much of a budding of heads between me and...

317
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,760
She rolls her eyes real big and says, Uncle Jimmy.

318
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,280
You know, it'll be fine.

319
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,480
He's a good guy.

320
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,760
I think that he's got a good head on his shoulders.

321
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,960
I just disagree with him.

322
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,360
How does the gas station attendant figure into your crime of passion idea?

323
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,440
These are not murders committed by a person who has all of their faculties about them.

324
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,440
You've seen the crime scene photos.

325
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,040
I mean, the medical examiner even said quote and she reaches through some papers and grabs

326
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,480
one and pulls up.

327
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,920
I'll be damned if I know what's going on.

328
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,080
There's just there's anomalies all over the place.

329
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,000
In this case, it's wild.

330
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,200
In my experience, all anomalies and mysteries can be solved with rational, sensible answers.

331
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,960
It could be magic.

332
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I slap you.

333
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,200
He just kind of like, if you speak out of turn one more time on my task force.

334
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,320
Or you'll do what?

335
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,360
She looks at Elwood with her eyes like contain him.

336
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,160
And then Elwood just puts a hand on like has to reach really high up to put a hand on Kevin's

337
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,320
shoulder and he just does a light double squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

338
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,000
Mara Quinlan has had her back turned this entire time.

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,240
When she saw the awkwardness happening, she immediately turned around and started fiddling

340
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,680
with files on this desk.

341
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,520
I mean, it seems like magic though, right?

342
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,040
I mean, three witnesses the day after her time of death.

343
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,960
I fully believe that that body is Eileen McCarty, but you know, three witnesses the day after

344
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,800
time of death is strange for sure.

345
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,880
Do you have any information about those witnesses?

346
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,120
All I have is that there's three witnesses the day after time of death and the medical

347
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,760
examiner also said it looks like the eyes were cut out with great care, which is odd.

348
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
Three witnesses the day after the death.

349
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,880
Yes.

350
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,040
So this is in addition to the witnesses who saw her on the day of the gas station crimes.

351
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,440
Yeah.

352
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,160
Yeah, that's right.

353
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,720
Yeah.

354
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,080
They saw her in New York.

355
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,920
The day after they saw her in New York.

356
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,320
The day after her death, they saw her in New York.

357
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,800
And then the next day was that the gas station.

358
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,400
Yeah, she was seen at the gas station where that murder, that horrible, horrible murder

359
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,280
took place.

360
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,800
What do you think about that footage?

361
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,040
She shudders.

362
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,840
One of her hands begins to like grip the desk and her knuckles turn white.

363
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,440
I don't know.

364
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,040
Well, if it, if it helps at all in my role as a profiler criminal psychologist, you learn

365
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,680
a lot about how regular people act too.

366
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,920
Sometimes they just shut down with the fear and they can't, they can't think of doing

367
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,640
the right thing.

368
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,200
Oh yeah.

369
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,760
She's just nodding her head and eating it up.

370
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,160
Yeah.

371
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,720
Yeah.

372
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:34,960
Yeah.

373
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,680
Of course.

374
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
That's why we do the job we do.

375
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,800
I like to think that I would have done something, but I, I understand wanting to not get involved.

376
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,080
You signed up to do something.

377
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,640
Exactly.

378
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,520
That's, that's what your service to this community is.

379
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,640
And my service is kind of at an end for you guys here.

380
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
I've given you everything I have.

381
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,400
If you have any questions for me, sure.

382
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,000
But I do have these super high res crime scene photos.

383
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,880
I know you probably saw uncle Jimmy.

384
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,800
All of our copies of those are, well, disgusting.

385
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,200
Yeah.

386
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,520
Yeah.

387
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,120
So I I've, I've got some on, on a thumb drive here if you want them.

388
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,920
Thank you very much.

389
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,800
I take the phone drive.

390
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,120
Yeah.

391
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,680
And maybe even after he handled Kevin dropping the magic like line, she like takes it, looks

392
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,000
over at Elwood and then tosses it to him.

393
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
Uh, Elwood catches it out of the air.

394
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,280
It sticks to his hand.

395
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,720
She instantly, she's like, no, now they're just covered in mayonnaise in another way.

396
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,520
Holler if you need anything.

397
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,480
Here's my card.

398
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,040
All right.

399
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,120
Thank you for your cooperation detective.

400
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,160
We'll be in touch.

401
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,040
Have a great day guys.

402
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,400
And you as well.

403
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,560
Hey, have you guys eaten since you've been out here?

404
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
Yeah, we had some charcuterie.

405
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,280
I had a bunch of olives.

406
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Elwood made me spit it out.

407
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,560
Oh, I huh.

408
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Well, you know, you just keep, you have a good day now.

409
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:52,800
Okay.

410
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:52,960
Yeah.

411
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,000
I regret asking.

412
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
They didn't taste good.

413
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,240
Okay.

414
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,280
Why do you care?

415
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,400
It's just, I had really good lunch, so I was going to suggest the place.

416
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,040
Where did you go?

417
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,880
Ocean city cafe.

418
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,760
It's really good.

419
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,720
It's just literally like around the corner from here.

420
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,120
Pretty good.

421
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,320
So if you need a bite to eat.

422
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,840
Is it by the dripping scoop?

423
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,520
Yeah, it's literally two doors down from the dripping scoop.

424
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:13,760
Okay.

425
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,080
I assume that was ice cream.

426
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,360
I want ice cream.

427
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,880
Oh no, that's not ice cream.

428
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,400
Hey Zach, what is it?

429
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Where should we go almighty sparrow?

430
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,160
You guys all say as you're looking out, uh, kind of standing at the double doors of this

431
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,680
police station, looking out at the torrential downpour of rain.

432
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,560
Now coming down here in ocean city, New Jersey.

433
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,960
I get an umbrella out and hold it above Elwood.

434
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,360
There's no acknowledgement from Elwood.

435
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,240
It's just expected.

436
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,480
Yeah.

437
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,200
What was the name of the restaurant you told us to go to?

438
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,000
Ocean city cafe, a real place in ocean city, New Jersey.

439
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
That is like catty corner from the police station.

440
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,040
I only, I only had olives.

441
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,080
I will remind you.

442
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,160
And I could use something else.

443
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,640
I threw up my food and spit it out.

444
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,600
I didn't need any of this food, but I pretended to eat an olive, which I just feel rotten about.

445
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,760
Let's go where the lady told us to go.

446
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,600
Yeah, let's stop by the ocean city cafe.

447
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,400
Oh, that looks good.

448
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,800
Right?

449
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,120
Yeah.

450
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,040
So I pulled up a picture of the ocean city cafe from Google street view.

451
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,320
It's like an old house.

452
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,720
It does.

453
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,280
It looks like an old house, like an old three-story house.

454
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,680
And there's a nice green awning on the outside that says ocean city cafe, breakfast, lunch,

455
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:40,560
dinner, and there's some nice patio tables, like four or five tables outside with umbrellas.

456
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,960
No one's sitting outside cause it's fucking coming down cats and dogs.

457
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,640
And you guys rush in out of the rain into the ocean city cafe, which is a

458
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,480
bustling little cafe here at about 1 32 o'clock PM.

459
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
Hey, my name's Leah.

460
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,360
I'll nope.

461
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,560
Hello.

462
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,440
My name's Leah.

463
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
I'll be out in just a moment to help you.

464
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
You can find anywhere to sit that you would like.

465
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,480
Well, what happened with your voice just there?

466
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,240
I decided to change it.

467
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
Oh, are you like an actor?

468
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,040
No, it's just, I studied journalism at the university.

469
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,320
And so I was just, it's just, sometimes I like to put myself into other people's shoes for

470
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,880
just a moment.

471
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,240
Maybe, but her name tag says Leah Maloy.

472
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,600
She's 20 female, curly, brown hair and long limbs.

473
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:38,560
Shout out to crane song from Washington, DC, another $10 or up patron on patrion.com slash

474
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,880
pretending pod and crane song is actually one of our $50 a month first church of contention

475
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
youth group members.

476
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,080
And so, uh, I, she's, uh, she's played in a couple of games that I've run now, a couple

477
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,160
of Delta green games, uh, that I home brewed and, uh, an excellent player.

478
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,880
So thank you crane song for Leah Maloy, who will sit you guys down.

479
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,280
Okay.

480
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,560
Hunts, what'll it be?

481
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,920
Coffee, water, black coffee, a water toast, no butter toast, no butter.

482
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,000
Uh, Elwood's going to order for Kevin.

483
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,160
We'll take, uh, two chocolate milks, put some ice in them.

484
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,040
Put some ice in those.

485
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,040
We like it when it waters down, she shudders.

486
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,280
Kevin's looking at a menu in front of him and I want the munchy platter and the Jersey

487
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,780
burger.

488
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,920
Oh, you already know what you want to eat.

489
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,400
Okay, good.

490
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,520
The munchy platter has chicken tenders, onion rings, French fries, mozzarella sticks, and

491
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,040
Buffalo wings.

492
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,520
Wow.

493
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,080
Yeah.

494
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,040
Make that, make that too.

495
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,760
I don't need the burger.

496
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
I'll just take the platter.

497
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,400
Okay.

498
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,920
Platter and the munchy.

499
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,240
And did you want anything to eat on?

500
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,560
Yes.

501
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,440
Butter, no toast.

502
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,000
That's right.

503
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,640
So sorry.

504
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:57,440
Uh, and she, uh, started writing down, she started writing the notes after she took the

505
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,640
toast, no butter order.

506
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,280
So she does write down butter, no toast, and then walks away and then immediately turns

507
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,880
on her heels and it's like butter, no toast, no butter.

508
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,960
And, uh, as an embarrassed server might do turns and, uh, wanting that good tip later

509
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,400
is just like, no, no, no, my bad.

510
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,520
And goes to the back.

511
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,200
You're so fucked there because you can bring out both things separately, but you still

512
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
brought out one thing you were not supposed to bring.

513
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,120
She's just in the back staring at the sheet where she wrote down butter, no toast, and

514
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
is just like, did I mean to do this?

515
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,380
I do.

516
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:44,480
But you know, uh, she is a lover of facts and therefore she comes back to the table

517
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,920
a few minutes later with a coffee and two chocolate milks filled with the brim with

518
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,120
ice cubes.

519
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,080
Now I just wanted to do one more check on that butter, no toast.

520
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
Was that butter, no toast or toast, no butter?

521
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,960
What do you think?

522
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,680
That's a, that's a very good, that's a very good point, ma'am.

523
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,040
Sorry to bother you.

524
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,480
And she walks back.

525
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,160
Still not a hundred percent.

526
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
She's definitely bringing you butter.

527
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,000
Any, uh, any conversation happening over the, uh, coffee and chocolate milks?

528
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,080
I think at least now agent Sparrow is like really deep in these crime scene photos.

529
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,760
Oh, wait, we get, we didn't get copies of those.

530
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,160
We got the, well, we didn't talk about, can I have a computer?

531
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,080
Yeah, fuck yeah, you can have a computer.

532
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,760
2016 baby.

533
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,480
I'm pulling it up.

534
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,000
I plugged in the, uh, the stick and we're looking at the high res images.

535
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
Roll luck for me real quick.

536
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
50 50 shots, 47.

537
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,720
You plug it in correctly the first time that USB slides in there.

538
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,080
Agent Sparrow, like her eyebrow raises that you're like, you really can get in and out of places.

539
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,040
Actually, as you guys, it says here, you have to roll sanity again because these are high

540
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,680
res crime scene photos.

541
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,360
And so it says obscured by mayonnaise dance.

542
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,000
That's right.

543
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,800
So quote, there is nothing to be seen here except sand loss.

544
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,080
We fell into your trap.

545
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,320
Yeah.

546
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,040
Not when you, not when you roll sick twelves.

547
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
Oh, nice pass 32.

548
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,760
I fail.

549
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,160
Okay.

550
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,080
So, uh, you are going to lose three sanity.

551
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,440
Elwood Boyd loses three sanity.

552
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,800
Are you okay, boss?

553
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,680
He's probably shaking a little bit and he's now turned the computer screen away from himself

554
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,200
so that you guys can see it, but he doesn't want it in his field of view at all.

555
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,400
Agent Sparrow kind of like takes it from him and starts sort of very familiarly flipping

556
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,080
through this file like system.

557
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,680
She's been given reports like this before and she's just like tabbing through and she's

558
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,720
like, yeah, okay.

559
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,880
No eyes, no eyes.

560
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,800
Carefully removed very carefully.

561
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,120
So do you think the book is a clue?

562
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,920
Shane seems to think that I want the listener to know that every single time Joe goes into

563
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,040
character, he holds his wrists limp and then one over the other.

564
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,920
We'll post a picture.

565
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,160
Yeah.

566
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,560
Like he goes a little Igor.

567
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,600
Yeah.

568
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,520
Yeah.

569
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,680
That's the sort of the picture of my brain.

570
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:18,880
It's Igor, the creature, which is actually what you just lost sanity to was some Igor.

571
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,120
Hey, I like that one.

572
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,360
That's both electronic.

573
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,000
And the thing we just said in all the blood.

574
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,560
You're right.

575
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,840
That's why it was a joke, Joe.

576
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,040
Sometimes you would just let it sit with the gore, but you worked in that E.

577
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,080
The E was important.

578
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:54,880
It's could I give you a forensics or medicine or even alertness or search role on these

579
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,360
pictures to determine what just to see if I can glean anything more from them?

580
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,720
Yeah, go ahead and give me a forensics.

581
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,760
What about a medicine?

582
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,320
Oh, okay.

583
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,120
Whichever.

584
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,880
It'll get you something different.

585
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,600
I suppose.

586
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,240
Okay.

587
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,920
46 on a 60 medicine.

588
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,320
Okay.

589
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,480
So with a 46 on a 60 medicine, you're really diving in.

590
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,480
And I will say, even though the great Dennis Detwiller wrote, there's nothing to be seen

591
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,880
here except sand loss, especially because you passed that sanity check.

592
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,920
Oh yeah, you did just say that.

593
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,960
You can dive in.

594
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,920
Yeah, I did.

595
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:41,040
But you dive in and you can very clearly pull up a picture of Eileen and it's definitely

596
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,680
Eileen.

597
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,040
You can match it up enough to where like the corpse.

598
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:53,760
Yeah, anyone who thinks that this is not Eileen is really grasping at straws to make a case

599
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,400
that they want.

600
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,480
Now I think I know what's going on as Thomas, but Agent Sparrow doesn't.

601
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,320
Agent Sparrow definitely would because she doesn't know the scenario is called control

602
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,280
copy or that this podcast is called pretending to be people and like that's part.

603
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,280
Yeah, you're right.

604
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,400
She doesn't know those things.

605
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,960
She does.

606
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,000
She does like take a note of the fact that this is certainly Eileen's corpse unless she

607
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,160
has a twin with both her eyes.

608
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,640
These witnesses were sorely mistaken.

609
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,280
What about a magic that makes you look like her?

610
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,640
Oh, I'm glad you brought that up.

611
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,280
Hey, now I know you've been on a couple of nights at the opera before with Elwood.

612
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,320
Yeah, yeah.

613
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,880
Y'all are just friendlies right now, right?

614
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,520
Is that what they call you?

615
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
We're friends with each other for a long time.

616
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,480
Right, right.

617
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,160
Elwood, you're friendlies?

618
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,880
No, we're full-fledged these days.

619
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,320
We've done a couple of these now.

620
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,200
All right, well, that concerns me because this one doesn't seem to know you can't be

621
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
talking to civilians.

622
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,360
Well, you know, it's a police officer, but you can't be talking to the uninitiated about

623
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,600
the supernatural and the otherworldly.

624
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,280
You're right, bud.

625
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,280
That is probably magic, but we can't be saying that to detectives from Newark.

626
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,920
Do you know what I mean?

627
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,280
Can you guys roll alertness for me?

628
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,360
I'm gonna roll intelligence to see if I know what he means.

629
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,440
Okay, I passed alertness and I passed my intelligence check.

630
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,160
Leah Molloy failed her stealth roll and she is trying to eavesdrop.

631
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,320
I also passed my alertness.

632
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,200
So you guys were able to have this conversation covertly.

633
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,040
As you notice, she is literally trying to bust the tables closest to you as she kind

634
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,680
of gets a hint that you're talking secrets.

635
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:54,640
Yeah, so agent Sparrow tilts the laptop away from her from a view in towards the booth.

636
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,480
And she says, let me go grab your food.

637
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,960
And she comes back with both things that Kevin ordered, one of which also goes to Elwood

638
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,480
and then she sets down a plate very, very awkwardly.

639
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,760
She slowly sits down a plate of butter.

640
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,520
Agent Sparrow is already just like looking back in her notes.

641
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,720
And you can tell she's really deep and lot like she got she's on a trail and she just

642
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,120
kind of absentmindedly like spoons butter into her mouth.

643
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,720
And like it looks she makes an unpleasant face, but doesn't, you know, spit it out or

644
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,520
really clock that that's what she's just done.

645
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,600
The other two you see Leah Molloy is like, oh, nailed it.

646
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,560
Nailed it.

647
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,520
And then she says, did you guys hear about the new vandalism in town?

648
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:45,920
What?

649
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,600
Yeah, it's this weird like pentagram ish kind of thing.

650
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,320
It's this dark brown paint that someone's using to make these tags.

651
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,960
It looks like it's so scary.

652
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,080
Can you guys handle this?

653
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,280
It's super scary.

654
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,240
Dark brown.

655
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,800
Yeah, yeah.

656
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,280
Agent Sparrow's like stomach sinks.

657
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,880
Kevin is like intently listening, but he hands her his two empty plates.

658
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,400
And she kind of like holds him on her forearm like a server might as she's like, yeah, this

659
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,720
thing.

660
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,640
It's kind of pentagram ish, but it looks like a bearskin rug.

661
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,440
You know what I mean?

662
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,080
Like the head, then the paws, then the feet, you know, that would make kind of a star pattern

663
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,480
like a pentagram, but it's not a bear.

664
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,000
It's like a person.

665
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,440
It's like the picture of it's like a person who's like splayed out.

666
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,240
It's like a person skin rug.

667
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,960
Yeah, but that's it's just that it's art all over.

668
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,000
It's crazy looking and dark brown paint.

669
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,320
Yeah.

670
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,080
Is it like the rotruvian man?

671
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,440
Like Leonardo DiCaprio, but but skinned, right?

673
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:51,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,080
Like skinned and pinned by the stiff.

675
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,920
Oh, actually, so that jogs something in Agent Sparrow's mind and she's like, I'm hungry

676
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,480
then I thought.

677
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,440
And she points to the menu.

678
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,600
She says, I will take the skinned and pinned.

679
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,240
You said is have you seen that that symbol that's been other there many places?

680
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,080
I hear like everything that goes on in Ocean City because I don't know if you could tell

681
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,880
earlier.

682
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,680
I think you could tell.

683
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,200
I was trying to listen to you guys too.

684
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,800
But I just I love it trying to get the scoop trying to get the scoop.

685
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,360
You know, I dropped out, but I'm going to get that big break and I'm going to write

686
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,400
the story that puts my name on the map.

687
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,880
Do you know?

688
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,280
Well, Miss Malloy, if you want to make a difference in this world, I suggest getting your law

689
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,320
degree and going into some kind of criminal enforcement.

690
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
That's the only way I really see to make a difference.

691
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,280
But because that's what we did do, it's our job to scoop around, figure that out.

692
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,880
That's not that's not yours.

693
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,880
And do you have any pie?

694
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,120
Yeah.

695
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,640
Why don't you butt out and get us some pie?

696
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,840
And one spin and pinned extra crispy.

697
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,440
Completely turned off by this situation.

698
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,920
She's not going to try to make any more chitchat with you guys.

699
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,480
She's just going to bring you the food and the pie and then you can head out as you guys

700
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,920
are finishing up the pie.

701
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,440
Blueberry.

702
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,680
Miss Malloy, do you know the location of any of those recent graffitis?

703
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,320
Yeah, there's one literally right around the corner.

704
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,560
It's on the Ocean City Cafe.

705
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,360
Thank you very much.

706
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,320
Agent Sparrow leaves a not great, but sensible and not insulting tip.

707
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,360
What is that?

708
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,560
What percentage is that?

709
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,840
It's probably like 17.

710
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,800
As he's scooting out of the booth, Elwood grabs a fork near him and he finishes off

711
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,480
whatever is left of the pad of butter.

712
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,560
Do I see that?

713
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,240
Sure.

714
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,320
Yeah, Elwood, for the rest of the game, is going to have like grease marks around his

715
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,400
mouth from doubling down this plate and then butter also.

716
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,360
Jesus.

717
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,400
It's horrible.

718
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,520
When we get around to the graffiti, Kevin's going to start doing some push-ups.

719
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,400
Okay, I'm going to go pee real quick.

720
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:24,000
Until I had an alien abortion.

721
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,520
Alien abortion.

722
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,960
Alien abortion.

723
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,480
Alien abortion.

724
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,680
Alien abortion.

725
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
Get this beast out of my belly.

726
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,400
Kevin Gelato begins doing push-ups.

727
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,920
How does Kevin do push-ups?

728
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,360
Look at Clarissa.

729
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,880
It's how he keeps in shape.

730
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,240
Yeah, and she's tapped you and she's like, I think it's good that he's distracted for

731
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,560
a minute.

732
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,320
Can we talk for a second?

733
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,000
Sure.

734
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,920
So like, you help him out?

735
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,000
What's the nature of your...

736
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I mean, we help each other out, surely.

737
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,080
I guess you could say he's my bodyguard.

738
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,320
That's kind of the way I like to think of him.

739
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,120
Your bodyguard.

740
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,160
Yeah, I mean, look at me.

741
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,000
I wouldn't do anything in a fight and I do run my mouth from time to time and I feel

742
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,320
like I should have some muscle there.

743
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
He's always been by my side.

744
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,080
I keep him around.

745
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,400
All right.

746
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,760
Yeah.

747
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,880
Would you say you're friends?

748
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,720
He would.

749
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,220
Yeah.

750
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:35,440
So yeah, Clarissa just allows that to be added to like how sad the world is.

751
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,520
She's just like, can't.

752
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,240
All right.

753
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,320
Can't think about that necessarily right now.

754
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,880
Yeah, you look down at the ground to get away from that thought.

755
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,400
Well, I look down at the ground and see him doing the pushups and then I look back up

756
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,600
and he's like, there's one more thing I wanted to say.

757
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,120
You know, when that waitress mentioned the dark brown paint.

758
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,760
I saw your eyes kind of sunk a little.

759
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,280
Well, I just...

760
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,720
Do you know what gets dark brown when it dries?

761
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,560
He's just seen the crime scene photos and it sparks in his mind a little bit.

762
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,320
Oh, oh.

763
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,520
Yeah, that's blood.

764
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,680
I'm going to go take a look at this graffiti.

765
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,960
Could you keep him here doing pushups?

766
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,680
Do you think you could handle the side of that if you knew what it was?

767
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,720
I think Elwood would think that he could handle it.

768
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,240
Like he clocked that guy in the back of the head in my pre-story.

769
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,640
Yeah, like I don't think he's immune to violence.

770
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,920
Oh, I thought he jacked him off so well that he passed out.

771
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,760
You said he whacked him real good.

772
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,920
He whacked him so good, dude.

773
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
He said he's in his boxers on the floor.

774
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,320
Whacked him so good that he's down for five hours.

775
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,120
Western style.

776
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,680
If it was a big crusty cum stain on the wall, he would handle it, but it's blood.

777
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,180
I don't know.

778
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,520
That's what I'm thinking.

779
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,800
If it's a big crusty cum stain on the wall, he could handle it.

780
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,000
This is blood.

781
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,440
Oh, I think I just spoke.

782
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,640
He didn't whack him.

783
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,040
Whack him.

784
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,400
He whacked him.

785
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,080
And at this time you hear Kevin go,

786
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,080
and a punch.

787
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,920
And then he just gets up and walks over.

788
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,920
And a bunch.

789
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,360
Kevin, can you stomach the side of blood?

790
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,040
I made people bleed.

791
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,600
He has.

792
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,320
Yeah, he has.

793
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,400
On and off the field.

794
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,440
She takes a note of that as well and doesn't say anything.

795
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,080
She's like, all right, let's go investigate this graffiti.

796
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,320
Yeah.

797
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,480
Also, I don't even know what kind of EQ I'm going to have to use on Luke's voice for this

798
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,400
group of episodes to get that voice.

799
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,000
It's not that you're speaking quietly.

800
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,640
It's just that I fully had to parse it for a second in my language center.

801
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,920
It was like a Spanish person listening to Portuguese.

802
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Like, oh no, we can make each other self understood,

803
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,480
but I'm not going to be fluently communicating with you.

804
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,760
So you guys turned the corner, just right around the corner of this restaurant.

805
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,560
And basically, if you were driving on the street,

806
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,360
you would be able to see this vandalism.

807
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,880
This, we can say it's blood, probably.

808
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,080
Blood graffiti.

809
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,120
Probably blood graffiti.

810
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,400
Justin hits some sweet, like, string rises here.

811
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,880
Oh yeah.

812
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:36,080
It's as Agent Sparrow, like, shakily walks up to the wall and does a medicine roll to examine it.

813
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,580
Yeah.

814
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,960
69.

815
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,260
Nice.

816
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,460
Whoa.

817
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,380
Okay.

818
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,000
69.

819
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,380
Hmm.

820
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,200
I know the blood type.

821
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,600
Who's blood this is.

822
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,800
He knows who's blood it is.

823
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,480
I was trying to think of a way that I could tell you who's blood it is.

824
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,320
They wrote the name above here.

825
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,820
Right.

826
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,240
69.

827
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,800
Kevin just ordered dinner for two.

828
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
And you guys are...

829
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,360
Is there any cool meaning I might be...

830
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,120
Like, I was trying to see if it was blood,

831
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,880
but do I grasp maybe the significance of this picture?

832
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,040
Yeah.

833
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,840
With the 69, I will tell you that that is an occult symbol.

834
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,720
It is related to the Testament of New Flesh.

835
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,840
Is that, like, even something I might have heard of before?

836
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

837
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,800
That's why you recognize it, is you're like,

838
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,000
shit, this is the Testament of New Flesh,

839
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,440
which is this, like, old idea that there were these chants

840
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,640
that people could learn in this language called Aklo,

841
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,120
which is a pre-human language that people talk about,

842
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,320
like, it's this thing, like, within the walls of Delta Green,

843
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,720
you know, people might be talking about Aklo,

844
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,360
some very, like, estranged professors who are not well respected

845
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,520
at their specific universities, you know.

846
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,280
These are the kind of people who talk about Testament of the New Flesh.

847
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,840
It's cult worship of some sort of unknown deity.

848
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,480
Yeah, yeah.

849
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,880
I knew a man, he was almost like a father to me,

850
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,600
but he died on my first mission with this organization,

851
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,920
but he spoke of things like this.

852
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,720
He was interested in this group, he called it the Testament of New Flesh,

853
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,920
and this is one of, it was crude,

854
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,480
he didn't have a good drawing of it, but he showed me this symbol.

855
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,120
Agent Sparrow, your phone starts ringing.

856
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,480
Unknown number.

857
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,520
No, it doesn't say unknown, it has numbers there.

858
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,480
It's 2016.

859
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,360
It's 2016.

860
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,480
I already don't want to answer phone calls that I get

861
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,400
when I don't know the number at this point in time,

862
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,240
but this is my work phone, so I do.

863
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,120
Yeah, hello.

864
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,760
Agent, Agent, Agent, uh, Sparrow, right?

865
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,960
Mr. DeChase.

866
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,520
DeShane, yes, I, I am so scared.

867
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,960
I just got, I got a voicemail, I got a voicemail from Chilton.

868
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,680
It says I'm next, he's gonna kill me.

869
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,280
He's gonna kill me.

870
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,600
You hold on tight, we'll be right there.

871
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,480
Thank you.

872
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,360
He hangs up.

873
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,640
Elwood, you call 911, you tell them to get RAT to his address,

874
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,800
and then I directly call the detective.

875
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,640
Elwood, Elwood's gonna pop in real quick.

876
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,360
What's going on?

877
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,680
Mr. DeChase just got a message.

878
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,120
He says it's from Chilton.

879
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,120
He says Chilton threatened him next.

880
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,800
We gotta get there immediately,

881
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,880
and I think we need all the help we can get.

882
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,760
I worry that we should keep this in-house for the time being.

883
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,920
What if he shows up and does our kind of thing?

884
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,640
But what if he shows up and the cops are already there and he doesn't?

885
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,840
We could save this man's life.

886
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,680
From my experience, that's not exactly what we're hired to do.

887
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,400
We're supposed to keep the unnatural threat from civilian eyes.

888
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,560
Well, she's gonna try to persuade you.

889
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,120
We know this unnatural threat is after his civilian eyes.

890
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,920
They dig out the eyeballs.

891
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,800
You can give me a big disadvantage on that.

892
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,080
That's not a good argument, but it's a funny argument.

893
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,000
How do you combat a persuade?

894
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,520
Humant, or you can role persuade yourself.

895
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,360
They're the same!

896
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,600
Forty.

897
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,160
Fifty.

898
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,560
Fifty!

899
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,240
Big ol' fail.

900
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,040
She fails too.

901
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,840
Who failed higher?

902
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,800
Mine's a ninety-eight.

903
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,920
Oh, Jesus.

904
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,800
Mine's an eighty-two.

905
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,360
That'll do it.

906
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,120
So you're not convinced, but you're...

907
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,600
Play ball.

908
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,120
You don't feel confident enough maybe to say no to her in this situation.

909
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,760
I like that.

910
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,080
There's a pause, and you were looking at each other,

911
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,760
and she can just see you don't buy it.

912
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,320
I have my reasons to believe that he could be important to this case,

913
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,680
and you don't buy that either, but you can tell that she's gonna go try to save him.

914
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,240
Sure.

915
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,520
Elwood does reluctantly call local PD.

916
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah.

917
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,520
You were calling the detective?

918
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,280
I was gonna call the detective, but I was hoping you could call actual dispatch

919
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,240
and just start the process of getting, you know, cop cars.

920
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,720
Sure.

921
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,760
While I'm gonna specifically call some of these, like, people.

922
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,800
The players.

923
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,040
Yeah.

924
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,280
Yeah.

925
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,160
Elwood is doing that on the phone.

926
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,040
He says, hey, it's Agent Boyd,

927
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,680
and we have reason to believe that the landlord Duchesne life is in jeopardy

928
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,240
or something like that.

929
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:32,880
Absolutely.

930
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,120
And when Agent Sparrow calls in to the department and talks to Quinlan,

931
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,520
she can talk to Garza as well either way.

932
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,640
I don't talk to Garza.

933
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,000
Oh, you don't like Uncle Jimmy?

934
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,600
I do not care for Agent Garza.

935
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,240
Yeah.

936
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,680
Quinlan will tell you that when you tell her what happened,

937
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
she says, let me check the phone records.

938
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,400
They got a ping.

939
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,680
And yeah, they got a ping that Arvin Chilton's phone called Alexander Duchesne's phone.

940
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,400
Cool.

941
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,960
Detective Quinlan, I need you to gather anyone you have here with you from Newark,

942
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,200
any of your associates.

943
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,640
We haven't met Gambeson yet.

944
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,920
Please get them involved.

945
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,760
You can tell Agent Garza or not.

946
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,440
Gambeson is out still.

947
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,240
He must have taken a long lunch or got caught up doing something,

948
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,920
but he'll be back later.

949
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,400
Can they see where that phone call was from?

950
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,120
Gia, look at it.

951
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:19,840
Ping it?

952
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,340
Yeah.

953
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,240
Put it in a triangle.

954
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,720
It was in Ocean City, we can say.

955
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,320
You said put it in a triangle.

956
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,680
You mean triangulated, yeah.

957
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,080
Have they been able to triangulate the signal?

958
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,120
Like on Netflix.

959
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,480
Put it in a triangle is a pretty good way to describe it.

960
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,640
Put it in a triangle.

961
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,880
The call's coming from inside the town.

962
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,160
We've got to hurry.

963
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,040
When you arrive in our jaguar.

964
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,160
And you're fucked up.

965
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,640
What?

966
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,920
Our jaguar.

967
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,880
In our jaguar.

968
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,080
What is that?

969
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,320
Solve Delta Green and kill scary monsters.

970
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,280
And get there in the back of our jaguar.

971
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:06,640
Cool.

972
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,760
You guys all know the thing.

973
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,400
Dragula?

974
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,160
You would know.

975
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,720
I think you would know.

976
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,080
You don't know that song?

977
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:18,400
Burn through the riches and burn with the riches and burn in the back of my dragula.

978
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,640
No, it was fun though.

979
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,360
I like it.

980
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:21,760
Wow.

981
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,880
We'll play it for you later.

982
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,200
Okay.

983
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,760
It's like one of the opening parts of the matrix.

984
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,440
They're all dancing in a club to that song.

985
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,320
Oh, for real?

986
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,640
Really?

987
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,480
I haven't seen the matrix in a long ass time.

988
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,120
Yep.

989
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,120
That's such a, that's so bizarre.

990
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,120
I kind of, I mean like that's, I could see like a goth dance club.

991
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,000
That's kind of what it is.

992
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,800
Like the late nineties.

993
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,520
It's like industrial enough that that song can hit the masses.

994
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,440
Oh, it's where he goes down the rabbit hole.

995
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:45,680
Yeah.

996
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,640
Follows the white rat.

997
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,920
Yeah, he follows the rabbit.

998
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,400
Gotcha.

999
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,560
We arrive there in our jaguar.

1000
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,280
That's right.

1001
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,720
And there are four squad cars already on the scene.

1002
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:00,640
There are some police officers in uniform standing around their cars, just kind of like

1003
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,840
talking to each other.

1004
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,120
You see that the door is open and there are a couple officers already speaking to Mr.

1005
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:12,480
Duchesne who waves his hands at the three of you when he sees you arrive.

1006
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,800
Kevin waves back at him in Kevin's mind.

1007
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,680
He's like trying to put on the FBI character and he gets out of the car and goes up.

1008
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,360
So what's going on boys?

1009
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,200
Oh, you're a big fella, aren't you?

1010
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,440
Hey.

1011
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,320
Uh-huh.

1012
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,400
Big guy.

1013
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,120
Uh-huh.

1014
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,960
Big guy in the FBI.

1015
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,200
The look on Kevin's face goes to a little bit of confusion and almost like, are they

1016
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,000
making fun of me?

1017
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,840
Yeah, for sure we are.

1018
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,560
What?

1019
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,080
I'm an FBI.

1020
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,280
Are you walking into the house?

1021
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,640
Yeah, she doesn't see this because she is like beelining for the door.

1022
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,400
I think Elwood would be kind of shuffling behind her and when he gets toward Kevin,

1023
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,160
he just kind of pulls him along with him.

1024
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah, Kevin like picks up the front of one of the cruisers and kind of shoves it.

1025
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,200
Yeah, just like and like gives them a dirty look.

1026
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:03,760
Oh my God.

1027
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,920
They're both like freaking out and you walk away.

1028
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,760
But when you turn back and look, one of them's on the other one's shoulders and they're

1029
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,520
like, where'd that guy?

1030
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,760
Oh man.

1031
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:15,680
Wow.

1032
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,200
Hey Kev.

1033
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,080
These Kev.

1034
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,800
These cops are bastards for sure.

1035
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:24,960
All right.

1036
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,640
And so you guys go...

1037
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,360
What about, you know, humble public servants like John Lee Pettymore?

1038
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,640
Who never did a thing wrong in his life.

1039
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,720
Never did a thing wrong.

1040
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,120
Diligent public employees like Keith Vigna.

1041
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,520
You can go honestly wave off these officers who are currently talking to Duchenne because

1042
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,480
he clearly wants to talk to you as opposed to them.

1043
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,160
I need to speak with Mr. Duchenne alone for a moment, but can you brief me on what you

1044
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,160
found here in the time you've been on the scene?

1045
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,400
He leans in real close.

1046
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:00,560
I've been holding my nose the whole time without holding it with my hand because he

1047
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,160
spells really bad.

1048
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,280
Like this apartment spells horrible and so does he.

1049
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,160
Did you determine anything about the nature of the threat?

1050
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,840
Oh, I listened to the voicemail.

1051
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,880
Do you want to hear it?

1052
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,600
Yes, please.

1053
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,880
Okay, so he'll pull up Duchenne's phone and plays you a voicemail and you just hear...

1054
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,000
Clearly in the voice of Arvin Chilton.

1055
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,120
We just established it.

1056
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,600
Arvin Chilton and I'm possessed by dark mysteries.

1057
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,080
I love Shakespeare.

1058
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,480
Yeah, that's a really unsettling voicemail to hear.

1059
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,440
I'm not changing it.

1060
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,480
That is the voicemail.

1061
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,160
Oh wow, I'm gonna kill you.

1062
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,240
So chipper and casual about that threat.

1063
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,160
I would be alarmed too, Mr. Duchenne.

1064
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:06,660
I just...

1065
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,200
He wouldn't do it, I don't think, but that's him.

1066
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,120
That's his voice.

1067
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,040
That's his voice and they sang it.

1068
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,080
It sounds like, yeah, he said point blank that he was going to do it.

1069
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,440
I think he's gonna do it.

1070
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,560
Did you make him mad?

1071
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,200
I didn't do anything.

1072
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,000
But what did you...

1073
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,520
You gotta do something.

1074
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,240
I didn't.

1075
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,120
Were you maybe supposed to get his book back to him a little sooner than you did?

1076
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,360
Yes, maybe.

1077
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,360
I don't know.

1078
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,480
I doubt that's likely.

1079
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,480
You said he was giving it to you one to two days before he disappeared?

1080
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,040
That's right.

1081
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,920
That would be a very short amount of time to expect a book back.

1082
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,000
Also, I don't think it's worth murder.

1083
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,220
Do you?

1084
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,600
As a criminal profiler, I have to tell you that

1085
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,800
what murderers consider worth murder is not what you and I would expect.

1086
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,920
Damn dude, that's intense, Agent Sparrow.

1087
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,760
Your life is in danger, but these officers are going to be here with you all night.

1088
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,240
How come you let it go for your voicemail?

1089
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,840
I couldn't hear my phone.

1090
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,560
It was on vibrate and I couldn't hear it.

1091
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,720
So for the first time, Agent Sparrow is gonna call Agent Garza.

1092
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,120
Okay.

1093
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,280
And basically she's just gonna relay that if you can coordinate with the local cops

1094
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,520
to give him round-the-clock protection for at least the next few days while we're in town.

1095
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,800
Okay, sounds good.

1096
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,400
Did you try calling him back?

1097
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,120
Well, you...

1098
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,000
Hey, big guy.

1099
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,520
Well, you stay with me.

1100
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,120
These guys, they got guns.

1101
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,240
They got whatever.

1102
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,200
They're cops, you know.

1103
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,480
They have guns, but you, you're a big guy.

1104
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,480
I think you could definitely protect me.

1105
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,680
Kevin looks at Elwood.

1106
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,600
Elwood kind of steps between them.

1107
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,800
No, he's mine.

1108
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,240
I know what he says.

1109
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,880
Agent Sparrow's on the phone, but that gets an eyebrow raise from her.

1110
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,380
Uh-huh.

1111
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,760
Okay, well, could both of you stay?

1112
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,600
You could both stay upstairs or you could stay in here anywhere, please.

1113
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,440
I just feel so scared.

1114
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,720
What time is it?

1115
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,000
It's getting later now.

1116
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,240
It's probably five, five thirty.

1117
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,000
I think internally Elwood also would think, but it's not the worst idea.

1118
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,720
It'd be like staking out the place all night.

1119
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,600
Yeah, so she does.

1120
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,880
She pulls you aside.

1121
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,280
She's like, yeah, that was, that was my thinking as well.

1122
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,800
And we've seen what whatever's out there can do to people.

1123
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,160
It wouldn't be such a bad idea to have the big fella around.

1124
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,000
Now, let's let him get some sleep, the big fella.

1125
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,040
You take first watch.

1126
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,760
I'm going to start reading as you like it.

1127
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,760
Actually, I mean, I guess the cops are keeping watch.

1128
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,600
We've still got the uniform police here.

1129
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,520
Why don't we encourage Kevin to take a little nap, sleep off those burgers.

1130
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,080
I've got his copy of as you like it.

1131
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,640
I've just sent you a link to a free digital open source copy of as you like it.

1132
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,720
Why don't you read along and we can see if we can.

1133
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:54,160
You seem intelligent, even though you are very shifty and quite mean to your friend.

1134
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,440
I'll read it again if you think I need to, but I have read it.

1135
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,000
It's, it's a thrilling tale.

1136
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,360
Since you're already so familiar with the text, I would just, I'd love it.

1137
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:08,160
If you read it again with me and I will be looking for maybe some overarching themes,

1138
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,640
but perhaps with your familiarity with the text, you could pick out some details that

1139
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,640
that might might've missed that might be relevant.

1140
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,600
As they're having this conversation, I'm over with Chilton still.

1141
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,520
You're with Chilton?

1142
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:20,880
He's here.

1143
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,080
He's here.

1144
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,200
I am with Duchenne.

1145
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:27,600
We did it.

1146
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,880
The Eastern Seaboard is safe.

1147
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,160
Uh, I'm as they're talking, as they're talking, I'm over with Duchenne.

1148
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,560
Yeah.

1149
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,880
Did you call him back and ask him why?

1150
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,480
No, I, as soon as I heard it, I, I call, he points at agent Sparrow.

1151
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,880
He's like, I called agent Sparrow.

1152
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,560
Call him back and see where he is and ask him why.

1153
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,840
Agent Sparrow looks at you with like genuine shock on our eyes.

1154
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,800
Yeah, that is a pretty good, yeah.

1155
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,560
We'd like to, everybody, everybody quiet down.

1156
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,440
Everybody quiet down.

1157
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,480
Mr. Duchenne, please, please redial that number.

1158
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,240
His finger shakes.

1159
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,320
Zach's rolling to see if his finger falls off.

1160
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,720
Wobbling as it goes to punch in the number.

1161
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,840
It's a rotary of Arvin Chilton.

1162
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,600
He's going to roll for each number dial because he might miss click at any moment.

1163
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,100
Yep.

1164
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,240
First number is good.

1165
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,920
Second number.

1166
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,120
Oh, got it wrong.

1167
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:40,080
Until Zach rolls heads seven times in a row, he's going to be getting one number wrong.

1168
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,600
And we just got to sit here and play that out because sometimes that's what we're playing.

1169
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,360
Let me try again.

1170
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,640
Please.

1171
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:56,400
And he finally just goes to calls recent and then clicks on the name Arvin Chilton.

1172
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:04,160
And agent Sparrow, Kevin Gelato, Elwood Boyd, as well as these two police officers

1173
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,600
and Alexander Duchenne all here.

1174
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,480
Coming from the upstairs apartment.

1175
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,600
Oh, it's coming from the who's.

1176
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,800
Oh no.

1177
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:43,040
Kevin looks at Elwood and looks at Clarissa and is like, not sure why they have these

1178
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,720
expressions on their face, but he matches their expression quickly.

1179
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:07,520
And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind, I'll be all

1180
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,320
right.

1181
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:14,400
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

1182
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,480
I'll be all right.

1183
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,760
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

1184
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:45,760
Doesn't it always seem like the parts that made us laugh now make us cry.

1185
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:54,160
Doesn't it always seem like the villain pulling the strings is a regular guy.

1186
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,440
You and me have gone bad in a good way.

1187
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,640
I promise.

1188
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:08,800
Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.

1189
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,360
I'll be all right.

1190
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:18,880
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

1191
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,520
I'll be all right.

1192
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:36,880
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

1193
00:57:51,520 --> 00:58:06,880
There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.

1194
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:14,880
Whitewashed hymns in the deadliest sins push me to my limit.

1195
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:24,240
When you deconstruct, you're shit out of luck for a minute.

1196
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:30,240
After the last spin, you can break it all down to rebuild it.

1197
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:52,880
You and me have gone bad in a good way.

1198
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,880
I promise.

1199
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,880
You and me have gone bad in a good way.

1200
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,880
I promise.

1201
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,880
I'll be all right.

1202
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,880
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

1203
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
I'll be all right.

1204
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:22,880
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
