1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Bless this mess, my babies.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,380
Damn, y'all are stinky.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,560
Uh-oh.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,240
It's your scent-spraying stepdad, Wolf the dog.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,240
And I'm here stinking up the joint live from 694.2 PTBP,

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,800
the only radio station that offered

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,920
smell-o-listen for a time.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,800
But we had to stop.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,520
People died, man.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,240
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,760
is from at Sergeant Boondock on Twitter.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,760
He tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,160
which really puts the hell yeah in hell yeah, dude.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,480
Mr. Sergeant Boondock would like me

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,480
to dedicate a big old smooch to Mrs. Sergeant Boondock.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,200
Well, I guess I can cook up a little romance.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,380
Prepare for a smooch.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,300
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,760
Mwah.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,660
Sorry, I don't know what came over me,

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,640
Sergeant Boondock on Twitter.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,940
I was overcome with a strong passion.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,900
I haven't given an auditory smooch in many a millennia,

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,960
according to my smooch calendar.

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,480
If you wanna make a saucy request of your stinky wolf,

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,140
tag the show at pretending pod on the internet.

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,660
And if you're interested in trading $6.66

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,780
As always, the links are all up in the show notes

31
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,280
and I am all up in the news.

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,100
Last time, the little twins recognized

33
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,860
and stared down Clark Bishop from a horrifying vessel

34
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,860
floating across the shimmering steel sea,

35
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,580
aboard this defaced bay boat,

36
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,660
the rabid ball holding Julie Maxwell's corpse

37
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,900
ripped at the bridge connecting the two stilted bunkers.

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Keith, Don, and Jack leapt for the railing

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,020
of the little balcony outside

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,180
the second bunker's hatch door,

41
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,220
but Keith couldn't hold on.

42
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,540
He fell into the molten ocean

43
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,000
and became engulfed in the sea made of solder.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,760
But Don D. Pettymore chanted some sort

45
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,720
of cancellation incantation

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,280
and each action by person, object, or ball

47
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,880
played out perfectly in reverse.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,800
As the rope bridge came crashing down a second time,

49
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,520
Keith leapt for the railing of the little balcony

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,440
outside the second bunker's hatch door.

51
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,540
But this time, with a little hindsight,

52
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,160
to everyone's delight, he held on with all his might.

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,800
So make like a beans and Keith holding on tight.

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,300
It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In.

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,300
["What Kind of World Are You Living In"]

56
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,300
["What Kind of World Are You Living In"]

57
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,300
How many apples can you fit in your butt, Thomas?

58
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,300
I don't have numbers like you and Luke.

59
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,300
So, Taylor and I started saying ditto a lot.

60
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,300
I don't know who started it, but then we were, like, kind of playing with the word

61
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,300
and saying different iterations.

62
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,300
So, there for a minute it was just, like, ditty, ditty, dits.

63
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,300
And now, if we agree with each other, we just go, big dits.

64
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Big dits.

65
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
Big dits.

66
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,300
But then...

67
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,300
Big ol' ditties.

68
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,300
Big ol' ditties.

69
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,300
So then I said, big ol' ditties, and she was like, no. Too far.

70
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Yeah, that's why I'm really the one for you.

71
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
Yeah, dude. Diddy Kong.

72
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300
And Luke's our sub, who we call Diddy Kong.

73
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
I want bananas.

74
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
Cause they're your peanuts.

75
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Oh, Diddy.

76
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
Diddy Dong.

77
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Diddy Dong.

78
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Well, this is really funny, but we probably can't use that.

79
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Diddy Dong.

80
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Why?

81
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,300
I don't know, can we say that we're gonna have a three-way sub-relationship

82
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,300
with Luke where he sucks our penises and calls them bananas cause he's Diddy Dong?

83
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,300
I think we can, and I think you summed it up pretty well.

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Yeah, that's what I thought we were doing.

85
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
Okay, well, if that's not, you know, insensitive...

86
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
To Luke?

87
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,300
To Nintendo fans.

88
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
To N-

89
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
Yeah, to Nintendo fans.

90
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Sorry, everybody.

91
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,300
I just don't want to cross the line of joking into, like, fetishization or even, like, otherization.

92
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Right. Well, then the listeners can know that you feel that way.

93
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
God damn it.

94
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,300
And I'll keep calling Luke Diddy Dong for the whole episode.

95
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Oh, God.

96
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
I rolled a 48.

97
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Diddy Dong!

98
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Oh, fuck yeah.

99
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,300
You did this, Thomas. You forced my hand. Now it's all in.

100
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,300
You can take the part out where I'm a little bitch about it.

101
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,300
But that's our new intro, like, thing, is that we say fucked up stuff until Thomas goes,

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,300
I don't think we can put this in there, and then we start the episode.

103
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,300
I'll cut you saying the word bitch, though, you sexist fuck.

104
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Keith Vidner grabs onto the railing.

105
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,300
You gendered, slur-using son of a bitch.

106
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,300
All right, so Keith grabs onto the railing.

107
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Zach, are you okay?

108
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Keith grabs onto the railing.

109
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:47,300
And this time, all the sweat got wiped off my hands the last time I grabbed it,

110
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,300
and somehow the reverse, you know, didn't put the sweat back on my hands,

111
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,300
so I go slightly to the left of where I jumped last time to avoid the puddle of sweat,

112
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
and I grab on with all my strength.

113
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,300
In the distance, you just hear what sounds like a door hitting the inside of a metal wall.

114
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Don't.

115
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Echoes.

116
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,300
I hear, but I don't even have time to think about it.

117
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Can I try to pull myself up this round or, I guess, probably not?

118
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
You guessed right. Clark, it's your turn.

119
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,300
I mean, there's nothing to do.

120
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Clark and Jon both brush their hands and say, mission accomplished.

121
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,300
It looks like Keith made it this time.

122
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,300
This time, I'm saying this time because we went back in time.

123
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Did that happen to you, Jon?

124
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,300
Yeah, it felt like we did a little rewind, a little Prince of Persia there.

125
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,300
Or do we have any recollection of that handler?

126
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,300
You absolutely remember it, and you absolutely need to roll a sanity.

127
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Oh, hell yeah, I fail.

128
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
I fail too, but not over my power.

129
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Oh, I failed over my power.

130
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,300
I critically failed and over my power.

131
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
It's a 66.

132
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Oh, wow. Well, now I'm not locked in here with you.

133
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
I'm locked in here with you.

134
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Fool me twice.

135
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
You can't fool me again.

136
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
You ain't going to Rorschach me again.

137
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,300
All right, so with that, you all lose one sanity.

138
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,300
This was a zero slash one, so Clark, you still only lose one.

139
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,300
We're in a room of junk, and I'm frustrated.

140
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
I would just start chucking things against walls.

141
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
I just threw a door. You saw me do that.

142
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
I'm going to just keep on chucking shit.

143
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Where the fuck are we? Get out of here.

144
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
God damn it.

145
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,300
And as you're chucking junk across the room,

146
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,300
you pick up the golf club you found earlier,

147
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,300
and you fling it, and as it leaves your hands,

148
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
you think you're throwing it at the wall,

149
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,300
but it just kind of flips out of control.

150
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Putter head over handle flies toward Leo piston,

151
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:31,300
and the putter part just sinks directly into the bullet hole in him,

152
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,300
and he's just like, yay!

153
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,300
No, Clark! Clark!

154
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,300
And he leans back over, and you're still,

155
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
I mean, you're just not even paying attention.

156
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,300
You're just throwing shit. Don V. Pettymore, you're up.

157
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
I'm assuming I also went back,

158
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,300
so I need to re-grab onto the thing.

159
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Yeah. Okay.

160
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
My ding-dang dexterity.

161
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
Oh, I didn't even think about what if we save Keith,

162
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,300
and then lose both Don and Jack.

163
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Two for one deal.

164
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,300
I'm willing to take that risk.

165
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,300
36 on a 55 for my dexterity.

166
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
Nice. Yep.

167
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Don grabs some steady footing

168
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,300
as this rope bridge is crumbling beneath him,

169
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,300
and he, not crumbling, just moving, just falling.

170
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
I feel like Don D. in this moment would be like,

171
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,300
oh, shit, knowing that he has to complete that jump again.

172
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
He's like, oh, son of a bitch.

173
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
It went back further than you expected.

174
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Yeah, I thought I was just going to be hanging out,

175
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
and I'm like, oh, fuck.

176
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
But you oh, fuck your way right across

177
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,300
and grab onto the railing that is right outside the hatch

178
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:50,300
on this stilted room above the shiny, shimmering silver sea.

179
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
John, it's your turn.

180
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
Keith, Don, are you okay?

181
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I am now.

182
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,300
About melted in half, it felt horrible.

183
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Yeah, I saw. That looked very unpleasant.

184
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,300
It's okay. I have no residual pain from it,

185
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
no lasting effects at all,

186
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
and my hands aren't sweaty anymore.

187
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
You didn't feel it mature you at all,

188
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
like you passed through a crucible,

189
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,300
came out maybe a little mentally tougher, older?

190
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,300
I don't know. I'd say maybe I have lost enough sanity

191
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,300
and rolled over my power and am at a breaking point,

192
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
past my breaking point.

193
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,300
Oh, hell, that's one hell of a way to put it.

194
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,300
I think Clark's at that point, too.

195
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,300
And you see a folding table fly over John's shoulder

196
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
and crash into the sea.

197
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Well, I guess we'll probably explore that with you

198
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
pretty soon here.

199
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,300
I'm going to go check on Clark.

200
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,300
Can I calm him down at all with persuade or...

201
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Yeah, if you have psychotherapy,

202
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
that is what it is meant for,

203
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
so if you need to roll persuade,

204
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
then you'd take a negative 20.

205
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Okay, I'll try a negative 20 on my persuade,

206
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
which is a 60.

207
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Fuck.

208
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
59, that would have been excellent.

209
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
So very ineffectively...

210
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,300
Clark, I know we've seen a lot of fucked-up shit,

211
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
and now your whole chronology...

212
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Yeah, he's got a little folding chair

213
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
that he's using as a shield,

214
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,300
and he's deflecting some incoming shots.

215
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Please!

216
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
I don't like shots.

217
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Please!

218
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
But, like, basically, just don't, like...

219
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,300
I guess just don't worry about it,

220
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
and your life will always be like this now,

221
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,300
so why even, you know, don't stress out?

222
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,300
Jack Russell is running and making a jump.

223
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Fails.

224
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
Oh, no!

225
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Bye-bye, Jackie.

226
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
He grabs...

227
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,300
You can't take Jack from me!

228
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
He grabs Keith by the legs

229
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,300
and takes him down with him.

230
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Takes his huge pants down.

231
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,300
But the shorts make for a huge parachute,

232
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,300
and he's floating up and away.

233
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
And then he's gone.

234
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,300
The twinkle star in the sky,

235
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,300
he just disappears like Team Rocket.

236
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Okay, so Jack Russell is going to begin falling,

237
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
and as he makes the jump for it,

238
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
he hits his head.

239
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
He, like, grabs on to the railing,

240
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,300
but then his head kind of slams into the room,

241
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
and he immediately just lets go,

242
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
and he starts falling,

243
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
and he's falling on his back,

244
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
and he's kind of, like, rotating backwards,

245
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,300
so you think his neck is probably gonna land first.

246
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
It's the ball's turn.

247
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,300
It shrieked.

248
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,300
The moment that it reversed all of its actions

249
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,300
back to where it was in time...

250
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
All of that got noise.

251
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Yeah, all of that got blocked by Discord.

252
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,300
It was like, there must be a wild animal in Zach's apartment.

253
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Aiden and Alice Little are looking at their hands

254
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,300
where they just held lollipops,

255
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
but then, for some reason,

256
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,300
we're forced to put the lollipops back into their overalls.

257
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Jon standing at the open door is just, like, pointing at Don,

258
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,300
like, he did it, he did that to you.

259
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
I just didn't want them to put a missing, like,

260
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
taking our candy away from them

261
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
on top of everything else that had happened.

262
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Holy shit.

263
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Okay.

264
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Ooh, 69.

265
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Uh-oh.

266
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Jack Russell does not hit the ocean, so that's good.

267
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
However, the reason he doesn't hit the ocean

268
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
is because one long metal tendril

269
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,300
flies out towards him and skewers his neck

270
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,300
right in between his head and his shoulders.

271
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,300
It goes all the way through,

272
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,300
about five yards past him as well,

273
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,300
and so as the long, long metal limb

274
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,300
is just horizontal above, parallel with the ocean,

275
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,300
the body of Jack Russell is, like, hanging from it

276
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
like a foosball player,

277
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,300
but the stake is going through his neck.

278
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Because of his, like, rotation as he was falling,

279
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
he is like a foosball player,

280
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,300
kind of spinning around by his neck.

281
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,300
The metal tendril rips backwards

282
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,300
and brings the body of Jack Russell with it,

283
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,300
and so now two of its tendrils are holding up bodies,

284
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,300
one being Julie Maxwell, the other Jack Russell,

285
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,300
as two of the other tendrils are in the melting,

286
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,300
shimmering silver sea.

287
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,300
They've kind of climbed out to find purchase

288
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,300
within the waters, made of the same texture

289
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,300
but in a different state than itself.

290
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Keith, it is your turn.

291
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
Keith is pulling himself up to get up

292
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
and get on, like, level ground,

293
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
and as he's saying it, he looks over at Don

294
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,300
and is like, thanks, don't use that on him.

295
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,300
And with a 12, I pull myself up.

296
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,300
I think Don gives, like, a menacing glare back to him,

297
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
but doesn't say anything.

298
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,300
You pull yourself up and can stand on this balcony

299
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,300
that is outside of this stilted room

300
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
with the hatch door right next to you.

301
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Yeah, as soon as I actually get up on there,

302
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
I think about what just happened to me,

303
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,300
and it's not computing.

304
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
With that, I need Joe, Thomas, and Justin

305
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
to take off their headphones.

306
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
Ooh.

307
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Luke, Luke, Luke?

308
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,300
Yeah, I'm a crazy guy.

309
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
You fuck so good, though.

310
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Did he, Don?

311
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
I'm on top of it.

312
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
I need you to...

313
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
You hit a breaking point, you said?

314
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Yeah, over my power, loss of sanity, breaking point.

315
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
All the...

316
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
All right.

317
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Hitting them all.

318
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
All the things.

319
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
So I need you to roll three times.

320
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,300
A D100, right?

321
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Yes, please.

322
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
A 61.

323
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
A 3.

324
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
And 80.

325
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,300
61 is kleptomania,

326
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
irrational compulsion for stealing.

327
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Okay.

328
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
3 is acluomania,

329
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,300
an excessive liking for darkness.

330
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,300
Okay.

331
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,300
And 80 is phasmomania,

332
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,300
an obsession with ghosts.

333
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,300
I'm gonna say because of where I am

334
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,300
when this happened,

335
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,300
and it's, you know, dark and gooey

336
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300
and all the colors and also other stuff, right?

337
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Yep.

338
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
The second one, compulsion for the dark.

339
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Yeah, okay.

340
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,300
So you are going to have acluo, acluo, acluo.

341
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Acluomania.

342
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,300
An excessive liking for darkness.

343
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,300
I like it.

344
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,300
And then you are now extremely paranoid.

345
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,300
I know what this is gonna manifest as.

346
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,300
All right, let's get him back.

347
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy.

348
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
I feel birded.

349
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird, oran.

350
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,300
You know that one, classic one.

351
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,300
My favorite bird too.

352
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Yeah, I kind of like look off in the distance for a second,

353
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
and then I look at Don.

354
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Yeah, he's hanging there off the railing,

355
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,300
I walk over to where he is and I start stepping on one of his fingers.

356
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Oh, shit.

357
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Okay, roll against each other.

358
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Oh, I hope I lose.

359
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,300
What am I rolling, strength or?

360
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
You can either like try to hold on tight,

361
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,300
or you can try to like move your hands away from where he's stepping.

362
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
What am I rolling?

363
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
What am I rolling?

364
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
This is a very important number.

365
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,300
I guess unarmed combat, I guess is technically what it is.

366
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,300
I crit, succeed.

367
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
No.

368
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Jesus Christ.

369
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Can I just like tough it out, or is that like not really an option?

370
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Should I try and move?

371
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

372
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,300
So you could roll like constitution to tough it out, yeah.

373
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
That's what I think I'd do because I don't want to move.

374
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,300
Wait, wait, I lied, I lied.

375
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
I was looking at the wrong sheet.

376
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Did you crit fail?

377
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,300
I only have a 40, so I crit fail.

378
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Oh.

379
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
I was looking at Clark's.

380
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Should I still roll?

381
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Whoa, sneaky.

382
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

383
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,300
What if I crit fail worse?

384
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,300
I didn't, I got a 35 on a 60.

385
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,300
You're like, you go to step, you go to step on Don's fingers,

386
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,300
and a critical fail, huh?

387
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Throw him back into the sea.

388
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,300
I know, right?

389
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Yeah, he just slips and falls over the railing.

390
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Undo everything.

391
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:46,300
And Don won't save him that time because he tried to step on his fucking fingers.

392
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,300
I don't have to die.

393
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,300
I don't think it's that.

394
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:58,300
My parachute pants open up and it slows me down so much that I can't even touch his fingers with my foot.

395
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Oh my God.

396
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
There's an updraft in here.

397
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
What's updraft?

398
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Nice.

399
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Nice.

400
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,300
I slip on the puddle of sweat that's like dripped off of me.

401
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,300
Yeah, you slip on the sweat from your wet hands.

402
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Oh, Keith Vigna, old wet hands.

403
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
What'd you do to my ankle?

404
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
I scream at Don.

405
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
That's right.

406
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
That's perfect.

407
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Yes.

408
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
You like getting his face too.

409
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Well, I'm on the ground, so I'm like face to face with him.

410
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Screaming right in his face.

411
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
What'd you do to my ankle?

412
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,300
And I'm like grabbing my ankle and I'm like angry and very scared.

413
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Clark, your turn.

414
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Am I snapped out of it?

415
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Yeah.

416
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:54,300
He starts to get his wits about him and he stops throwing things with his much vigor

417
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,300
and then slowly stops throwing things at all.

418
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Oh, God.

419
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Leo, I'm so sorry.

420
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Oh, fuck.

421
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Leo, I didn't mean it.

422
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
You were caught in the crossfire.

423
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm sorry.

424
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
I didn't mean to do that.

425
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
It just happens sometimes.

426
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:14,300
And I try and help him get the putter out of the bullet hole.

428
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Shit.

429
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
I'm sorry, Leo.

431
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
I didn't mean to do that.

432
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Leo, you have to admit it was one hell of a throw.

433
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
That was one in a million.

434
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Got you right in the hole, did I?

435
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Dang it.

436
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Dang it.

437
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Dang my perfect throwing arm.

438
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,300
This hole is so big now you can fit like two apples in here.

439
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Hole or sliced up?

440
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,300
Two.

441
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
Okay, rookie numbers.

442
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
John, we got to get out of here.

443
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
It's driving us mad.

444
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
We can't be staying here.

445
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,300
We got to – that ball's out there.

446
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,300
We got to – what are we going to do?

447
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
That's my turn.

448
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,300
Don, you're up.

449
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,300
Does Don know that he was about to get stepped on or did he just see –

450
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
I guess not.

451
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,300
– Vigna take one step and then tweak his ankle and fall over and start yelling at me?

452
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,300
And then he panic screams at you.

453
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
You guys are like face to face.

454
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,300
I'm going to pull myself up and I'm like, what happened to you, boy?

455
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
I shrink away from him in total fear.

456
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,300
I want to slap him in the face to like snap him back into reality.

457
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,300
That seems like Don.

458
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Can I roll to resist getting slapped?

459
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,300
No, I think that with how panicked and freaked out Keith is, he's just going to take it.

460
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
I do a backhand too.

461
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
Front and back or just backhand?

462
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Oh, both would be good though.

463
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Let's say both.

464
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Thanks for the recommendation, Luke.

465
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Yeah, yeah, anything.

466
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Yeah, I like pull up the shirt collar since he's on the ground and like holding his head in front of me just like whack, whack.

467
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
It's a big coral polo.

468
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,300
It's actually a little too tight on me so it pulls me right to him.

469
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Not anymore. Not after this.

470
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Yeah.

471
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,300
It's going to be a huge awkward neckline just hanging down.

472
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
Oh, God.

473
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
So unfortunate.

474
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Snap out of it, boy.

475
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Jon, your turn.

476
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Jon hears the trademark shrieking whimper of someone who's just been slapped.

477
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Snapped out of it?

478
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Yeah, by a petty more uncle.

479
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:44,300
He takes inspiration and slaps Clark who has just screamed, what are we going to do?

480
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:51,300
And Jon smacks him twice across the face, grabs him by the shoulders and says, I don't know.

481
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,300
What kind of sound does Clark make?

482
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Don D. Pettymore hears the echo of slaps happening.

483
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,300
A tear runs down his eye.

484
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Ouchie, ouchie.

485
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Oh, my God.

486
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,300
That boy might be a ball.

487
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,300
But he's a petty ball.

488
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
A petty ball.

489
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
Jon Lee petty ball.

490
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Holy shit.

491
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Ouchie, ouchie.

492
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Ouchie, ouchie.

493
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,300
It's Jack Russell's turn and he's dead.

494
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
That's one less thing on your plate, Zach.

495
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
I didn't get to say two to a canoe.

496
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:48,300
I thought you were going to say as he got pulled away and he was dying, he'd be like, two to a canoe.

497
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
Two to a canoe, bro.

498
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,300
Oh, well, now's a good time for that.

499
00:25:52,300 --> 00:26:03,300
So, yeah, he's still hanging there and his vocal cords are pushing against the metal tendril that's going through his neck sideways.

500
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:13,300
And so as he's talking, it reverberates through the metallic arm of this ball and it's like, two to a canoe.

501
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
Truly horrible.

502
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,300
Jon's just like, I don't get that reference personally.

503
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,300
None of us did, boy.

504
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
And then it's the ball's turn.

505
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Just make him be nice. Just make him do a nice thing for us.

506
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
Yeah.

507
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Yeah.

508
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
Yeah, Zach, you ever think of that?

509
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,300
Yeah, Zach.

510
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,300
The ball is coming for...

511
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
It's definitely Don. It's coming for Don.

512
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:57,300
He's the only one who's like, out of one of the rooms and he's standing above Keith, so Keith wouldn't be a target.

513
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:06,300
So the biggest target is Don D. Pettymore and this thing is flinging a metal tendril at you. What do you do?

514
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Is the hatch near me the door to get into?

515
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Yeah, in fact, you're in kind of a spot where you could slam open the door and use it as a shield.

516
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:26,300
I imagine it like if we were standing in the middle of the rope bridge, if the rope bridge was still attached to this second stilted bunker

517
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:35,300
and we were staring at the hatch, you would be with Keith holding him just to the left of this hatch

518
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:46,300
and you'd have to reach across this hatch door in order to pull it open, putting the door in between you and the metal tendril flinging toward you

519
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:53,300
but also putting the entrance to this bunker on the other side of the hatch from where you were standing.

520
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Yeah, I think I'd try and get some kind of cover, basically.

521
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,300
If you slam the door open, it'll be between you and the arm.

522
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Yeah.

523
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Okay, so go ahead and roll either athletics, dexterity, strength maybe, I guess, or dodge doors.

524
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,300
If I got a good dodge, we'll see. Nope, dexterity it is.

525
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Wait, hold on. Oh, 47 on a 55. I've never rolled this well in my entire fucking life.

526
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
What's going on there? What was that?

527
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
It was gross.

528
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
He's making kissy faces.

529
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
That's weird.

530
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
He made a kissy face, then he made a...

531
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
There's a ghost, a sexy ghost in his house.

532
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,300
Kind of linguist's face.

533
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,300
What are you guys talking about?

534
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Taylor brought me food.

535
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Oh.

536
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
Is it Taco Bell?

537
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
No, it's Subway, actually. I'm very confused.

538
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
Wow.

539
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,300
You gotta eat fresh.

540
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Mm-hmm. Blimpies eat fresh.

541
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,300
It's called Blimpie. There's no S on the end.

542
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,300
It's not all B's.

543
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,300
Wait, really?

544
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
They rebooted it with a Z.

545
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
I didn't know that about Blimpie.

546
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
It's called Arby.

547
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:04,300
It's just one of my mini pet peeves. Specifically Blimpies. That's the only one that gets me for some reason.

548
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,300
So...

549
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
What about Arby?

550
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,300
That's what Thomas said.

551
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
We're going to Arby.

552
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,300
Yeah, that's what Thomas said.

553
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
Oh, sorry.

554
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
All right.

555
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Back to your roll.

556
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
What about Arby?

557
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Dude!

558
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,300
Dude!

559
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Nice. Good one.

560
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,300
Because that one's plural.

561
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,300
Windy.

562
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,300
Possessive.

563
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,300
It's plural.

564
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
There are two Arby.

565
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
I passed.

566
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
With a 40.

567
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,300
Which is lower.

568
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,300
Which is...

569
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
Wait, is that good or bad?

570
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
I don't know.

571
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
That's good for you.

572
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Yay!

573
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
Wait, what did you roll?

574
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
I rolled a 47.

575
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
Cool.

576
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,300
Hell yeah.

577
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,300
So you slam open this hatch door.

578
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,300
You just rip it open and it's blocking you and Keith.

579
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
You can't see the boat at all anymore.

580
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,300
You can't see this metal tendril coming toward you.

581
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:17,300
And then all of a sudden, the hatch door, which is made out of the same black, colorful, inky darkness, warps toward you.

582
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,300
Like something is pushing into it from the other side.

583
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:30,300
And it's almost as if a stretched out piece of cotton or a canvas is being pushed by a hand.

584
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,300
But it's this metal tendril trying to push and break through this hatch.

585
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,300
And it cannot.

586
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,300
And it kind of rubbery bounces back.

587
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,300
You can't see anything, but you seem to be safe.

588
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
You feel...

589
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
There's not a metal tendril inside of you.

590
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,300
So you did good.

591
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Good job.

592
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Yeah, thanks.

593
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Jon, your turn.

594
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,300
Seeing that, Jon wants to quickly...

595
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
Hey, Jon.

596
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
Sorry.

597
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:13,300
When he flings open the hatch through the doorway, you do not see the inside of a room like the junkyard bunker that you are in.

598
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,300
You see a vast world.

599
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:24,300
The sky is the same inky darkness that is extremely, extremely...

600
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Oh, wait.

601
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,300
No, it's not.

602
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,300
There's no color in it at all.

603
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,300
It's just darkness.

604
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,300
And the ground is made of pure light.

605
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,300
It seems kind of like we got screwed on the bunker lottery, Clark.

606
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Looks like there's a world of pure light over on the other side.

607
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:52,300
That might be nice, instead of this junkyard fucking dying-ass Leo piston.

608
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,300
The cat fucker.

609
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,300
It may not be nice, actually.

610
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,300
I've seen a place like that before.

611
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
The Circle of Knowledge showed me that.

612
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,300
That's where that creature I saw that I'm so frightened of, that's where it lived.

613
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,300
That's where they were trying to keep it.

614
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,300
They were trying to keep it in that place.

615
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
Well, Don just opened a door.

616
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
I don't think that's...

617
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,300
That's probably not good.

618
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,300
I don't think it'd fit through that door, but that's probably not good that that door is open.

619
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
Shit.

620
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,300
I don't know.

621
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,300
Maybe it is best if we just stay here with the cat fucker.

622
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
But we probably should go get Keith.

623
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,300
I guess we gotta take Jack Russell's boat.

624
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
Is that how we get over there?

625
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
How are we gonna...

626
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
What are we gonna...

627
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:40,300
What if I just spent months in here, Bruce Wayne-ing myself in the ways of the ooze and learning how to manipulate it.

628
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:44,300
And then once I'm like a master, then we go outside and rescue everybody.

629
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,300
I forgot that you're doing that kind of thing with the ooze stuff now.

630
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,300
Do you feel like you have control over it in an effective way?

631
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Can we use that to our advantage here?

632
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,300
It really does seem like the rules are stacked in my favor, so to speak.

633
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,300
But in another manner speaking, I don't want to break the game by being super powerful.

634
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,300
And just manipulating literally everything in the world.

635
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,300
This ball is one-shotting people.

636
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:18,300
I think now is the time to use any resource that you have available in order to not die or not let your friends die.

637
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:25,300
You know how when we went out the Marie Jacobs door and then we came around and we were at the same door again, we did like a loop-de-loop somehow?

638
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Yeah.

639
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Can you create a door that does that for us to get over there?

640
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Let me think about that.

641
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:40,300
John walks over to the wall and puts his hands on his hips and kind of considers for a moment.

642
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,300
And he touches the top and he touches the bottom.

643
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,300
And he closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.

644
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
And I roll unnatural.

645
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,300
And he passes with a 37.

646
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
Whoa.

647
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:08,300
Looking through this portal that you've just created, John Lee, Kevin Moore III, and Clark Bishop see a metal tendril pulling back away from this portal.

648
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:17,300
And the view that you're looking through seems to be from the side of the hatch that was just penetrated by this metal tendril.

649
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,300
You're like looking out of that hatch somehow.

650
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,300
So if you walk through, then you'd be on the other side from Don and Keith.

651
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,300
So it's about to come flying through this portal at us?

652
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
It's pulling away right now.

653
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,300
Right. But it's probably going to hit again, right?

654
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
In two turns? Yeah, probably.

655
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,300
One of those is Jack Russell, though, and he's dead.

656
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,300
Oh. Two turns, not two rounds. Okay.

657
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
You don't know that to be true.

658
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Right. Of course not.

659
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,300
You did it, John. You did it.

660
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Yeah, on the wrong side of the door, though, I think.

661
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:58,300
I mean, John, I was just warning you that that thing is in there, but at this point, maybe getting in there, maybe the ball can't get in there?

662
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,300
I mean, any place is better than this if the ball's going to kill us.

663
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
Can I hear this conversation?

664
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,300
You're kind of, yeah.

665
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:13,300
Strangely enough, you're hearing it from the other side of the hatch door.

666
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,300
You can hear Clark and John having this conversation.

667
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Clark? Is that you?

668
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
John? Oh, shit.

669
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,300
And I'm still laying on the ground?

670
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,300
Well, now that gives me an idea.

671
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,300
John closes the portal.

672
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,300
I just realized your turn was opening the portal.

673
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Okay. Oh, no. That's fair.

674
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,300
The ball.

675
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
Crit fail.

676
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,300
So this ball is, like, so freaked out.

677
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:52,300
I mean, this thing is just making these noises, these, like,

678
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:59,300
just like aggressively poking at things, you know, trying to just, like, catch bodies, seemingly trying to collect.

679
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
But it's like out of control.

680
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:09,300
As you open this portal, you see one of these long metal tendrils just flies up through into the portal.

681
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:17,300
It's like trying to, like, get one of you, but it just completely misses as John closes the portal.

682
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:25,300
And this metal tendril just falls in this Leo piston junk bunk yard bunker stilted room.

683
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,300
And it wriggles for, like, half a second.

684
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
And then it just stops.

685
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
You were right, John.

686
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,300
It doesn't, it can't, or, I don't know.

687
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,300
I don't know. I don't know what that means to us.

688
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,300
You injured it. You injured it. That's a good thing.

689
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,300
Yeah.

690
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:59,300
And through the John made hole in this, in the side of this room that's still there, you hear this thing, like,

691
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Keith, it's your turn.

692
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Keith heard Jack Russell kind of, like, yell something as he was being taken away.

693
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,300
And it sounded like a spell to Keith.

694
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,300
And he knew that Don just cast a spell.

695
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,300
So Keith is thinking that he was trying to cast a spell.

696
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
So Keith starts saying,

697
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:34,300
That's so good.

698
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Amazing. Clark, it's your turn.

699
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,300
He wants to kick the metal tendril that is now on the ground.

700
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,300
What kind of texture and material sensation do I get from it?

701
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Is it solid metal?

702
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,300
It's like a hard, hard, solid, shiny metal.

703
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,300
That was good work, John. I mean, that's, you created a portal.

704
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,300
It just was kind of an inopportune time, but that's the kind of thing we need now.

705
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,300
If we can time it right, we could either us go over there or just bring them back to our side.

706
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Yeah, I just don't think it ever works out with the turn order.

707
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,300
I just don't think this happens while we're in combat.

708
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
You can wait.

709
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,300
What if I waited a moment and chose the time I would strike?

710
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Yeah, I think that's probably for the best.

711
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,300
I'll trigger it to set off right after your turn.

712
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,300
I'll skip this turn, wait till the end of your turn,

713
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:34,300
and so the portal will open right before Don's turn in a manner of speaking.

714
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,300
I guess we can talk about turn order out of character.

715
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,300
That's fine. That's part of our plan.

716
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Yeah, I will trigger this. Yeah, I'll do all that.

717
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,300
I'll trigger this action to go off after your next turn, Joe,

718
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,300
so that it'll open up and Don can run through it on his turn and bring Keith with him.

719
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,300
So that just means that they have to survive whatever the ball does on this round, right?

720
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,300
Yeah.

721
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,300
Yep, and it's Don's turn.

722
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:04,300
So I saw the tendril whiz into the door and then get cut off, basically.

723
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,300
You heard it freaking out.

724
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,300
Yeah, if you poke your head around the door, then you would see it's not the whole tendril.

725
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,300
Half the tendril is recoiling, and it's losing its mind.

726
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,300
Or mind. It's losing its ball.

727
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
It's marbles.

728
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:26,300
I think I'd just stay in a good defensive spot, preparing for another strike.

729
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,300
Keith's like, chant this spell with me, to do hakanu.

730
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
Does Don know what that does?

731
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,300
You would recognize it as a mispronounced phrase that your old buddy Jack Russell used to say all the time

732
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,300
when two of you were on the boat together.

733
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,300
Oh, he said two? Oh my god.

734
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,300
Oh, it's absolutely perfect. Oh, he just got it.

735
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,300
Oh, it's so good that it's just me and you, because we've got two to a canoe here.

736
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,300
Two to a canoe.

737
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
Two to a canoe. Two to a canoe.

738
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,300
Oh my god, I can't believe I didn't realize what that was.

739
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,300
Yeah, I had no idea. I thought it was a reference I wasn't getting, which it was.

740
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Yeah, I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?

741
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,300
I'm like, I feel like I'd just be like, now stay close to me, boy.

742
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,300
We gotta survive this, and I'll like, is he near me, or were you like, scooting away from me?

743
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,300
You're like, standing over me.

744
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,300
You still got him like, by the shirt collar.

745
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,300
Yeah, I'm holding him, I have him by the shirt collar, and I'm like, taking a defensive position.

746
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,300
Perfect.

747
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,300
John is pushing his turn, Jack Russell is dead, and the ball goes again.

748
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:42,300
Don, Keith, the two of you see the ball put its long, long limbs into this shining, shimmering, silver sea, and begin moving.

749
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:52,300
It drops the body of Jack Russell onto the boat right behind the little twins, still holding onto the body of Julie Maxwell,

750
00:40:52,300 --> 00:41:01,300
but it moves and makes its way toward the John made hole in the side of the original piston bunker yard,

751
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:11,300
and John and Clark, you both see, just rising from below, right outside that John made hole,

752
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:20,300
a one inch in diameter, silver sphere pop up with the tendrils coming out below it and above it.

753
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,300
It's made its way to the John made hole.

754
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,300
Keith, your turn.

755
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,300
I stand up.

756
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,300
Fuck.

757
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,300
I look on the other side of the door to see what could have happened to this spider.

758
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,300
When you look on the other side of the door, you just see it's a hatch door, it's kind of made out of the same material,

759
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:45,300
but then you see through the door this entirely new world, the sky completely dark.

760
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:51,300
It's almost tension relieving when you look into it because it is just one thing.

761
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:58,300
When you look into the sky and you look at materials that are in this plane of existence where you are currently,

762
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,300
it wrinkles your brain, it like tenses your shoulders.

763
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,300
You haven't been able to really relax even though you feel completely content here.

764
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:14,300
There, on the other side, it is just darkness above and just light below.

765
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,300
I want to walk in looking straight above me like trying not to look at the ground at all

766
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:25,300
and trying to not have the ground in my eyesight at all, staring straight up and just walk in.

767
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:37,300
Past the ball and in the foreground of your view, Clark and Jon both see Keith in the background walking through the door.

768
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,300
Clark, it's your turn.

769
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:47,300
Clark is going to try and get low and put junk piles between him and the ball at the door.

770
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Yes. Jon, his eyes get big as he sees the ball floating there.

771
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:59,300
He kicks himself for closing the portal in the first place and hastily tries to make it again.

772
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,300
43.

773
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:11,300
With his experienced hand, he opens the door into the ivory endlessness of the terrain in the other bunker.

774
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:15,300
They see Keith just in front of them walking into it.

775
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,300
Jon yells at Clark,

776
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,300
Come on, buddy. We got to get fucking through this portal.

777
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:27,300
And kind of assumes, I guess, that the ball will choose Leo instead of Clark.

778
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:33,300
He just grabs onto whatever part of Clark is closest to him and drags him through the portal with him.

779
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,300
Dope. Amazing.

780
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,300
All right, Don, your turn.

781
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,300
I see Keith walk away from me, right?

782
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,300
Yeah, Keith goes to the other side of the hatch.

783
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,300
Do I see, like, Jon coming through?

784
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:52,300
Yeah, when you turn and go around the hatch to your left immediately on the inside of this hatch door,

785
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:58,300
you see Jon dragging Clark through and they pass you as you're standing there.

786
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,300
They pass you and walk right behind Keith into this new world.

787
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,300
I think Don just slams the fucking door and turns to go with them.

788
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,300
Fuck yeah.

789
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:15,300
So you come through the door, slam the door behind you, and the four of you have entered a new world.

790
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,300
It is Jon's turn right behind you.

791
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,300
The inside of this hatch is still a portal to the world that you were just in.

792
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Anybody forget anything? Car keys? Cell phones?

793
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,300
Leo!

794
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,300
No, no, no, no. No. God damn.

795
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,300
I promised him we wouldn't forget him.

796
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,300
Yeah!

797
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,300
You hear a violent cry.

798
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,300
We gotta help if we did this to him.

799
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,300
Did they forget the goat they fed to the Tyrannosaurus in Jurassic Park?

800
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,300
No, it played an important role.

801
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,300
And I'm gonna try to...

802
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,300
I'm gonna try to close that portal.

803
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,300
Forty-five.

804
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,300
I mean, yay!

805
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
No, that's rad.

806
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:10,300
The fact that Jon Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth is just so in tune with this ability makes so much sense.

807
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,300
Because you're home, baby.

808
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:23,300
Jon moves his experienced hands across this strange inky doorway, removes the portal, and the hatch dissipates into nothingness as well.

809
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,300
The ground you all stand on is made of light.

810
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,300
It's a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below.

811
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:38,300
In every direction surrounding you, what could be called the ground meets what could be called the sky.

812
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:43,300
And it's this blacker than black opaque darkness.

813
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:52,300
And there's nothing on the horizon except for a single imposing building way off in the distance.

814
00:45:52,300 --> 00:46:00,300
Dimly lit from below, you can see that it's a slightly shiny pitch black.

815
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:06,300
But Keith doesn't notice that because Keith is staring straight up.

816
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:16,300
And each of you understand why he hasn't stopped staring when you follow his gaze up into a tube of pure light hanging above.

817
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:24,300
The interior wall of this incandescent pipe is made of the same light you currently stand on.

818
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:31,300
And there seems to be only complete darkness beyond its well-lit passage.

819
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:39,300
And there's something in this immense, resplendent cylinder, consistently plodding the glowing terrain,

820
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:45,300
somehow simultaneously moving toward you and staying at a uniform range.

821
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:55,300
It is a towering, lumbering beast, seemingly made of the darkness that surrounds everything in this place.

822
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:00,300
It walks on two massive legs the size of trees.

823
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:06,300
Its broad shoulders swing back and forth high above the glossy ground.

824
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:15,300
And as you all stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible little glitches.

825
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:21,300
And you cannot fully make sense of its shape. And then it roars.

826
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:34,300
Every muscle in your body stiffens and every breath abandons your lungs.

827
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:44,300
Bad girls on top of the water

828
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,300
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

829
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,300
Leaving my mind at your altar

830
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,300
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

831
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:02,300
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

832
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:10,300
What kind of world are you living in?

833
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,300
What kind of world are you living in?

834
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,300
What kind of world are you living in?

835
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:44,300
What kind of world are you living in?
