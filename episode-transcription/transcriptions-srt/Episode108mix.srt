1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,280
Hey y'all, it's Zach. Sorry for not being wolf, he'll be on momentarily, but first I have a quick announcement and a request, a plea, I'm begging, it's a bag.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:22,640
The announcement, you may have noticed we released a trailer for this first season of pretending to be people here on our RSS feed.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,120
We've also uploaded said trailer to YouTube, yeah! I'm so abso-fucking-lutely stoked.

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,680
This has been on my to-do list for two years now and crossing it off,

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:49,120
I won't go into detail, but it feels good. I have poured everything I am into this show and I'm

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,600
immensely proud of the result. And the fact that my best friends and I have been able to stay close

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:05,440
and create this story together, it's really meaningful. Shit, okay, on to the request, the plea,

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:13,360
the bag. Please, please, you've listened to so many hours of this campaign and like

9
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:22,080
three and a half years of our bullshitting banter, so I beg you, please share our trailer

10
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:30,080
for pretending to be people season one everywhere. Reddit, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook,

11
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:39,840
fuck Mark Zuckerberg, everywhere. It would make me feel good. And as Wolf says, the link

12
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,760
is in the show notes. Seriously, thank you all so much for listening. We have horribly delightful

13
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,200
things in store for you after season one, so hold on to your horses by their sick BDSM gear

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:03,280
and get ready. Now over to you, Wolf. I have a question for y'all, my adoring fans. Do you

15
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,840
prefer your bread to be moist or unmoist? Before I answer, you should comment down below what y'all

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,360
prefer. And don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe. And before I answer, this question

17
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,560
was brought to you by Wet Bread Incorporated. They make bread wetter. So anyway, I, of course,

18
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,120
like my bread moist and sloppy. You throw a couple of slices of that good year old bread

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,000
into a bucket of room temp milk, let it sit for a month to 10, and you got a damn stew going.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,640
And oh yeah, this is live from 694.2 PTBP, the only channel that offers you at least a baker's

21
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,240
dozen of new songs every week. This Howlin' with Wolf is from Brendan, who lives in San Diego.

22
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,840
They tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. Just one of the many ways

23
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,760
you can help to make sure your favorite wolf's trash stays good and wet. They write,

24
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,200
Wolf, it's me. I was able to use the gun again, and I think this is the right time stream.

25
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,040
Things are really messed up. We have to make sure we keep those myriad monsters from stopping the

26
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,040
contention boys from fulfilling their destiny. Remember to keep checking the trash for the

27
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:38,480
updates from the head office. Your friend, Dog the Wolf. Head office? Head office? You think there

28
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,520
are powers that are above my own in this world, Dog the Wolf? Dog the Wolf, if that even is your

29
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,160
real name, what a stupid piece of shit name you have that no one would ever take seriously.

30
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,520
If you write this show again, I'm gonna find you, Dog the Wolf. And when I do,

31
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,000
well, I'd probably give you a big ol' hug. But then I'll banish you back to your own time from

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,320
whence you came. And remember, I don't make the rules, except for when I decide to. If you want

33
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:19,360
to write up something for your sourdough damsel, Wolf to Hal, tag at PretendingPod on the dadgum

34
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:27,040
internet, or write up a five star review on Apple Podcasts. And let my producer know you did so by

35
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,240
dropping an email to pretendingpod at gmail.com. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. Follow at PretendingPod

36
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,520
on Instagram though. Fuck Jack Dorsey. Make sure you follow at PretendingPod on Twitter.

37
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,680
And fuck Jack Conte. Subscribe to Pretending to Be People on Patreon. Discord sick though,

38
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,520
no doubt. Follow along with our little community over there. All the links? Guess where they are.

39
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:02,400
Hyrule? No, you fucking nerd. The links are in the damn show notes. I am the segue, and the truth,

40
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:12,480
and the life. No one cometh unto the news but by me. Last time Rose Mary performed its predictable,

41
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:19,040
prepared, profusive prose. Though the production proved powerless due to a pitiful pun,

42
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,760
John stood his well-lit ground, shed the skin of his father, and began to alter the stage for what

43
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:33,360
is sure to be a main event level brawl. Don, Keith, and Clark ran for the shiny black building.

44
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,600
They were met by a chanting chorus, a singing swarm, a reciting circle, a luminous land liturgy,

45
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,360
a crooning crowd that consisted of close to all the characters that have been in this show so far.

46
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,680
Except for me. But like, I am here. I'm not looking around. I'm, uh, fuck. This new world's

47
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,240
got me feeling like a child called David after he visits the first Randy Angst. Is this going to be

48
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,400
forever? If so, that's fine. I've got Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In?

49
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:27,440
On top of the water, Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar,

50
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:38,400
crossing the double line, doing it every time. Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

51
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,440
What kind of world are you living in?

52
00:06:51,920 --> 00:07:02,320
Farts and Buttons. This 10-story tall creature with Rose M-A-R-Y atop it begins to trudge forward.

53
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:11,360
You see little technicolor beams from in front of you as you're running toward this building begin

54
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:22,160
to, as people start appearing on this luminous land all around you. As they hit the ground,

55
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,600
they're confused about what's happening. They're looking around. You see they're feeling their skin

56
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:35,040
like they were just recently covered in ooze. And now they're here. And you see with each

57
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:43,840
new person that arrives in this place, the beast grows even larger. You're running away,

58
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,120
but as you turn back and look over your shoulder to see, I mean, this thing is growing and growing

59
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,200
and Rosemary is just cackling into the sky.

60
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:07,520
And with one arm, this beast swipes at Silas Cole, picks him up off the ground,

61
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,640
and as Silas Cole is devoured by this fist, he is no longer visible.

62
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,120
Black and red light starts coming out from the hole that Jon has made in the ground.

63
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,480
And the air around you sounds angry. Keith Vigna, your counterpart,

64
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,800
you sent him to his seeming demise. It's your turn.

65
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,280
I'll just keep running. Clark.

66
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,760
I want to say real fast that we started doing some goof-em-ups, but when you were describing

67
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,000
seeing the town, I was getting nostalgia waves of joy with each person. When you said Gary

68
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,400
Daly was dressed to the nines, I was like, oh, Gary. That was really cool. That was really cool

69
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,840
to see all of our old friends. Now you get to die alongside them.

70
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,720
Clark is hearing that chant. Is that ringing a bell for him? Joe's, I guess, asking, is this

71
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,880
the chant that he had heard back when he was here previously? Yes. As this thing reverberates in

72
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:20,640
your head, you kind of think back to the moment you were in the circle of knowledge. Chief Maggie

73
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,520
Cook places this thing, this little bug-like creature with round circular mouths on the

74
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:35,360
bottom of your left foot, and you're sent to this place where these 12 figures are chanting up to

75
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,400
this beast. This beast that now in your memory looks tiny compared to this thing that you're

76
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,120
running away from, but at the time brought you to your fucking knees. And as you were weeping,

77
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:57,440
you just heard, Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya of all the overseers. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya of all the overseers.

78
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,760
Clark is kind of with Reckless Abandon going to run toward that group, and he's singing along.

79
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't know if he can find a way to get into the circle, but he wants to, he's like,

80
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,640
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya of all the overseers. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya. And I'm kind of emotioning

81
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,880
to the guys around me like, come on, come on. As you begin chanting this,

82
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:32,560
a light beams straight up into the dark sky from the middle of this circle, and a figure begins

83
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,280
rising with both of its hands out from the middle of this inner and outer circle that are going

84
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:47,840
in counter and normally clockwise directions. And you see a light emitting up into the air

85
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:57,600
from this humanoid's face. It is wearing dark robes, and it removes the hood above its head,

86
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:10,560
and there's a cowboy hat. Like a no-shit, like John Wayne-style cowboy hat on top of Clark Bishop

87
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,240
with black robes about 10 feet off the ground in the middle of this. And you, with your immense

88
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:29,040
power, chanting this same chant has given the overseer an overwhelming dose of unnatural power.

89
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:39,280
Yes, dude. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya. Clark has a lot more gusto in his chant as he sees this happening

90
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:49,120
before him. He is groovin' to it. Don, as you've gotten closer to this towering building,

91
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,120
this building that once looked huge, but again, with the perspective you have in this world now

92
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,360
with this creature behind you, this building doesn't look so tall, maybe three stories,

93
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,040
four stories. You hear the phone ring, and it's ringing from the top floor of this building. You

94
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,640
know it to be true in your Pettymore heart. You always trust a Pettymore heart. Just shut up,

95
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,920
Zach. Don't squint at me and frown. No, yeah. Donnie Pettymore's gonna run. I don't know.

96
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,520
Does the building have doors even? Like, I don't know. Is it like an unnatural? Yeah,

97
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,840
you kind of run past this huge group that's chanting, not giving a fuck about the thing

98
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,800
that is tugging at the heartstrings emotionally of the other three PCs in this situation,

99
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,440
and you can head right into the door of this thing. Yeah, I'll kind of push my way through

100
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,720
the crowd if they're in the way. Yeah, love it. Even rudely so, just knocking someone over.

101
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,680
I gotta get to that damn phone. You make it all the way up the stairs. You just fucking

102
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,840
sprint through these people into this building, up the stairs to the top floor. You see a small room.

103
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,840
There's a table made out of this inky black substance that the entire building is made out

104
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,360
of. There's a candle that is lighting this room that's sitting on top of this table,

105
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,000
and the candle is giving off the only light in this room, and it is illuminating two objects

106
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,760
sitting beside it on this desk. One on one side of the candle. There is an old-timey radio with

107
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,840
strange glass tubes, one of the glass tubes of which is broken, and neither the red nor the

108
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,400
green light are lit. On the other side of the candle, there's an old rotary phone.

109
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:50,960
Jon. Like a bad 3D animation, the ground where Jon was is just sinking and sinking deeper and

110
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:58,480
deeper, and this red and white light is coming out of it, this angry light, now that you've seen

111
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,920
Silas be destroyed. And all you see this turn is that it suddenly goes out. And in its place,

112
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:16,240
a technicolor swirl begins to appear. This spinning mass of people who are treating

113
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,000
the overseer like the top of a mayday pole as they weave in and out of each other. Now,

114
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
you've got the inner circle going one way, the outer circle going the other way, and before they

115
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,440
were purely inner and outer, but now they're weaving in and out of each other, passing left,

116
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,760
right, left, right, like a do-si-do, but never quite connecting arms in order to spin around

117
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,320
in a small circle before carrying on with a new partner. And they head toward this foe.

118
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,840
The monster? Yeah, sorry. This gargantuan behemoth. Big baddie.

119
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:58,400
Dripping with shadow. The big bad evil guy, if you will. As these dancing, singing, chanting

120
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:07,680
people from all across space and time and this specific campaign move toward this enormous

121
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,680
creature, it had just swiped down and grabbed consumed Silas Cole with one of its hands,

122
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:27,120
and the other arm swings across and takes out about half of this mass of people as it swipes

123
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,280
through backhanded like the second swing in a petty more slap. An uncle slap. Ouchie ouchie,

124
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:50,000
they all say. I felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried

125
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:59,760
out ouchie ouchie and then were silenced. And with that half of the luminous land liturgy,

126
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:08,960
this group of two intertwining circles chanting has just been consumed by the arm of the Gigantum

127
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:21,360
Repithecus in one swing. So let's play a game. This game could be fun. This game could also

128
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,400
be not super fun, depending. Are you going to force us to gamble the lives of the contention

129
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:43,600
for townsfolk? You're evil. This is sadistic. You're an evil, evil man. The dice tell the

130
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,720
story. The dice tell the story. And since I can't trust any of you, I'm going to need your cameras,

131
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,800
like Thomas is doing now, to show me the dice rolls that you will be making. I'm going to

132
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:07,840
assign each of you a group of NPCs, or former PCs, and you will roll, if you roll under 50,

133
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,240
that NPC survives.

134
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,760
I wasn't looking, what did Joe do? None of anyone's business. He was rolling his dice.

135
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:35,760
Down by his wiener. Showing us his dice. This is a very serious moment.

136
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,240
If you roll under 50, the NPC that you were rolling for in that moment survives the attack.

137
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:01,200
If you roll 50 or over, they are consumed. We're going to start with Justin.

138
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:13,120
Justin, show me this roll. We'll roll individually for most NPCs, but for the first three,

139
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,880
we're going to put them in a chunk. They're all right next to each other. We've got the Old West

140
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,080
folks, not the PCs that you guys played, but we've got the bartender, the piano player,

141
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,480
and a gambler named Thomas. Kill them. They all have friend branded across their foreheads,

142
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,160
and they have a raccoon, a chunky kitty, and a handsome dog. You better not kill them.

143
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:46,080
Justin, don't kill these people. So roll for their life. Like RuPaul says, roll for your life.

144
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,120
Under 50, survive. Over 50, survive, but a little worse for wear.

145
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
Are you sure? That's my vote.

146
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,760
Well, rolled off camera. Well, I don't know where to put it. It's too tiny. There's a two.

147
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,360
Wait. Okay. Show us the important one.

148
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,200
Yeah. 32. So good. You got that roll out of the way. Now roll for Jack Pearlman.

149
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,320
Why did you make me do the good one first? That's right.

150
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,560
There's no way this is going to land on camera, but we can pull that camera a little bit further

151
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:35,200
away. That way I can watch your fucking hands. I got a 40. Yay. I'll show you.

152
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,080
Right on. And with that, Jack Pearlman,

153
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,520
the bartender, piano player, and gambler named Thomas, all from our old west of contention

154
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
have survived. Yay.

155
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,360
Next, we're moving on to Joe. Boo.

156
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,200
Listen as if you didn't know Joe and Justin are feuding this week.

157
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,440
No, Justin knows that I've been rolling really bad lately. So

158
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,880
everybody he throws up is about to get swatted right now.

159
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,320
Well, we're starting off with a pretty, pretty easy one. No one will care if they disappear.

160
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,120
It's Drew Andrews' body. Councilman Terry pages is likely inside.

161
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,000
His corporeal form, but not as like soul or memories.

162
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,280
And the excitable black lab, Tyler. Tyler.

163
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,120
It's an eight. Yay.

164
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,880
Well done. Well done.

165
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,000
All right. Next up, Harry clinker with an old distinguished proud.

166
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,120
Don't kill clinker.

167
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,600
What's it going to be? That boy's dead. It's a 62.

168
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,440
Damn. Oh no.

169
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,480
God damn.

170
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,800
Harry clinker stops chanting at the moment that this behemoth's arm is swiping across toward him.

171
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:22,160
His eyes get big. He looks down at this old distinguished gray dog,

172
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,640
pulls out a slice of white bread with some cut up hot dogs on it and feeds it to the dog.

173
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,360
Oh yeah. That's right. That's right. Good job. You're done. Good boy.

174
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
As they both get fully consumed.

175
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,120
Next up, I'm going to roll for old Everett Pace.

176
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,920
Okay. Oh shit.

177
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,720
Joe Terry.

178
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Everett survives. It's a 45.

179
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,880
I'm so glad to stay around.

180
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,680
Good job, Joe.

181
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,640
Jack Pearlman fires a gun off in celebration.

182
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,280
Luke, your turn. We've got two people for you to roll for.

183
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:14,240
First is going to be Mildred Mitchell, rainbow earrings, her face completely bruised and swollen

184
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,800
from her last encounter with the contention PD and on her shoulder is an old gray squirrel.

185
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,840
22.

186
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,560
They survive little squirrelly.

187
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,120
And next is Gary Daley with the golden retriever named Bean.

188
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,240
He's putting your own dog in it.

189
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,160
That's so sad.

190
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,080
And it's a seven.

191
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,760
Thank God.

192
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,320
There you go.

193
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,600
Whew.

194
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,520
All right.

195
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,160
Bean lives to see another day.

196
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,440
This is going so, so much better than I expected.

197
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Whew. My heart was racing for Bean.

198
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,920
Thomas, first up, your uncle, Jimmy Sanders with a possum.

199
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,240
Okay.

200
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
Yeah. Roll whatever.

201
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,320
Yeah. Thomas was like, this one can go over 50. That's fine.

202
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,560
Yeah.

203
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,280
Rolling in a terracotta pot.

204
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
He rolls 53.

205
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,360
Over.

206
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,680
Who's going to make our sandwiches?

207
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,160
The possum was named Common.

208
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,760
He was a NPC from Contention Critter Coalition, one shot.

209
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,480
Okay. But an NPC, not a PC and not a dog or a cat.

210
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,520
Just a possum.

211
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,560
Some people love possums and keep them as pets.

212
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,000
Fun fact today for you.

213
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,520
The John Ball shrieks in white hot rage like, I will avenge you, Jimmy.

214
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,800
Jimmy completely hears and understands that as he's fully fucking insane.

215
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:10,160
His eyes have been just as dilated as they ever were on any of his many shrooms trips

216
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,480
while he's been in this world.

217
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,200
And he's honestly been having a pretty good time.

218
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,400
So as he's consumed by this endless darkness within the arm of this gigantic creature,

219
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,680
he takes the possum, he takes the possum by the front two legs,

220
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,080
stares into its eyes and says, down to the next one.

221
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,920
That fucking rules. That's how I want to go.

222
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,000
Never go to a second location with a possum.

223
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,920
They're probably just playing dead.

224
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,500
Yeah.

225
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,080
Professor Horace Green holding the decapitated head of preacher Sheriff Dr.

226
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,920
Bobby Custard is up next.

227
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,320
I love this character so much.

228
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,040
Please don't die.

229
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Fuuuuuuuuck.

230
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,680
That's a death.

231
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,320
What is it?

232
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,120
81.

233
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,240
Oh, that's too much.

234
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
I don't remember what that character voice was.

235
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,360
So that's personally...

236
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,120
Professor Horace Green?

237
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,600
Oh, I just like this.

238
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,920
I just meant like I'm glad I wouldn't have to be playing him since he's dead.

239
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,400
Oh, okay.

240
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,640
Yeah.

241
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,040
Perfect.

242
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,600
Good timing.

243
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,760
Now, can you play him real quick as he dies?

244
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
Now, play him at his most important moment.

245
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,680
Of all the wonders I've stared at in the natural world.

246
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,400
He says as the gigantron propithecus is swinging its arm towards him.

247
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,680
I never thought I'd imagine I'd see anything so beautiful.

248
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,920
And a smile crosses his face as he's subsumed into the creature.

249
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,520
Love it.

250
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,160
Love it.

251
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,560
Now, the last one.

252
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
Carrie Page's body.

253
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,480
Oh, no.

254
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,800
Drew Andrews inside with Salem the cat's body.

255
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,720
Oh, God.

256
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
Agent Trent Chad.

257
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,160
I hope God loves me enough for this role.

258
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,080
Everyone, if you could bow your heads.

259
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,880
Have you done your apples today?

260
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,640
I'd like to say a quick prayer.

261
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,080
Yes.

262
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,120
Drew lives and so does his corporeal form.

263
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,000
Hell, yes.

264
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,880
Thank God.

265
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,080
We got both Drew's.

266
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,360
Yeah.

267
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,680
Guys, this is literally, this is like fucking Thanos snapped and only Hawkeye disappeared.

268
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,800
I don't really understand that reference.

269
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:45,280
The song decibel level is cut in half as a large portion of these chanting individuals

270
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:55,600
are soaked up into the arm of this massive monster that then grows and grows its arm first.

271
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,440
About twice the size it was before as the ooze slowly forms out over the rest of its being.

272
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:15,200
And Rosemary leaps from a top now 15 stories off the ground and lands.

273
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,920
Her body does not touch the ground as the four tentacles from the back of her neck slam

274
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,640
themselves into the luminous land below.

275
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,880
And it kind of holds her up and she makes direct eye contact with the overseer.

276
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,240
Keith, it's your turn.

277
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,040
Am I just like following Don or how about I tell you, I'm just following Don.

278
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,080
And I get into the same room that he's in with the one candle

279
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,720
and I look around and it's just everything is dark except the candle.

280
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,000
And I just stare right at the candle and go over to it and blow it out.

281
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,560
And then I just lay down on the ground and my heart rate kind of slows down and I just take a

282
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,040
ah and lay on the ground.

283
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,400
The traditional action turn of a Delta Green character.

284
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,880
Clark Bishop, it is your turn.

285
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,920
And take a breather, take a little nice nap on the ground.

286
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,280
Yeah, Clark is gonna lay down and

287
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:31,920
No, Clark wants to he's been this whole time he's been doing his best to kind of keep up with the

288
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,160
steps that somehow everybody already knows this this circular dance he wants he doesn't want to

289
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,120
look stupid so he's trying his best to keep going in that dance he stumbles over some people here

290
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,480
and there but he's wanting to make his way up to get as close to Clark Gold as he can

291
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,200
or the overseer and he wants to kind of shout

292
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,440

295
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,520

300
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,800
a lot of your bidding and pretty cryptically too if you could have just told me not to do that I

301
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,520
would have not done that that seems kind of it's I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't mean to be mean

309
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,960
Clark you begin chanting with more gusto than you even had before as he looks down at you and says

310
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:07,520
a few words under his breath you are unnaturally compelled to worship the overseer oh shit

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:29,920
teela you turn out to be a dick all right so uh it is on deep anymore's turn um I'm in the room

312
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:38,000

as the tone rings through my face just like completely like just falls and I'm just like

340
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:13,280
kind of staring into space and I drop the receiver out of my hand this was this was this is why I

341
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,480
can't this is supposed to fix things it's what what happened keith you hear him saying this is

342
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,760
you're the only other person in the room you didn't hear what was on the other end of the line

343
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,480
but he's devastated what's wrong this is just enjoy what's around you are you

344
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:39,120

345
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,240
grabs you by the collar again like he did earlier when he was trying to help you but much more

346
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,480
threatening this time keith is just extremely relaxed and and kind of limp john it's your turn

347
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,720
the small hole that had been like deepening sinking into the ground has expanded it

348
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,160
disappeared in a flash and there's there's a there's a technicolor swirl there now

349
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,640
it's whirlpooling around in light and and sound and if you were near the whole wind

350
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,520
all of a sudden it's so much bigger than the little silver ball and it grows and it grows

351
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,000
and it grows the light kind of disappears from it and all of a sudden you see like the night sky

352
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:34,320
and from what to you is the ground but what to them is is the air falls upward planet juggernaut

353
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,600
keith beans and clark bishop and a john lee pettymore

354
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:50,480
holy shit keith and clark are both wearing bomb squad gear like the hurt locker

355
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,560
and you would recognize this as the gear that they had on in the scrap pit

356
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:09,920
john looks confused but relaxed keith and clark literally still have like the bloodlust coursing

357
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,600
through them from the arena you see clark has these these weird gloves on they're like

358
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,520
magnetic pneumatic hands and he's kind of like punching them and he's ready for a fucking tussle

359
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,640
after he gets over his brief surprise when like gravity flips on them and they fall from the sky

360
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:40,880
up into your world keith has his nitro gun that he used to freeze 37 members of the of the crowd

361
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,240
on family night at the scrap pit and in his other hand he has this crossbow that appears to shoot

362
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:57,120
the blades from like circular saws and john looks like he's just come from a couch his shoes are off

363
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:06,080
he's you see his like sweaty socks he's he's still got this huge look of surprise on his face from

364
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,800
where planet juggernaut clark bishop and keith but not the clark bishop and keith from his timeline

365
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,880
have collected him from the house of clark bishop's parents after after he watched keith

366
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,520
disappear into into a door and clark disappear into his book and he took a moment to just watch

367
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,160
wheel of fortune at clark's house that's this john he doesn't look ready for this world like

368
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:41,840
like keith and clark do and planet juggernaut but the whole like they shoot up out of it and then

369
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,840
kind of plop down as they as they encounter the gravity of this world and the hole disappears

370
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:54,960
underneath them it just sucks back up and they land on solid ground in fighting pose like in

371
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,480
an anime or like cartoon fighting style fucking clark and keith are down at the base of this

372
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:10,880
towering planet juggernaut who also has his hands out with his mickey mouse gloves and he's got them

373
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,200
he's got them ready for a fight as well john falls out of the air and lands flat on his back

374
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,720
and doesn't know what's happening and above above it all you see a tiny silver ball just like

375
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:33,600
floating and the camera pans around to where we see a 2d scene essentially like a fighting video

376
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:46,400
game and on the left side of the screen we have gigantam propithecus and rose mxry versus the

377
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:58,000
overseer and planet juggernaut out of a tiny vacuum in planet juggernaut you see these two

378
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,400
you know like when the urakai get born in lord of the rings when they're pulled out of the muck

379
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,400
out of like those kind of sacks the two announcers from the scrap pit get thrown

380
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:20,800
and land yes let's take a look at the situation right hand here if it was up to me to decide

381
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,680
what's going on here i'd say we got a pretty good fight on our hands what do you think dick

382
