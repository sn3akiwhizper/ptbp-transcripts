1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Happy holy days, my friends and my families.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,320
Me, Wolf the dog, and my dog, Wolf the dog,

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,480
are wishing you a happy one live from 694.2 PTBP,

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,220
the holiest and jolliest station

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,880
this side of the northern pole.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,380
My producer also sends his eternal love

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,340
through a mix of wild vibrations and chatterings.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,980
What a fun dude.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,060
And speaking of fun dudes,

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,400
this year howling with Wolf is from Curtis

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,220
and his friend Jared, both in St. Louis.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,080
Curtis tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,380
the merriest and most cheerful act of giving

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,300
outside of ripping a hole in the corner

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,540
of a grease-filled diner dumpster

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,940
and squeezing that big old nasty metal box

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,880
like a piping bag until the sludge slips and slides

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,540
right into Wolf's gaping inscrutable maw.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,200
Mm, baby.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,980
But the tweet thing is pretty good too.

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,920
Curtis writes, hello Wolf, master of grease,

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,860
time travel, trash, and dumpster grease.

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,840
First off, thank you for all the new songs you always bring

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,540
and for continuing to keep us up to date

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,140
on the continual and confusing adventures

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,740
of the Contention PD and City News crew.

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,820
My friend who's listened to all the episodes

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,300
made sure to ask you not to spoil anything for me

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,220
like the Christmas episodes,

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,900
the fate of Jack Russell's soft, velvety eye bags,

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,820
or the Contention Creek Critter Coalition, or the turtle.

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,220
Stay frosty and fuck the zuck.

33
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,620
Well, damn, thanks, Curtis.

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,580
I appreciate that you acknowledge

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,600
that I am the master of both grease and dumpster grease,

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,020
two different food groups that I use

37
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,660
for very different reasons.

38
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,580
And Curtis, stay greasy.

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,740
Now, if you wanna write up something

40
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,140
for your jolly wolf to how, it's real simple.

41
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,620
Post about pretending to be people on the internet

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,700
and tag at PretendingPod, or write up a five-star review

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,340
in the podcast app of your choice.

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,100
Screenshot that stunning work of art

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,180
and get that proof in front of my eyeballs

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,760
so that I may provide you with your just rewards.

47
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,300
Your reward of putting words in wolf's mouth

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,380
is just a few taps of the fingers away.

49
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,580
Those taps go on links, and the links,

50
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,260
the links are in the show notes.

51
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,660
Quick reminder, we're taking new

52
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,420
and upgrading Patreon subscriptions.

53
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,380
We're matching them and we're donating the total

54
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,820
to a crisis cold weather shelter

55
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,580
in the PTBP Boys' hometown of Springfield, Missouri.

56
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Join the Patreon and you'll get fun rewards

57
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,260
like exclusive merch, access to behind-the-scenes live video

58
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,140
of the Patreon recording sessions in the Den of Sin,

59
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,380
the ability to submit an NPC and location

60
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,980
to be used in the show,

61
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,980
and a confidential audio feed with 38 bonus episodes.

62
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,460
Coming later this month, the first episode

63
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,560
of Thomas' Oops All Petty Mores arc.

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,620
You're gonna wanna hear the boys

65
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,580
make their way back to contention.

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,620
And since we're raising money this month

67
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,380
to help folks stay warm,

68
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,980
we're combining this thing with a raffle.

69
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,500
Every five bucks subbed or upped on Patreon

70
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,800
gets you an entry to the raffle.

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,160
At the end of December,

72
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,800
we'll randomly select three winners.

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,000
The first two will receive a PTBP shirt

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,760
with the design of their choice from the merch store

75
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,200
or the Patreon exclusive options,

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,120
including the new season two Patreon exclusive designs

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,440
that will be announced at the end of this month.

78
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,160
And that third winner of the raffle can also have a shirt.

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,920
Oh, and they will be invited to play in a one-shot homebrew

80
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,760
written and run by Zach,

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,080
alongside Joe, Luke, and Thomas as their fellow players.

82
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,880
So if you want to maybe get a shirt

83
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,080
or play at the PTBP virtual table,

84
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,560
join up before December is over.

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,720
Time's running out, baby.

86
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,660
But I am not running out of time,

87
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,300
for time is merely a tool at my disposal.

88
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,520
Mm, I love two things in this here world.

89
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,960
A good bout of disposing.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,960
And the news.

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,760
Last time, our assumed heroes showed

92
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,180
some actually unbelievable footage to their editor,

93
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,000
Vivica, perhaps breaking her mind.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,080
And then Kurt, the red-eye siren chaser,

95
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,100
showed up with some wild footage

96
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,560
of a new weather phenomenon.

97
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,160
Absolutely exhausted and spent,

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,480
Julius Summers headed to the hospital

99
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,680
while Beck and Cal made their way back to Cal's

100
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
to check on Stevie and Greg Fox god-goddle.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,360
But they found neither of the god-goddle's siblings,

102
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,600
and the bindings that tied down the wet god-goddle

103
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,720
had been cut by scissors.

104
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,960
Beck Wilder and Cal Colorado sped on empty tanks

105
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,160
to Bean's Bridge to assess the scene after that

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,240
seemingly god-caused freak weather incident

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,640
from Kurt's footage.

108
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Too tired to succeed, but too driven to hit the brakes,

109
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,600
Cal maneuvered past the police barricades

110
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,760
and taken us now to a better view

111
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,680
of Bean's Bridge's new, unnaturally smooth hole.

112
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,840
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great,

113
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
and it's all mine, all.

114
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,720
Oh.

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,680
Oh.

116
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
What is that?

117
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,340
The noise.

118
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,180
Yeah.

119
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,280
That's part of why I was making that face,

120
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,360
because I was like, if there's a noise,

121
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
just say it so we don't have to do this.

122
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,800
But what is it?

123
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
The timer for the lights.

124
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,960
It's just that it's not a digital one,

126
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
it's just literally this mechanical thing

127
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,480
that's just like, so I can absolutely just unplug that.

128
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,320
I didn't notice it, and I bet you it's the kind of thing

129
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,640
that the 30 seconds of silence would cancel out.

130
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,680
It will cancel out.

131
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,600
Sorry, what did you say?

132
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,200
I couldn't hear it over the enormously loud clicking

133
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,040
in my ears.

134
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,840
It's episode 19 of Pretending to be People.

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,880
Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham,

136
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,300
wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, season two.

137
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,640
Season two.

138
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,080
Episode 19.

139
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
Episode 19.

140
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,920
Whoa.

141
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,560
Episode 19.

142
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,400
COVID-19.

143
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,200
You know what that reminds me of?

144
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,840
19, nine one, nine 11.

145
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,000
Welcome to the numerology episode

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,200
of Presenting to be People.

147
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,440
I crashed my Scion TC at 100 miles an hour.

148
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,880
I crashed my Scion TC.

149
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,040
I don't care, it's numbers.

150
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,480
So Taylor and I were at Ramatai eating lunch the other day

151
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,520
and we went inside and there was the loudest conversation

152
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,480
happening right behind us.

153
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,320
We were the only two groups of people eating

154
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,760
in this tiny living room converted

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,240
into a restaurant dining room.

156
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
And this loud, loud conversation,

157
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,960
the first sentence that I heard was one young gentleman

158
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,880
college age asked the other young gentleman college age,

159
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,360
what is it about your actions and behavior

160
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,580
make you think you're not an incel?

161
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,800
Oh damn, so it's-

162
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Incelvention?

163
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Yes, it was an incelvention.

164
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,220
Incelvention are just like bullying

165
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,860
and it's the same dynamic as the guys

166
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,480
in White Lotus season two.

167
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
They're just still in college.

168
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,320
Yes, it's essentially that,

169
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,280
well, and after the whole thing went down.

170
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,880
The fish, but the one guy wouldn't let the other one have it.

171
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,120
At one point in time, he's like,

172
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,160
you're obsessed with women.

173
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,640
And the guy was like, I'm not obsessed with women,

174
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm obsessed with beauty.

175
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,340
And then he's like, don't you think it's not okay

176
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,480
to say things to girls that make them uncomfortable?

177
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,480
And his response to that was, I say things that move me.

178
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,480
They also don't like your skin suits that you wear.

179
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,880
At one point in time, I thought the conversation

180
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,920
was sort of veering into a like,

181
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,600
oh, he actually said, do you understand

182
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,520
that this is serial killer behavior?

183
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,360
What?

184
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,240
He was like, you're messaging these girls repeatedly,

185
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,920
they're not responding to you in their DMs

186
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,320
and you continue to message them.

187
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,020
And he's like, I don't send them questions,

188
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,360
I send them things.

189
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,400
You don't have to respond to things.

190
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,240
Oh no.

191
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
No, this is not good.

192
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
He's like, when people send me things,

193
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,320
I don't always respond to them.

194
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,560
It's pretty cool.

195
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,160
They were peers, they were the same age.

196
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
They seemed to be the same age, yeah.

197
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,780
Much older women in nursing homes.

198
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,240
Okay, they don't respond because some of them

199
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
are physically incapable of moving their thumbs.

200
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,120
I was wondering if it was maybe like a dad

201
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,160
having a talk with his son.

202
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,480
Oh no, that would have felt more appropriate.

203
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,080
I was on the side of the antagonist.

204
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,120
I really thought you were about to say the incel.

205
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,920
I was on the side of the incel.

206
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,680
I too am obsessed with beauty, sir.

207
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,400
You should see my campaigns, they're quite beautiful

208
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
if dark.

209
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,560
The aggressor was like,

210
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,080
what would Jesus think of your behavior?

211
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
Yeah, the guy who was like-

212
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,880
Is that what it's called in an intervention?

213
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
It will be in mine.

214
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,520
And if all of you were aggressors,

215
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,060
we'd get out of my house.

216
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
It's offensive defense.

217
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,040
Oh no, I'm feeling really suppressed right now.

218
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,800
Y'all are some suppressive people,

219
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,760
and me and the drugs are gonna stay right here.

220
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,200
So it did end eventually with,

221
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,720
actually Taylor got up as we were leaving,

222
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,520
walked over to their table and said,

223
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,800
after we witnessed both servers

224
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,300
coming in and out of this room,

225
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,840
like looking over tentatively every single time,

226
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,040
Taylor went over and was like,

227
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
hey, everyone can hear your conversation,

228
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
it's making everyone uncomfortable.

229
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,840
And then everyone clapped.

230
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,920
We raised her up in a chair, carried her out,

231
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,240
we got to keep the chair.

232
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,780
I went back to Ramatai a week later,

233
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,180
because I love Ramatai.

234
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,180
They were still having the conversation.

235
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,100
Makes sense.

236
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,920
Is this guy just like a series of copy pastas you read?

237
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,300
Copy pasta.

238
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,220
Is that how you say that?

239
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,760
No, it's not, you say copy pasta.

240
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,100
You could have gotten me.

241
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,780
Yeah, you're a jiff.

242
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,460
Yeah, I would have gotten your jiff ass.

243
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,860
All right, fuck you, get out of the room,

244
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,860
we're role playing, you're in the hospital.

245
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,980
I'm still not playing yet?

246
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,660
Yeah, I know, it sucks.

247
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,500
We're about to play you,

248
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,180
but first of all- For two fucking hit points?

249
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,880
Maybe you shouldn't have gotten the shit kicked out of you.

250
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,760
Joe and I have written up pretty extensive backstories

251
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,620
for your critical care team that we're gonna be playing.

252
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,540
That's what I was doing outside.

253
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,340
I was on nurse talk to see good tips

254
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,300
on patient health care.

255
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,420
Well, let's get this going.

256
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,700
Thanks for telling me it wasn't me in Ramatai.

257
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,220
I'm glad you kept that to yourself.

258
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,660
You're fine with Thomas knowing.

259
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,500
I'm sad.

260
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,100
So, did they look like peers?

261
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,380
I'm like, well, they look about the same age.

262
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,020
Thanks for not telling about me dressing down my dad.

263
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,700
Okay, no lie though, I could see your dad saying,

264
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,820
I say things that move me.

265
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,700
He wouldn't be talking about the same kinds of things

266
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
this boy was saying, but.

267
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
We're standing at a hole.

268
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,520
Standing at a hole in the middle of a bridge.

269
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,120
So, and you'll remember from the footage

270
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,000
that it did seem to close up in the footage that you saw.

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,840
I didn't remember that from the footage.

272
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,940
Yeah, I didn't remember that at all.

273
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,120
It had left a giant hole

274
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,040
and that's why the tugboat was swirling.

275
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,000
So, the tugboat swirled down along with its barge behind it,

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,400
but then after some time of the swirling,

277
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,900
after the tugboat and barge disappeared,

278
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,920
it's almost like it got stopped up.

279
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,080
I thought it got equalized.

280
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,840
I thought enough water had rushed in.

281
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,720
Gotcha, okay.

282
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,560
So, now the river is flowing normally,

283
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,640
but there's still a hole in the bridge

284
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,720
that people are very curious about.

285
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,840
Oh, I thought that's what you meant got closed up.

286
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,280
No, the hole in the water.

287
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
Oh, okay.

288
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,100
The hole in the bridge is still there.

289
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,940
Yep. Gotcha.

290
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,560
That's the hole we're looking for, man.

291
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,400
That's the money hole.

292
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,600
That's the money hole.

293
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,440
Oh, boy.

294
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,000
Did you guys follow that at home?

295
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,800
Beck, get a good shot of this big money hole.

296
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,760
Big money, big money, big money.

297
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm shooting the hole over the edge.

298
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,060
Yeah, I haven't described it this episode.

299
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,200
It is on the Beans Bridge,

300
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,640
which is the nearest bridge

301
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,620
from Cal Colorado's home through downtown.

302
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,600
And at the end of this bridge, nearest downtown,

303
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,240
there is a hole the size of a revolving door

304
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,920
from a shopping mall in the middle of this bridge.

305
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,440
And it is unnaturally smooth on the sides

306
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
where the hole has been ripped through this bridge.

307
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
Around this hole, there are countless city, county,

308
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,120
federal, state employees all coming around,

309
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,160
looking at it with their own different

310
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,720
sort of operational awarenesses and their own skills

311
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,760
and trying to figure out what happened here.

312
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,480
It is clearly a multi-agency task force.

313
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
Nailed it. Nice.

314
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
I'm getting some B-roll of the sides of the hole

315
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,120
because I think you mentioned they were smooth.

316
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,640
You were getting some of that B-roll.

317
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,380
And then at the end of our last episode,

318
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,880
the end of episode 18,

319
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,080
we saw Cal Colorado with a glint in his eye,

320
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,040
wink at the camera, move one of the barricades,

321
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,040
and make his way past onto the bridge and toward the hole.

322
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,360
Follow me Beckwith.

323
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,500
This is Cal Colorado City Action News,

324
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,760
and we're gonna get you the real story here tonight.

325
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,080
He B-lines it for,

326
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,800
you said there were like people in suits?

327
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,680
Yeah, there were people in suits.

328
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,520
Do they?

329
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,880
People in police officer uniforms,

330
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,080
people in like hazmat suits,

331
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,160
people in all sorts of different gear.

332
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,440
Who looks to be the most in charge?

333
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Oh, there is a woman who is wearing a black suit

334
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,920
and people seem to be walking over to her

335
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
and keeping her abreast of the situation.

336
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,300
And she's kind of like on her phone

337
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,280
and talking to people and then pushing them off.

338
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,320
Keeping an eye on her for now,

339
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,200
Cal like looking into the camera, like gestures.

340
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,040
Come here, come here, come here.

341
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,520
And we go straight up to the hole.

342
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,880
Get this Beck, get this.

343
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,700
Look at this now.

344
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,160
Show the people what we've got here.

345
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,480
Let's go ahead and roll law.

346
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Whichever one of you has the highest law.

347
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,660
And this is again at a negative 40.

348
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,840
I've got 40.

349
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Oh, I've also got 40.

350
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,680
Did you crit?

351
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,500
No.

352
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,040
Me neither.

353
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,860
Nice.

354
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,700
Immediately upon you hitting the hole,

355
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,500
stepping up to it, a police officer walks over.

356
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,340
Get up.

357
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,180
It's just the Muppet, he can't hurt us.

358
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,500
Gentlemen, what are you doing?

359
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,460
Gentlemen, what are you up to this evening?

360
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,660
Cal Colorado officer, city action news.

361
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,740
And you see that line over there, about that there?

362
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,580
Of course, of course.

363
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,420
And he's pointing over at the barricade

364
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,380
where you just came from.

365
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,300
This is bigger than the line

366
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,500
that we're showing the people what's really going on here.

367
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,600
Get this Beck, get this.

368
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,540
Sir, would you consent to being interviewed

369
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,380
and telling us a little bit

370
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,340
about what's going on here tonight?

371
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,340
Hands behind the back or bodies behind the barrier.

372
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,900
Okay, I understand.

373
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,460
We start backing away towards the people who are in charge.

374
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,940
Yes, we're heading back to the barrier, officer.

375
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,980
I understand, I understand.

376
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,980
Thank you very much.

377
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,660
You are absolutely going the wrong way there.

378
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,820
We're diagonally, our friends are over there

379
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,700
kind of towards the other side of the barrier that way.

380
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,620
So we are heading towards the barrier,

381
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,460
but diagonally in this kind of direction

382
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,100
that also sort of takes us through the center

383
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,940
of the rest of the things over here.

384
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,700
At this point, you're backing into the woman.

385
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,120
Cal Colorado, city action news.

386
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,100
I put the microphone in her face.

387
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,940
Get this, get this, get this.

388
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,380
She puts her hand up to the camera

389
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,620
and she's like, no, thank you.

390
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,840
Your laptop screen light actually makes it look

391
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,940
like you've got a camera light in your face.

392
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,020
Blocking it away.

393
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,140
No, thank you.

394
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
So sultry.

395
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,460
Yes, get away from me.

396
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,380
Cal did not say so sultry.

397
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,540
I was like, that was my comment on your vocal choice.

398
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,980
Well, in that case, Zach says, oh, hey, thanks.

399
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,460
Nice.

400
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,300
I'm playing him a little manic,

401
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,740
like how wild would it be if.

402
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,660
I mean, you're like, it's 4.30 in the morning

403
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,200
and it's bad.

404
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,100
Cal takes a huge fucking gamut

405
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,600
and he says, Cal Colorado, city action news.

406
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,440
Do you know me?

407
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,260
And he winks.

408
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,140
Yeah, roll charisma.

409
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,820
Negative 40.

410
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,640
That's a fail.

411
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,820
Would have actually passed 8,385, but.

412
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,620
I don't give a damn who you are.

413
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,980
Back up behind the border.

414
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,500
And the guy comes up behind you and he's like,

415
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,380
that's right.

416
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,200
I said, keep it moving.

417
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,040
Okay.

418
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,180
And it's got hands on you now.

419
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,340
He's like, what did I just say?

420
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,660
Can we get somebody else over here?

421
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,980
Hands behind her back or behind the barrier.

422
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,820
We got it.

423
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,660
We got it.

424
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,480
Cal failed your role.

425
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,320
Get the fuck out of here.

426
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,160
Yeah, I understand.

427
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,000
I understand.

428
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,940
Did the woman with the sultry voice

429
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,580
have any kind of identification on her?

430
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,220
Whether it's a name badge or something on her jacket.

431
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,500
Also, is she age appropriate to Cal Colorado?

432
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,340
Yes.

433
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,060
And she says, I don't give a fuck who you are.

434
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,580
And it's like a powerful peer of Cal Colorado's.

435
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,860
He's a little taken.

436
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,100
Is Beck taken too?

437
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,940
The sequel.

438
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,860
So you would notice that there is a tattoo on her hand,

439
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,940
the hand that she put up.

440
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,780
I zoom in on it.

441
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,940
To put in front of the camera.

442
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,700
And it is like the tail.

443
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,060
It's like a tail that's scaly.

444
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,180
That's running up out of her cuff.

445
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,780
Scaly like a rat tail?

446
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,500
No.

447
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,320
Like a dragon tail.

448
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,000
How close to a dragon than a rat?

449
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,840
A dragon rat.

450
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,440
And it just kind of creeps up out of the cuff

451
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,240
from under her suit jacket.

452
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,100
And I just realized she's wearing a suit.

453
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,220
And so as you back up,

454
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,680
what is Beck's reaction to this whole situation?

455
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
Oh yeah.

456
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,920
The whole time he's been walking through here,

457
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,460
he's been sweating bullets.

458
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,480
You've noticed that his eyes been

459
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,760
kind of darting back and forth.

460
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,520
And he's kind of been keeping his head down

461
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,280
like strictly into the viewfinder,

462
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,480
pointed directly at you.

463
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,240
And then when I bumped into her,

464
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,200
I was probably backing up and bumped into her

465
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,680
and saw her and I probably,

466
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,280
the camera jostled really bad.

467
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,100
And you saw me start to turn around

468
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,080
and walk toward the barricade like strongly.

469
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,440
And then remember, oh shit, I've got a job.

470
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,140
And I got, I'm pretty far away now

471
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,440
using a zoom to get you guys in frame.

472
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,880
As the officer approaches them,

473
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,600
he's like, I'm sorry officer, I'm sorry.

474
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,080
And he immediately turns away

475
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,840
and you kind of see like a sheepish boyish grin on his face.

476
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,840
And with the waters of the city river raging below you,

477
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,640
the sounds of the lapping waves hitting the rocks below.

478
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,120
The two of you kind of headed off

479
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,960
back on the other side of the barrier.

480
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,360
It's about 4.30 in the morning.

481
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,040
The haze of sunlight is kind of growing off in the distance,

482
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,640
even though it's still quite dark out.

483
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,800
So with all of my stats, negative 40,

484
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,580
I think Beck then is feeling that

485
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,800
and would just look at you

486
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,040
with just the most bloodshot and hang dog eyes.

487
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,720
I don't know if we're gonna be able to find anybody

488
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,000
tonight, like I'm about to just drop on the ground, man.

489
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,840
What do you mean?

490
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,600
Are you not, I mean, I'm so,

491
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,640
I'm taken up in the work right now.

492
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,460
What a day we've had.

493
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,680
We've got to go to the foundry.

494
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,760
We've got to have some drinks at the foundry.

495
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,080
I'm buying.

496
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,920
Come on.

497
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,620
Cal, I can't do it, Cal.

498
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,480
Well, you want to go back to your mom's sad apartment?

499
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,160
I was gonna ask if I could crash at your place,

500
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,520
but it sounds like you're still going out.

501
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,760
So I'll just sleep in the van

502
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,080
and I'll meet you in the morning.

503
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,920
I'll be right in front.

504
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,740
Okay, no, no, no.

505
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,080
We'll go have drinks at my place.

506
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,200
We'll have some drinks at my place.

507
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,280
Come on, let's go back to my place.

508
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,800
Yeah, yeah, we'll go back to your place and then.

509
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,160
It's just like hanging out with Thomas.

510
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
Go to sleep.

511
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,680
Hey, I was trying to explore that subtly

512
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,120
through character work.

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,920
I was trying to exaggerate it, but I guess, I don't know.

514
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,760
I liked it.

515
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,100
If it was me, I'm ready to go to the foundry.

516
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,040
I know, but other people aren't.

517
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,200
Something I've learned

518
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,000
and I'm trying to express through my character,

519
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,080
Cal, Colorado, who hasn't learned it.

520
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,600
What are you guys doing after this, by the way?

521
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,140
But yeah, I said I'm going back.

522
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,400
Yeah, we get back there.

523
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,480
All right, I'm just gonna crash in the van

524
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,000
and I'll see you in the morning, man.

525
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Beck, Beck, Beck.

526
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,440
I insist.

527
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,420
I've got seven bedrooms in this home.

528
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,440
You will take one.

529
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,120
Yeah, okay.

530
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,000
I mean, if you're talking about sleeping, yeah.

531
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
I am, and Stevie's gonna come back.

532
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,320
I mean, well, you know, we're gonna probably,

533
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,680
I've got some pretty nice whiskey.

534
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,080
Hey, do you, speaking of her coming back,

535
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,880
do you have security cameras?

536
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,360
Like A, could we see when they left?

537
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,060
And B, like get a notification if they come back?

538
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,640
I get all these notifications from the Ring app

539
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,440
and I don't know what to do with them.

540
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,960
I, maybe you can find something relevant in here.

541
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,920
Let me see that, let me see that.

542
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,940
I'm looking at the hours after we left

543
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,680
and seeing if we get any footage of them leaving.

544
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,760
Did you see Stevie and God come and go like seven times

545
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,840
like they go to the fucking bodega.

546
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
They are holding pizza.

547
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,680
Yeah.

548
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,320
Arms full of snackies.

549
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,160
They walk away the first time, they come back,

550
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,160
they walk away with $1,500 in their arms in cash.

551
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,680
They come back with pizza.

552
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
A little too many, like feed too many red peppers

553
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,220
and God goes crazy.

554
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,780
The app wasn't downloaded on Cal's phone.

555
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,420
Like it had been long enough that he'd clicked on it,

556
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,900
that it wasn't downloaded.

557
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,500
So you click download on it

558
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,900
and as it's finishing up the, oh man, you're asleep.

559
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,460
I see Beck just like passed out on the couch with my phone

560
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,340
and I like pluck it out of his hands,

561
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,780
like plug it in a charger,

562
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,980
walk off with the two glasses of whiskey

563
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,840
I've just poured for me and Beck.

564
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,800
I throw one down my gullet and walk upstairs to my bedroom,

565
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,680
pass dozens of pictures of Cal's career

566
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,100
from the seventies on to today.

567
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,120
And he downs the second glass, brushes his teeth,

568
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,000
gets in like some silk pajamas

569
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,480
and slips into a pretty fucking nice bed set.

570
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,880
This sounds lovely.

571
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,720
I'm warm and soft.

572
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,320
Just in case either one of you are wondering.

573
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,380
Yeah, we know, you're a soft little bitch.

574
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Now I'm hard.

575
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,520
What was that?

576
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
You're broken.

577
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
You said broken.

578
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
You're broken.

579
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,520
I broke and I couldn't breathe.

580
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Can that man not breathe every time he laughs?

581
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
He's like a human bug.

582
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Oh my God.

583
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
You had wake apnea.

584
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Oh man.

585
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Okay, cool.

586
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
We dropped so many balls today, man.

587
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,520
I was like, I can't see a way in character

588
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,520
to get Vivica from just stop her from walking away from here.

589
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,520
We didn't really try that hard to go find Stevie and God.

590
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,520
I mean, like I said, mechanically and what,

591
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
because of mechanically what Beck would be feeling,

592
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
he just wouldn't be able to.

593
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
He just couldn't.

594
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,520
I feel like we could have deployed some energy drink.

595
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Yeah, I mean, I had it coursing through my veins.

596
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,520
I figured that had already been taken into account.

597
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Energy drink coursing through my veins.

598
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Energy drink coursing through my veins.

599
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,520
Yeah, I think just with the day that you guys have all had

600
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
hitting that 5 a.m. spot,

601
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
I was just going to be like, nah.

602
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
What are we at on recording time?

603
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
Nothing.

604
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
I have not clicked record yet.

605
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Cool.

606
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
I think we can really nail it in the second take

607
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
and lose all that mindless bullshit.

608
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,520
Now we're going to double down on the soft bitch stuff.

609
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Go back, go back.

610
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,520
Find anything that really cut anybody deep.

611
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Double down.

612
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Double down.

613
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Double down.

614
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Should we bring Luke in?

615
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Yeah, let's get Luke back.

616
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
So he doesn't...

617
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Luke!

618
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
We got Luke a boy.

619
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I'm back.

620
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
They sent me outside.

621
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
How was it?

622
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
I watched TikTok videos.

623
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Yeah?

624
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
It was nice.

625
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Did you have a good time?

626
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Yeah, but I'm glad to be back.

627
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
Yeah, back in the hospital.

628
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Beep.

629
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Beep.

630
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
Beep.

631
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Oh, thank God he's alive and the camera zooms in

632
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,520
and sees that Julius Summers is out cold.

633
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
I'm just kidding.

634
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Do whatever you want.

635
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
It's zoomed in on the monitor, the heart monitor,

636
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,520
and it's going beep, beep, beep.

637
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Boop.

638
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
And then it pans over to Julius,

639
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
who has come to from his not very restful night of sleep,

640
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
and he's got to pee.

641
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
So he's disconnecting that shit.

642
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Okay, it's disconnected.

643
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
That's not what happens when you have to pee.

644
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
My heart stops and I have to pee.

645
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,520
Right, it's just disconnected because he's got to go pee.

646
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Go ahead and roll a con times five for me

647
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,520
and that'll see whether you get your natural healing

648
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,520
of one hit point back for the eve.

649
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
37 on a 50.

650
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
Nice.

651
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
So take one more hit point of health.

652
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
And what does that bring you up to?

653
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
Seven?

654
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Six.

655
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
Six?

656
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Lovely.

657
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Nurse comes in, puts your TV on,

658
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,520
and you see the same thing that Kurt showed you,

659
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
but it's all over the news.

660
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,520
And there's footage from all sorts of different angles,

661
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,520
but you do think that Kurt's footage might be the best

662
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
of anything that you're seeing flash before your eyes

663
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
on cable news here?

664
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Did it break on can?

665
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
Hard to remember.

666
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Don't really care.

667
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
How does it make you feel?

668
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Scared.

669
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
But you're okay.

670
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
You can handle it?

671
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
This?

672
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
This.

673
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
It's some sort of weather tornado they're saying.

674
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
Tornado lightning.

675
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
That's what they're saying?

676
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Yeah.

677
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Keep believing that.

678
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
I've got to pee.

679
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
That's what I'm here to help with.

680
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
I can handle it.

681
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,520
I can handle it too.

682
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Julius doesn't like this nurse and then looks to see,

683
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
does she have a badge on?

684
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
No, she doesn't work here.

685
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,520
It's just some wild person roaming the halls.

686
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,520
I hit the call a nurse button and then go pee real quick.

687
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
And I get back in bed and wait for the nurse.

688
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
When the nurse comes in, he's like, what's up?

689
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,520
There's some lady roaming the halls trying to scare people.

690
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Did you see this?

691
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
And he points up at the TV.

692
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
Oh, yeah, what's going to happen next?

693
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Global warming, right?

694
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Right.

695
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
So you think it's weather?

696
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Yeah, lightning tornado, is that what they're calling it?

697
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Yeah.

698
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,520
So watch the evening news tonight, just so you know.

699
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Anyway, how am I doing here?

700
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Yeah, I mean, everything looks fine.

701
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,520
You're going to be in pain for four to six weeks at least.

702
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
You're going to want to stay on the medicine for,

703
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,520
hopefully not too long, but you got to take it when you need it.

704
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Don't be a hero.

705
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,520
You'll have some serious pain in the face for a while.

706
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Yeah, I know what you mean.

707
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,520
But yeah, besides that, you should be fine.

708
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
No severe broken tissue.

709
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
You're going to look the same after a while.

710
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Thank you very much, and would like to be discharged, please.

711
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Do you need a wheelchair?

712
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Julius wants to send the nurse out while he gets dressed in his clothes and stuff.

713
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Sure.

714
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
But he also wants to search around for any sharp objects in the room.

715
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Oh, they don't like to keep those around in hospital rooms typically.

716
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Yeah, but how good are the doctors here?

717
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Not that great apparently.

718
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
So what are you looking for?

719
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Something to maybe try to cut part of my face off.

720
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Oh my God, dude. Fuck.

721
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Because the pee didn't take that long, but Julius staring into the mirror in the bathroom,

722
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
that was like a solid 10 minutes.

723
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,520
Roll luck 50-50.

724
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,520
You roll under 50, you find something sharp.

725
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Although I guess it should be the other way around.

726
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
I rolled under 50.

727
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
Okay.

728
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Yeah, you see there is a pair of shears, a pair of scissors that is in one of the cabinet drawers.

729
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,520
And it's the kind with the plastic grip. It's not super sharp scissors.

730
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Julius figures this is probably the best place to do this.

731
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,520
And he's going to go in the bathroom and try to poke the scissors right at his jaw.

732
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
Yeah.

733
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
And poke them through and try to cut.

734
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,520
He's not going to go full face, but he's going to see at least,

735
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,520
he's pretty sure underneath is like what he's actually supposed to be.

736
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,520
So he's just going to remove that first fake layer.

737
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
How much?

738
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,520
Like the right cheek.

739
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
The whole right cheek?

740
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Yeah.

741
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
Oh my God.

742
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
Okay, roll grip to go through with this.

743
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,520
I guess he doesn't have to poke through. He can just start at the corner of his mouth.

744
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,520
I'm going to make you roll grip to see if you can follow through with this. This is disgusting.

745
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
21 out of 25.

746
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Oh, yeah. No, you're not going to be able to do this.

747
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Oh, because I passed.

748
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Yeah, you passed.

749
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,520
As one half of the scissors is in my mouth and the other half is on the outside of my cheek,

750
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
I'm about to cut through.

751
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Nurse walks in and says, oh.

752
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Julius kind of like snaps and like shakes his head and just lets the nurse take the scissors.

753
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
And thank you. I guess I'll go.

754
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,520
And Julius wants to just kind of like go past the nurse and try to leave the hospital.

755
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:49,520
He fucking crit failed his grip check seeing you do that and just stands there, frozen,

756
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,520
staring at the most awful, confusing thing he's seen.

757
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
I mean, he just, you shininged him.

758
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,520
He like walked past the door and saw you in there with the scissors inside of your like skin and mouth.

759
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Like you were putting butter underneath the chicken skin on fucking Thanksgiving.

760
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Is he like completely blocking the doorway?

761
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
No, no, no, no. You just walk right past him.

762
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Yeah, I just kind of squeeze around him.

763
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,520
I pat him on the back and say, thanks.

764
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
And I look at his badge.

765
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Darren.

766
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Thanks, Darren. Thank you. Bye.

767
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,520
And I'm going to start heading towards the exit of the hospital and give Cal a call.

768
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
Yeah, absolutely.

769
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
And we'll bring those two back.

770
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Bird, bird time.

771
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
As I'm leaving the hospital, I call Cal.

772
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Yeah, let's get a little early morning pickup here from the Colorado home.

773
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
Yeah, you were in for a while.

774
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
You had a full rest.

775
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,520
I was watching the noon o'clock news, right?

776
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Yeah.

777
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
So we're talking noon thirty.

778
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
Oh, God.

779
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Oh, hello. Hello. Cal, Colorado. Good afternoon.

780
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Hey, Cal, it's Julius. I just got out of the hospital.

781
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Julius Summers. How are you?

782
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Well, they discharged me from the hospital and a clean bill of health.

783
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,520
I guess I wouldn't really go back to that hospital if I had the choice.

784
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Oh, which hospital?

785
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,520
It was St. Luke's Children's Hospital.

786
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,520
Well, now I've had several fine procedures at St. Luke's.

787
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,520
The procedures they gave me were all too small.

788
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,520
I'm sorry, I just woke up. I don't understand at all what you mean.

789
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Well, where should I go?

790
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Luke, what are your max hit points?

791
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Max is ten.

792
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Perfect. On a scale of one to ten, how would you say you feel?

793
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Oh, like twenty percent better.

794
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
I'm sixty right now.

795
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,520
Okay. Well, you know, we all had a rough night. I feel like I'm about a sixty-two.

796
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Curious. Cal and Beck, are the two of you down any hit points?

797
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Oh, yeah.

798
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Okay, so you can actually roll a constitution check to regain a hit point of natural healing with overnight sleep.

799
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,520
I don't have Cal as having lost any hit points.

800
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
That makes sense to me.

801
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
I did not pass my con check.

802
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
Bummer.

803
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Bummer.

804
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,520
He slept on the shitty basement couch where God was supposed to be.

805
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
That's unsettling.

806
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,520
God fucked it up in the escape, so it's all... your back is just, like, shitty this morning.

807
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Should I come over or go to work? What happened?

808
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Wow, Julius, I'm still kind of coming around here.

809
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Why don't you head over, I'll put some coffee on, and we'll all discuss our next steps around the dinner table. How does that sound?

810
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Great, I'll jog over.

811
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
He's got to exercise.

812
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
Yeah, that's close.

813
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Beck, what's the wake up situation?

814
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,520
I wouldn't wake up unless you did something to wake me up.

815
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Oh, yeah, remember the intro scene to Beck Wilder.

816
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Face down, tighty whities up, that's the way he likes to sleep in.

817
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Cal doesn't do anything in particular, but he is loudly whistling, and at a few points, like, definitely running from room to room as he grabs different things,

818
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:02,520
and he's kind of excited and preparing, like, yeah, we're going to have coffee and then we're going to plan our Pulitzer Day, part two.

819
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:10,520
So, yeah, you would hear him running up and down stairs and stuff, and he's a big enough guy that it's booming through the house.

820
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
You hear one stir from the couch.

821
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,520
No, mom, I don't want to walk a dog. It's not my dog.

822
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Oh!

823
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:27,520
You hear the, like, the basement door creak open, and Cal peeks his head and he says, Beck, Beck, good morning.

824
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,520
Coffee's on in five. Get on up here.

825
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
Get on up here.

826
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
Yeah, okay, I'll be right up.

827
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
We've got to find Stevie and God.

828
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Yeah, big day.

829
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
Julius is coming over.

830
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Is he all right?

831
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Oh, uh, 60 percent?

832
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
All right, good enough.

833
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
That's what I said.

834
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
All right, I'll be up in a sec.

835
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Nothing some coffee can't fix.

836
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Julius opens the front door, a little sweaty.

837
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,520
Who the fuck is that?

838
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
Got any water?

839
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Oh, he's got some very well-made lattes, each with a little, like, news van in it.

840
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
He's like, oh, yeah, yeah.

841
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Those are great.

842
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
You can have some water.

843
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Julius takes one and then sips it and has a little milk froth mustache.

844
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
I saw the news broke. I saw God on TV.

845
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
Cal drops the tray.

846
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
What do you mean our news broke?

847
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,520
I turn it to can on his TV, and magically that is on.

848
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
You can do magic?

849
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
That story is...

850
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
I turn the TV on and it's like they're interested.

851
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,520
You turn the TV on and it's in Cal, Colorado's house, so it's on can.

852
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,520
And can is currently covering this exclusively.

853
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,520
They're just about to intro the whole story on can, so it's perfect timing.

854
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Becca's walking up now, up to the back of the couch, into frame.

855
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,520
They're running. What are they running? They're running.

856
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Is it ours?

857
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,520
It's Daddy's. Kurt's. Kurt's footage.

858
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Okay, with our pickup from last night?

859
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
Would you have been able to send that in?

860
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
Yeah, we sent that in, Link.

861
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
I think you have to take it to the station.

862
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,520
The rules of the universe, as we've established, seems like we would have to take it.

863
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:01,520
I figured we'd run it as an evening news segment, but that was breaking news because people know about it.

864
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,520
People saw it, as far as the logistics of Julius' thoughts went.

865
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,520
When Kurt's footage ends, you see the can studio.

866
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Isabella Kaya back with this absolutely staggering story here on City Action News.

867
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,520
I mean, for those of us watching at home who have never seen Lightning Tornado before,

868
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:33,520
it can be scary, but I'm being told from those scientists who we love listening to here at can

869
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,520
that there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of.

870
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Isabella Kaya, City Action News.

871
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,520
Kaya was like, didn't they see our footage?

872
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,520
It's not a lightning tornado, it's God! That's God, you idiots!

873
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Everybody at the hospital just thought it was a lightning tornado.

874
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
That's stupid!

875
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
It's what they're telling him.

876
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Wait, maybe we could spin this as a positive. Now we'll be able to answer all the questions.

877
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Instinctively, Beckwilder reaches his hand in his pocket for the thumb drive that he copied all the footage onto,

878
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,520
and he flashbacks to the moment that Vivica-

879
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
Put that kick me sign on me.

880
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Put that kick me sign on you.

881
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
She stole it.

882
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,520
And you reach the bottom of your pocket and your heart sinks.

883
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Beck, what's wrong?

884
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,520
You're right, Beck. We can just say teasers that's like the crazy tornado that happened.

885
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,520
We'll just tune into can and we'll tell you what it's all about.

886
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Beck, what's wrong?

887
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Let's get that footage over to the station.

888
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
Look at his face, Julius.

889
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Yeah, the footage, it's on the thumb drive. Remember the thumb drive?

890
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Yeah.

891
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,520
And I put it into this pocket and that pocket is empty.

892
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Check your other pocket.

893
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I check another pocket, and I check another pocket.

894
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Check.

895
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
And I check another pocket, and I check another pocket.

896
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Your coat.

897
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
And I check another pocket.

898
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Check the fucking camera, Beck. Check the can van.

899
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Yeah, Vivian took the drive. She had to have.

900
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Vivica, she had to have.

901
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
When would Vivica have taken the drive?

902
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,520
When she put that hilarious sign on his back.

903
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Oh, we've got to find Vivica.

904
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,520
We've got to find Vivica, we've got to find Stevie, we've got to find our footage.

905
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,520
All we have is your TikToks, Julius.

906
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Julius, like, kind of perks up and then goes to post another TikTok.

907
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
I posted the Jackalope one yesterday.

908
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Yep.

909
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Guys, which one should I do?

910
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
I don't know what you have.

911
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Didn't we have footage of the medical device, maybe? Was that something?

912
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Yeah, I'll do that, of them healing up your wound.

913
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Yeah.

914
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,520
He posts that.

915
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
Do that.

916
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,520
And while it's doing it, he puts, like, the sound that would be in a St. Jude's commercial,

917
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,520
he puts that in the background as the sound and uploads it.

918
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Good edit.

919
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
We've got to find Vivica.

920
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
We've got to find Stevie and God.

921
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,520
We've got to find out what the fuck is going on at Cannes and where our footage is.

922
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
I'm going to call Cannes.

923
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Bec, do you feel comfortable?

924
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
Can you hunt down Vivica?

925
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,520
Yeah.

926
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
Do you know her?

927
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
Of course. I've got to get my footage back, dude.

928
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
You don't think she got rid of it, right?

929
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,520
Julius, can you get a hold of your uncle or go to his home?

930
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
I call Tyfe.

931
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Boing, boing.

932
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
Boing, boing.

933
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Boing, boing.

934
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Boing, boing.

935
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Julius.

936
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Uncle.

937
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
My guy.

938
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Uncle Tyfe.

939
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
We've got good news.

940
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
Yeah? Well, I am, like-

941
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Well, and bad news.

942
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
Tell him we've got questions.

943
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
What are you doing? Why weren't you answering my calls yesterday?

944
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,520
I'm fucking hungry for good news.

945
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,520
You're going to give me some good news? I love that.

946
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,520
We've got crazy footage, but we lost it.

947
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,520
Well, like I said, we hungry.

948
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,520
All right, tell me about this footage.

949
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Grover's Gorge. Have you heard of it?

950
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Forget about it. Cut. What are you talking about?

951
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,520
We followed that anonymous tip and it led us to Grover's Gorge,

952
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,520
which is a hidden utopia that's ran by the-

953
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Dystopia.

954
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
The Godel company.

955
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,520
It's a utopia?

956
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
It's run by the Godel company?

957
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
That's amazing.

958
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
It's nice, but it's bad.

959
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,520
It was an anonymous tip? What was it?

960
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
It was just a pin in the middle of nowhere.

961
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Just a pin? Who was assigning all the-

962
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,520
I mean, I assume it was Isabella who assigned you all the stories?

963
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
She did a bang up job. She's good.

964
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
She's all right. She's the best.

965
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,520
Well, we've got to find Vivica. Are you at work?

966
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,520
Yeah, I'm in the office.

967
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Is Vivica there?

968
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
I don't know. I'm upstairs.

969
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Can you check?

970
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Let me slack her real quick.

971
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Oh, it says she's working from home.

972
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
Did you-

973
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,520
I get on the slack channel and add Vivica?

974
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
What's up?

975
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
Oh, no buy? No buy for your uncle?

976
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,520
I am doing that with him still on the phone.

977
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Uncle type, yeah.

978
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,520
When I talk to Vivica, we'll bring you the footage and show it to you, but it's big.

979
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Well, if it makes the Godel company look great, that's fantastic, you know?

980
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
They were really haranguing us about that last story.

981
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,520
It got crazy there, but you know, this is going to be great.

982
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Good job, Julius.

983
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Oh, you're going to be on top so soon if you keep it up like this, my guy.

984
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Are you working all week?

985
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
You're taking a vacation this week, right?

986
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
What?

987
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
I thought you told me.

988
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
You're taking the week off.

989
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,520
No, just a day.

990
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,520
Just a day.

991
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Had a meeting down at the city, city tower.

992
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Well, you sound like you could get some rest.

993
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Whoa, is that a burn?

994
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
Is that a sick burn?

995
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Did I get got?

996
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
I don't know.

997
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
I'll talk to you later.

998
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
I've got to find Vivica.

999
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Bye.

1000
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Beep.

1001
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,520
I couldn't help but hear like some of that over the receiver.

1002
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Guys, we can't show my uncle the footage.

1003
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,520
He said as long as it makes the Godel company look good, then he'll be happy.

1004
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
We can't show it to him.

1005
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
We've got to find a way to run it without it going past him.

1006
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,520
He said only good news for the Godel...

1007
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Fuck.

1008
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
He said...

1009
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
He threatened you?

1010
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,520
He said only good news for the Godel company.

1011
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
I mean, he didn't threaten me, but...

1012
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
He threatened the truth.

1013
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
He threatened the news.

1014
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Basically, yeah.

1015
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,520
I mean, has my uncle always been like this?

1016
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Not in my experience.

1017
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Julius, I haven't felt like this since 1983.

1018
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
What happened in 1983?

1019
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,520
That was a personal matter.

1020
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,520
But it is the closest to truth and justice I've ever truly come.

1021
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,520
And you see a flashback to Cal spending a summer following his brother around

1022
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:09,520
and catching him in this elaborate lie about a Christmas gift.

1023
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,520
Beck, do you know where Vivica lives?

1024
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,520
You've worked with her closely for so long.

1025
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,520
Yeah, I know the neighborhood.

1026
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,520
I dropped her off two or three times over the years.

1027
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
I think I could find it.

1028
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Roll intelligence.

1029
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,520
Oh my God, it's a 70 on a 70.

1030
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Yeah.

1031
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Ooh!

1032
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Our smiles.

1033
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Good boy.

1034
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Yeah, I know exactly.

1035
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
I could take you right there.

1036
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
Yeah.

1037
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Totally, dude.

1038
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
I think we've got to go get this shit from Vivica.

1039
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
We've got to get our fucking footage.

1040
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
We've got to get the footage.

1041
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Vivica has our Pulitzer.

1042
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,520
I didn't go through all of that shit just to get the footage stolen by some fucking

1043
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
editor.

1044
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Vivica's good, though.

1045
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Vivica's good, though.

1046
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,520
Maybe she just is doing touch-ups at home and forgot to-

1047
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
You saw her face yesterday, Beck.

1048
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
She's not just doing touch-ups.

1049
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
That footage is in danger.

1050
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
We've got to get to her, guys.

1051
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,520
Vivica taught us an important lesson, which is that this footage is more powerful than

1052
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
even we suspected.

1053
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,520
We know we've got something here, but we need to be a little more careful with it,

1054
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,520
and to that end, we have to secure it immediately.

1055
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Guys, we've got to get this footage from Vivica.

1056
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,520
Vivica, if the news is like music, these pieces are The Beatles.

1057
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
That's what I've always said, dude.

1058
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,520
Yeah.

1059
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,520
The Beatles were very popular when I was a schoolboy, and-

1060
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,520
They're still popular.

1061
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,520
I just want to say I resented them at the time, but I do understand their appeal.

1062
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
Let's go, boys.

1063
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,520
I met them once.

1064
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,520
You can tell us about it on the way there, Cal.

1065
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,520
I figure that's what he says as we're walking out the door.

1066
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Cal, you never told me.

1067
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,520
You met the fucking Beatles, dude?

1068
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,520
That's the coolest fucking shit I've ever heard.

1069
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,520
As we're walking out, Cal points to several pictures, like three pictures with the Beatles

1070
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,520
at different stages of their career when he's a kid, and then finally in their 70s crazy

1071
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,520
phase, one is him as a teenager reporter, and then multiple pictures of him with John

1072
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Lennon up to a point, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and he shows you some extensive

1073
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,520
correspondence with Ringo.

1074
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
You got this last one in under the wire.

1075
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,520
He stopped taking mail, famously stopped taking mail recently.

1076
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
Not for friends.

1077
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Nice.

1078
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,520
We play chess by mail.

1079
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Across the pond, it takes forever.

1080
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Why are we wasting time?

1081
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
Get in the van.

1082
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Get in the van.

1083
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
No, wait.

1084
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
Who else?

1085
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,520
Beck, you've never shown any interest in my pictures before now.

1086
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,520
I had never noticed that that was George Harrison there that you're sitting on the bench with.

1087
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
Who else haunts these halls?

1088
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
I'm kidding.

1089
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
I figured this was happening in the van.

1090
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Definitely happening in the van.

1091
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
Is it that one?

1092
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,520
There it is right there.

1093
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,520
The van is lined with pictures too.

1094
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,520
Some of the choicer ones.

1095
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,520
Vivica has a pretty cool place above a bodega on the corner.

1096
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,520
A bodega?

1097
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,520
I thought you said bodega, which would be really fun.

1098
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,520
She lives above a place called Bodega.

1099
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,520
They sell bidets and bagels.

1100
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
Bodega.

1101
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,520
The sign has the water shooting through a doughnut, a bagel hole.

1102
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:39,520
It is also just a standard bodega with a cat, but it's also bodega.

1103
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
It's bodega.

1104
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,520
No, it's clearly not.

1105
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,520
Julius really wants to stop in, but knows that there's no time.

1106
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,520
Yeah, and her door is just off to the side.

1107
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,520
Beck, you would know that when you open up the door, it just immediately stares on the other side,

1108
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,520
so you'd have to buzz up, but the last time you were here, the buzzer didn't work.

1109
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,520
Now I'm just picturing your old apartment.

1110
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,520
They have to run down and meet us?

1111
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,520
Well, we hit the buzzer.

1112
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,520
It is July 6th. It's about 1pm.

1113
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,520
It's a hot day. The sun is shining down.

1114
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,520
It's a Wednesday. Less kids on the street than usual, and the ones that you do see, you're like,

1115
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,520
It's Wednesday.

1116
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,520
There's the urchins.

1117
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,520
Cal remembers, and it's weird that he and Beck didn't remember before now,

1118
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,520
but he remembers that they successfully downloaded the Ring app,

1119
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,520
and that it'll have all the footage from last night.

1120
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
Oh yeah.

1121
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,520
Oh yeah.

1122
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,520
Hold on, boys. Before we go in, let's take a moment to watch what came in and out of the front door last night.

1123
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
Of here?

1124
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,520
No, of my place. Remember how God and Stevie escaped?

1125
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,520
Yeah, you guys haven't talked about that much.

1126
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,520
Well, you know, we went to the bridge last night, and then we slept in, and it was at a chance since then.

1127
00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:00,520
Yeah, I mean, I figured when I saw Kurt's footage that, I mean, I knew that Stevie and God weren't gonna be at your apartment anymore.

1128
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,520
So what, did you find anything?

1129
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,520
God is everywhere, Julius.

1130
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,520
Did you find anything?

1131
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,520
We found evidence that Stevie may have let Fox out of his bindings.

1132
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:17,520
And so we went and just, like, did a cursory check at the bridge, but we were both beat, so we didn't get much there.

1133
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,520
But then I realized that maybe Cal has security cameras, and sure enough, he does.

1134
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,520
So I downloaded the app last night, and I didn't get a chance to look at it.

1135
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,520
Let's watch it.

1136
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
That is a wild sound.

1137
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,520
Yeah, there's a bunch of owls going crazy outside.

1138
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,520
Is that what that is?

1139
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
Yeah, take your headphone out.

1140
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,520
They're like, shut up, Zach's listening now.

1141
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,520
I thought somebody's, like, phone or something.

1142
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,520
Yeah, I thought it was his phone.

1143
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
That was nuts.

1144
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,520
What were we doing? Oh, yeah.

1145
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
The app.

1146
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,520
The app, I downloaded the app.

1147
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,520
Yeah, the Ring app.

1148
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Let's see what happened.

1149
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
For just $4.99 a month, you can subscribe to Ring.

1150
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
In grainy black and white.

1151
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,520
Get the premium.

1152
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,520
No, it's a Ring camera, it's not grainy black and white for sure.

1153
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,520
Oh, but it's nighttime.

1154
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,520
It's a Ring camera, which is a high quality camera.

1155
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
Yeah, but it's nighttime.

1156
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,520
It's the only camera I would buy to secure my house.

1157
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Where can you pick one up?

1158
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,520
Amazon is where I got mine. You can get them directly from Ring.com.

1159
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,520
We're not allowed to have separate deals, you rat.

1160
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,520
So what do we see in, like, the...

1161
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,520
So hit those show notes for a link to the Ring camera.

1162
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,520
They're both in on it.

1163
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Available at Target.

1164
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Thank you.

1165
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,520
We see high quality black and white.

1166
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Yeah, because it's nighttime.

1167
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
Yeah, but it's high quality, it's not grainy.

1168
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
Because it's Ring camera at Ring.com.

1169
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,520
While Beck is pulling up the footage, I'm ordering a bedagel.

1170
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,520
Wow, that app looks so user friendly.

1171
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,520
With just a few simple tabs, I can see who's at the front door.

1172
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,520
Let's tab away.

1173
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,520
Yes, one plain bagel please and one everything bidet.

1174
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:12,520
Suddenly, you see Stevie walk out the front door, followed by Greg Godle.

1175
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,520
She holds the door open as Greg passes her and heads down to the front yard.

1176
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,520
Stevie closes the door, notices the Ring camera.

1177
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,520
Oh.

1178
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,520
Everyone roll humit.

1179
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,520
I thought she was here and I was like, I don't know why she's here, but I'm excited.

1180
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,520
Oh my god, that's why you were waving?

1181
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,520
I was going to offer her a bagel.

1182
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,520
Oh my god.

1183
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,520
What am I rolling?

1184
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,520
Humid.

1185
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,520
I passed 24 on 70.

1186
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,520
I failed a 93 on a 40.

1187
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,520
Yeah, Cal fails.

1188
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
I also got a 93.

1189
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Ooh, spooky.

1190
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Cal's looking at all the features of his everything bidet on the box.

1191
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
Cover your ears real quick, Thomas and Joe.

1192
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,520
Luke, something in their face.

1193
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,520
When Stevie turns back, you see Shane.

1194
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,520
So like I can tell from the footage it doesn't look like she's doing it completely against her will.

1195
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,520
That's right.

1196
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
That's exactly right.

1197
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,520
And you two see the face of Stevie turn back.

1198
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,520
They look at the camera and they turn back away and head off into the street.

1199
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:17,520
The Ring camera footage is so high quality you can see the shame on Stevie's face.

1200
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,520
I'm sorry.

1201
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
I wasn't getting that from this footage.

1202
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,520
What did you see?

1203
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,520
Look.

1204
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,520
Rewind it.

1205
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,520
Look.

1206
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,520
She's not making her do it.

1207
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,520
She's doing it on her own but she knows.

1208
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,520
Look.

1209
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,520
She sees it right there.

1210
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,520
She sees the camera.

1211
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
She just looks ashamed.

1212
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,520
I think she looks gassy.

1213
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,520
I mean, could be.

1214
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,520
Shame gas.

1215
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,520
But I mean, Godel's not forcing her to do this.

1216
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
It is her brother after all.

1217
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,520
I mean, she was pretty forward with the idea that she was trying to help him.

1218
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,520
Maybe this isn't all bad.

1219
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,520
Maybe he talked her into this but she has a plan.

1220
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,520
She wouldn't let him jump off of something.

1221
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,520
She doesn't want her brother to die.

1222
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,520
Could she stop him?

1223
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,520
Yeah.

1224
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,520
Even if she was on the way to somewhere she thought might help.

1225
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,520
She's Trixie.

1226
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,520
She might have something up her sleeve.

1227
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,520
No, she's Stevie.

1228
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,520
Oh, shit.

1229
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,520
Trixie was kind of the burnout in turn.

1230
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,520
The one with the vape pen.

1231
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,520
I assume the buzzer.

1232
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,520
Guys, I don't think the buzzer's working here.

1233
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,520
We gotta find Vivica.

1234
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
We gotta find Stevie.

1235
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,520
Her window's that one.

1236
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
Hang on a sec.

1237
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
And I'm trying to find a pebble to throw at the window.

1238
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,520
Oh, yeah.

1239
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,520
There's plenty of pebbles.

1240
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,520
Tink.

1241
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,520
Vivica!

1242
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,520
Vivica, it's back!

1243
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,520
Vivica!

1244
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,520
Is the door that leads up to the stairs a wooden door or a glass door?

1245
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,520
What was it, Joe?

1246
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,520
It was a glass door.

1247
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,520
No, it wasn't.

1248
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,520
If you're talking about my old apartment, it had a glass pane that you could see through.

1249
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,520
On the outside it did.

1250
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,520
Yeah, like the downstairs one.

1251
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,520
What?

1252
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,520
How tall?

1253
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,520
You could see into the stairwell.

1254
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,520
It had lettering on the window up to my apartment you could see through.

1255
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,520
Interesting.

1256
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,520
It said, Joe Terry, private eye.

1257
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,520
Very much like that.

1258
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
Dangerous dames turn around.

1259
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,520
He had legs.

1260
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
Two of them.

1261
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,520
Guys, watch out.

1262
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,520
They were walking all over me.

1263
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,520
He could see through me like the glass door at the bottom of my apartment stairs.

1264
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,520
Joe's apartment.

1265
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,520
So yeah, you can kind of see, you can see the top of the stairs kind of through the glass,

1266
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,520
but then there's the rest of the door is composite.

1267
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,520
Guys, we gotta get in there.

1268
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:26,520
And he hikes up his fancy work shorts and is going to try to kick this door in down.

1269
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,520
I'm normally not a fan of property damage, but we don't know that our coworker is safe

1270
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
right now.

1271
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,520
Got those big powerful legs.

1272
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,520
We should use them.

1273
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,520
At the exact moment that you rear back on one of your enormous thighs, one of the...

1274
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,520
Rear back on like he rocks the floor.

1275
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,520
Yeah.

1276
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,520
Eat some fucking spinach and one of them gets like Popeye-age.

1277
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,520
One of the botanical employees walks out and goes to light a cigarette and as they're

1278
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:59,520
about to light up, they look over at you as your leg is like up in the air about to kick

1279
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
and their mouth just kind of drops.

1280
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,520
But the cigarette sticks to their lip because it was dry.

1281
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:15,520
Julia says, watch this and kicks.

1282
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Wow.

1283
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:22,520
A plus 20 on strength or criminology, whichever one's higher.

1284
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Strength or criminology?

1285
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,520
Yeah.

1286
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,520
Let's see.

1287
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,520
I don't think I have any criminology.

1288
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,520
Nope.

1289
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Okay.

1290
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,520
Let's see.

1291
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,520
Up and down.

1292
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,520
50-50.

1293
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,520
With a plus 20 because...

1294
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,520
Okay.

1295
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,520
12 on a 70 then.

1296
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,520
Oh.

1297
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,520
Oh.

1298
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,520
Oh.

1299
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,520
Rocking.

1300
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,520
Little did Julius know the door was just a little bit ajar.

1301
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,520
So when he kicks it, it kicks hard and like smashes into the wall.

1302
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,520
It looks like he kicked it open, like forced it open, but it was just gonna happen anyway.

1303
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,520
Whoa.

1304
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,520
Dude.

1305
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
What the fuck?

1306
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,520
Cal Colorado City Action News, step aside.

1307
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,520
No persuing.

1308
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,520
That's hilarious.

1309
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,520
Did he roll the crit fail?

1310
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,520
29.

1311
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,520
I pass.

1312
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:14,520
The cigarette trembling, still stuck on his lip as he just like quivers and backs up.

1313
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,520
And he's just like going to light his cigarette in front of him, but the cigarette's not there

1314
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,520
as he just kind of backs away.

1315
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,520
Cal pushes everybody through and after they're up the stairs, I turn around and I'm like,

1316
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,520
don't hassle my people again.

1317
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,520
He goes, yes, sir.

1318
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,520
Good boy.

1319
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,520
Which apartment is hers?

1320
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,520
I don't know.

1321
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,520
Kick down all the doors.

1322
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,520
We do know, right?

1323
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,520
Yes, Beck Wilder does know.

1324
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,520
I mean, in the fiction, I said I dropped her off.

1325
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,520
But you said that's her window.

1326
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,520
You did point at her window, you creep.

1327
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
Okay, yeah.

1328
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,520
It would be this one back here.

1329
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,520
That's my favorite rock.

1330
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,520
In the fiction, I said I dropped her off.

1331
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:00,520
I didn't tell you that I'd gone around the back and know exactly where she lives.

1332
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:06,520
I actually rented a place across the street with a good view.

1333
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:11,520
Let me see, if I'm parked over there, then that would make it...

1334
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,520
Is it this one?

1335
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,520
And there's a doormat that just says Vivica on it.

1336
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,520
Welcome to Vivica's place, the editor.

1337
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,520
Julius wants to knock very aggressively on the door.

1338
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,520
Vivica, give us our shit back!

1339
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,520
Vivica?

1340
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,520
Cowcall her out of here with Beck and Julius.

1341
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,520
Hey, I'm here. I'm here.

1342
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,520
We just want to talk.

1343
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,520
Zach leaned away from the mic.

1344
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,520
He's not gonna...

1345
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,520
Yeah, like a toddler refusing to be fed.

1346
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,520
Julius is gonna...

1347
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,520
Go away!

1348
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,520
Okay.

1349
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,520
Wink.

1350
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,520
You should open the door, though, for the next people to come in.

1351
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,520
Great idea.

1352
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,520
We'll get plumber's jumpsuits.

1353
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,520
And fake mustaches.

1354
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
Vivica, it's back.

1355
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,520
Look, I know that you think you're maybe doing something good, and maybe you are.

1356
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Hey, are you just in there editing the footage with another pass like we talked about, maybe?

1357
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,520
We just realized that the footage wasn't on us, and we figured maybe you had it,

1358
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,520
and we want to make sure that we get backups.

1359
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,520
Vivica, I haven't felt this way about a story in nearly 30 years,

1360
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,520
and I think that caused me to be fairly short-sighted about showing you what was really on there.

1361
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,520
So I want to say, I'm sorry. We're sorry.

1362
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,520
We're really sorry, Vivica.

1363
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,520
Would you let us in to talk about it?

1364
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,520
The door opens.

1365
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,520
Vivica stands in front of you, eyes red.

1366
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,520
She has been through hell since the last time you saw her,

1367
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,520
and she is trying so hard not to burst into tears again.

1368
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,520
I was going to delete the...

1369
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,520
I was going to delete...

1370
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:07,520
I took the thumb drive, I'm sure that you yelled, I understand.

1371
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,520
It was pretty funny, the sign.

1372
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
I was going to... which sign?

1373
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,520
Kick me?

1374
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,520
She laughs a little bit.

1375
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,520
There's the Vivica we all know.

1376
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
Okay, yeah, thank you.

1377
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,520
So I had a plan. I was going to take the footage, I was going to bring it back here,

1378
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,520
I was going to figure out what to do with it, I was going to talk to people,

1379
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,520
I was going to figure it out, I was going to talk to people,

1380
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,520
I was going to let you in on it too, but we were high energy

1381
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,520
and you guys seemed so gung-ho about getting it out

1382
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,520
and I didn't want to get it out because I'm scared to get it out

1383
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,520
because it's scary and terrifying and I needed to tell somebody else

1384
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,520
and I needed to get somebody else's opinion.

1385
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:46,520
So I decided to go wait and hide in the parking lot until after you all left

1386
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:50,520
and then I went back into the building and I was going to go delete all the footage.

1387
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,520
I wasn't going to delete it, but I was going to bring it back here

1388
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,520
and I was always going to have the edit, but wait, let me fucking finish.

1389
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:01,520
Cops came and they took it. The cops fucking took it all.

1390
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,520
Why? They weren't even in uniform, they just came in and they took it

1391
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,520
and where were you? You weren't there. No one was there.

1392
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,520
And I couldn't do anything.

1393
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,520
Did they take the thumb drive?

1394
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,520
Yeah.

1395
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,520
Can I hear a bit of that?

1396
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,520
Yawn.

1397
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,520
Yawning.

1398
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,520
Yeah, yeah.

1399
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1400
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,520
Can I hear a bit of that?

1401
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,520
Zach doesn't seem like he's taking this very seriously.

1402
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,520
Better throw out a yawn.

1403
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,520
Great, great show.

1404
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,520
Yeah, good stuff, Zach.

1405
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,520
This is great, this is great.

1406
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,520
This is not like it when I yell at him.

1407
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,520
It's late, I'm sleepy.

1408
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,520
I thought it was fun when you yelled at me.

1409
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,520
I just thought you sounded insincere when you said that last thing,

1410
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,520
so I want to be human.

1411
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,520
I don't remember what it was, but what did you roll?

1412
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,520
It was about them taking the thumb drive.

1413
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,520
Oh, the thumb drive.

1414
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,520
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

1415
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,520
Ooh, 24, a pass.

1416
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,520
Yeah, no, she seems sincere.

1417
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,520
You said they weren't in uniform, how do you know they were cops?

1418
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,520
Came out of a cop car, went back into a cop car, showed me a badge, had guns.

1419
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,520
Not nice.

1420
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,520
Did you see a name?

1421
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,520
It oinks like a pig.

1422
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,520
Were the badges City Police Department?

1423
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,520
Yeah.

1424
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,520
I'm looking at the other guys, why would the police even know about it,

1425
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,520
let alone want to come and get it?

1426
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,520
Why would they want the footage like that?

1427
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,520
Do you have a ring camera?

1428
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,520
They got it from the...

1429
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,520
At the office?

1430
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,520
At the office, not here.

1431
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,520
Does the office have a ring camera?

1432
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
I'd assume the office has...

1433
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,520
A lot of cameras.

1434
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,520
We can see if these guys are real cops, what kind of car they pulled up in.

1435
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,520
So Vivica, you're saying though that at the end of the day,

1436
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,520
you don't have any of the footage at all?

1437
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,520
You weren't able to maybe sneak some?

1438
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,520
Maybe pulled out a hard drive or...

1439
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,520
Just a sneaky little...

1440
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,520
Her eyes go like blank.

1441
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,520
I'm talking like my good friend, Ringo.

1442
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,520
I tried to sneak some, but no, I didn't get any of them.

1443
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,520
Sounds like it could be God all demons we're working with.

1444
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,520
God all demons?

1445
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,520
God turtle?

1446
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,520
Yeah, like people, you know, God all sending people out to grab the stuff.

1447
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,520
Maybe not actual demons, but who knows?

1448
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,520
Let's go look at that footage and we've got to find...

1449
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,520
We've got to find it.

1450
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,520
We can't let them have it.

1451
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,520
Cal has had like kind of an unworried little smirk on his face this whole time.

1452
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,520
Guys, I'm sorry here, but it's in the hands of the police.

1453
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,520
It's perfectly safe.

1454
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:39,520
It's perfectly safe.

1455
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,520
Cops like me.

1456
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:47,520
Yucky ducky.

1457
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,520
Cal answers the phone and you hear explosions and like screams in the background.

1458
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,520
And he's like, Oh God, Julius, think, think, fuck, you're out of the hospital.

1459
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,520
We got a big situation going on here with Stevie and God.

1460
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,520
Got to go.

1461
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,520
Peep.

1462
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,520
What do you do?

1463
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,520
Cal's call.

1464
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,520
You get like, you see a call coming back like Cal, Colorado.

1465
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,520
I answer it.

1466
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,520
I'm sorry.

1467
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,520
I forgot to tell you.

1468
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,520
I'm dropping a pin.

1469
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,520
I know how to do that now.

1470
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,520
Click.

1471
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,520
I wait for the pin and how far away is it?

1472
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,520
How far away is the pin?

1473
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,520
Like how far from the hospital is his apartment?

1474
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,520
He gave me until noon to imagine what Cal, Colorado had gotten up to with his day.

1475
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,520
Oh.

1476
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,520
And I imagined we got another pic of it.

1477
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,520
I thought it was real.

1478
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,520
Yeah, it was all nonsense.

1479
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,520
He's been asleep.

1480
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
You wake him up.

1481
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,520
Yeah, I think that's fair.

1482
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:50,520
So you would have the footage on the drives that the camera records the footage onto the drives.

1483
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,520
And then you take the drives to work, load them onto the computer.

1484
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,520
You tell me how to do my job?

1485
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,520
Cause my life is great.

1486
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,520
Oh, that reminds me.

1487
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,520
I already backed it up to the cloud.

1488
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,520
We're good.

1489
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,520
Oh, sweet.

1490
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,520
I'm going to make pancakes.

1491
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,520
Cool.

1492
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,520
As you pull out your phone and look at the cloud and it's like...

1493
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,520
It's raining.

1494
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,520
Oh, it's not there.

1495
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,520
Well, that's so weird.

1496
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,520
No, no, no, Zach.

1497
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,520
I'm sorry.

1498
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,520
The end of music episode already started playing.

1499
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,520
We are not there yet.

1500
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,520
End of music episode.

1501
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,520
The day the music died.

1502
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,520
The end of music episode.

1503
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,520
Yeah, that is some fucking dark ass shit.

1504
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:39,520
And then Cthulhu comes out and he steals music.

1505
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,520
Do you want to sing a sad song about it?

1506
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,520
You can't, nerd.

1507
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,520
Cut to a child's birthday party.

1508
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,520
Happy birthday to you.

1509
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,520
Happy birthday to you.

1510
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,520
You're putting too much stank on it.

1511
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,520
It's still like a third of a song.

1512
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:59,520
Putting too much stank on it is my Spotify party playlist.

1513
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:06,520
In the morning, Thomas was putting too much stank on it.

1514
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,520
It's How Far is Heaven a hundred times.

1515
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,520
Julius runs back down and sticks his head out and says,

1516
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:32,520
put that on your bagel and smear it and then runs back up.

1517
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,520
And he's like, Julius is like, fucking nailed it, yes.

1518
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,520
And it's all my fault.
