1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
We're probably going to need a content warning on this episode.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,760
Because I'm sitting here and I'm like, I don't like being here.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,240
Julius looks at...

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,040
Content warning, not fun.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,040
This one?

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,040
Not so fun.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,040
Not fun, man.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,160
Let's go to an ad.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
It's...

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
Wait, we're gonna...

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
Do we do an ad?

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
We're gonna go to an ad?

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
We do an ad?

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
We're gonna go to an ad.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,160
An ad.

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,840
Hey, listeners!

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,880
And Joe and Thomas and Luke, I got some questions for you.

18
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,600
You need to go back, that automatically indicates the first bit I had.

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
What?

20
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,640
It's the start of your day peaceful...

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
What?

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
Hey, listeners.

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,440
Oh, are we the listeners?

24
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Got it.

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
Fucking nailed it.

26
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
So good.

27
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,760
I got some questions for you.

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,240
Luke, is the start of your day peaceful?

29
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
No.

30
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,040
Are you tired of being scared awake by your alarm every day, Joe?

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,960
It's like waking up to a jump scare every morning.

32
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,400
Do you wake up feeling groggy as hell, Thomas?

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Yeah.

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,440
Are you losing out on precious sleep because of your partner's different schedule?

35
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
Yeah, my freaking partner.

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Not anymore.

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,680
Either way, I am.

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,200
That's why I must tell you about the hero of my morning, silent wake up.

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Silent wake up?

40
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Silent wake up?

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,680
I've heard of an angel of the morning, but a hero of the morning?

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,400
A hero of the morning.

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,700
What is silent wake up?

44
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,480
It's the having a sandwich for breakfast of the alarm clock game.

45
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
It is...

46
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Is that in the copy?

47
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
No, it isn't.

48
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
You just gave him something free.

49
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
I don't know if you should say that.

50
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,280
Well, I don't know if it's good.

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Having a sandwich is the best meal you can have, so having it in the morning...

52
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
That's not true.

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,760
I mean, I do like the...

54
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,520
Well, wrong.

55
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,520
The wearable alarm that gradually wakes you up using soothing vibrations and silent wake

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,600
up.

57
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Sound alarms instantly wake you up by spiking your adrenaline and blood pressure, causing...

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, that's sound...

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay, that's sound alarms.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Because I was like, that sounds bad.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't want that.

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That is not this product.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,920
That's like eating a turd sandwich for breakfast of the morning.

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Yes.

65
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Exactly.

66
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,680
That solution slowly transitions you from a deep to light sleep over 10 minutes before

67
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,960
gently awakening you.

68
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,120
That sounds better than like seven cell phone alarms every seven minutes.

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,720
It's like the nuclear meltdown sound and I'm like, God, now I gotta get up.

70
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,560
Do you feel shame when you've like hit the snooze like a certain amount of times?

71
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,840
I feel accomplishment, but I think this would eliminate that.

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,380
You can even personalize your morning with customizable modes for those heavy and light

73
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,380
sleepers out there.

74
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,520
Are you guys heavy or light sleepers?

75
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,720
Not getting a lot of sleep lately because normally I'm a very heavy sleeper, but lately

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,160
I'm a pretty light sleeper.

77
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,000
It's because I got a shitty mattress, so if we could get one of those on next.

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Well, as much as you'll love your silent wake up, your partner will love it even more.

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
My partner?

80
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
I love thinking about them.

81
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,400
No longer will either of you be disturbed by the other's snooze addiction.

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Does your snooze addiction affect your wife?

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,920
No, it doesn't because I wake up far later than she does.

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,360
And you wake up hours later and you wake up with a silent wake up.

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,560
That's right.

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,640
Without any noise whatsoever.

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,760
And I tried to scream, but I can't, it's just the ads don't have to be horror.

88
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
That's right.

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
That's right.

90
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
That's right.

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:54,120
Get yourself a favor and get the gift of extra sleep for $35 off at get.silentwakeup.com.

92

One more time!

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,960
Get.silentwakeup.com.

94
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,400
Everyone all together now?

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920
The smarter wake up is a silent wake up.

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Fucking nailed it.

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,600
Howdy there, my friends.

98
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:18,960
I just got back from my vacation back in the pirate times and have made my way all the

99
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,400
way back to the July 5th, 2022 times.

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,560
Damn, I miss those pirate oceans.

101
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,560
My fur though does not take kindly to the briny beast that is the ocean.

102
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,320
Gotta re-grease up my quills.

103
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,160
So welcome once again to the briniest broadcast this side of the Bermuda.

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,680
694.2 PTBP.

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:55,920
I am your loyal and humble host, Wolf the Dog, and you are my loyal listenership.

106
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,480
You sometimes write me things.

107
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,720
I sometimes read them.

108
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,680
This howlin' with Wolf is from Derek Enfargo N.D., who tweeted about the show and tagged

109
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,480
at Pretending Pod, a very cool thing you should do.

110
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:20,200
Derek Enfargo N.D. writes, Dear Wolf, you kooky bastards are the reason

111
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,640
I got my group to start playing D.G.

112
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,320
We at Fuckboys Central owe a debt to you for all we've gotten into.

113
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,440
From stealing a helicopter and killing a hand monster with hellfire missiles to having

114
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,440
a canoe-sized bomb dropped on an agent and explode the theater just as his bloody entrails

115
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,680
slopped out for a ritual sacrifice.

116
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:55,640
Shout out to Scoots, Danimal, Bozzie, Goofah, Cashew, Jesus, Matt, and your OG Fuckboy,

117
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Drable.

118
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,160
Thanks for all the fish.

119
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,120
And thanks to you, Fargo Derek, I think your group has potential to go far.

120
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,880
If you want to write up something for your salty wolf to howl, just do a quick little

121
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:19,760
shout out to your favorites here at 694.2 PTBP and tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter

122
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,320
or Instagram, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a five-star review on

123
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,240
the podcast app of your choice and send them screenshots.

124
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,520
The links are in the show notes.

125
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Click them.

126
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Cook them now.

127
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,600
Or after the show.

128
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,040
You just better look at them at the least.

129
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,200
Sorry, being back in 2022 has me on the edge of my mind's chair.

130
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,840
There's just so much more of the news.

131
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,080
Last time, right after Luke, Joe, Thomas, and Zach stood up from recording the end of

132
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:02,160
The Death of a Salesman, just like immediately after Zach stopped recording, Thomas exclaimed,

133
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,640
Holy shit, did we just create the Bermuda Triangle?

134
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,760
But back here in 2022, things aren't going so cool.

135
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,720
In the hidden, unnatural, Godel company town, Grover's Gorge, Fred Godel is nowhere to

136
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,360
be seen except on the screens in the train and the statue in front of the lab.

137
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:32,280
However, Vernon Covington, the landlord, has with a large audience accused Cal Colorado,

138
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:39,720
Beck Wilder, Julius Summers, and Stevie of the murder of the mayor of Grover's Gorge,

139
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,440
a turtle named Sandro.

140
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,720
When the can crew spoke in resistance, they were the victims of Vernon Covington's relentless

141
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,160
vitriol and violence.

142
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,560
The latter was most harshly directed at Julius Summers, who lays on the ground bleeding like

143
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,480
a fountain from his face, barely conscious.

144
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:09,520
And that's when the landlord called for a specific punishment, stoned to death.

145
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:18,160
Taking us now to a conflictingly less-than-hell-yeah-dude moment, it's Altergirl with My Life is Great

146
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,560
and It's All My Fault.

147
00:08:39,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Welcome back to Pretending to Be People, after a four-episode run as pirates.

148
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Argh.

149
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Here's what I'm thinking.

150
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Oh, and 80s.

151
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,320
Bones are their money, and also their food, and that's it.

152
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,880
But what if the part that we already recorded isn't in here anymore?

153
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Yeah.

154
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
We're gonna have to keep it in, then.

155
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Argh.

156
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,240
We can just let that sit there.

157
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,960
Zach asked you to talk about pirates and- Pirates eat bones, maybe?

158
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,000
I can't remember if I got a solid argh- You can't say it never happened.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
In the pirate ark.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know if I got one in here.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you want to get one now?

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Argh.

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Go, Joe.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,320
This is your one and wild argh.

165
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,120
Is that how you're gonna use it?

166
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Argh.

167
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Oh.

168
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
That was pretty good.

169
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
No, it wasn't.

170
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Don't fucking...

171
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Oh.

172
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Oh.

173
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Oh.

174
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Oh.

175
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Oh.

176
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Oh.

177
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Oh.

178
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Oh.

179
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
Oh.

180
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Don't coddle the boy.

181
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
I thought it was pretty good.

182
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
Give me an argh, motherfucker.

183
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Argh.

184
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
What?

185
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
I didn't know if you pushed people aggressively and got better results.

186
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Have you ever heard of Stanley Cooper?

187
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Is Thomas Stanley Kubrick of this podcast?

188
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
No, no, no.

189
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,600
There's a difference between inspiration and abuse.

190
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,200
What I do is abuse.

191
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,280
Which ultimately provides better material.

192
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Excellent.

193
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,800
Excellent short-term results.

194
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,040
He never wanted to do a shining too, so it's like he doesn't care what happens after.

195
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,200
He doesn't care what bridges I burn.

196
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,680
Jack, you're cool.

197
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
This lady, though...

198
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,200
What was her name?

199
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Shelley Duvall.

200
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Shelley Duvall.

201
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Poor lady.

202
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Poor, poor lady.

203
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Yeah.

204
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Seems like it was a bad time.

205
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Yeah.

206
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,520
Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.

207
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,920
Have you seen that video?

208
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,280
No, I thought you were just playing character now on the show.

209
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
I was like, wow, bold choice.

210
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Let's see where it goes.

211
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,520
What was shooting like?

212
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,520
She hosted some show that she was the...

213
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Every intro, she said, hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.

214
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
And she said it in the exact same way.

215
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,520
So somebody made a compilation of her saying it a million times in a row.

216
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
It's really...

217
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
She's a fucking pro.

218
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
It's a fun video.

219
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Yeah.

220
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
She's an ultra pro.

221
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
It's like perfect every time.

222
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Whoa.

223
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Do you think that we should like say the same thing at the beginning of all of our episodes?

224
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Sure.

225
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
Yeah.

226
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Fuck off, fuckaroos.

227
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,760
It's another episode of pretending to be people.

228
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
So, I mean, that's one idea.

229
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,760
It's kind of just Gabrus's what's up shit heads.

230
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,760
What if we just did the same thing every episode?

231
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Every time.

232
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
The full episode?

233
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
From start to finish.

234
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Yeah.

235
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Episode one over and over and over again.

236
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Hold on, I got to turn my heads down a little bit.

237
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Until we get it right.

238
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Can you reach it?

239
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
You can.

240
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You fucking nailed it.

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You said it the exact same way you said it last time.

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That was crazy.

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Well.

245
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So, Zach.

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't want to be a pirate.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,560
We just got out of the pirate arch, which, holy shit, man, there were some things that

248
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,960
happened in there.

249
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,400
But before the pirates, an even crazier thing was happening to our characters in the real

250
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
world.

251
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,040
Nobody remembers that.

252
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,040
In the real world is a great way to say it.

253
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,300
In the present world.

254
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,760
In the not pirate world.

255
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
It is the real world.

256
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
It's just spooky.

257
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
It's just spooky.

258
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,760
This is all spooky.

259
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,440
Luke, what was happening at the end of the last episode?

260
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Was Julius fine?

261
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,840
Oh, he was having just a fine day until he ran into...

262
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,720
You don't have it in your notes?

263
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,360
He just looked to everyone in the room.

264
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,920
He looked at it in his character sheet.

265
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Joe, don't show him.

266
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,640
Were you looking for your name?

267
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Your character's name?

268
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Vernon.

269
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,780
Until he ran into Vernon.

270
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,500
And then he was not having such a great day anymore, because he's almost dead.

271
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,900
He was having about as bad a day as you can have.

272
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,940
I would say one point away from ending his day completely.

273
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,220
Have we ever taken a PC down to one hit point on the show before?

274
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:21,060
Taking a PC down to one hit point on the show before.

275
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,760
So I've turned my headphones down, but Luke is still peaking really hard for me.

276
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
That's the thing.

277
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,740
I'm louder than everybody else is, for sure.

278
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,220
I always forget he just talks way louder than everybody else.

279
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,000
Bing bong, bing bong, shooby dooby doop.

280
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,300
It's all that theater training.

281
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
He projects.

282
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Yeah.

283
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,540
I think the mics just don't pick up the deeper, more powerful voices in the room as much as

284
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,540
they do the...

285
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,380
The whiny, little, shrill, annoying voices.

286
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,420
As someone who listens to all of us on a regular occasion, I'm constantly surprised by how

287
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,940
deep Luke's voice is still to this day when I'm editing, and I'm like, whoa, he got down

288
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,940
there.

289
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
Hello, dude.

290
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Luke, give us an argh.

291
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
Argh.

292
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,940
Hmm.

293
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,940
I genuinely believe that's the best you can do.

294
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
Fuck.

295
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
Argh.

296
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,940
Argh.

297
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:25,340
See, you've got to tailor your abuse to each person to get the most out of them.

298
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,100
Jesus Christ.

299
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,700
I am afraid to argh.

300
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,860
Hey, Zach.

301
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,860
Yeah.

302
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
Mm-hmm.

303
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,860
Yeah.

304
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,620
Let's get this episode going, huh?

305
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Yes, thank you.

306
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,180
Let us begin.

307
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,500
Well, I do like the...

308
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Fuck.

309
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,980
You got me all riled up.

310
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,020
Lettuce, tomato, pickles and onions.

311
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,300
I want to go back and keep talking about where we were at the end of episode eight, because

312
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,940
that was a fair few moments ago.

313
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,460
I can sum it up in four words.

314
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,460
Okay.

315
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Ouchie, ouchie.

316
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,460
Hell yeah.

317
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,260
Would you like to...

318
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,500
I think your forward explanation needs a slight explanation, but it is well done.

319
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Yeah.

320
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,740
I think it's appropriate for listeners who remember what's going on, but entirely inappropriate

321
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,740
for the job of...

322
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
Catching anyone up.

323
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
Yeah.

324
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,420
That is my explanation.

325
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,860
Would somebody else like to give it a crack?

326
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Julius hurt.

327
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
We're fucked.

328
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,860
Oh, we didn't need to...

329
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,260
I really appreciate the effort, but I...

330
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,460
It didn't have to be in four words.

331
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,820
It did not have to be in four words that time specifically.

332
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,420
But also very good job.

333
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,980
Yeah, super well done.

334
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,980
Four words, Joe?

335
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,980
Landlord, bang, bang, bang.

336
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
Yep.

337
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,980
Oh no, four words about the story.

338
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,980
You already told us what you were up to today.

339
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
Three times, wow.

340
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,980
Fucking your landlord.

341
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Pretty impressive.

342
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Thanks guys.

343
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,980
Three times, not bad.

344
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,620
Yeah, we're getting old.

345
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,620
What is your refraction period?

346
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Refractory.

347
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,620
What is your refractory period?

348
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,620
What was that?

349
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,620
I was doing the same laugh I did the time before, but I just didn't have it in me that

350
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,620
time as much.

351
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,620
I thought you were trying to laugh in reverse.

352
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,380
Give us an R.

353
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,380
I got it.

354
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,380
Yeah, nailed it in one.

355
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,380
So we killed the mayor.

356
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,380
We didn't kill the mayor.

357
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,380
The mayor, if he was killed by anybody...

358
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,380
The turtle mayor of this bullshit town committed suicide.

359
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,140
With the help of possibly...

360
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,140
God damn it.

361
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Well, Julius did say he would watch it.

362
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:12,140
Well, Julius, I guess, but the guy, the guy who spoke for the mayor.

363
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,140
The guy who asked you to watch it?

364
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
Chuck.

365
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Chuck.

366
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
Chuck Bidwell.

367
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,140
If anybody killed the mayor, it was Chuck Bidwell.

368
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Turtle dies.

369
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,140
Other stuff.

370
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,140
Town mad.

371
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
Yeah, turtle dies, town mad.

372
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
That's the four words we were looking for.

373
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Yeah, and then you guys came down and saw a very dry turtle corpse there on the ground

374
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:41,900
before you headed out and saw the crowd all staring at you angrily, almost rabid, to see

375
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
what happens to you.

376
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,900
There's your answer, Joe.

377
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
This is very similar to something that actually happened to me in preschool.

378
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Whoa, what?

379
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,900
This girl brought a frog to school and was showing everybody on the playground and it

380
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,900
was all loose and everybody's looking for it and they all run up into this tree house

381
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,900
to look for it there and I'm standing near the bottom just looking around and they all

382
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,900
just point to this dead frog and they're like, look, you stepped on it.

383
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,900
I was like, I don't think, well, yeah, the mob turned on me.

384
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
Yeah.

385
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,900
You're right, this is almost exactly the same.

386
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Yeah.

387
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Why did you step on the frog, though?

388
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,900
I wanted to watch its light go out.

389
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
That's somehow better than wanting attention.

390
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Also, he wanted to be the-

391
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Wanted attention.

392
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
I'm the mayor of the playground now.

393
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,900
I'm the frog.

394
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Watch me hop.

395
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,900
Why would they have thought that it went to the tree house?

396
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
Because it was a cool place to be.

397
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Maybe they had a dead frog and wanted to prank me, I don't know, but everybody else rushed

398
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,900
up to this little tree house and yeah.

399
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
Frogs live in tree house.

400
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
Frogs live in tree house.

401
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,900
True frogs do.

402
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Frogs live in tree house.

403
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
That's right.

404
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
And tree house frogs definitely do.

405
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Anyway, then they stoned me to death.

406
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
Which is what we ended there.

407
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
One of the teachers came out.

408
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Yeah, that's it.

409
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,900
So Vernon Covington, the landlord, put you in your place both verbally and physically,

410
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:25,900
and really did some serious damage to Julius and left him on the ground bleeding, coughing

411
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,900
up his own blood, sputtering, and maybe even teeth falling out.

412
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
I mean, it was bad.

413
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,900
It was a bad scene.

414
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Before he, Vernon Covington, the landlord, did indeed call out to the judge and ask that

415
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,900
the four of you, the three of you, Julius, whatever your last name is-

416
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Summers.

417
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
Caesar.

418
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Julius the Simpsons.

419
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
I almost said Caesar so many times.

420
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
Summers.

421
00:19:50,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Julius Summers, Beck Wilder, from Cal, Colorado, as well as Stevie, or as you know her.

422
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
Stevie Gotel.

423
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Well.

424
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
Starts with an F.

425
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Frank Gotel.

426
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
Yep, her name is-

427
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
Francis.

428
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Francis Gotel.

429
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,900
No, I almost did that before I realized I did that name in season one, so I avoided

430
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
using those names.

431
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
Fox.

432
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
Yes.

433
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
Fox is the sun.

434
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,400
Fox is the name that the sun is going by these days.

435
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,900
He was the one that greeted us when we got here, right?

436
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
He is, yes.

437
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Oh, wait.

438
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
That's Francis.

439
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,900
Faith.

440
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Faith.

441
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
That was, dude, I took a lot of fucking notes in this crazy town.

442
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
That was a while back.

443
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Yes, Faith Gotel.

444
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,380
Vernon Covington is asking also that Faith Gotel be stoned to death, although she is

445
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,340
very much still in disguise to everyone here.

446
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,380
Our last hope is Faith's friend.

447
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:51,060
Faith was kind of, was she iffy about whether or not the judge was on our side or not?

448
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
Yeah.

449
00:20:52,060 --> 00:21:00,580
Yeah, iffy, but also mentioned that for the past year, Susan Bloom, the judge, has known

450
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:08,060
the whereabouts of Faith Gotel and hasn't turned on her yet, is what Faith said.

451
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,060
Right.

452
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,540
Maybe a friend, maybe saving her for something really juicy.

453
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,540
Yeah.

454
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,540
The right time to turn her in.

455
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Yep.

456
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,340
That's the way this world goes, guys.

457
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,500
You don't know what's really in people's hearts, who you can trust, but I think most people

458
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
are good.

459
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,500
I'm sure hope this judge isn't.

460
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Probably not this judge.

461
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,100
So, yeah, I'm laying down munching on my own teeth and drinking my own blood on accident

462
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
basically.

463
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
Whoa.

464
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Fucking metal.

465
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
Hardcore, yeah.

466
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,920
Fucking hardcore.

467
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,440
In this moment, the world basically freezes in your minds.

468
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,840
It doesn't actually freeze.

469
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,280
I know this is a natural kind of game to where if I said that and meant it, it could mean

470
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,080
that it's real, but also I just mean, let's zoom into each of your minds real quick and

471
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,960
get an idea of where you are at.

472
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,440
What is rushing through your mind right now?

473
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,200
I mean, Beck was just bleeding profusely from his leg not 15 minutes ago, and he's been

474
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,640
cured seemingly, and now you've come out and seen this.

475
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Oh, yeah.

476
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,960
We didn't mention it, but also we cured Cal's poison ivy because we forgot about that.

477
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Oh, yeah.

478
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Wow.

479
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,560
Good thing they used that machine.

480
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,800
That was a deleted scene.

481
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,000
I lied to you just now.

482
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,280
We didn't forget about it.

483
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
You just got cut.

484
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Oh, we could easily put that in now.

485
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
It hasn't come out yet.

486
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Somebody just comes in.

487
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
That's true.

488
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Oh, that's true.

489
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
That's too much work.

490
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Too much work.

491
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,280
But it happened.

492
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,760
Or something that doesn't need fixing because we already addressed it.

493
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Oopsie.

494
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,240
I accidentally edited it out when I was drunk.

495
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Whoops.

496
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Uh-oh.

497
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,680
That trashcan buttons pops out of nowhere sometimes.

498
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
It's wild.

499
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,640
You know what Hemingway said, write drunk, edit drunk.

500
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,960
Play high.

501
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,320
It zooms into Julius's face, and a voiceover of Julius says, you're probably wondering

502
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,160
how I got here.

503
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,720
Say that through your blood and teeth.

504
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Don't spill.

505
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,760
You're probably wondering how I got here.

506
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,120
I wish I knew.

507
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,520
Julius is, he's not really got much thoughts going on in his head other than like, ow,

508
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,240
and if I fall asleep I'll die.

509
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,320
Yep, those are the two things that makes all the sense in the world.

510
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,600
I feel like Beck up until this point was just kind of both weirded out but also really

511
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,120
into everything that's been happening so far and then he fell on a jackalope and that really

512
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
messed things up.

513
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:56,280
But I think this is, I think this is now it's hitting him that this isn't just like accidents

514
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,640
and hijinks and weirdness.

515
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,480
This is life or death.

516
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,440
This is, this is, this is no longer a news story.

517
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,200
So weirded out here.

518
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,240
This is all just a crazy misunderstanding.

519
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:13,920
It's not just the kind of place that can cure a deep wound out of nowhere, but it's also

520
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
the kind of place.

521
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,560
It's the kind of place where you could lose your life today.

522
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,920
And that's, that's, that's not, that's not what Beck signed up for.

523
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Yeah.

524
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,720
What about Cal, Colorado?

525
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,160
Cal is like stunned.

526
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:34,000
He doesn't, he, he tried to make these appeals to like justice and rightness and the law

527
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,320
and like the power of journalism to shine light on dark places and got nothing.

528
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,360
And his head, he's, he's just rapidly like turning through different variations of those

529
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,640
ideas and like, what if I approached them this way and appealed to their civic duty

530
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,360
or like, yeah, but he's just grasping at straws.

531
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,960
Will you remind me, did, did, uh, Julius do something in particular to receive that wrath

532
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,640
or did we do something and he was the brunt of the...

533
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:10,640
I did, what did I, Oh, I tried to break his cane in half and I didn't do that.

534
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,800
And then he grabbed it and beat the shit out of me with it with my beautiful big thick

535
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
thighs.

536
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,360
I thought it would work flawlessly.

537
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,680
I planned this character for this exact moment.

538
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,240
I was like, will there be any cane wielding baddies?

539
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:37,760
Do we look at the face or watermelon people?

540
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,600
Just the normal role playing stuff.

541
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
You never know.

542
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
What's going to happen.

543
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Hold on.

544
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,820
I got to rewrite the end of this.

545
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:54,880
As the mothership's doors open, the bulbous head of watermelon prime descends slowly down

546
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,560
stop this madness.

547
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:06,720
He says, you know, we're going to invent the watermelon people language and they're aliens.

548
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,840
So it's weird.

549
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Well they're here for our seeds, which seeds they need to cross pollinate.

550
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,800
Their people are experiencing a children of men situation and they can't make seeds of

551
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
their own.

552
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,520
So they need our watermelon seeds.

553
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,040
You realize the first time you get one of those babies in between your thighs for too

554
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,840
long and you're like, they're seedless.

555
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,320
The reason they turn on us is they're like, what, what have you, you did this on purpose?

556
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,200
They actually go to war with us because the first one to land who came in peace, Julius

557
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,320
just like fucking raffles to the ground between his thighs and pops that fucker open.

558
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,440
I was made for this.

559
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,480
Oh, we're just putting off some bad things.

560
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
I don't wait.

561
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,240
Kill the frog.

562
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,560
Are you saying that we're just procrastinating because of the, I don't want to kill me Joseph

563
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
because I'm Stalin.

564
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Oh my God.

565
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
All right.

566
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:14,240
Well we need to get Russian if we're going to get this episode done in time.

567
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Communism.

568
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Yeah.

569
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,240
We need to quit putting it off.

570
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
You'll laugh your yak off.

571
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Oh, that was hammering circle.

572
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:36,160
All right, in Russia it says, or in America it says, in God we trust on the money in Russia.

573
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,960
We have no money.

574
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
That's Bobby Hills.

575
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Yakov joke.

576
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Yeah.

577
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,080
He sells it to Yakov for $20.

578
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,120
Last thing I'll say about Yakov Smirnoff is his, um, in Branson, his sign out in front

579
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,400
of his show says, laughter kills the COVID virus.

580
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Wow.

581
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,720
Is it true?

582
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,440
I went to Yakov and I haven't had COVID since.

583
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,840
Dangerously false sec.

584
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Oh, okay.

585
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Fascinating.

586
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,640
Encouraging a crowd of mostly senior tourists to all expel as much air as we can in a closed

587
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
space.

588
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,000
I just listened to whoever talked to me last.

589
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,120
So I didn't know if it was true.

590
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Oh, it's not.

591
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Thank you.

592
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,560
Do you just want an earpiece?

593
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,240
So the watermelon people are invading.

594
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Yeah.

595
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,480
So you guys are looking up at what is basically now the King of the Hill, Vernon Covington,

596
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,440
the landlord, as he is just smiling through these teeth that are fucking afraid of each

597
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
other.

598
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,360
They're so far apart and spit is just like dripping off one of his lips as he's looking

599
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,040
down at Julia Summers.

600
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,960
This guy sounds hot.

601
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,520
We see the faces of people in the crowd, people in yellow, people in green.

602
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,520
We see the two medical staff who spoke up to say that Julia Summers had tried to assault

603
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,720
them.

604
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:13,460
Pretty harsh character witness as everyone's eyes turn to the judge, Susan Bloom, who kind

605
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,280
of almost shakily steps forward and then quickly gains her confidence.

606
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,000
She's looking at the four of you, but you all kind of noticed, well, two of you kind

607
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,280
of noticed mostly that she's directing her gaze at Stevie, lip quivering.

608
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,440
Oh, hey, I didn't come up with her voice.

609
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
What should I do for her?

610
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
What should I do for her?

611
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,760
I'm the judge and you're going to listen to my justice.

612
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Is that what you want?

613
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
No.

614
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,280
When you say judge, also based on our new artwork, I think of like a powdered wig judge,

615
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
so British.

616
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
I'm the judge.

617
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,600
Wait, is she wearing a powdered wig?

618
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Powdered wig.

619
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Oh yeah.

620
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Powdered wig.

621
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Lightning blue.

622
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Black gloves.

623
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
Powdered merkins.

624
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
And blue high heels.

625
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Electric blue high heels.

626
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
So yeah, British.

627
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Joe?

628
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Yeah, British.

629
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Oh, okay.

630
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,040
I was going to kind of combine all three of them, but yeah.

631
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Okay.

632
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Then I would say aristocrat, not cockney.

633
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Oh, Kai.

634
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
God dammit.

635
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:28,880
Due to all the outstanding evidence levied against these four, I do hereby charge Carol

636
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:46,240
Colorado, Julius Summers, Vic Wilder, and Stevie to be stoned to death.

637
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Hell yeah.

638
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Hell yeah.

639
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Hell yeah.

640
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
But also-

641
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
No.

642
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,320
It's all Julius can summer out of.

643
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,180
You were probably the most effective person to speak up at that moment.

644
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:05,740
Blood splatters up above you, spraying back down directly in your eyes as you blind yourself

645
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,920
with your own blood spittling out of the hole in your mouth where most of your teeth used

646
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,420
to be.

647
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,680
The trial will commence in one hour.

648
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,360
Didn't you just sentence us?

649
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,400
To death for the trial.

650
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,320
So if we lose the trial, we'll die, but we could win.

651
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,720
Usually it's a trial, then sentencing.

652
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,720
I sentence you to a trial by stoning.

653
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Yeah.

654
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
It's old school.

655
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Trial by stone.

656
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,720
If you live, you are innocent.

657
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,680
Wait, what?

658
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,800
I charged you.

659
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,780
I literally already just charged you for the crime, didn't I?

660
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,640
But that's the thing that happens in the trial.

661
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
You get charged.

662
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,440
And then you go to trial, but you sentenced us to death, which is what happens typically

663
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
after a trial.

664
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Damn.

665
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,240
But they do different things here in Grover's Court.

666
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Yeah.

667
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
They tell you how you're going to die.

668
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,900
The justice system would probably be a lot more effective if we just started with a foregone

669
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:15,280
conclusion and worked our way towards that instead of-

670
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:22,360
I sentence you to be tried for the death of Sandro the Turtle, our dear mayor here

671
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
at Grover's Gorge.

672
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,320
Oh, that makes more sense.

673
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,500
The trial will commence in one hour.

674
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,960
You may roam free until then.

675
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
She looks at Vernon.

676
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
That's nice.

677
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Yeah.

678
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Oh, wait.

679
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Oh, no, that's not right.

680
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,720
Vernon's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no take backs.

681
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
No take backs.

682
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,840
You all heard her say it, right?

683
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Everybody.

684
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Yes.

685
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Everyone witnessed it?

686
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Julius gives a thumbs up.

687
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,360
Your honor, might I request the defendant, Julius Summers, be allowed to receive medical

688
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
attention immediately?

689
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,920
He's in no fit shape to stand trial.

690
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,480
Medical attention will be given.

691
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Thank you, your honor.

692
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,000
Julius gives a rock horns.

693
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,320
Because his other fingers are battered and broken.

694
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,840
He's trying to hold his hand up.

695
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,880
Well, I guess I don't know.

696
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,960
Should they be led free until the trial or should they be thrown in?

697
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,960
I think they should go free.

698
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Yeah, let them go.

699
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,200
Seems like a vocal swelling of support for our freedom.

700
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,240
It would reflect very well on you and your community if you showed this kindness to us

701
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,320
before justice is properly expected.

702
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,560
I will grant you each 30 seconds to plead your case and then the crowd will vote.

703
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,600
Is this the trial or are we pleading to get like their freedom now?

704
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Is that the 30 seconds?

705
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,960
No, this is just for pretrial bail, essentially.

706
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Quick question.

707
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,680
Do you have your camera with the on you still?

708
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Uh huh.

709
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Yeah.

710
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
I think so.

711
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
Yeah, I think so.

712
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,080
Yeah, we tried lying and saying that we were live streaming, but they called our bluff.

713
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,960
I was probably filming that crowd before this all happened.

714
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,720
I think you can still be filming, honestly.

715
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,760
I just assume that Beck is literally like attached eye to camera.

716
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Agreed.

717
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,560
I will grant you each 30 seconds to plead your case.

718
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,240
Your Honor, petition to have Julius' 30 seconds either split between Beckworth and I or he

719
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,680
seeks medical attention first before he's in no condition to plead any kind of case.

720
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,840
Julius barely is able to give a thumbs up.

721
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,520
He may go last.

722
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:47,440
And she looks over to the medical staff who are the two who were

723
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,160
like threatened by Julia Summers earlier and they are both giving the flat hand under their

724
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,480
chin waving side to side of like, no thank you, not us.

725
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,000
But they get on their little speaker system and call out and shortly medical staff will

726
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
be here to assist.

727
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Hell yeah.

728
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You may begin in three, two, one, go.

729
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:23,080
Well, a society that treats its imprisoned with respect is one that deserves respect.

730
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,960
We live in a country, this is I still believe, I hope, I sincerely hope we're still in the

731
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,960
United States, but we believe that a person here is innocent until proven guilty and I

732
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:48,840
believe that we should be given time to like be not guilty for a while.

733
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
You know?

734
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,800
Cal knots vigorously.

735
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,280
And more words, 30.

736
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,560
Please.

737
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,720
I bequeath my time.

738
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,080
Yeah.

739
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,340
And also like neither one of these big statue guys are even here.

740
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:14,960
So like how do you even know what you're supposed to be doing until one of them is here to like

741
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
tell you what to do.

742
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,000
Aren't they in charge, especially with your mayor being dead as well.

743
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,160
There's probably like no one in charge anymore time.

744
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,520
And lastly, and at this point, Julius has been fully like, actually go ahead and roll

745
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
a D4.

746
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,600
I said fully like a fool.

747
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,480
Well, you get one hit point back, which brings you up to what?

748
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Two.

749
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,040
Well, two is enough to talk.

750
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,020
My mouth is mostly what's been fixed.

751
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,800
They focus on the face.

752
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,720
I believe that I've received punishment enough already.

753
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,220
I mean, up until you decide whether I'm guilty or not of the crime.

754
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:11,480
But I would like to have time to formulate my trial argument and I won't be running away

755
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,000
or anything because I know what happens to bad time.

756
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,560
All right.

757
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,880
I need all four people.

758
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:27,760
So the three of you and me is Stevie to roll persuade.

759
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,840
I passed a 19 on a 50.

760
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,320
I failed an 86 on a 60.

761
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,940
I pass a 43 on a 80.

762
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,280
And Stevie failed.

763
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,360
So go ahead and add up your two successes.

764
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
What were your successes?

765
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
43.

766
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,600
Mine was a 19.

767
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,960
Math 62.

768
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,440
He's just rolling until he gets more than 62.

769
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,680
41 plus 19 is 60.

770
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:04,160
I have one more role.

771
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,240
That's a success.

772
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:17,160
The crowd is seemingly on your side and vocalizations of like, Oh, maybe there's, okay, yes, now please

773
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,700
throw up some noise.

774
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:34,120
If you believe they should be let free between now and the trial, and now let's make some

775
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,800
noise.

776
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:44,520
If these four should be thrown in the pit, I don't think they should be in there.

777
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,240
No, this is not the right move.

778
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,040
I think we should consider a more reasoned approach.

779
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,440
Beck is literally shushing people near him.

780
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:02,760
Vernon pulls out these crazy looking handcuffs from behind his back and begins walking up

781
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,420
behind and slaps a pair on Stevie.

782
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,560
Can I roll another health now that they've applied it to more than my face?

783
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,600
I think as soon as they got you up and ready to go, like able to talk.

784
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
They left.

785
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Yeah.

786
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
These are the guys who didn't want anything to do with you.

787
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,940
So they just put some chapstick on you and then, yeah, I'm just kind of like, I'm sitting

788
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
up now.

789
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:30,420
I'm not just completely on my back, but I just let him not struggling snaps a couple.

790
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:36,100
These are the same kind of like that fifties futuristic vibe of what people thought handcuffs

791
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,220
would look like.

792
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,220
Like laser beams?

793
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,220
Yeah.

794
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,220
Like an energy beam.

795
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,220
Yeah.

796
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:47,060
But it's like energy beam cuff, but there's very clearly like tubing around where the

797
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,500
cool pulsating light is coming from.

798
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
It's like fiber optic.

799
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Yeah.

800
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
It's fiber optic.

801
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,140
Cal's like, that's a little disappointing.

802
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,900
It's a pair on Beck Wilder.

803
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,460
Dude, bro, this seems like totally unnecessary.

804
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,740
It's just a turtle guys.

805
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,740
Come on.

806
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,980
Puts your camera nicely back in its bag.

807
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,340
Vernon Covington is weirdly nice.

808
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,820
Like handles your camera with care.

809
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,220
Hey man, watch the merchandise dude.

810
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,420
Smiles up at you as he walks over to Cal.

811
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,860
Do you think he's a home videographer?

812
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
An enthusiast.

813
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,380
He didn't know how to put it in its bag, which is kind of tricky sometimes.

814
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,220
Hands behind your back.

815
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,860
Beck, are you filming?

816
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,860
It's in the bag.

817
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,860
Oh, right.

818
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Okay.

819
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:43,900
As soon as he snaps your handcuffs on, he clicks a button and all four of your handcuffs

820
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:51,540
like snap together in a line where like a rod like reaches out and connects the four

821
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:57,580
of you together with a leash almost on the front end of it that he grabs hold of.

822
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,620
So it's like we're attached to an invisible foosball table arm.

823
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,620
Yeah.

824
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,020
That's what I was picturing.

825
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,020
Yeah.

826
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,020
With a leash.

827
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,020
Yeah.

828
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:13,260
And he begins leading you East away from this large lab that is made of glass and grass

829
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:19,660
and toward what was described to you as the factory where the GEs work.

830
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,140
The whole time, Cal was like, you know, some of those no votes seem to be from people sitting

831
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,460
in a natural hollow of sorts, which amplified their, I don't think this was an accurate

832
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,780
method of counting that vote.

833
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:39,540
Vernon Covington laughs and laughs and spits on the ground and continues walking you toward

834
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,700
this massive, massive building off in the distance.

835
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,380
Your laughter is a very cold thing, sir.

836
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:52,260
Vernon Covington laughs and spits on the ground.

837
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,820
Somebody like called you like the landlord.

838
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,820
You like own this place?

839
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:06,340
Well, you know, I am the overseer of sorts of the GIZs around here.

840
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,060
So you're more like a super or facilities.

841
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,140
I'm a super landlord.

842
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,140
Maintenance.

843
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,140
Hmm.

844
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,780
The name is what you make of it.

845
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:22,900
I do suppose a glorified errand boy carrying out whose orders look up behind you toward

846
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,900
the sky, your towering statues, but I understand they're not here right now.

847
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,500
Would they be happy with this decision you've made?

848
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:40,300
We'll see, yes, we'll see, oh, we'll see when you go in the it pit.

849
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:48,020
We'll see if Fred Godel likes it when I have you down in the it pit.

850
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:52,420
Julius, I know you're hurt, but remember that name for a future segment.

851
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Which name?

852
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,420
The it pit.

853
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,620
Oh, nods his head and, guys, I think my wisdom teeth grew back.

854
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:05,340
Yeah, man, that machine works wonders, dude.

855
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:11,380
Julius is kind of still out of it, like coming back to life, but he will remember the it

856
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,300
pit.

857
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,860
As you guys make it towards this factory, you see plenty of happy and chipper ease wearing

858
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:25,340
their work clothes, cute little jumpsuits that are both monochromatic and have little

859
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,860
flashes of yellow all over them, heading in and out of work.

860
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:35,180
But you guys do not take the front entrance as you lead you around the back.

861
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:40,740
As you walk around the back, this is the first time you've really made it toward the trees.

862
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:47,780
These trees are all around, and there's just this thick, hazy fog off in the distance that

863
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:52,020
you can kind of make out through the thick of the trees in the distance.

864
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:59,540
He leads you around the corner of this massive facility and in the ground around back behind

865
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,060
the factory.

866
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:08,220
There are two metal doors that seem like they go down into a bomb shelter or a bunker of

867
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,220
some sorts.

868
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,220
Or like a pit.

869
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,220
They're in the ground.

870
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,220
They're in the ground.

871
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,220
Like a hatch.

872
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,220
Much like a hatch.

873
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,780
A hatch that's actually in the ground.

874
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,180
Not a SpongeBob door.

875
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,260
This one does not have the cool wheel on it that makes a fun noise when it turns.

876
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,260
I know.

877
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,260
But you're just like, around back there's two doors, and then...

878
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,260
Just I don't know.

879
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:37,660
It seems like you have trouble with openings as a spatial concept.

880
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,500
Which reminds me of another Stephen King book I read.

881
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,740
Oh my god.

882
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:54,700
He opens up one of the metal doors, opens up the other one, inside is only darkness,

883
00:44:54,700 --> 00:45:05,780
and out comes the most foul stench, decrepit, awful, human anatomy that's just been left

884
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:14,220
out in blood that's coagulated and piss and shit and cum that's just molded over growing

885
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,820
cultures on them.

886
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,020
Who could cum in a place like this?

887
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,020
And we'll answer that question on the next episode.

888
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,020
No, it's not over yet.

889
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:27,740
Yeah, we still need a closing line.

890
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,220
This pit is not it.

891
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:37,180
It kind of smells like Beck's bedroom.

892
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,780
He takes his cane and hits Stevie in the back of one of her legs and then pushes her into

893
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,780
the pit.

894
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,780
Hey, whoa, bro!

895
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,780
Boom!

896
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,060
Immediately, the three of you just dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

897
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,820
And if anyone can hold on, you can give it a go here, but you're being whipped down

898
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,500
and dragged by the human weight.

899
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:02,420
Kind of like we're spinning like you would spin a bunch of foosball players.

900
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,980
We might have some leverage here, literally, because he knocked the smallest person down

901
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,980
the stairs, presumably.

902
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:14,300
There are no stairs as you look down and you just hear Stevie yelling out like, oh, ow,

903
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:20,060
ow, ow, ow, and like she's screaming out because her hands were behind her, so when she went

904
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,860
down, her hands are now above her head if you were looking down in her eye.

905
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,500
It's a dislocated shoulder action.

906
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:32,500
Yeah, Julius is the next one up, so Julius is staring down and you're seeing, I mean,

907
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:38,860
her arms just snapped up fully behind to then be above her, and she's just like, oh, oh,

908
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,380
shit, oh, just, oh, shit, oh.

909
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:47,860
We're probably going to need a content warning on this episode because I'm sitting here and

910
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,820
I'm like, I don't like being here.

911
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,780
Julius looks at- Content warning, not fun.

912
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,540
This one, not so fun.

913
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,980
Not fun, man.

914
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:04,540
Julius looks at the other two guys and just goes, I think we should jump.

915
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,540
Do we have a choice?

916
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,540
I'm confused now.

917
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,780
Yeah, how far- Did we all go tumbling in now because of her?

918
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,220
I think, like Thomas pointed out, he did push in the smallest one, so-

919
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,820
Oh, so she's just like dangling by her arm.

920
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,820
She's just dangling by her arm.

921
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,820
That's okay.

922
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,820
Why didn't I say nothing?

923
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,820
Sorry, Stevie.

924
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,460
Yeah, that's what made that happen.

925
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,620
I thought that she had hit with such a weird impact that it had snapped her arms up.

926
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:29,220
She's like dangling there while we're not- He's got his cane out, he's looking at Julius

927
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:34,580
and he's just like, jump, and he lifts his cane up and they're like, he's about to hit

928
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,580
you.

929
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,900
Julius immediately gets a cane PTSD and he says, I think we should jump, and then he

930
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,900
jumps.

931
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,900
Nope.

932
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,900
Boom.

933
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,540
We got two and- Okay, I try to grab out.

934
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,700
Oh, wait, I've handcuffed- Yeah, you have handcuffs on and Beck is

935
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,780
actually next up and the two of you are the only ones standing, so I'm actually going

936
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:57,900
to need strength rolls here in order for the two of you to stay up.

937
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:03,540
And Vernon Covington is laughing his ass off while this happens.

938
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,740
Cal passes a 45 on a 50.

939
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,020
I failed a 57 on a 55.

940
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:14,580
Okay, a 45 is enough to where when Beck falls in, you skirt your heels right up to the edge

941
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:21,180
and are able to just hold on, but as you do so, Beck's arms are about to do the exact

942
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,780
same thing if you don't jump at this last second.

943
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:29,340
I know my hands are down behind my back, but Cal just wants to try to throw himself back

944
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:35,220
and grab out with his fingers for any part of Vernon's clothes and take him down with

945
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,220
us.

946
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,220
Awesome.

947
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,220
Fucking cool.

948
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,220
That's so cool.

949
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,860
What would that be?

950
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,860
Grabby grabbies.

951
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,380
Oh yeah, I've got a hundred in grabby grabbies.

952
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:51,460
Well, his hands are sticky from the poison ivy, so.

953
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,540
Right, all the pus from the poison ivy that's still here.

954
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,540
We actually did say that.

955
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,540
That's why we cured it, I forgot.

956
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,540
Yeah, I know.

957
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,540
I know.

958
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,540
I'm talking.

959
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,540
Ooh, I'm talking.

960
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,540
That's what I'm...

961
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,540
I'm talking.

962
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,540
Shut up.

963
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,540
I'm talking here.

964
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,540
No.

965
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,380
No, you said what I said before I said it.

966
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,380
The bear.

967
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,380
That's pretty good.

968
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,820
So yeah, what should I roll here?

969
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,340
You should roll athletics or decks.

970
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,140
Okay, I'm going to roll dexterity.

971
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,140
Yep.

972
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,020
Got a 45 in that.

973
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,580
And I rolled a 70.

974
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,580
So I'm going to spend my luck.

975
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,860
Wait, yeah, to change that to a seven.

976
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,860
Right.

977
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,860
Which is great because he crit fails.

978
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:31,860
Oh, fuck yes.

979
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,860
Holy shit.

980
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,860
All right, because he crit fails, I'm going to say Beck keeps his arms, which is very

981
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,980
nice for Beck.

982
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,980
You're able to grab him.

983
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,580
They were going to be ripped out of their sockets?

984
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,580
Yeah, they were.

985
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,580
Did mine?

986
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,580
Did mine already do that?

987
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,580
Actually, fuck.

988
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,580
Ouchie.

989
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:54,620
I would say it's not a foregone conclusion that your arms would dislocate in this position.

990
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,820
Yeah, you could come up.

991
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,460
Well, when he put the cuffs on me, they were in front of me.

992
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,460
Oh, nice.

993
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,460
That was nice.

994
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,460
That worked out well for you.

995
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,460
Yeah.

996
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,580
Because I was like, my arms hurt too bad to put them on the way back there.

997
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,420
So you just have your arms raised normally above your head.

998
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,140
It's uncomfortable, but it's not terrible.

999
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,660
Yeah, you were able to hold on to the in-between connection.

1000
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:23,180
So yeah, as Kal is slipping off, he just manages to get three little fingers around

1001
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,180
a belt.

1002
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,180
Inside the vest.

1003
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,180
Yeah.

1004
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1005
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,180
And he just yanks him off with us.

1006
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,180
Boom.

1007
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,180
And with the belt in your hands.

1008
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,180
I jack him off into the gumpit.

1009
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,180
Okay.

1010
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,460
Oh, fuck, dude.

1011
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:38,340
He can't get both doors, but also because he crit fails there, he's trying to grab on

1012
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:42,340
to one of the doors for any sort of like leverage on the ground, right?

1013
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,780
But that just ends up shutting one of them.

1014
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,060
And slamming his fingers and breaking his hands, right?

1015
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,060
Why not?

1016
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,060
Yeah.

1017
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,060
Hands.

1018
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,060
Fingers, maybe.

1019
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,060
Knees and toes.

1020
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:59,580
As he comes down, he's got his fingers just on the edge, but then that door that he pulled

1021
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,940
up just comes down and slices off all of his fingertips.

1022
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,100
Slices them off?

1023
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,100
Yeah.

1024
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:15,580
And as you guys all hit the ground, he's just, whoa, oh my, oh shit, oh my goodness, oh no,

1025
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,780
oh my God.

1026
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,480
And you look over and there's just very little light in here.

1027
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,020
The only light that is actually coming through is coming in through one of the empty doors

1028
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,020
that is above you.

1029
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,460
So light is pouring in through that.

1030
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:34,360
And you see that Vernon Covington shoves his fingers into what is the ground, but what

1031
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:42,320
is essentially just a layer of, okay, so like the amount of skin that sloughs off of

1032
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:51,680
a human in like a certain amount of time, like leaves a certain amount of skin waste.

1033
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,680
Mostly what dust is.

1034
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
Most of the dust in your house.

1035
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,680
Yeah.

1036
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,840
This place be dusty and the dust is basically turned to mud.

1037
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,840
Yeah.

1038
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
Because of all the shit and blood and common piss.

1039
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,840
Because of all the shit and blood and common piss.

1040
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,840
Yeah.

1041
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,320
You've got a pretty good idea of what that sounds like in here.

1042
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,320
Oh, did we say puss?

1043
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
Oh, and it'd be a lot of that too.

1044
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,320
Snot.

1045
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,320
There would absolutely be a fair amount of snot and puss.

1046
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,320
That's just some puss.

1047
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
Kind of puss really.

1048
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
It's all white blood cells.

1049
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
Interesting.

1050
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,320
Yeah.

1051
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,320
And probably a bunch of skin cells in there too.

1052
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,320
Yeah.

1053
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,320
Yeah.

1054
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,320
So we got it double covered.

1055
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,320
I'm going to go ahead and say roll grip.

1056
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,320
Okay.

1057
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:36,480
I wanted to pass this so bad because that could be okay with a certain degree of this.

1058
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,480
But I did not.

1059
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,360
I'm an 83 on a 63.

1060
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:44,040
Cal, Colorado is not okay with this at all and critically fails.

1061
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,680
77 on a 56.

1062
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,580
I got a 41 on a 45.

1063
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,780
Congratulations Julia Summers.

1064
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,780
He's in too much pain.

1065
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,260
And like half blind and can't really tell what's going on.

1066
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:04,300
Literally the thoughts on my mind are who came down here with us and my wisdom teeth

1067
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,940
hurts so bad right now.

1068
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:17,740
You lose one grip, Beck, you failed, which means you lose one D4 plus one and Cal, because

1069
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:23,540
you critically failed, you lose the most for this role, which is five.

1070
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,780
I got the most and it looks like Joe, I got the most too.

1071
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:37,700
And I got a chance to not have the most and I got the most.

1072
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,700
That's a big old fiver.

1073
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,260
Hey, Zach, that also makes me hit my bow breaking point.

1074
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,020
I'm one away from my breaking point.

1075
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,180
Oh, why did I tell that's for the audience, Zach.

1076
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,180
Don't listen to that.

1077
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,600
I don't get any ideas, mister.

1078
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,200
So we're going to have the cover Joe's breaking point here, and we're also going to have to

1079
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,840
take care of fight flight or freeze.

1080
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,280
Okay.

1081
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,080
So that's a three, two, one, right?

1082
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,040
So three fight, two freeze, one flee.

1083
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,040
Okay.

1084
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,420
Do I do that because of the breaking point?

1085
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,280
You do that because you lost five as well.

1086
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:18,160
Losing five grip in one go means you got to roll that fight flight freeze.

1087
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,600
It is going to be Beck's first because you don't want to be in this pit.

1088
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,720
Freeze would be a second and third is fight.

1089
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,720
Yep.

1090
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,720
Beck got a two, which was freeze.

1091
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,720
Your name's Cal.

1092
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,440
Oh, Cal got a two.

1093
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:39,880
That's not going to stop the shippers or just one now call me by your name.

1094
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,680
Let me eat your arm.

1095
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,360
So you are doing what now?

1096
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,360
You're freezing.

1097
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,360
Yeah.

1098
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,480
Cal feels a brief moment of triumph as he drags the landlord down with them.

1099
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,900
But then as soon as he sees what's in this pit, instead of trying to beat him to death,

1100
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:01,840
he just looks around every part of his face drops and he just stands there silently crying.

1101
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:07,040
And I think that in this moment, as you're standing there crying, it's one of those you're

1102
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,880
in here with me, I'm not in here with you situations as you realize that you have brought

1103
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:20,480
down a person who has been capable of extreme violence, whose hands are not cuffed.

1104
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,320
Yeah, but his fucking fingers are cut off.

1105
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,320
Yeah.

1106
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:31,160
It's not going to help as I try to beat the shit out of you guys until you die.

1107
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,560
Weird call, but I like it.

1108
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,560
Beck Wilder.

1109
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:39,000
I mean, you're going to have to tell me how much you allow in the handcuffs, but Beck

1110
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
rolled a one.

1111
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,280
Oh, that's the fucking-

1112
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,040
Joe business right there.

1113
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,680
He's going to try and start kicking and headbutting Vernon.

1114
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,320
He is far too concerned with his current situation right now to fight back.

1115
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:00,520
So you've got a free shot on him and because you're going with just like unbridled lack

1116
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:06,080
of grip on reality here, you are going to act in basically what is a surprise round

1117
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,640
before we get into combat.

1118
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
Especially no one.

1119
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:18,080
Beck is not a combat person, so I can roll unarmed combat, which you get a natural 40%

1120
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,080
in.

1121
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,080
That's not a bad score.

1122
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:25,200
I would argue that I'm literally not using my arms, so maybe it's just like strength.

1123
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,200
Leg combat?

1124
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,040
No, I'm going to call that unarmed combat.

1125
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,040
Yeah.

1126
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,040
If you're not using your arms, man.

1127
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,040
It's super unarmed.

1128
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,480
Head and leg only.

1129
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,080
I could see like pure violence also being a strength roll.

1130
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,080
I passed it.

1131
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,080
It's a 12.

1132
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,080
Oh, that's great.

1133
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,080
It's uncontested.

1134
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:48,400
Can I headbutt him unconscious?

1135
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,000
You can give him one great headbutt hopefully here.

1136
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,760
Go ahead and roll a- what is a headbutt worth?

1137
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,120
Oh, that's a D100.

1138
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,320
You haven't seen Beck's head.

1139
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,520
It's going to be a D4 minus one.

1140
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,640
Just give us a D4.

1141
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,640
Nice.

1142
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,640
So three total.

1143
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:17,000
So Vernon Covington takes three damage as you- I mean through the slop in the mud beneath

1144
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
your feet.

1145
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,720
Do you want to describe how Beck headbutts Vernon Covington?

1146
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,560
I mean, since his hands are behind his back and he's attached to all these guys, it's

1147
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,320
going to be a weird kind of lunge forward.

1148
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:34,120
He might even lose his feet for a second to get enough momentum to bring everybody forward

1149
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,120
with him.

1150
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,480
And he just kind of supermances his head into Vernon's head.

1151
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,720
And since he connects, I think that he can stay on his feet because of that.

1152
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,640
If he had missed, he would have gone face down past him.

1153
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,520
Vernon just failed to stay standing.

1154
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,080
He is on his back prone and will now act last in this turn.

1155
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,480
What is your guys' dexterity?

1156
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,480
45.

1157
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480
75.

1158
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,480
Mine's a 50.

1159
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:05,960
So first up, Stevie fucking just starts stomping on Vernon Covington's face and it's Julius

1160
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,020
Summers' turn.

1161
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:11,440
I want to point out real fast- That's what I wanted to do if I wasn't present.

1162
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,760
Just for the record, there's no way that Beck can say this in person, but I'll say it out

1163
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,680
of character because I want us all to be aware.

1164
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,960
There's no reason- like now we're definitely going to be sentenced to death if we get out

1165
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,960
of here.

1166
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:28,600
This is us killing or naming the landlord.

1167
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,160
He brought us here on his own.

1168
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,720
It's our word against his.

1169
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,760
He brought us to their fucking weird cum shit torture pit.

1170
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:44,120
Oh, you know, he tried to hit us and fuck us with a dead guy's arm or whatever.

1171
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,600
So yeah, it was self-defense and we ended up beating him to death.

1172
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,320
Sorry, but maybe you should have a real police force here.

1173
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,320
I don't know.

1174
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,040
It's better to ask for forgiveness.

1175
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,560
I'm glad you said it, but like Julius does not think of that at all.

1176
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,560
Thank you.

1177
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:06,640
But now it's like everything I do, I'm like, damn, it's stupid to do this.

1178
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:14,440
As your turn turns the corner here, you see that Stevie is performing an act that is making

1179
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,840
Vernon Covington look in role-playing parlance bloodied.

1180
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:27,120
Julius is going to, for lack of a better term, I'm going to straddle his head and try to

1181
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,400
just crush his head between my legs.

1182
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,720
Foreshadowing the triumphant end of the campaign when he defeats the watermelon people.

1183
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,160
Now see, this is a strength roll.

1184
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,160
28 on 50.

1185
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,160
Holy shit.

1186
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,480
Okay.

1187
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,800
So because what you're going for here is full-blown like head smash.

1188
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,600
Like skull fracturing head smash.

1189
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,600
Yeah.

1190
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,160
I'm going to have him roll constitution.

1191
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,600
So you are going to do one D4 minus one damage.

1192
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,600
One.

1193
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,600
Okay.

1194
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,760
So you do one damage to him.

1195
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:16,440
You are squeezing his head so hard that his actually, his a tipless fingers are now like

1196
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,960
reaching out for you.

1197
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:26,480
But every single time that he actually tries to grab onto you, he's cause it hurts so fucking

1198
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,560
bad when he's trying to reach out.

1199
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,560
Well good.

1200
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,920
Cal, Colorado, you are frozen.

1201
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,440
What is going through your brain is you're unable to act in this turn.

1202
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:44,080
I guess Cal is kind of being dragged around by everybody on this line, but he's not really

1203
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,640
seeing what's in front of his face.

1204
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,120
He's just remembering conversations with like his ex wife where she's like, one day this

1205
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,120
job is going to get you killed.

1206
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:56,280
Like one day you're going to be in a situation where you couldn't say no and you're going

1207
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,600
to pay the price.

1208
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,120
There's more important things, Cal.

1209
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,080
There's more fucking important things than that job.

1210
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:09,560
And he's not quite like ready to accept that, but that's all he's seen in his mind at the

1211
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,600
top of the next round.

1212
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:19,840
Vernon reaches out his fingerprintless fingers, trying to grasp and find his cane and he successfully

1213
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,160
does so.

1214
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:28,600
And when he goes to use it on Julius Summers, wrapped so tightly around his face, he is

1215
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:34,000
fully unable to quite figure out where Julius is still.

1216
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,280
He's just whipping his arm around randomly and confusedly.

1217
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,800
He's freaking out.

1218
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:44,960
The guy can't even fucking breathe right now and he's losing his absolute shit.

1219
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:51,760
I don't think you're going to be able to hit me with your cane.

1220
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,760
Got him.

1221
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,760
Bible stuff.

1222
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,760
Bible slam.

1223
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,760
Yeah.

1224
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,760
Total Bible slam.

1225
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,760
Fucking got him.

1226
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,800
Interesting character choice at this time to make Julius religious.

1227
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,480
He's losing it a little bit.

1228
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,720
Julius is deeply Christian.

1229
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,240
Stevie straight up, she was stomping on the face, but the face is taken.

1230
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:17,600
So she jumps into the air with both feet coming right down on Vernon Covington's ribs and

1231
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,840
you hear just crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.

1232
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,840
Holy shit.

1233
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
And he just...

1234
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,840
Spatchcock.

1235
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
Julius Summers.

1236
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,840
Finish him.

1237
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,840
Finish him.

1238
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,840
Finish him.

1239
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,840
Finish him.

1240
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,840
Finish him.

1241
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,840
Finish him.

1242
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,840
Finish him.

1243
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,840
Finish him.

1244
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
Finish him.

1245
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,840
Finish him.

1246
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,960
Finish him.

1247
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,960
Finish him.

1248
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:42,400
Julius avoids the cane and kind of like kicks his foot trying to knock it out of his hand,

1249
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,080
repositions and then just full force squeeze again.

1250
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,080
Oh, give me that.

1251
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,360
Give me that strength.

1252
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,200
That'll be a three minus one, two.

1253
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,200
Oh, wait, I got to do strength check.

1254
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,200
Strength check.

1255
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Yeah.

1256
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
45 on a 50.

1257
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,240
I succeeded as well, but only with a 10.

1258
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,240
Nice.

1259
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,240
And you rolled?

1260
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,680
I rolled a three minus one.

1261
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,200
Plus one, which is two.

1262
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:10,560
He's going to roll a constitution to stay conscious and he fails.

1263
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:19,320
The muffled screams of Vernon Covington, the landlord, begin to slowly fade into the enormous

1264
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:23,920
thighs of Julius Summers.

1265
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,680
Do you stay on top of him?

1266
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:31,480
Julius doesn't stop squeezing until he, his eyes are finally adjusting to the dim light

1267
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:38,480
in here and he's going to wait until he sees eyeballs pop out.

1268
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,040
Just continuously squeezing.

1269
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,600
I can't see his eyes.

1270
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,600
His eyes are in your teeth.

1271
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,880
And just medically that might not be what happens.

1272
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,080
I know, but it's not a, this isn't a medical podcast.

1273
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:54,920
Actually, this is, this is a spinoff of Sawbones.

1274
01:03:54,920 --> 01:04:00,720
Uh, yeah, Julius is just going to keep doing it until basically until somebody pulls him

1275
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,080
Just continuously squeezing.

1276
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,080
Julius stop.

1277
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,080
We're out of combat now, right?

1278
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,080
Yeah.

1279
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,960
Julius, Julius, he's worth more to us dead.

1280
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:19,840
I mean, he's worth moral to the world dead, but to us right now he's worth more alive.

1281
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,520
He's our only bargaining chip.

1282
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:28,080
Julius gives like one last little squeeze and then stands up and just spits on his face.

1283
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:34,440
Even the force of your spit hitting the back of his head makes his eyeballs explode.

1284
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,000
That's how science works.

1285
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,280
He spits on his face that kind of looks like a pug, like, you know, smashed with eyeballs

1286
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,300
kind of smashed out.

1287
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,080
You know how those ugly little pugs look?

1288
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,080
Yeah.

1289
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,080
You know, with their eyeballs.

1290
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,080
With their eyeballs almost hanging out of their head.

1291
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,080
Yeah.

1292
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,080
Like that.

1293
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,080
So he's cute.

1294
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:00,160
We beat him into adorableness took a lot, took a lot.

1295
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:10,160
And as your eyes adjust to this low lighting down here in the pit, you see that all over

1296
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:23,080
every single wall are the same cryptic designs over and over and over seems to be drawn in

1297
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:29,080
whatever it is that's below you making up the ground here, slathered on these walls.

1298
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:35,640
And I'm going to, I'm going to send it in the group and let you guys describe it that

1299
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,640
way.

1300
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,640
I don't give anything away.

1301
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,640
Okay.

1302
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,640
Just send it.

1303
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,640
Yeah.

1304
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,640
It's it's his dick.

1305
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,880
It's just kind of looks like a tongue.

1306
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,880
How's my dog?

1307
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:46,880
Yeah.

1308
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,880
Uh, five.

1309
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,880
Nice stars.

1310
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:54,800
You got to take care of that tongue thing, man.

1311
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
Okay.

1312
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:01,760
So we've got like a big spiral and in the center of the spiral looks like what is like,

1313
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:08,920
what's the castle thing called a rook from a chest like a rampart.

1314
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,680
No, it's like a castle tower, the top of a tower of a castle.

1315
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:18,480
Well, it's, it's like the teen Titans tower, but wearing a crown.

1316
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,480
Yeah.

1317
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,280
Or maybe you can't see its head and those are its shoulders and it's, it's bar mitzvah

1318
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,600
and it's wearing that, that thing, that sash you wear anyway.

1319
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,680
That's in the middle.

1320
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:34,480
And then like coming out of the spiral from the middle is a star, a perfectly drawn, like

1321
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,480
five point star, like a kid would draw.

1322
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:42,720
And then going, I mean, I drew it, so fuck you.

1323
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:49,600
Moving on the spiral line, the next thing you get is like, like basically a V, but in

1324
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:55,600
the bottom of the V is a diamond or like the, uh, Mason's symbol.

1325
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,600
It's a square.

1326
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,600
Yeah.

1327
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,920
Not like a square shape, like a, a, a, the square tool, I guess I'm looking at it.

1328
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,920
Okay.

1329
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,920
Yeah.

1330
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:10,800
And then continuing on the spiral is, am I looking at it this way or this way?

1331
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:17,680
It's like a lowercase teen Titans tower upside down.

1332
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,400
Then there's like a wall with a gate, maybe some kind of doorway.

1333
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,200
There's a line with what looks like a door in it maybe, but I think it's a wall with

1334
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,200
a door.

1335
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,200
It kind of looks like a field.

1336
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,200
Yeah.

1337
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,680
Like a, like an archway in a field.

1338
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:35,360
Yeah, that could be, you know, the kid who drew this.

1339
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,360
And then basically, uh, an upside down cross.

1340
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,440
No, that's the lowercase teen Titans tower.

1341
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,080
That's a hammer.

1342
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,080
Oh, okay.

1343
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,080
Yeah.

1344
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,080
Yeah.

1345
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:49,680
And we'll post this picture on Instagram at pretending pod on Twitter at pretending pod.

1346
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,680
Zach, are you okay?

1347
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,760
You actually drew this on your walls.

1348
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,760
Yeah.

1349
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,240
Uh, Thomas isn't making a joke.

1350
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,400
The picture that he sent us is him standing next to a white wall that he has drawn this

1351
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,400
on.

1352
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,400
Yeah.

1353
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,400
With my piss and shit and comments.

1354
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,400
It is Brown.

1355
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,400
A little blood.

1356
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,280
It looks like it wouldn't be the whole stew with who took this picture.

1357
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,280
Taylor.

1358
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,120
No, I took that long arms.

1359
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,120
Oh, whoa.

1360
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:20,560
You must have, I'm sorry, but that's a selfie all day long, Betty.

1361
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,320
It just looks like his shoulders are both like that shoulder does look like it's going

1362
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,320
straight down.

1363
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:31,560
It's, it's all elbow.

1364
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,880
And to get enough of you and my forearms, three feet long.

1365
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,720
So do we see one of those or a bunch of those?

1366
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:45,560
You see those just all over, like spiral to spiral covering the entirety of the walls

1367
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:50,840
and they all have these little designs drawn slightly differently, but in the exact same

1368
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,880
spots over and over and over and over.

1369
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,640
I are you okay?

1370
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,640
Cause like this is not a compelling symbol.

1371
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,760
This is actually what a crazy person would make.

1372
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,760
Honestly, thank you so much.

1373
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,800
Thank you so much.

1374
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,800
That is exactly what I was going for.

1375
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:17,800
Top to bottom nonsense with a very poor overall like sense of composition.

1376
01:09:34,760 --> 01:10:00,440
Whew.

1377
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,600
I'm sweaty.

1378
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,240
I am also very sweaty.

1379
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,920
And I am pee.

1380
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,920
I am pee.
