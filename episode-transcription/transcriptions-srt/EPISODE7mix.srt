1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Greetings, greetings, my fellow canines, my pups, my pack.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:14,720
You are listening to 694.2 PTBP, Contentions best radio show hosted by Wolf the dog.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,720
That's me baby.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,560
I'd like to introduce a brand new segment today, and we're gonna call it Howlin' with

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,600
Wolf.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,360
If you listeners out there would like any of your announcements read on air each week

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,820
by yours truly, I had to read anything these people send me.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,400
Apparently yes, it can be anything.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,440
Tell me your thoughts about what them boys are up to, promote your new business, tell

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,840
your best friend Becky that she's really been nailing it lately, or just go ahead and say

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,560
hi to your best pal Wolf.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,960
Okay well, then you can enter up to four times by doing one of the following.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,800
One, leave us a five star review on your podcast platform of choice.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Two, three, and four, make a post and tag us on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,800
You can find us on Instagram and Twitter at pretending pod or look up pretending to be

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,540
people on Facebook.

17
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,800
Eat my ass Mark Zuckerberg.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,220
Nah, each time you do one of these we'll put your name in a bowl.

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,780
Each week me or one of my minions will draw a name and that person will be able to write

20
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,900
an announcement to be read by your local canine DJ Wolf the dog.

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,660
Now I'm just gonna let y'all know my producer told me to read all that, but what the fuck

22
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,560
is a podcast?

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,920
Now for a little news, says right here them boys done fucked up.

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,300
Now speaking of fucked up, we got a banger for y'all today.

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,100
It's kazoo with no backbone.

26
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:47,300
Oh, come on, it's all about the build up.

27
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,380
Wow, enough of that.

28
00:02:52,380 --> 00:03:07,780
So that song plays over the drone shot of you all of us crying and then we would see

29
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:16,220
one police cruiser and a raggedy four wheeler come pulling back into the contention police

30
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:23,300
department parking lot and the three of you go inside.

31
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,100
Well we're back in the police station.

32
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,340
Can I first aid myself to see if I can set my foot back in and strap that boot back on

33
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,620
and just leave it be?

34
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,860
Let's drop you off at the hospital.

35
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,300
Let's get professional medical attention.

36
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,980
I kind of like the idea of me doing it.

37
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,980
What do you want to do Keith?

38
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,940
I want to just see if I can't set it back in where I think it might be and then wrap

39
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,540
it up and then put my boot back on and then just go from there.

40
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,700
Go ahead and roll a first aid for me.

41
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,700
That's a nine.

42
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,780
You nailed it.

43
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:02,100
With an actual first aid kit handy and perhaps a leather strap to bite down on, you set your

44
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,380
ankle back into place and get your boot back on.

45
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,020
I think Clark is real disturbed.

46
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,020
We would have just taken you to the hospital man.

47
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
We don't have time.

48
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,700
Let's get, let's do some more investigating.

49
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Oh, all right.

50
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,340
I have to prove myself dude.

51
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,900
Is he losing hit points or anything?

52
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,380
I gain hit points from that probably.

53
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,980
Yeah, you do actually roll a D4 for me.

54
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,980
Oh yeah.

55
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,980
Come on baby.

56
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
Two.

57
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,260
Yeah, go ahead and grab two hit points.

58
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,460
What is your first aid Luke?

59
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
60.

60
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,640
Oh nice.

61
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
He said 60.

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,060
It's qualified.

63
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,900
And as you guys are sitting around, Drew says, oh, by the way, I meant to tell you guys,

64
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:47,660
I called in and checked with the city PD about the death of Jim Cook, Maggie's dad.

65
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,220
It's pretty brutal actually.

66
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,020
He was murdered in an alleyway the night of December 1st.

67
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,980
He was strangled and died of asphyxiation.

68
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,740
Didn't you say you had a dream about an alleyway?

69
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,580
As a matter of fact, I did.

70
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,780
And you had a dream about an old woman strangling people?

71
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,020
No, not an old woman.

72
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,660
She was an old timey lady throwing me through the floor.

73
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,180
Even spookier.

74
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,860
And did I see you guys pull up in that four wheeler, but did someone wreck the four wheeler?

75
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,180
Yeah, I did.

76
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,260
Yeah, I wrecked it.

77
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,340
It was bad ass though.

78
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,100
Right guys?

79
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,620
Just could you take a look at that?

80
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
Yeah.

81
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
You know mechanical stuff, right?

82
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,620
Yeah, absolutely.

83
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,620
I'll take a look at it.

84
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,220
And then now that Julie Maxwell is definitely not at her apartment, maybe we should go take

85
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,220
a look at that.

86
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Do all three of you want to go?

87
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
Yeah, I think so.

88
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,220
Sure.

89
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:55,400
I think it's best we stick together because if any of us got into this kind of trouble

90
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,500
without people to help, I'm like...

91
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:07,300
Okay so you get the address off of her ID that John Pettymore got a hold of when she

92
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,220
was in her car accident.

93
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,900
You head there and you pull up to a quadplex in the shitty neighborhood just northwest of

94
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,980
downtown where Julie Maxwell rents a studio apartment.

95
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,820
There's a sticky note on her door and I will hand it to you now.

96
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,980
I just got a dick drawn on it.

97
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,980
That's strange.

98
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,980
What's it say?

99
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
You weren't here.

100
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,980
Still waiting for reply.

101
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,260
Please help me.

102
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,860
You know I've always thought it was weird that this place is called the shitty neighborhood.

103
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,280
I feel like step one to raising property values in this place is changing that name.

104
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,460
I knock on the door.

105
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,940
As you knock on the door, the door opens and an odd chemical scent wafts out the door.

106
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,580
Do I recognize this chemical?

107
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,300
It opens from the power of his knock.

108
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,620
Yeah, it was just clearly not closed very well.

109
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,260
Is it like methy in here?

110
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Or like bleach?

111
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,220
Yeah, a little bleach-y.

112
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,220
Not so methy.

113
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,780
A scent that John would know pretty well I bet.

114
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,200
As you go inside, you find a bed, a desk with an old computer on it, and a large number

115
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,740
of complete and incomplete taxidermied animals.

116
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,020
Looking around further, you see an empty bottle of brandy, an old digital camera, taxidermy

117
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:26,700
materials like tanning chemicals, pickling agents, bactericides, oils and such, a handful

118
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,660
of pictures of Julie with her sister Ashley from before the accident, and a receipt from

119
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,580
Forgotten Treasures, a local flea market.

120
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,660
Whoever has the best search, please roll search for me.

121
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
I've got 50.

122
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,660
Yeah, you're the best.

123
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,080
32.

124
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,100
As you are giving the apartment a quick go around, you find a phone book.

125
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,100
It's flipped upside down underneath the bed, and flipping it over, you see the phone book

126
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:59,100
was opened to the Yellow Pages for private practices, and Circled is an ad for Dr. Marie

127
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,340
Jacobs, who is a family practitioner in contention.

128
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,540
Hey John, you should take a look at that computer.

129
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
Yeah, definitely.

130
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,860
I want to look at that camera and that receipt too.

131
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
Okay.

132
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,420
Roll computer science.

133
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
96.

134
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Well.

135
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,980
My skill is 99, so I pass hand on it.

136
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
It's awfully handy.

137
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,540
You would see that the digital camera is broken that's sitting on the desk.

138
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,620
Damn, it's broken.

139
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,260
There are some recent Google searches on her computer for fixing broken digital cameras,

140
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,060
and then moving on to where to find a new camera.

141
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,940
She was looking into buying a new camera.

142
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,980
The receipt from Forgotten Treasures is off an old register for, I don't know, $45.

143
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,460
Let's go with $45.

144
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,260
I also, before I move on to the camera, I'm going to pocket that memory card.

145
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Sounds good.

146
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,140
Is there any memory card reader or input on the computer?

147
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,140
Sure.

148
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,660
I would like to see if I can see anything on it.

149
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,220
A bunch of pictures of taxidermied animals.

150
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,660
Can I spend the next four hours here trying to complete some of these unassembled taxidermies

151
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,980
and really grind my taxidermy skill?

152
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Absolutely.

153
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Sweet.

154
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
What is the mattress memory for?

155
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,820
A little progress bar appears above my head as I just...

156
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Learn.

157
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,820
Yeah, just stand.

158
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Is this just a one bedroom?

159
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,820
Yeah.

160
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,580
Does Clark know anything about Dr. Marie Jacobs just from being in the town?

161
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,540
I don't think so.

162
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,860
Any pictures or anything around?

163
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,860
Oh yeah.

164
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,980
They're all of Julie with her sister Ashley, so they're all from high school.

165
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,020
Move on, you know?

166
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,020
She is now.

167
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,020
Thanks to Clark.

168
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,060
Hey Clark, how do you feel about being in the home of the woman you brutally murdered

169
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,060
yesterday?

170
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
I mean, she murdered first.

171
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,060
Hell yeah.

172
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
All right, for an eye.

173
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,060
Literally.

174
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,060
Literally.

175
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,140
Can you think of anything else to do in here?

176
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,620
Clark is real interested in the taxidermy from a fan of taxidermy standpoint.

177
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,620
Awesome.

178
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,680
Guys, look at the scenes.

179
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,100
The whole time that John and Keith are looking through stuff and trying to work on the computer,

180
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
you're just...

181
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Admiring the craft work.

182
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Wonderful.

183
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Good.

184
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,860
Are there any deer heads in here that you could wear as like a funny prank or a disguise

185
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
in the woods?

186
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Oh dude, yeah.

187
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
Could we disguise ourselves?

188
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,540
Is there enough deer components here for us to make deer disguises?

189
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,920
I think you could probably come up with a headdress of some sort if you really took

190
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
the time.

191
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
I take the time.

192
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Yeah, actually.

193
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,420
It seems like we're dealing with some spooky shit, so we're going to spook right back.

194
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,420
Okay, perfect.

195
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,980
You guys can spend some time in here- Making three deer headdresses?

196
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,780
Yeah, I mean if that's what you want to do- Well, I want a deer, do you guys want anything

197
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
else?

198
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,780
Ooh, yeah.

199
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
Is there like a boar?

200
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Yeah, there's for sure a boar in here.

201
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,780
What about a bobcat?

202
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,700
There are three bobcat heads.

203
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
What do you want to be, Clark?

204
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,260
I am not participating.

205
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,180
I make like a bobcat Cerberus.

206
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,660
I'm just going to go with a deer.

207
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,420
Clark, how are you reacting to them doing this?

208
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,780
I would not let it happen, but I don't know if Thomas and Luke will not let me let it

209
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,780
happen.

210
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,700
Listen, Clark.

211
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
We've seen some shit.

212
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
What the fuck?

213
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
You guys are putting shit on your heads.

214
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
I know.

215
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Act like officers, boys.

216
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
Hey, you know what?

217
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,220
There's officers of man's law, and there's officers of spooky law.

218
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,500
I go and take it off of your head, off of Jon's head, and just put it back on the table.

219
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
We don't need this stuff.

220
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,140
I have ahold of the deer antlers with my mask, and I say, you're not fucking touching me,

221
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,140
Clark.

222
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,060
It's a weird call to just set mine on the table, because I just pick it back up and

223
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,420
walk out with it under my arm.

224
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,580
I roll out of the apartment with my deer mask on.

225
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,580
Clark, you are standing in the middle of the apartment of the woman you killed, and your

226
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,580
two fellow officers have walked out with taxidermy hats.

227
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,900
Sorry, one was a Cerberus.

228
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,480
Well, it was a hat, but it's a spooky three-headed bobcat mask.

229
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
How you feeling?

230
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Not great.

231
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,440
I think madness has taken my friends.

232
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Yeah.

233
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,880
I'm okay if you want to throw a sanity roll at us for that decision we just made.

234
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
No, you're good.

235
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
All right.

236
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,440
Let's take that memory card and camera with us.

237
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I'll take that tray for a sweet bobcat.

238
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Wait, what kind of camera?

239
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,120
What kind of camera was it?

240
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,700
Remember before we had iPhones, and we all, a bunch of people had digital cameras that

241
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,900
were about the size of an ID.

242
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,160
What are you, a grandpa?

243
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
It was one of those.

244
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,360
Yes, my children have children.

245
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,640
I want to take a picture of the apartment with it and see if it just takes a picture

246
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
of the apartment.

247
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
He said it's broken.

248
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Oh, it's broken.

249
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Well, darn.

250
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,140
Let's take it back to Drew and see if he can fix it.

251
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,440
We got the card off it.

252
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Yeah, that's true.

253
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,040
Yeah, so unless you want a digital camera from 2008-

254
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
I don't.

255
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,440
Okay, what should we do next, boys?

256
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
I kind of got caught up in that bobcat mask thing.

257
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,960
What was on the SD card?

258
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,520
It was pictures of the finished taxidermy.

259
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Right, okay.

260
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,280
I think you figured out earlier in this game that she is a taxidermist, and so it's her

261
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Etsy page.

262
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Yeah, nope.

263
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Chuck Testa.

264
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Sweet meme.

265
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Oh, yeah, vintage.

266
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Vintage memes.

267
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
What are you, a grandpa?

268
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
What?

269
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Yeah, his kids have kids.

270
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Pictures.

271
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,840
We got two things we could go and look at here now.

272
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,120
We can see if anybody at Forgotten Treasures remembers what she bought, and we could head

273
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,320
over to the doctor's office and see if she has any information on why-

274
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,920
Let's go to Hidden Treasures.

275
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Or Forgotten Treasures.

276
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Forgotten Treasures.

277
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Forgotten Treasures.

278
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Let's go there.

279
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,180
All right, so you guys roll up to Forgotten Treasures.

280
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:32,400
It is in the old neighborhood, two blocks west of, it's, no, it's, yeah, to the left.

281
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
It's right there.

282
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Yep.

283
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,640
And it's an antique flea market.

284
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,040
For people who don't know that we have a map, it sounds like you said to the left.

285
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Yep, there it is.

286
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:51,320
We just go out on the balcony of Julie's, and the poor looking, no, no, oh.

287
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Just above that.

288
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Just to the left.

289
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
There you go.

290
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
You got it.

291
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
You found it.

292
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
To the left.

293
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
To the left.

294
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
All your shit in a box in the flea market.

295
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,760
Okay, so you guys pull up, and it's almost closing time.

296
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Not for cops.

297
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
I'm pretty much, yeah.

298
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,000
What do you guys want to do?

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Go inside.

300
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,160
Okay, you go inside.

301
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
You know what?

302
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
That's what they're expecting.

303
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,160
No, I don't have a better point.

304
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,220
Okay, so you guys go inside Forgotten Treasures, and at the front, there seems to be a sort

305
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,640
of office to your right.

306
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,500
There's a big register area to the left where everybody checks out.

307
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,200
There's one big register sitting on it, and an old woman standing behind it.

308
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,880
And then looking forward, you just see a bunch of different rows of booths, individual booths.

309
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,680
It smells kind of weird in here.

310
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,000
Like old stuff.

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Cool.

312
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,920
Wait, so do we have ... We have a receipt from here?

313
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
What was on the receipt?

314
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
$45.

315
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
It wasn't itemized.

316
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,520
Okay, let's go up and talk to this lady and see if she remembers.

317
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,480
Yeah, see if Julie came by a lot.

318
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Hello, ma'am.

319
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Hello?

320
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
Hi?

321
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,480
We're three officers of the law, and we need some information from you.

322
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Oh my.

323
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Okay.

324
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Sure.

325
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Yes?

326
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
Do you remember a lady named Julie Maxwell?

327
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Julie Maxwell?

328
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
No.

329
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Pull up a picture.

330
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Yeah.

331
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
We show her a picture.

332
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Oh, yes.

333
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Yes.

334
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,320
She was in here, I don't know, maybe a week ago.

335
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,720
Was she a frequent customer or just the one time?

336
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
No.

337
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Do you recall what she purchased?

338
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Oh gosh.

339
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Oh gosh, what was it?

340
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
It was an old camera.

341
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
What booth?

342
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
504?

343
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
I think.

344
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Yeah.

345
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Yeah.

346
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Polaroid?

347
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Seemed to be.

348
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
I'd never seen anything like it before.

349
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,600
It was a weird camera.

350
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,280
What kind of things do they sell in this?

351
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,320
As she's saying that, I'm going to head toward it.

352
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,440
As she opens a book and starts flipping through it.

353
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,760
That booth is owned by Mildred Mitchell?

354
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,120
That's John Peters' neighbor.

355
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
Clark, you're walking toward the booth.

356
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,440
When you get there, it contains some old hippie records, some tie-dye clothes, and future

357
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
paraphernalia.

358
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Future paraphernalia?

359
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Future paraphernalia?

360
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,840
Yeah, like some pipes that will- For tobacco use only.

361
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,320
For tobacco use only.

362
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,960
Are there any other items like that camera or are they all pretty straightforward, nothing

363
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
too unusual?

364
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Yeah.

365
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
I don't know.

366
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:26,000
There has been some, I guess, not too many people around here buy stuff from Mildred,

367
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,600
but she had a few items come in pretty recently that all sold pretty quickly.

368
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
How recently?

369
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,080
Probably about a week ago.

370
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,960
I think she looted John Peters' house.

371
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
We need to go talk to her.

372
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,360
Yeah, we need to find out how she got this stuff.

373
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,120
Do you have any other cool booths?

374
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,600
You might want to check out booth 420.

375
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,000
Man, we are officers before war.

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,720
Man, we're cops.

377
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
It's all Elvis memorabilia.

378
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
I'm a big fan.

379
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Well.

380
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Oh, you old hound dog.

381
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Crying all the time.

382
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,280
I really want to go talk to Mildred.

383
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Let's roll.

384
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,960
Let's head right to Mildred's.

385
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:09,560
You guys pull up to Mildred's house and when she opens up the door, a cloud of smoke billows

386
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:16,400
out of the door and she's like, oh, hey, uh, oh, officer, officers, uh, officers.

387
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
I, uh, oh boy.

388
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Hey Mildred.

389
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Hey.

390
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
You having a good time there?

391
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Hey Johnny.

392
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
How are you doing?

393
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Uh, yeah.

394
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
I, um.

395
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Not as good as you, I don't think.

396
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm so, I am, um, I'm sorry.

397
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,740
Burning a little incense in here, are we Mildred?

398
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,020
I just like the place to smell nice.

399
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,020
Of course.

400
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,260
Hey, do you mind if we step in and ask you a few questions?

401
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,260
I don't know.

402
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
By all means.

403
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,260
Do you want some tea?

404
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,940
And she, uh, starts walking back.

405
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,300
What kind of tea?

406
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:49,180
I've got green, chamomile, herbal, mint, peppermint, black, uh, blue, and, uh, green.

407
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,860
I'll take one of them peppermints, man.

408
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,380
I'll take the second green.

409
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,940
I'll take the first green.

410
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,940
Have some fun, Keith.

411
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,260
All right, let's do it.

412
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,980
She picks up a spliff off of her ashtray.

413
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
Mildred.

414
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,100
Oh, I, oh, shoot, I'm so-

415
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,980
She's, like, embarrassed and puts it out, uh, and then goes back and, uh, comes back

416
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,180
with some tea, uh, and sits down on the couch and is like-

417
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:16,100
Oh, no, uh, what, what can I, uh, oh, ew, what can I, uh, do for you, officers?

418
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,100
We don't want to go accusing nobody of nothing, Mildred, but, you know, when you noticed John

419
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,700
had been missing, did you happen to maybe stock your booth with some of his things?

420
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
My, my booth?

421
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Down at the flea market?

422
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:36,900
I totally forgot I had a booth at the flea market.

423
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,940
Somebody restocked it about a week ago, Mildred, with some pretty interesting things.

424
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
What?

425
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,940
No, I, uh, you know, it might have been my granddaughter.

426
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,340
I think she might put some stuff for sale there, everyone smile.

427
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,860
Hey, uh, Tildy B. Tildy B, come on down here.

428
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,060
Uh, she gets an accident when she yells at her granddaughter.

429
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,340
A teenage girl, uh, comes down the stairs, and as soon as she, uh, sees three police

430
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,300
officers standing in her living room, she bolts back upstairs.

431
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
What do you do?

432
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,700
I call, hey Tildy, now, we just want to talk.

433
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
I call up the stairs.

434
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
You hear a door slam?

435
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,260
This one's on you, boys, I can't go upstairs.

436
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,300
Clark, you go head out the door, I'm gonna make sure she doesn't jump out a window or

437
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
something.

438
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Sure.

439
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,460
So John runs around the side of the house and, uh, gets a visual of the windows, and

440
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,180
Clark heads upstairs, uh, you are now facing a door that is shut.

441
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,860
Hey, Tildy, uh, we're, you're not in trouble, we just, we just need to talk to you about

442
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,220
some stuff you might have sold at the, at the booth down at your, your mom's shop down

443
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,220
there.

444
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,180
Uh, you hear, um, some clanking?

445
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
Yeah.

446
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
Clanking.

447
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,180
You hear some clanking around.

448
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,780
I knock one more time, more forcefully.

449
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,300
Tildy, you gotta open up, or I'm gonna open it up.

450
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,300
No.

451
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
No, don't.

452
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Alright, step away from the door.

453
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,700
I kick in the door.

454
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,180
So I'm gonna have the two of you leave.

455
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,260
You're gonna have to take a sanity check.

456
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,260
She's a deer.

457
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:08,700
She's wearing a three-handed four-hand suit.

458
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,940
Clark, you kick in the door, and a teenage girl is standing before you.

459
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,780
She has a crazed look in her eyes as she slams a large bullet into the chamber and squeezes

460
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,300
the trigger on a really odd-looking revolver.

461
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,540
There's an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision,

462
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,420
and then, as if she had never been there, the girl is gone.

463
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
Roll sanity.

464
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
Uh, seven.

465
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,420
I pass.

466
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,420
Okay.

467
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,700
Roll, uh, D6 and a half it for me.

468
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Three and a half.

469
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Two.

470
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Call it a two.

471
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Alright, so Clark loses two sanity.

472
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,220
I am at 52 for the listener at home.

473
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:59,700
You see this odd gun fall to the floor exactly where this young girl stood, frozen in place.

474
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:08,260
You're looking at it, and it's this old revolver, and it's got some glass tubing that runs around

475
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
the outside of it.

476
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,260
What do you want to do?

477
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,340
Look in the closet, because she had to have just jumped in there.

478
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,020
You creep up to the closet.

479
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
Gun drawn.

480
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,740
The door open, and there's nothing inside.

481
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,020
I want to look under that damn bed.

482
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
Where'd that girl go?

483
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,920
You look under the bed, and there's no one underneath the bed.

484
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,100
You have absolutely no idea where this girl is gone.

485
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,820
I want to kneel down at the gun, look it over without touching it.

486
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Pretty normal.

487
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,820
It's got, like, a stock, and it's got a barrel, but on the barrel it's almost like a revolver,

488
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,060
but instead of the ... What would that be called?

489
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,620
It's got a very specific name, and I can't remember.

490
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,600
The spinny part ... God, yeah.

491
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,900
If you haven't been able to tell by listening to this podcast, I know lots about guns.

492
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,620
And I know even more.

493
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,500
So instead of that-

494
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Oh, God.

495
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Chamber?

496
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
They're chambers.

497
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Yeah.

498
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,620
So instead of the six chambers, there is one chamber that can be accessed from one side.

499
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,700
It's closed on the other side, and then it's got one chamber.

500
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,500
She slammed a large bullet into ... You saw her do that.

501
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,140
And then it's got those weird metal tubes all around it, and on the back of it, kind

502
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,500
of where the hammer would be, there are two lights, one green, one red, and the red one

503
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
is currently lit.

504
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
I pick it up.

505
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,340
I'm going to look out the window and see what I see out the window.

506
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,580
All right, let's get the other boys back in here.

507
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
Yep.

508
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,580
Oh!

509
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
Oh!

510
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
Oh!

511
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,580
Oh!

512
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
Thomas already did that.

513
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
Oh, goodness.

514
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
Oh.

515
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,580
You okay?

516
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,720
How much sanity did you lose?

517
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,260
Is Tildy alive?

518
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,340
Did she explode into black goo?

519
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,180
Jon, as you ran around the outside of the house, you get to a point to where you could

520
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,800
see the window from where you're assuming her room was, because it's a rather small

521
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,640
two-story house, and you see a extremely bright flash of light come from that room.

522
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,680
I feel like a really dark tingle of recognition and dread.

523
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,440
Keith, you also see a bright flash of light coming from the staircase.

524
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,200
Do I hear anything?

525
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,020
You hear a thud.

526
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,520
I get up out of my wheelchair and start going upstairs.

527
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
It's a miracle.

528
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,200
I can still walk.

529
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,440
As Keith is hopping up the stairs, Jon, you see Clark standing in the window.

530
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,660
What does he look like?

531
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,660
He looks horrified.

532
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,200
He's pale white and panicked.

533
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,600
I single to him from below to open up the window.

534
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,860
I go ahead and do that.

535
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,860
What the hell happened?

536
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,680
Uh, you didn't see her.

537
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
See who?

538
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Where's Tildy?

539
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
She's not here.

540
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,920
Why don't you come on up here?

541
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
I come up.

542
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,040
The three of you meet at the platform at the top of the stairs.

543
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,460
What happened?

544
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,920
So I busted in the door, and she shot me.

545
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,200
She pointed a gun at me, and she chambered a bullet, and she shot me, and there was this

546
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,960
blinding white light, and then she wasn't there anymore.

547
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,160
Are you shot?

548
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,520
I don't think so.

549
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
What's the gun look like?

550
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
Be cautious, Leag.

551
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
Go look at the gun.

552
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,480
The gun looks like an old-timey revolver, but where the chamber is, six bullets, maybe

553
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
you know.

554
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Do you know what that thing's called?

555
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,480
Cylinder.

556
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Cylinder!

557
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
That's the name!

558
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
We could not come up with it.

559
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,160
So where the cylinder was, there's basically, on one side, it's completely enclosed, cased

560
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,040
in, and on the other side, there's a small sliding door, basically, that you can slide

561
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,680
open and shut, and it would fit one bullet that's the size of a cylinder.

562
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:02,060
And then there are glass tubes, one going underneath it, and then one kind of going

563
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,660
around the side where it's closed, and then on the back of the gun where the hammer is,

564
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,560
there are two lights, one red, one green, and the red one is lit.

565
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,000
John, it's like that goddamn camera you found.

566
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
How do you mean?

567
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,120
It's got glass tubing and lights.

568
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,400
I don't really see it.

569
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
I shake him.

570
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Don't fuck with me, man!

571
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.

572
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,720
You're, it's, of course.

573
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,360
I want to look around the rest of the room.

574
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,360
She's not in the closet.

575
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
I checked there.

576
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
I mean, you saw her run in the room.

577
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,840
Well, I want to see if anything else like that is in here.

578
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,600
You sure she was in here when you opened that door?

579
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
She was frightened as all get out.

580
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
She was scared.

581
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
We looked each other in the eye.

582
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,160
What did the bullet look like that she chambered?

583
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,720
I was going to ask that as Joe.

584
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,780
Did I see her chamber the bullet itself, and did I see what light, if there were lights

585
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,720
on the gun at the time that she shot?

586
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,900
The lights would have been facing her, so you wouldn't have seen that.

587
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,160
You did see her slam a, what looked like a large bullet casing.

588
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Did he see the tubes?

589
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Oh yeah, they were there.

590
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,340
Let's see where she got the bullet from.

591
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,840
She already had it in hand when he kicked in the door.

592
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,400
Okay, we heard her fumbling around.

593
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,840
As soon as he kicked in the door, she slammed that bullet into place and shot.

594
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Okay.

595
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
It was a big ass bullet.

596
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Where'd it go?

597
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Where'd she go?

598
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,200
Well, let's, let's look around the room and see if we find anything else similar to the

599
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
camera or the gun.

600
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Clark points under the bed.

601
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,480
I checked there and he points at the closet.

602
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
I checked, I checked there.

603
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,800
I don't know where else, unless you jumped out the window, but you were out there.

604
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,120
Did you check under the bed?

605
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
That's, yeah, that's what I meant.

606
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
I checked under the bed.

607
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Did you check in the bed?

608
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Nope.

609
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,240
I checked in the bed.

610
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:35,380
Pulling back the covers.

611
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,100
There's an elaborate like fake sleeping doll that she had made to sneak out of the house

612
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
later than me.

613
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,760
Ferris Bueller asks, three pillows outside of contention Missouri.

614
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Boo.

615
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Yeah, that was bad.

616
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,800
I want to start looking around in some drawers and stuff.

617
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Oh yeah.

618
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Yeah.

619
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Let's toss this place.

620
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,800
I think Clark is sitting on the edge of the bed.

621
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,660
I think we're all okay with that.

622
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:06,960
It's really just a completely normal teenager's room, but inside her sock drawer is a wad

623
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,840
of $20 bills all rolled up.

624
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
I take it.

625
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,400
A drug dealer's wad, like more of a wad than a teenager should have or like the kind of

626
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,320
scrap you might get like selling bullshit at a flea park.

627
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Yeah, exactly.

628
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Like 200 bucks.

629
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,040
So like the meanest definition of wad.

630
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Oh yeah.

631
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Yeah.

632
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,360
Also, oh my God, like if I was fucking 15 right now and had a wad of 200 bucks, I would

633
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
feel like a clean.

634
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
A what?

635
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,080
Also, just like right now at 28, I would really love to have $200 in my pocket.

636
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,360
When the gun went off and there was the flash of light, was there a sound?

637
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
No.

638
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Okay.

639
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,120
I want to hop back downstairs and let Mildred know.

640
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,160
We all came here together, but did we take separate cars?

641
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,680
I want to know where the camera is basically.

642
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,200
I want to take a picture of this room with the camera and I want to see if her shooting

643
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,400
anything is like reactive.

644
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,240
I want to see if it's the green lights on again.

645
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Okay.

646
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,040
So if I have to go back to the station or whatever and get it.

647
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,080
It can be in your cruiser outside.

648
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,440
You probably took two cruisers here because Keith is probably not driving.

649
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Nope.

650
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
So has anything changed with the camera?

651
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
Is the green light back on?

652
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
No, it's red.

653
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,600
I want to take it into the room.

654
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,440
So you rush out the front door.

655
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,880
Keith and Clark, you guys come back downstairs and Mildred is sitting on her couch in a Snuggie

656
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,300
drinking some tea, watching TV.

657
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,540
As I run by, I'm like, Hey Mildred, has Tildy ever disappeared in a flash of light before?

658
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,540
I'll be right back.

659
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
But think on that.

660
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,940
She kind of looks up at the two of you as you come down the stairs.

661
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,540
As John comes running back inside, she's like super blazed in her eyes.

662
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,020
Hey Tildy, honestly, for somebody who smokes weed all the time, it seems like you cannot

663
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,740
handle your shit.

664
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,260
Just in as I'm running back to Tildy's room.

665
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,460
Anyway, you smoke some weak ass grass.

666
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,700
Hey Mildred.

667
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Hey.

668
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,340
You got any of that peppermint tea still?

669
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
It's sitting right here for you.

670
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,380
I go over and I'm just sitting at the kitchen table or whatever it is, head in hand, drinking

671
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,380
it.

672
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Did you know that she had a gun?

673
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380
She?

674
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
She had a what?

675
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,500
She had a gun and also she's not here anymore.

676
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,180
What do you mean she's not here anymore?

677
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,940
We don't know where she is, but she ain't here.

678
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,380
Wasn't she upstairs?

679
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,380
He knows more about it than we do.

680
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:18,340
Tildy B. Tildy B.

681
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,620
I'm upstairs in her room.

682
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,060
I'm just like, no, she disappeared in light.

683
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
We told you.

684
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Never know.

685
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Drowning out.

686
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
All I know.

687
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
There's nobody home.

688
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,340
Nobody home.

689
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
There's nobody home.

690
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Fight, fight.

691
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,340
Street me down.

692
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Takes me back.

693
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
To where you're from.

694
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Don't stop.

695
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,340
Don't stop.

696
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
Don't stop.

697
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,340
Don't stop.

698
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,340
Don't stop.

699
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:03,340


700
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:46,340
Don't stop.

701
00:30:46,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Don't give up.

702
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Don't give up.

703
00:31:31,340 --> 00:32:00,340
Don't give up.

704
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:10,340
Don't give up.
