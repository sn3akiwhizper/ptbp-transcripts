1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Well, how do you do, pupparoos?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,760
It's your grown-ass pup mother, Wolf the dog.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,240
And I am here to provide nourishment for your wittle ears.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,040
It's also live, I'm told.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,840
From 694.2 PTBP, maybe.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,440
The only radio station that can broadcast

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,700
in multiple dimensions, probably.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,400
But what I'm rock solid for sure about

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,520
is the fact that we got a new Howlin' with Wolf,

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,820
everyone named Wolf's favorite segment.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,800
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,840
Nick with Everything's a Mimic,

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,080
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,880
which is, whoa, something you can do too, dear listener.

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,520
So cool of you, wow.

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,360
Nick with Everything's a Mimic writes,

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,160
hello, Mr. Dog, long-time listener, first-time writer.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,520
Normally, I would take this opportunity

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,560
to shout out the actual play podcast, Everything's a Mimic,

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,560
and our players, Ryan D, Ryan B, Chris, Cody, and Andy.

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,080
Normally, this would also be the perfect time

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,000
to shout out our website, Everything's a Mimic dot com.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,640
But now is just not that time,

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,080
for I have seen the yellow sign.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,480
Its insignia dances carelessly and purposely

26
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,780
in and out of the black void of our empty vessels

27
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,280
like the ebb and flow of the ocean's embrace.

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,880
The pallid mask seeks all who are willing,

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,960
and, oh shit, I ran out of characters.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,320
Love you, PTBP boys.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,380
Thanks for the love, Nick with Everything's a Mimic.

32
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,460
Can anyone who knows what the fuck a podcast is

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,960
tell me what an actual play is?

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,300
Do they actually do things?

35
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,980
Or do they imaginarily do things?

36
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,060
Is an actual play like a real Shakespeare?

37
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,860
I'm so confused by the internet and all it beholds.

38
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,520
One day, when I remember my AOL password,

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,660
I'll get to get back on there and see what's poppin'.

40
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,060
If you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,

41
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,340
tag at PretendingPod on the internets.

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,460
Or don't, what do I care?

43
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,580
Though I will say it warms my producer's bones

44
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,220
every time he sees kind words written about pretending

45
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,400
to be people out there on the damn internet.

46
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,600
So if you wanna positively impact my producer's day,

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,860
and maybe write some words for wolf to say,

48
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,660
tag at PretendingPod and check out this segue.

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,460
One gave me a bruise, the other gave me the blues.

50
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,140
The first part's a segue, and next it's the news.

51
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,260
The boy on the table, Carl Lambert's long-lost brother,

52
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,740
who somehow hasn't aged in three decades,

53
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,820
seems to have been bitten by something

54
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,780
that looks a bit like a tick.

55
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,140
But it's got more than eight legs,

56
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,820
and last I recall, ticks can't normally

57
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,420
phase through matter, like if they wanted

58
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,200
to get into Doreen Morreen's boot

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,540
just by pullin' some kind of Hayden Christensen

60
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,380
and Jumper nonsense.

61
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,100
But this here is, indeed, some Jake Gyllenhaal

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,300
crawlin' around with Danny DeVito

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,340
while chasin' car crashes in his blue kinda stuff.

64
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,180
The Chuckster hollowed for Agent Morreen

65
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,880
to pour some of the potion out of the cauldron

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,740
and into her boot, which she promptly did.

67
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,920
Hopefully, luckily, this elixir was exceptionally brewed

68
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,860
by Dr. Rusty Hooch, all while Dr. Olivia Miller

69
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,220
just stared at the rash around the bite

70
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,180
on the unnaturally young boy's bruised and bloodied chest.

71
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,820
The rash rippled like waves from the terrible epicenter,

72
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,380
and the flushed bumps formed a target

73
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,140
on the most recent victim's body.

74
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,140
Unrelated, here's Molly Healy with Circles.

75

76
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,140
["Circles of Death"]

77
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,740
So I was writing down secret things

78
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,900
that I'm not allowed to see, but it's in my eye line.

79
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,820
That's like when people are like,

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,580
"'Don't look at my cards,"

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,660
and they're like showing you their cards.

82
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,620
It's like, it's not my decision,

83
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,300
my mental decision to look at your cards,

84
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,900
but physically, my body will turn towards your cards.

85
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,020
Yeah, like guess what, bitch?

86
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,800
God helps those who help themselves, so hide it.

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Oh my God, I love God.

["In the Arms of the Angel"]

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,000
You know when you're just like loving God?

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
Sarah McLachlan.

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,240
All right, Ellie.

93
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
I, uh.

94
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,920
All right.

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,760
You first.

96
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,160
Did you open your email, Zach?

97
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,520
Oh God, what?

98
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,200
I don't know if it's linked to your email, though.

99
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,400
It might not be, nevermind.

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,440
Eleanor Tilleranzo just became a patron

101
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,440
of pretending to be people at one of the coolest tiers.

102
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
420?

103
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,120
No, 420 a month would be a hell of a Patreon tier.

104
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,460
She's at the $6.66 level.

105
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,960
Yeah, hell yeah.

106
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,060
You can be a patron at the $5 level

107
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,480
at patreon.com slash pretending pod,

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,920
and you can get all of our bonus audio content there,

109
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,120
including full episodes of full Delta Green

110
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,040
like home brew campaign that I ran for the boys,

111
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,560
and you can have Taylor's phone call fully sound

112
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,300
as your ringtone.

113
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,140
Ring, ring.

114
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,980
It's on.

115
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,800
Ring, ring.

116
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
But I think Chuck's version of it would be like,

117
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,680
bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.

118
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,720
Bring it, bro.

119
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,560
All right, but Eleanor signed up

120
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,200
at the much cooler $6.66 level,

121
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,120
which is all the exact same rewards.

122
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,820
It's just a cooler number.

123
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,820
Yeah, and I wanna be cool.

124
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,600
So far, so good.

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,660
Right, right, right?

126
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,660
No, I was never cool, but I was cold.

127
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,080
My heart is dead.

128
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,720
No, I'm kidding.

129
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,220
What were you like in school?

130
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,080
I was a slut, to be honest.

131
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
If you guys haven't figured it out,

132
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,780
but I was totally, at least by American standards.

133
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,240
But I wasn't judged for it, which was great.

134
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,080
Oh, that's great.

135
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,260
That's nice.

136
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,260
I was fondling the D and the P all up in high school,

137
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
but no one really judged me for it.

138
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,760
Wait, what's the difference between the D and the P?

139
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,880
One is a hole and one is like a thing

140
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,760
that really shoves things into a hole.

141
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,360
Wait, what are you putting in between the penis

142
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,920
and the vagina to have sex?

143
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
I get it.

144
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,600
You shoving something in?

145
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,480
No, no, the P stands for, okay,

146
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,880
the P stands for pussy, pussy.

147
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
I thought you were like,

148
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm playing with dicks and penises,

149
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,660
and I'm like, I don't wanna discredit your sluttiness,

150
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,440
but that's the same damn thing.

151
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,480
Yeah, you would also be like,

152
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
that's when you find out I was lying.

153
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm like, I was playing with something called the dick

154
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,460
and I'm the penis with my vagina.

155
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,480
I stuck my vagina inside his penis.

156
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,760
That's how you do it, right?

157
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,680
And then I got pregnant.

158
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
No, I didn't.

159
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,040
That was a lot later.

160
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Pretending to be teen pregnant.

161
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,080
You're like, Junie's actually 10 years old.

162
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,280
I know she's just developing a little slower.

163
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,680
Swedish babies take a little longer to cook.

164
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,800
We're like elves, 3,000 years old,

165
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,940
but it's like, oh, or baby Yoda.

166
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,480
Spoilers.

167
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,160
Spoilers, baby Yoda exists.

168
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,920
Yo, are you watching Boba Fett?

169
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,080
So here's the thing, Zach,

170
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,280
when you become a parent,

171
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,320
you have to basically choose your form of entertainment

172
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,200
because you have 10 minutes a day, maybe.

173
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,760
And I've put mine into Yellowstone, great show,

174
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,280
in case you guys haven't checked it out

175
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,800
because I'm super into Western awful people, apparently.

176
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,400
So that's who I like to watch.

177
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,080
Hell yeah, that rules.

178
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,280
I don't know what, I was just gonna talk about

179
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,080
how Thundercat is the cameo in the last episode

180
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,580
of Boba Fett and it made me so happy.

181
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,840
He's a bass player who's fucking awesome.

182
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,680
He's like-

183
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,500
Wait.

184
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,020
Thundercat, like the Thundercats, like the lion?

185
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,540
No, that would be so fucking rad.

186
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,540
No, it's a very cool musician

187
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,180
who Taylor is singing Dragon Ball Durag right now,

188
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,780
which is a bop.

189
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,060
Such a fun song.

190
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,260
Such a good song.

191
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,340
He's such a cool guy.

192
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,540
He like wears like-

193
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,540
It's like kimono print boxers that are like silky.

194
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,580
Dragon Ball Z embroidered logo on them.

195
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,900
It's like, he's a nerd and he's sexy

196
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,360
and he makes dope music and he's in Star Wars now.

197
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,100
So he's my hero.

198
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,620
Wait, Boba Fett is Star Wars?

199
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,460
Oh my God.

200
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,100
Yeah, Boba Fett is the assassin, right?

201
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,460
Like he's a hired, to me, the clone's out of him.

202
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,780
All right, midichlorians, let's dive into the-

203
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,060
The fourth episode of-

204
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,380
Live long and may the peace be on upon you.

205
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,180
Give you peace as you sleep and may you know

206
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,900
that the Lord, your God, loves you very, very much.

207
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,340
That is what my parents said to me every night

208
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,020
before I went to sleep and dreamed about demons.

209
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,860
Let's go.

210
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,020
So much to unpack.

211
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,860
So much to unpack.

212
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,500
Oh yeah, we all have religious trauma in this house.

213
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,700
Really, I need to know so much because I'm such an atheist.

214
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,340
Oh shit.

215
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,380
Raise your hand if you've spoken in tongues at this table.

216
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,220
What?

217
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,060
Yeah, that's two of us who acted like we were communicating

218
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,820
with the other side and no one thought it was cool.

219
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,420
It was like we were wearing khakis when we did it.

220
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,260
Like it wasn't fucking rad, it was lame and it's also cool.

221
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,500
I don't know, the church should lean into metal imagery

222
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,460
and I'd be way more into it.

223
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,700
All right, let's actually, let's play a game.

224
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,300
I like a bit of chitchat, but I'm very interested

225
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,940
to see what happens next and I have to know.

226
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,340
So let's get into this.

227
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,380
Well, it's like it's your choice.

228
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,460
You're either gonna let my cool ass boot move work

229
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,700
or Doreen, I guess, I don't know, loses a foot.

230
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,380
I don't know what's happening.

231
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,800
I do.

232
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,860
I have a sense, unfortunately, of what's about to happen.

233
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,700
Oh, unfortunately.

234
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,020
You know what, Zach?

235
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,380
I'll just take over from here.

236
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,340
Okay, sounds good.

237
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,340
Okay, so a little bit of meta game,

238
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,580
outside of the game knowledge,

239
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,220
just because it might be good to know this.

240
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,820
Okay, sometimes I just try to talk

241
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,140
and the thing I say is dumb and stupid, so.

242
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,980
Zach, I'm gonna need you to roll sanity for me.

243
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,540
Oh, that happens to me all the time.

244
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,940
I've had a new catchphrase around the house recently

245
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,820
when Taylor's like, what did you just say?

246
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,100
I say, I'm allowed to say stupid things.

247
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,420
He's been saying it so often.

248
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,060
I've been saying a lot of stupid shit recently.

249
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,380
You're not allowed to divorce me

250
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,620
because I say stupid things.

251
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
Just because I'm an idiot

252
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,500
doesn't mean you should love me any less.

253
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,740
He blamed COVID quite a bit.

254
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,580
Yeah.

255
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,620
Apparently COVID makes you dumber.

256
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,100
Yeah, I'm a fucking idiot now.

257
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,620
When I was pregnant, I blamed it all the time.

258
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,460
I'm like, guys, it's the pregnancy brain,

259
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,820
you know, it's the mom brain.

260
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,020
And so every time I say something dumb,

261
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,420
it's what I blame.

262
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,580
But one day you realize it's all a lie, Zach.

263
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,420
I know.

264
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,580
You're just stupid.

265
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,580
Well, I'd been doing dry January

266
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,700
and so previously I was like,

267
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,380
it's just cause I'm high all the time.

268
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,820
But apparently, no, it's not.

269
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,660
So I-

270
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,220
Oh wait, for dry January,

271
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,740
you're not allowed to smoke either?

272
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,020
Well, that's what I gave a go.

273
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,860
Zach set rules.

274
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,700
You're doing sober January.

275
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,060
He's doing fully clear mind January.

276
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,900
Until last night and I'm-

277
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,340
All right, but I'll get back.

278
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,980
I'll get back on for the rest of the month.

279
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,180
How about that?

280
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,660
Taylor gave me a look like, really, motherfucker?

281
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,180
Well, last night he's like, I think I'm done.

282
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,500
I think January is over.

283
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,420
It's February negative 11th.

284
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,420
Yep.

285
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,540
Amazing.

286
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,580
February, the shittiest month.

287
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,180
Like it always gets treated so poorly.

288
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,020
It's like you get 28 days

289
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,500
and now minus 11.

290
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,060
The 39 days of February.

291
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,620
All right, let's-

292
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,420
On the negative 10th day of February,

293
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,260
I drink a beer.

294
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,780
God fucking scared.

295
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,580
All right, let us begin.

296
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,420
He can't decide if he's going to let my cool thing happen.

297
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,900
Have faith.

298
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,060
George Michael this situation and let's get into it.

299
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,660
We were in dexterity order.

300
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,100
It was during Marine's turn.

301
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,820
Now it is Dr. Miller's turn.

302
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,540
Oh no, I hate, wait.

303
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,540
Right at the top of the episode.

304
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,980
Yeah, fuck, man.

305
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,660
Okay, so just like a brief little thing,

306
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,100
what was summary of what happened.

307
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,180
Eleanor, that's a really good point.

308
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,380
Let's give a quick rundown of everything that happened

309
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,620
in each of your introductions.

310
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,460
No, I'm just kidding.

311
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,700
So you guys got here,

312
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,740
you got your hazmat suits on ready to go.

313
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,220
They came out with the camera to shoot a Bush video.

314
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,380
You told them, hey, I'm not here to be on camera

315
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,900
until I know this shit is real.

316
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,180
Let's get inside.

317
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,180
As you get inside, you all see not the body of a Bigfoot,

318
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,180
but rather the blues and bruddy body of a 12 year old boy

319
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,180
who is just filled with bullet holes from a 12 gauge.

320
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,540
And there's just blood everywhere pouring onto this tarp

321
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,420
that he's laying on, which is on a pool table.

322
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,740
Carl yells out for his younger brother, Michael,

323
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,180
and he's just begins weeping and weeping.

324
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,140
Michael, his brother who disappeared at age 12,

325
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,940
Carl and his dad both said that Bigfoot had abducted

326
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,780
this boy.

327
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,020
That's what they remember happening in their minds.

328
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,340
That's how they must've explained it to themselves

329
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,620
to try to explain it to other people.

330
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,100
And so now everyone's kind of running around.

331
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,980
Dr. Miller's looking at the body.

332
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,420
Doreen Marine has grabbed this substance, this potion,

333
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,100
if you will, that's in a tiny cauldron

334
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,620
for some goddamn reason.

335
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,580
And then she's pouring it into her boot because Charles,

336
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,700
the Chuckster has screamed that she needs to pour this

337
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,780
into her boot.

338
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,820
Not knowing what's actually in this potion

339
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,460
could just be acid that melts her entire fucking foot off.

340
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,740
I mean, whatever you gotta do.

341
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,140
Dr. Hooch is the one who's created

342
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,260
this pharmaceutical remedy with a critical success

343
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,740
while in the lab.

344
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,580
Janice is on the ground underneath Charles, the Chuckster,

345
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,380
who has just disarmed her and is keeping her.

346
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,220
I feel like you're kind of like on her back a little bit.

347
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,340
Yeah, I've got my knee down kind of over her.

348
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,660
Riding her like a pony.

349
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,500
Absolutely.

350
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,140
That's some genuine Chuckster moves right there.

351
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,540
Jump on it.

352
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,420
I'm doing like a little lasso, fake lasso spin.

353
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
Janice.

354
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,180
And Carl and Jerome are kind of in this weird back and forth

355
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,740
where Carl keeps rolling fails on his sanity

356
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,940
to kind of get upset,

357
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,860
but Jerome keeps rolling really well to calm him down

358
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,500
and they're fucking homies.

359
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,460
And you can tell guys, as you're looking at the two of them,

360
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,620
their bond seems to be unshakable.

361
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,660
These two dudes have lived life together

362
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,020
for the past three years.

363
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,100
Honestly, it's cool to see men of this age

364
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
being so emotionally full.

365
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,340
Yeah, fucking gay man.

366
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,060
And this is why it's hard for,

367
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,740
yeah, it's hard to be a man in 2018.

368
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,580
Yeah.

369
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,140
Woe is the white man.

370
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,820
Yeah.

371
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,620
Cause Ali's always calling me gay.

372
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,860
I'm such a bully.

373
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,620
Yeah, wait, that's bullying to call me gay, Ali?

374
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,340
Yeah, because being gay is so bad.

375
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,180
Oh no.

376
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,780
Quick reminder for the audience.

377
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,900
Gays suck.

378
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,460
Oh my God.

379
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,060
Double down.

380
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,860
I prefer calling him weak, emotionally weak.

381
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,540
Holy shit.

382
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm rubber, you're glue.

383
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,820
You like pussy and I like you.

384
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,700
We talked about that last episode.

385
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,420
What if you guys found out I'm super homophobic

386
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,220
or something awesomely awful?

387
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,060
Right in the middle of the fourth episode,

388
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,420
you're a bigot and we're like, what the fuck?

389
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,220
Yeah, no, but honestly guys.

390
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,220
I can't wait to leave a review on how I was treated

391
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,220
on this podcast.

392
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,820
I think we're now, we stayed very on track

393
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,340
with the rundown of what's happened so far.

394
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,860
And I think that probably gave Dr. Miller enough time

395
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,420
to figure out exactly what she's doing

396
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,380
with this first turn of her round.

397
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,220
What is that?

398
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,100
I've been trying to, I've been trying to catch

399
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,820
this little tick for the past 60 rounds.

400
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,660
So I think if she can see it now, can she see it now?

401
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,660
Can we all see it?

402
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,500
Nope.

403
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,540
Does she know that it went in the boot?

404
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,380
It does not.

405
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,260
Oh, it already went into the boot.

406
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,620
Oh shit.

407
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,460
Then.

408
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,860
Oh, I'm sorry, fuck.

409
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,940
I mean, you should have all assumed

410
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,740
because I had her pour a potion down in her boot.

411
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,620
Yeah, you could maybe yell something in character right now

412
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,820
for just the story to make sense, I guess,

413
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,660
maybe a little bit.

414
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,980
It's the alien bomb.

415
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,980
Bug.

416
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,820
Where is it?

417
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
In the boot.

418
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,940
Okay.

419
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,140
I don't know why.

420
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,860
It's the alien bug in the boot, all right.

421
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,980
It's the alien bug in the boot.

422
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,380
It's the alien bug in the boot.

423
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,580
It's the alien bug, it's the alien bug,

424
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,420
it's the alien bug in the boot.

425
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,700
So Dr. Miller, she sees Doreen Morin

426
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,380
pouring the liquid into her boot and she's like, oh no.

427
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,300
And so she hurries over and I think tries

428
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,700
to get the boot off of Dr. Morin.

429
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,540
I'm sorry, Dr. Morin.

430
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,860
Morin, Doreen.

431
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,700
You've been upgraded.

432
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,620
You upgraded, yeah.

433
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,460
You're a doctor now, we're all a doctor.

434
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,300
Look at me.

435
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,740
I guess technically we're supposed to all be doctors.

436
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,580
I think we're all.

437
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,420
I'm a doctor, you're a doctor.

438
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,260
Oh right, med students.

439
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,300
We are all supposed to be.

440
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,740
Oh, that's right.

441
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,580
She says, doctor.

442
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,420
Yes, doctor.

443
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,260
Get your boot off, doctor.

444
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,080
Take your clothes off.

445
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,920
Okay, doctor.

446
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,740
Take your clothes off.

447
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,620
I strip naked.

448
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,180
Yeah, not those clothes.

449
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,780
Okay, down to her boots.

450
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,100
Hey, quick question, Zach.

451
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,740
How does it get in the boot if she has a hazmat suit on?

452
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,940
You don't know that it went in the boot.

453
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,740
The thing that I told you when no one else was listening.

454
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,220
Wow, you are the Luke of this group.

455
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,060
Jesus Christ.

456
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,660
Do we need to take our?

457
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,580
Oh yeah.

458
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,660
I remember how it got in the boot.

459
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,140
If it even is in the boot, you know.

460
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,980
That's a good point.

461
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,140
That's a good point.

462
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,980
Okay, Dr. Miller runs forward to Maureen

463
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,660
and tries to like, is it in the boot?

464
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,500
Is it in the boot?

465
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,780
And then she's panically trying to get the boot off

466
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,480
and try to find this thing.

467
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,620
I like to think that Doreen Maureen loves her military boots

468
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,880
so goddamn much that she took them off

469
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,060
to put on the hazmat suit and then put the boots on

470
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,580
over the bottoms of the hazmat suit,

471
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,460
which is how she was able to pour this liquid

472
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,620
down into the boots while still wearing the hazmat suit.

473
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,060
Done, he's in the hazmat suit.

474
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,380
It's still over my foot.

475
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,220
Let's be clear about that.

476
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,940
Yeah, oh, it's definitely still over your foot.

477
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,420
And so Dr. Miller helps you remove the boot.

478
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,260
Okay.

479
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,700
Yeah, you take the boot off, you look inside,

480
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,060
you don't see anything.

481
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,040
Sick, where the fuck is it?

482
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,880
Yes.

483
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,260
You scream and Janice Ruth looks up

484
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,940
and she's like, what, where's what?

485
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,500
As she's being straddled by the truckster.

486
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,820
Where's what, what are you guys talking about?

487
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,260
And Jerome is like, wait, you said alien bug?

488
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,840
The fuck is going on?

489
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,260
What do you know?

490
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,540
They're cool, it's cool, they're cool, you can tell them.

491
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,420
All right, based on the stretch marks

492
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,540
on this poor boy over here,

493
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,060
I have reason to believe that it used to be something

494
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,620
that it's not anymore.

495
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,340
And what we saw was a tick running away from it.

496
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,420
And I can only assume tick tend to be only feeding off

497
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,780
organic live material.

498
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,820
If this boy has been dead for a while,

499
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,420
as I understand, several decades,

500
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,780
this doesn't make any sense.

501
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,740
So we need to find this tick.

502
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,980
So basically Dr. Miller reveals everything

503
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,340
she heard in private.

504
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,180
And then Chuck yells,

505
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,940
where, ticker, where, where, where.

506
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,980
Sorry, that's how I get into character.

507
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,820
Totally.

508
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,140
This isn't no normal tick though, bro.

509
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,900
This tick is like jumpy in time and space

510
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,500
and like versus there and then it's there

511
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,860
and then it's there and then guess what, what?

512
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,300
Where is it?

513
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,700
Is that true?

514
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,540
Is that true?

515
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Then we can all be infected right now.

516
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,220
All I'm saying is that's what I saw, dude.

517
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,660
Everybody roll sanity, helplessness.

518
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,060
This is called helplessness.

519
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,900
Jesus.

520
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,220
You feel helpless and it's a ness.

521
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,060
Super fail.

522
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,900
11.

523
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,180
Not Loch Ness, it's just Bigfoot.

524
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,020
What?

525
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,180
78 on a 34.

526
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,420
A fail, lose one sanity.

527
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,780
I also failed 91 on a 54.

528
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,100
Lose one sanity.

529
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,820
11 on a 59.

530
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,060
Nice, critical success.

531
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,860
You gain sanity.

532
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,540
I gain sanity and I don't even know

533
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,740
if this tick is in my hazmat suit right now.

534
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,540
Critical success.

535
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,500
You're able to keep your head very much on your shoulders

536
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,420
and we'll go to Eleanor real quick for her sanity.

537
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,780
39 on a 55.

538
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,580
Congratulations, zero sanity lost in this situation.

539
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,100
You too will be able to act with a cutting edge movement.

540
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,140
You too, the edge.

541
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,300
All right, so shit.

542
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,740
Lindsay, because you critically succeeded

543
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,140
on your sanity check,

544
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,980
I am going to give you some information

545
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,140
that nobody else can hear.

546
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,140
So take off your headphones, wiggle your ears.

547
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,140
Hey, Ally, maybe don't fucking put your fingers

548
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,900
in your ears this time.

549
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,740
They can go on the outside.

550
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,100
Guys, it's been a joke from the beginning.

551
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,580
We don't do bits on this podcast, Ally.

552
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,940
Lindsay.

553
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,420
Yes, that's Doreen.

554
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,620
Doreen feels a bite on her foot.

555
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,060
Because you're clear and present in this situation,

556
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,020
it's very, very apparent to you

557
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,860
that underneath the hazmat suit, you've been bitten.

558
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,100
You know the feeling when you like see a bug

559
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,420
and then your skin starts to fucking crawl,

560
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,180
like you think that they're on you?

561
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,700
You feel that feeling all over your entire body.

562
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,620
Because you critically succeeded on your sanity,

563
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,300
I'm not gonna have your sanity again.

564
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,980
So you're gonna be able to have your wits about you

565
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,100
in this situation.

566
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,020
Stay calm, take care of it.

567
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,740
Can I just cut, just chop?

568
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,860
Can I just chop that bad boy off?

569
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,740
You can do whatever you would like to do.

570
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,940
I'm gonna get them back.

571
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,340
If that's your first instinct,

572
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,060
there's definitely a hatchet on the wall.

573
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,300
Like this is a barn slash camping, hunting.

574
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,260
And we have equipment to sew me back up.

575
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,220
Definitely.

576
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,060
Okay.

577
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,340
I mean, the mobile lab is probably a better option

578
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,940
for cutting off your foot than the hatchet

579
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,460
that you see on the wall.

580
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,220
You would only know that

581
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,420
because you critically succeed on the sanity.

582
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,580
Otherwise that hatchet's the best thing in the world.

583
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,980
All right, so I'm gonna bring them back

584
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,820
and then you can act.

585
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,660
Yes?

586
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,500
Yeah.

587
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,660
Okay.

588
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,140
Hello, come on back please.

589
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,780
Is this, okay.

590
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,420
Doreen just screams fuck

591
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,460
and just runs outside to the mobile lab.

592
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
Runs outside?

593
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,580
Runs outside.

594
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,460
Do you leave the door open?

595
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,300
She left us.

596
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,100
No, I closed the door behind me.

597
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,300
To the cabin.

598
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,140
To the cabin.

599
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,580
You just slam it behind you as you run out?

600
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,420
Yeah.

601
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,860
She left us.

602
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,940
She left us.

603
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,500
Dr. Hooch, you're up.

604
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,020
All right.

605
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,860
Fuck.

606
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,100
Did I see the tick going towards Doreen?

607
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,940
I don't know.

608
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,140
Did I tell you that you saw a tick going towards Doreen?

609
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,020
No, I don't think so.

610
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,860
I don't think you saw a tick going towards Doreen.

611
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,220
Okay, so all I know is that my potion

612
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,820
has been poured on a foot

613
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,980
instead of where I intended for it to go.

614
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,460
Uh-huh.

615
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,380
Hey, quick question.

616
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,300
Doreen, did you leave the rest of the vial,

617
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,260
the rest of the cauldron on the ground next to you?

618
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,740
And did you pour all of it?

619
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,580
No, remember at the end of the last episode

620
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,420
I said not all of it.

621
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,260
Not all of it.

622
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,580
Okay, okay, so there's a little bit left.

623
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,620
Okay, so I forget my British character.

624
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,020
Of course, yeah.

625
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,740
Fuck, God, God damn it.

626
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,100
Oh my God, my potion.

627
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,380
I jump for the cauldron.

628
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,020
I dive for the cauldron and grab it

629
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,620
and I scoop the rest of it up in it

630
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,260
and I'm on the ground scooping up

631
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,100
the rest of the potion into the cauldron.

632
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,980
Carl's going.

633
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,580
Is Carl near me?

634
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,220
No, he's on the other side of the pool table.

635
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,780
So yeah, I mean, he's just across

636
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,420
the pool table from you, I suppose.

637
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,660
Still elbows, staring at the corpse

638
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,380
of his younger brother who he fucking killed

639
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,940
and having a hard time getting over it.

640
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,580
It becomes clear to me pretty quickly

641
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,620
that Carl's emotions are gonna hinder us

642
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,340
in this process so I just throw

643
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,980
the rest of the cauldron on his face.

644
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,940
Holy shit, okay.

645
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,620
Yeah, go ahead and roll athletics just to,

646
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,460
I mean, I'll give you a plus 20

647
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,260
because he is completely still

648
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,940
and this seems pretty easy but in order

649
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,460
to get it enough of it.

650
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,820
And not on Jerome.

651
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,220
Oh, fuck.

652
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,780
Yeah.

653
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,820
49, or 46 on a 50.

654
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,660
Oh, nice, yeah.

655
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,860
So it splashes all over the face

656
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,660
of Carl Lambert and he's like,

657
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,660
whoa, what the, you're not British?

658
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,980
British?

659
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,340
As he like slowly slumps onto the ground

660
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,780
and Jerome is like, is that gonna knock him out

661
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,260
or kill him, what did you just do?

662
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,100
It'll just knock him out,

663
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,500
he'll just sleep real good for a bit.

664
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,340
Okay, okay, what's next?

665
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,180
What's next?

666
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,780
Fuck, fuck, where'd she go?

667
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,700
What is she doing?

668
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,060
It's Chuckster's turn.

669
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,980
I pull out my burner phone.

670
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,820
Well, I got this, guys.

671
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,900
And then I Google why this Bigfoot be a tick now though.

672
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,500
And then if you could just tell me

673
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,100
what my Google search results are.

674
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,380
Pull up your phone, grab your phone.

675
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,220
Yep.

676
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,220
Google why this Bigfoot be tick now.

677
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,060
Though.

678
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,900
Though.

679
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,060
Are you spelling though out

680
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,300
or is it just a THS situation?

681
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,060
Tick now though.

682
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,660
Stupid.

683
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,860
It says six steps what to do

684
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,220
when you find a tick on yourself.

685
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,980
Okay, this is great information.

686
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,940
Let's read off at least the first one.

687
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,780
Oh, wait, hold on.

688
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,820
The third result is a song by big homie G called Tick.

689
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,460
All right, Chuckster gets distracted by a song

690
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,660
instead of looking up what to do with a tick bite

691
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,220
which might've actually helped you in this situation.

692
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,780
It is Carl's turn.

693
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,620
He is asleep on the ground.

694
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
On a drink so I can't speak up,

695
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,980
bitch sucking my dick up.

696
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,740
If she bites, she gonna beat up.

697
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,580
I won't take no disrespect from no ho.

698
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,300
I'm a crazy bitch, I'm psycho.

699
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,420
Not a tip like a light show.

700
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,460
Gee, where you been?

701
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
Hell if I know.

702
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,740
Smoking runts, head in the sky, ho.

703
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,060
She says she's sick of me, bye ho.

704
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,900
I fucking hope.

705
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,060
Pull up that skirt, skirt.

706
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,060
Watching bitches stalk my bio.

707
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,140
I can't go nowhere without my money or my iron.

708
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,660
Okay, this is literally Chuckster's clicked on it

709
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,500
and this is just playing from his phone

710
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,060
and he's just looking at it now.

711
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,540
You fucking monster.

712
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,100
Janice's turn and Janice is still under him.

713
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,580
He is literally straddling Janice Ruth,

714
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,220
an asthmatic older woman,

715
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,780
and playing the song over his phone.

716
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,020
It is fucking-

717
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,900
Okay, honestly though, it's so relevant

718
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,180
because it says Johnny did these teeth.

719
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,820
Whole lotta cheese for these VV's.

720
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,660
I don't hardly be smiling but my shit big

721
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,580
when I say cheese like Carl's teeth.

722
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,940
Oh my God.

723
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,260
The truth comes out, I am big homie G.

724
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,980
This just turned into an episode

725
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,900
of Righteous Gems.

726
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,740
Oh my God, okay, it is Doreen Marine's turn.

727
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,100
Wait, so I wasn't helpful?

728
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,020
Oh no, I think you were extremely helpful.

729
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,820
I thought it was fucking, hey, I love you

730
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,860
and I loved that.

731
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,700
Oh my God.

732
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,340
Thank you, so I'm helping the mission

733
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,380
is what they all think?

734
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,220
I mean, unless there's like something in the wave,

735
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,580
like it would not be out of the realm

736
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,260
of Delta Green possibilities for the wavelengths

737
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,460
like underneath a song played by a certain Google search

738
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,540
would like pull up some sort of like spell like ability

739
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,140
in the air of the situation

740
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,300
but this is not one of those times.

741
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,100
Can I roll, wait, wait, wait, wait.

742
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,020
Can I roll military science?

743
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,980
Cause hear me out.

744
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,620
The military has been studying how to use music

745
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,940
to brainwash people into telling the truth.

746
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,700
Did you learn that in your one week at basic?

747
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,940
I spent two months there bitch.

748
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,380
And also, I'm sorry.

749
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,660
And also, so anyway, I think that I was

750
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,540
on the special forces team of basic training.

751
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,500
Oh my God.

752
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,780
I passed, so anyway, do with that what you will.

753
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,180
Your military science would tell you

754
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,300
that the action that you've just taken is not helpful.

755
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,820
Doreen, it's your turn.

756
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,220
What can I say here?

757
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,420
Is there anything off limits to say?

758
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,180
Let's have them take their headphones off.

759
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,340
Yeah, and let's just get this over with.

760
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,180
Wow.

761
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,540
Oh my God.

762
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,620
I mean, for your sake dude.

763
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,940
Okay, because I mean.

764
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,620
You're doing this alone?

765
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,220
Well, my actual brain wants to,

766
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,020
I'm trying to channel Doreen,

767
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,100
but I'm thinking like if I have full sanity during this,

768
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,060
my first thought would be I'm gonna run out

769
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,380
and grab tools to do this and come back.

770
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,220
And come back, okay.

771
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,460
And ask for help.

772
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,380
Right, okay.

773
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,340
Because if they know what's going on, it will help me.

774
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,980
And if I'm fully sane.

775
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,940
Totally.

776
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,780
Yeah.

777
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,300
The excruciating pain in your foot is growing

778
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,100
as you feel the bones in your foot begin to shatter.

779
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,940
I'm ready to get it off.

780
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,060
All of the bones in your foot just shattered

781
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:37,060
and your muscles are beginning to rip apart and reform.

782
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,940
All the tendons are stretching out in your foot.

783
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,700
You've never felt this much pain in your entire life.

784
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,820
Roll sanity.

785
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,140
Am I like hopping back into the?

786
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,980
Ugh.

787
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,300
No.

788
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,140
What did you roll?

789
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,260
99.

790
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,660
Are you fucking kidding me?

791
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,980
Fucking 99.

792
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,460
Are you serious?

793
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,300
Those dice are fucking cursed, dude.

794
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,300
These dice suck, I'm mad.

795
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,180
Hey, that's a critical failure.

796
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,020
I know.

797
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,340
On you realizing that you're about to turn

798
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,220
into a goddamn Bigfoot.

799
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,100
And you're by yourself.

800
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,100
I'm by myself.

801
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,340
I'm trying to get back, I tried to get back.

802
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,180
I tried.

803
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,940
Okay, so I'm gonna have you roll fight, flight or freeze

804
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,780
in this situation.

805
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,980
So I want you to rank them.

806
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,140
You're gonna roll a D six,

807
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,540
which is just the normal standard six sided dice

808
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,700
that you would use in normal games.

809
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,900
I say normal games like they're not lame.

810
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,500
Okay, so here's what I want you to do.

811
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,460
I want you to rank from most likely to least likely,

812
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,380
fight, flight or freeze.

813
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,940
So what is the most likely?

814
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,900
So fight.

815
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,460
Sorry, fight.

816
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,060
Allie and Taylor are being fucking wild,

817
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,060
rubbing their ears.

818
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,700
They have no clue what's going on.

819
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,540
You're making too much noise.

820
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,660
That's fair.

821
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,820
Oh, you can hear that?

822
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,500
No, I really can't hear anything.

823
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,700
I can't, I can't.

824
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,660
Okay, so I would definitely, my number one go to

825
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,940
as Dorian would be fight.

826
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,660
Okay, so that's four, five and six.

827
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,020
And then flight.

828
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,140
Okay, so that's two and three.

829
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,980
And then freeze.

830
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,340
Is one, so roll a D six.

831
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,180
Seven.

832
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,540
What the fuck?

833
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,620
I said, it's only got six sides Lindsay.

834
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,580
I read it wrong, I read it wrong.

835
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,660
It's a fancy dice, I couldn't see the thing.

836
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,660
Four, five, six is fight.

837
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,580
Hey Lindsay, Dorian Marine sees

838
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,340
a set of tools next to her.

839
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,700
She grabs a saw.

840
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,940
She's smart enough in this moment to strap her leg down

841
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,820
on this stretcher that is meant for the Bigfoot corpse.

842
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,100
And she cuts.

843
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,740
The first one is not the hardest actually.

844
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,580
Well, I'm feeling this other pain that seems worse.

845
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,180
It does seem worse until you hit a nerve.

846
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,580
And that's just this.

847
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,420
Just like running through the back of your head.

848
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,260
I mean, you just begin almost like violently coughing

849
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,860
and choking and your stomach hurts.

850
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,140
And if you have any food in your stomach, it's coming up

851
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,620
and you're just sawing and sawing and you start crying.

852
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,780
Tears are running down your face.

853
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,220
Just like hit the bone and then boom, you're just sawing.

854
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,340
Saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw

855
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,180
until finally crack.

856
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,540
This feeling is growing as it goes up into your ankle.

857
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,300
And as those bones begin to shatter

858
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,900
and the muscles begin to break,

859
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,100
it helps you cut the rest of your foot off.

860
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,260
Your entire foot is only hanging on by the skin

861
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,620
that is on the back of your calf,

862
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,260
attached to the skin on the back of your ankle

863
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,860
as you finally have cut through your Achilles tendon.

864
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,420
Just for listeners right now, I'm literally crying.

865
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,300
Yeah.

866
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,020
I mean, you start bleeding out almost immediately.

867
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:20,020
And so I need you to roll a D six and then add two

868
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,540
for how much hit points you lose.

869
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,740
One.

870
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,580
Wow, okay.

871
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,180
So one plus two is three, you lose three hit points

872
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,180
and Lindsey, you're gonna lose one D four to blood loss

873
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,460
every round until this is fixed.

874
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,820
What's your highest skill of medicine first aid?

875
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,720
Whoa, hang on.

876
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,740
I have zero in both.

877
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,540
Oh, you're fucked, dude.

878
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,820
Until someone comes out here,

879
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,980
you're bleeding out one D four per round.

880
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,860
Can I like scream as loud as possible for help?

881
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,460
Yes.

882
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,340
Yes, and I'll have them roll alertness.

883
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,180
Okay.

884
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,540
Do you need me to like scream?

885
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,980
That was absolutely miserable.

886
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,820
No, that was good.

887
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,140
I'm leaving the room from now on for those.

888
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,980
Yeah, sorry.

889
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,500
I thought that that wouldn't take as long,

890
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,660
but then some crazy fucking shit happened.

891
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,740
So Mabi, oh, Ellie.

892
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,820
She's scrolling this.

893
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,900
She's on Pinterest.

894
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,700
You on Pinterest, girl.

895
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,140
I was, I'm looking at pre-ordering the Elden Ring.

896
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,980
It looks so funny.

897
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,420
Oh, fuck yeah.

898
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,780
I need Dr. Miller, Rusty Hooch and the Chuckster

899
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,860
all to roll alertness real quick for me just to kick off.

900
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,700
Yes.

901
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,500
That's a big ass fail.

902
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,100
Big fail for me too.

903
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,380
Okay, Chuckster, you're the only one who hears

904
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,260
just the slightest faintest, just like blood curling scream.

905
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,660
Very, very muffled, but coming from outside.

906
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,820
Dr. Miller, it's your turn.

907
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,300
My D dog.

908
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,020
What's going on with my D dog?

909
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,860
Okay.

910
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,460
Seeing that she said like,

911
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,060
don't leave this house because we're all gonna die.

912
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,260
She's very disappointed in her colleague, Dr. Marine.

913
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:04,260
So she is going to take out a firearm from her hazmat suit

914
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,260
and actually follow Doreen ready to threaten her

915
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,060
to not leave and get back into the house.

916
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,980
And so she's gonna run after Doreen.

917
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,220
Yeah, you're gonna be able to make it

918
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,620
to the back of the van.

919
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,540
So you can start off the next turn, opening up that door.

920
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,300
It's gonna move on to Dr. Hooch.

921
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,220
Not Carl or Janice or anyone.

922
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,300
I mean, I want Dr. Hooch to have some power.

923
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,940
I just thought you were skipping.

924
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,980
Oh no, I'm actually skipping Jerome in this moment.

925
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,820
That's my bad.

926
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,020
Jerome, where'd she go?

927
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,060
Alien bug.

928
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,300
Someone tell me what the fuck is going on here.

929
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,500
I didn't know this shit was happening either.

930
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,460
You've knocked him out.

931
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,580
Do we need to...

932
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,940
Janice, are you okay?

933
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,780
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay.

934
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,820
I just need you to stay calm.

935
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,500
Okay, do you need to be on her right now?

936
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,180
I was just getting comfortable, but I mean, I guess not.

937
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,620
Hey, Janice, you gonna be cool?

938
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,580
Janice, be cool, please.

939
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,180
She trusts Jerome dire enough to where she's like,

940
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,820
okay, okay.

941
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,580
And she's just gonna walk back over

942
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,740
and go sit on the couch that's in the corner of the room.

943
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,860
And she's just sitting there

944
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,780
and she's just got her head in her hands

945
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,460
and she starts weeping uncontrollably.

946
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,980
Dr. Falsom, what do we do?

947
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,300
What is the plan?

948
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,140
What is happening?

949
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,780
You've got two people gone already.

950
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,100
I'm losing trust in Jerome Dyer.

951
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,260
I'm becoming suspicious of him.

952
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,060
Okay, I pull out a gun, I point it right at Jerome

953
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,300
and I say, show me your fucking ID right now.

954
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,260
What the fuck, dude?

955
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,740
Are you kidding me?

956
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,500
I'm the one who brought you here.

957
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,540
I don't trust you for shit.

958
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,420
You have no, you clearly have no fucking clue

959
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,820
what's going on. What would my ID do?

960
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,660
Show it to me.

961
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,780
Can she roll like an alertness or something

962
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,020
to see if she trusts him

963
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,220
or like to see if he's doing anything that might be.

964
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,060
Roll human.

965
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,900
Okay.

966
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,180
Human intelligence.

967
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,340
It's reading people.

968
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,740
Hugh Mint.

969
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,860
Is it 10?

970
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,700
Mr. Mint, Hugh Mint.

971
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,020
48 on a 10.

972
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,260
Yeah, unaware you continue your shitty line

973
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,940
and questioning piece of shit.

974
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,020
And he's like, I don't know what this will prove,

975
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,740
but he reaches back in his back pocket.

976
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,820
Okay, as he's reaching down, I just fucking tackle him.

977
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,420
Jesus Christ.

978
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,420
Okay, roll unarmed combat.

979
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,620
35 on a 40.

980
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,540
98.

981
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,460
Yeah, you take him right to the ground.

982
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,260
I mean, he's a small little nerd man.

983
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,260
And so fucking bang having banging black turtleneck

984
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:47,260
wearing Dr. Hootch just like lunges over the pool table,

985
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,740
over the corpse and just spears this dude into the ground.

986
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,820
Tight tackle, bro.

987
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,460
I'm saying, what do you know?

988
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,300
What do you know?

989
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,580
I know you know something.

990
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
I don't know shit.

991
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,540
What the fuck?

992
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,580
We're just trying to stop.

993
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,260
There's an alien bug apparently

994
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,660
and you're not doing anything to stop it.

995
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,100
And it's Chuckster's turn.

996
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,380
I'm still like humming the tune of my big homie G song.

997
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,740
And it's Carl's turn.

998
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,500
No, I'm still humming it under my breath.

999
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,460
And then I kind of like come to and I'm like,

1000
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,300
what are we doing?

1001
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,420
We can't be fighting ourselves, bros.

1002
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,380
We gotta be helping each other take down this alien dick.

1003
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,020
Now I say we all go out there and check on our friend.

1004
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,180
Come on.

1005
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,860
I am trying to keep control of this situation clearly

1006
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,980
because nobody else is.

1007
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,780
Everyone's just letting sheer chaos happen.

1008
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,740
So I'll just hold down the Fort in here.

1009
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,020
I'm still on top of Carl or Jerome, sorry.

1010
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,820
You're on top of the sleepy, sleepy Carl.

1011
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,980
I'm keeping control of this situation.

1012
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,700
Okay, so you leave?

1013
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,260
Yeah, I'm gonna run after Dr. Miller.

1014
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,300
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

1015
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,820
So Carl's still asleep.

1016
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,100
Janice Ruth is crying on the couch.

1017
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:59,100
And Doreen, you've got a D4 to roll please.

1018
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,420
A D4.

1019
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,260
It's a pyramid.

1020
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,080
It's a little pyramid.

1021
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,920
This guy?

1022
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,220
Yeah.

1023
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,060
Three.

1024
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,180
Three.

1025
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,020
You know what to do.

1026
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,180
Like in yellow, back in yellow, back in yellow.

1027
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,380
Dr. Miller, you run out into the darkness.

1028
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,920
The street lamp is shining down.

1029
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,220
It's the only thing.

1030
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,820
Snow begins falling.

1031
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,060
I think that's nice.

1032
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,420
Snow begins falling down through the street light.

1033
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,840
It's actually really, really beautiful.

1034
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,680
And as you-

1035
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,180
It's the most wonderful time.

1036
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,780
Starts playing as you open up the back doors

1037
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,740
of this sprinter van.

1038
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,500
And Lindsay, can you describe what she sees?

1039
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,140
I'm still just screaming and like growling

1040
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:45,140
and trying to put pressure on this nub of a leg.

1041
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,660
Could you demonstrate the screaming and the growling?

1042
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,500
Ugh.

1043
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,920
Something like that.

1044
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,440
Like big, nevermind.

1045
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,180
Like big what?

1046
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,420
Big poop sounds.

1047
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,720
Yeah.

1048
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,560
I understand.

1049
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,980
I didn't understand before, but now I get the sound.

1050
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,060
You know when someone cuts off their foot

1051
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,660
and they make sounds like-

1052
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,500
Big poop sounds.

1053
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,340
Big poop sounds.

1054
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,180
Poop, poop, poop.

1055
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,340
Wait, wait, wait.

1056
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,780
She's putting pressure on a fucking nub.

1057
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,620
On a nub.

1058
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,460
And you see her foot and ankle standing up

1059
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,460
on the stretcher next to her.

1060
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,740
She's like strapped her leg down onto the stretcher.

1061
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,700
Blood is pouring out between her fingers.

1062
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,100
She has no idea what to do.

1063
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,860
She is at less than half of her hit points.

1064
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,820
And so she is turning white in the face

1065
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,700
as she's crying and screaming and gurgling.

1066
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,700
And literally the foot that is next to her is transforming.

1067
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,860
So I need you to roll sanity real quick.

1068
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,240
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1069
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,420
Bigfoot foot.

1070
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,860
Bigfoot foot, but only the foot so far.

1071
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,780
Point of a Bigfoot.

1072
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,780
Yeah, that's a big old 91 on 55 sanity.

1073
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,180
This is extremely unnatural.

1074
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,900
And so I'm going to have you roll a D4 and add one.

1075
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,020
Four.

1076
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,060
Four plus one?

1077
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,880
Three plus one.

1078
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,720
So four.

1079
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,500
Oh, just one shy of that temporary insanity.

1080
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,100
You lose your fucking shit because this foot,

1081
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,540
you would know as a medical doctor

1082
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,100
that you can see the bones,

1083
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,620
part of which is sticking out of this foot

1084
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,140
that's just sitting on this stretcher next to Doreen Marine.

1085
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,040
The bones are shattering

1086
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,220
and then seem to be reforming themselves

1087
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,560
as the tendon, the Achilles tendon that she's severed

1088
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,300
begins to stretch and grow out.

1089
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,020
Like all of these things are trying to grow.

1090
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,500
As they're shattering, you see the blood that's spreading out

1091
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,860
and all the blood is coming up to the surface in this foot.

1092
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,940
It's rapidly turning purple,

1093
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,340
as well as the blood that's hitting the air up top

1094
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,660
is finally oxidizing.

1095
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,340
So red is starting to pour over the top

1096
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,020
of all of these bruised and bloody foot

1097
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,220
and Doreen is bleeding the fuck out

1098
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,140
and with your sanity failure,

1099
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,100
you're not able to attempt to stop the bleeding this round.

1100
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,660
The Chuckster is running up behind you in this moment.

1101
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,940
I think Dr. Miller turns around and throws up.

1102
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,240
And you see the exact same thing

1103
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,640
and I need you to roll a sanity as well.

1104
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,480
Okay.

1105
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,500
Really low odds of me.

1106
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,820
Ah, 23 on a 33.

1107
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,260
It's the first time I passed a sanity check.

1108
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,860
You run up, you see Dr. Miller has turned towards you

1109
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,260
and begins throwing up.

1110
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,180
You nimbly dodge out of the way of this vomit

1111
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,420
and you peek your head around and see Doreen Marine

1112
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,940
and this foot, her bloody situation, what do you do?

1113
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,140
So one thing about Chuck that you guys don't know

1114
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,380
is he's very astute

1115
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,700
and he puts things together really quickly as, yeah.

1116
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,540
Oh, really?

1117
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1118
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,900
Did not know that about Chuck at all.

1119
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,480
Yeah.

1120
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,820
Yeah, so he doesn't talk about it that often.

1121
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,500
He's a real humble boy.

1122
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,200
But anyway, so he puts together

1123
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,380
that the tick must have gone inside

1124
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,440
and that if he shoots the leg,

1125
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,900
it's just gonna leave again

1126
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,140
and maybe infect something else.

1127
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,100
So he wants that tick to stay inside the foot

1128
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,480
and he notices a deep freeze.

1129
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,520
So he's gonna throw the foot in the deep freeze

1130
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,200
and lock it.

1131
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,020
Smart.

1132
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,500
And then he says, not today Bigfoot foot.

1133
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,340
Yeah.

1134
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,880
And then he fist bumps himself.

1135
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,480
Extremely excellent work.

1136
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,880
Thank you so much.

1137
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,760
And Doreen, you continue to bleed out.

1138
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,600
Roll a D4.

1139
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,500
Yeah, sorry, Doreen.

1140
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,800
I'm gonna die.

1141
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,980
Oh shit.

1142
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,920
Three.

1143
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,080
How many hit points do you have?

1144
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,440
Five.

1145
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,280
Bummer town.

1146
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,480
All right, you are down to two hit points now.

1147
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,040
What happens when you run out of hit points?

1148
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:08,880
You die.

1149
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,700
Death.

1150
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,480
There's no death saving throws.

1151
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,300
There's no negative hit points.

1152
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,140
It's not like-

1153
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,640
No potions can save me.

1154
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,720
You fall unconscious at one or two hit points

1155
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,300
if you do not fail a constitution check.

1156
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,480
So Doreen has two hit points.

1157
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,720
She is going into shock from blood loss.

1158
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,320
You have to pass a constitution check

1159
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,440
or you will fall unconscious

1160
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,640
and you will still lose a D4 from blood next round.

1161
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,500
I think I was lost.

1162
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,480
Let's see.

1163
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,280
She's like shaking.

1164
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,920
28 on a 55.

1165
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,280
That is a success.

1166
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,440
Doreen Marine can keep her eyes open

1167
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,920
for a little bit longer.

1168
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,620
You know, before she fucking dies.

1169
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,080
It's Dr. Miller's turn.

1170
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,580
Wouldn't it be Hooch's turn?

1171
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,520
Hooch, you're on top of Jerome Dyer

1172
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,600
whose actual turn it is

1173
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,560
and he is not trying to fight you.

1174
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,400
He is just laying there and he lets his body go limp.

1175
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,360
He looks up at you and he says,

1176
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,200
do you think you're doing a good job?

1177
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,420
Wow, he got you so good.

1178
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,920
I don't even acknowledge him.

1179
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,160
I do get off of him,

1180
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,240
but I'm just still kind of like pointing my gun

1181
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,080
in the general

1182
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,000
or are all three of them kind of in the same area

1183
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,820
at this point?

1184
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,160
You are on top of Jerome

1185
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,120
and you're literally next to a face down,

1186
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,260
like Carl is now snoring and he's face down,

1187
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,440
which is impressive.

1188
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,240
Like that he's still snoring face down.

1189
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,280
This guy, wow, what a body.

1190
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,280
And you can hear Janice is sniffling over in the corner.

1191
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,280
What a goddamn mess.

1192
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,000
My team is outside.

1193
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,640
There's a fucking kid on the fucking table.

1194
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,340
I gotta destroy some of this evidence.

1195
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,720
Yeah, that's what I'm here to help you do.

1196
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,280
So I'm still just kind of pointing a gun over in that area.

1197
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,600
I walk over to the cameras

1198
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,140
and can I roll computer science

1199
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,760
to just wipe all the cameras?

1200
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,600
Yeah.

1201
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,240
But we have to look at the footage.

1202
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,320
Nope, I'm wiping them.

1203
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,160
Oh my God.

1204
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,560
Wow, fucking rebel scientist.

1205
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,880
83.

1206
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,280
83, Jerome notices what you're doing

1207
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,580
and I don't mean to, you seem very,

1208
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,160
do you want, I'm, this is, I'm good at,

1209
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,520
I'm good at this stuff.

1210
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,520
You're gonna have to prove it

1211
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,880
because you've done jack shit since we've gotten here.

1212
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,120
Before you finish the sentence,

1213
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,320
he's already finished clearing one camera,

1214
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,920
which literally meant like,

1215
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,220
he took out the SD card from it and like steps on it.

1216
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,520
And then he's like, staples.

1217
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,400
That was easy.

1218
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,320
I don't like you.

1219
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,520
That seems clear.

1220
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,360
Do you want to help me with the rest of these?

1221
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,240
Janice looks up and is like, who are you?

1222
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,540
What, how do you, why are you?

1223
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,060
And he turns around and he's like,

1224
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,300
well, obviously it wasn't Bigfoot Janice.

1225
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,500
I just point my gun back at her.

1226
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,820
I just say, shut the fuck up Janice.

1227
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,940
I liked Jerome.

1228
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,980
Dr. Miller, you've already lost your sanity.

1229
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,860
You can pull your shit together here.

1230
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,580
You have to save this woman.

1231
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,900
If you can pass a first aid check,

1232
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,740
you will stop the bleeding and give her one D4 hit points.

1233
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,900
Dr. Miller is going to turn around to Chuck and say,

1234
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,580
you guard that thing with your life.

1235
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:47,340
Pointing towards the ice bag that he put the foot in.

1236
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,500
And then she's going hurriedly trying to stop the bleeding.

1237
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:55,260
And Chuck's just like sitting on top of this deep freeze.

1238
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,940
I'm doing the like surfer sign where you stick your thumb

1239
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,340
and your pinky out and you shake it.

1240
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,180
And you shake it.

1241
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,020
And you shake it.

1242
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,580
And Dr. Miller says, tubular bra.

1243
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,060
Righteous.

1244
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,260
And rolls a 90 fucking five.

1245
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,100
Oh my God.

1246
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,500
Sorry, Doreen.

1247
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,940
Bye Doreen.

1248
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:19,780
Bye.

1249
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,340
Holy shit.

1250
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:26,100
Dr. Miller starts fumbling with her things.

1251
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,540
And she's like, you're going to be all right.

1252
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,380
You're going to be all right.

1253
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,540
Okay. You have to survive.

1254
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,140
Just trust me.

1255
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:31,980
Trust me.

1256
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,900
And you just can't find the exact shit you're looking for.

1257
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,740
I don't know.

1258
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,580
I don't know.

1259
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,580
Like you're looking for gauze.

1260
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,660
You're looking for anything to like,

1261
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,700
to maybe burn the, you know,

1262
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,260
singe the flesh at the bottom

1263
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,860
to try to cauterize the wound, anything.

1264
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:51,700
But you just can't find what you're looking for.

1265
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,700
Why can't I find anything in this fucking car?

1266
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,060
Yeah. She starts panicking.

1267
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,260
And then continues to look at Doreen

1268
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,540
trying to be like, you're going to be fine, all right?

1269
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,380
You're going to be fine.

1270
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,540
Just trust me.

1271
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,740
Give me one moment.

1272
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,180
As she continues to look for things,

1273
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,820
fumbling like a fucking idiot.

1274
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,260
Like the fucking idiot she is.

1275
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,660
I didn't mean that, Dr. Miller.

1276
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,900
I heard that, Chuck.

1277
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,260
I just like sadly put my surfer hand down.

1278
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,220
Back inside, Jerome and Dr. Hooch are wrapping up

1279
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,940
and Jerome is like, okay.

1280
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,780
And I think we'd uploaded on this laptop here.

1281
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:41,780
So Dr. Hooch, you actually see on this laptop,

1282
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,580
you see some of the pictures that they took

1283
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,540
and it's the strangest thing.

1284
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,460
They're all blurry.

1285
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,860
It'll be like a picture of the two of them

1286
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,700
throwing up peace signs on either side of the pool table.

1287
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,300
Like, ah, we got it.

1288
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,300
There's this like incomprehensible blurry thing

1289
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,580
on the table.

1290
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,740
It's almost like there's some sort of cloaking

1291
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,220
that this creature might have that would make it

1292
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,340
so that no one could get like a clear picture of it,

1293
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,580
no matter how good the equipment was,

1294
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,660
no matter how hard they tried.

1295
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,740
It's almost like the pictures you've seen

1296
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,940
of Bigfoot in real life.

1297
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,140
Why can't anyone get a good picture of Bigfoot?

1298
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,980
Maybe that's why.

1299
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,300
Roll sanity.

1300
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,940
48 on a 53, baby.

1301
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,780
Success.

1302
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,060
You're like, damn, I figured out Bigfoot.

1303
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,180
Okay, are you finished up there?

1304
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,020
Fuck.

1305
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,940
Y'all can't hire a fucking photographer

1306
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,740
that knows how to take a good damn picture?

1307
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:46,540
Look, it's like it auto-focused on my face and Carl's face,

1308
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,740
but it didn't, Jesus.

1309
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,380
It just seems like no one here knows what y'all are doing.

1310
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,460
I start like just scrubbing through the photos,

1311
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,940
frantically trying to see if there's one that's in focus.

1312
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,900
Not a single one.

1313
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,220
I just throw my hands up in the air.

1314
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,540
I'm so frustrated.

1315
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,940
Where's my fucking team?

1316
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,500
They all just ran outside.

1317
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,180
And I open up the front door and just look outside.

1318
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,700
Yeah, you can smell death.

1319
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,900
And Chuckster, it's your turn.

1320
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,380
I'm gonna valiantly take my shirt off.

1321
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,060
Nice.

1322
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,180
Hell yeah.

1323
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,140
But like I could easily just pull it over,

1324
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,460
you know, and it would come off easily.

1325
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,140
But instead I like rip it from the collar down.

1326
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,820
So it like still has like part of it.

1327
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,540
Like one sleeve is still on, but yeah,

1328
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,620
there's got a big patch in the front that's off.

1329
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,060
And I wrap that around her nub.

1330
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,820
Okay, go ahead and roll first aid to save her life.

1331
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,340
Not good odds, but.

1332
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,260
I pass!

1333
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,100
36 on a 40.

1334
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,300
I save her.

1335
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,420
Oh my gosh, the Chuckster is so tight.

1336
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,460
Doreen reaches up and gives him a little pat on the head.

1337
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,380
Hold on, let's go back.

1338
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,820
I mean, you're patting him on the head

1339
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,180
as he's wrapping this around.

1340
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,660
And you see Dr. Miller is still just frantically going out.

1341
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:05,180
I mean, just like throwing shit out of the cabinets

1342
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,980
all over behind her, trying to figure this out.

1343
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,180
You guys are almost like dodging shit

1344
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,500
that she's throwing out, being like,

1345
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,180
why can't I find it?

1346
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,780
Why can't I find it?

1347
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,580
And you're just like calmly wrapping your torn t-shirt

1348
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,300
around the nub at the bottom.

1349
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,980
And I'm giving her little eyebrows, like while I do it.

1350
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,540
Oh, this is the patch up the soldier moment.

1351
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,380
Okay, one of you guys.

1352
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,340
As you're patting his, I mean, roll a D4 please to see.

1353
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,340
You're able to stop the bleeding,

1354
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,740
which is the most important thing.

1355
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,940
And with three hit points back in your system,

1356
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,740
that takes you back up to five.

1357
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,100
And you're able to kind of stabilize your breathing.

1358
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,820
You're still extremely panicked.

1359
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,820
You're on the verge of throwing up at any moment.

1360
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,020
You're extremely pale.

1361
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,660
You've lost a lot of blood.

1362
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,220
You do not feel well, but you at least have someone

1363
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,820
who is your fucking savior now.

1364
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,380
I knew there was a reason I loved you, kid.

1365
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,420
You do remind me of my whippet.

1366
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,260
Ha ha ha.

1367
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,080
Ha ha ha.

1368
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:08,920
Ha ha ha.

1369
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,740
Ha ha ha.

1370
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,820
This might be too forward,

1371
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,260
but do you want to celebrate Christmas together?

1372
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,100
Ha ha ha.

1373
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,740
It's January.

1374
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,660
Ha ha ha.

1375
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,020
Doreen is so happy to have something wrapped around her.

1376
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,020
She was like, absolutely.

1377
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,860
Yes.

1378
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,700
Yes.

1379
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,540
Yes.

1380
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,380
Yes.

1381
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,200
Yes.

1382
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:44,620
Searing star, deafening heat.

1383
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:49,540
You don't know where you found it.

1384
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,740
In this heat, as your eyes fall short,

1385
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:00,380
you better learn how to keep it.

1386
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:26,380
Clasp your fist over all the blood.

1387
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:30,860
Water leaks through your fingers.

1388
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:36,660
You're standing in a swirling flood.

1389
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,660
And only darkness leaves.

1390
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:54,540
And only darkness leaves.

1391
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:07,540
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1392
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:13,540
till it's reaching out again.

1393
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:18,540
Find your theme on your broken bones.

1394
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,540
Be your outlaw or he is your king.

1395
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:53,540
He is your king.

1396
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:24,540
He is your king.

1397
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:30,540
He is your king.

1398
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:36,540
He is your king.

1399
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:42,540
He is your king.

1400
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:48,540
He is your king.

1401
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:54,540
He is your king.

1402
00:59:55,540 --> 01:00:00,540
He is your king.

1403
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:06,540
He is your king.

1404
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:12,540
He is your king.

1405
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:18,540
He is your king.

1406
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,540
He is your king.

1407
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:30,540
He is your king.

1408
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:36,540
He is your king.

1409
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:42,540
He is your king.

1410
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:48,540
He is your king.

1411
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:54,540
He is your king.

1412
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:00,540
He is your king.

1413
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:06,540
He is your king.

1414
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:12,540
He is your king.

1415
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:18,540
He is your king.

1416
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:24,540
He is your king.

1417
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:30,540
He is your king.

1418
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:36,540
He is your king.

1419
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:42,540
He is your king.

1420
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:47,540
He is your king.
