Fuck me it's off to wolf. Hello and greetings to all of my

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,640
Peculiar peoples it is I your dogmatic puppy wolf the dog and I'm here to speak nothing

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,880
But the truth live on six nine four point two PT BP

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,520
Except when I feel like doing a little lie every now and then but I cannot lie about how I love

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,640
Seeing a new howling with wolf coming in hot fresh and fragrant I drool in

38
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,160
anticipation I

39
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,280
Masticate the words to make them more easily

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,240
digestible

41
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,600
something about

42
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
creamy

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,680
Stank this here howling with wolf is from Duncan and Winnipeg, Manitoba

44
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,120
Canada who tweeted about the show and tagged at

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,960
Pretending pod a thing you could also do if you're so inclined and then my producer will look up your city name on

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,200
Wikipedia the name Winnipeg comes from the Cree and Ojibwe name

47
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,760
Winnipea which means muddy water and muddy waters was born with the name

48
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,880
McKinley Morgan field thanks Duncan from Winnipeg

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,880
Duncan writes

50
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,840
Hey there wolf

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,760
longtime howler first time listener

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,800
Is that right hard to remember down here in this dark place where the hours pass?

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,600
immeasurable made to contain a golem born of

54
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,600
Desperation and malice and built by those who wish to contain that which they did not understand

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,720
This labyrinth has lain forgotten for a century

56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,160
Yet the beast still lives for I hear its ancient voice in the echoes of rattling bones

57
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,340
In the beast it hungers

58
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,280
Shout out to Pavlo Mason and Brock for trusting me to run them through their first session of Delta green

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,640
Damn Duncan sounds like you live in an eternal nightmare from which you may never come back from and that sucks

60
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,940
But what doesn't suck is that you decided to take a break from your horrid

61
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,780
Conditions to write a letter to little old me and for that I send you immense gratitude

62
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,120
I hope one day you can get out of that labyrinth

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,020
Have you tried simply leaving it if you want to write up something for your muddy puppy wolf to how?

64
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,280
Tag at pretending pod on Instagram tag at pretending pod on Twitter tag

65
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Pretended to be people on Facebook or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and make me

66
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,800
aware of that review now on the count of three

67
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,880
Wink at the person nearest to you

68
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,520
And if they give you any lip just let them know the winks are in the show notes

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,120
Wink it's time for the news

70
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,200
last time

71
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,560
Beck Wilder filmed what he could of Cal Colorado in the early early morning out on beans bridge

72
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,420
Which had been pierced by a new freak weather event before they were asked to leave by the alphabet

73
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,560
Supers running the show and the two went back to the empty Colorado townhome to catch some sleep

74
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,720
Julius Summers had a couple strange

75
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,160
Interactions at the hospital before he met back up with the can crew the next day and headed to Vivica's

76

Apartment above the bodega to retrieve their footage that day today is Wednesday, July 6

77
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,580
2022 and don't let anyone tell you differently

78
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,760
It's altar girl with my life is great and it's all my fault

79

Cuz my life is great and it's all my fault

80
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Cuz my life is great and it's all my fault

81
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
3

82
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
2

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Happy New Year

84
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,240
Is that actually the release schedule that we're looking at now

85
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:42,220
Wow, that's so soon surprise me because that actually is a lot if you didn't already buy your Christmas gifts Thomas

86

89
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,480
13 December 13 Taylor Swift's birthday

90
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,560
She's 22, she's 22 look what I'm wearing Oh a little midnight sweatshirts

91
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,120
Appreciate I tweeted at her today. Did she do it back? Nope

92
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,740
I said happy birthday to my favorite blondes and there's two people I know whose birthdays today

93
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,600
One is Taylor Swift and the other is blonde. The other is a blonde person

94
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,320
I mean have I met this blonde person

95
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
That's who I meant

96
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,440
Oh my god, we sound shitty again, is this just our headphones say something funny

97
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Play Freebird

98
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,880
It's currently mid-December as Luke said and

99
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,920
Currently we're in the middle. I don't say it. He did I pointed at Thomas

100
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,320
he Luke points at Tom Clark Bishop said and I

101
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,640
Just wanted to throw out

102
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,700
We probably just came back from a little intro to this episode about our donation pledge

103
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Which at this point in time is it?

104
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,980
$500 already, so we're gonna match that we're already gonna be able to donate over $1,000

105
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,260
As of mid-December this when you're listening to this episode, there will probably be a much more exciting announcement

106
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,100
Yeah, it'll come right before this. So this is a letdown. Let's get in the episode. That's what she said

107
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,060
Far back to remember it'll come right before this so that will be a letdown

108
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:44,460
It's the demons which ones the God all the gondol demons the god old name, I think he meant goons, but he said demons

109
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,140
In this world demons ghouls and ghouls

110
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,740
Be a good one. Mm-hmm. The god of ghouls. We're talking about God

111
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,380

113
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,540
Tortoises and hairs. So you guys are in vivica's

114
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,180
Apartment above the Joe. Oh, yeah, it's the bidet gal

115
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
badego

116
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,980
The badego it told Luke earlier. I was looking at my notes and I was like, why did I write down the day gal?

117
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
Spelled badego wrong

118
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
So you guys are in the point

119
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,540
B AG le BAG al that's

120
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
Sounds like I

121
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:40,620
Spelled that in my notes as bidet gal. So I would remember how to say it instead. I read it as badego

122
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,180
Yeah, you should have maybe gone for an UH

123
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,540
Deagle the deagle the deagle goal and we found we we found out our stuff get done

124
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,900
Yeah, show on some stuff guys going twice some cops came in store stuff, which is how they do. She got you

125
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Listen to season one

126
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:06,060
Which was not a mistake on our part, but in fact incisive commentary the entire time as we played cops

127
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,460
incisors used our trench and make those

128
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,800
Trench mouth gum disease I had in college. Let's move

129
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,620
Yeah, what the dentist said the nobody had gotten it since 1917

130
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:29,300
Stress based trench mouth. Yeah, apparently trying to do college the first time was so rough on little

131
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,740
Pussy Zach. No, no, no, you're no no, I'm supposed to write. I'm supposed to have better self-talk than that. I

132
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,420
Wasn't ready for college

133
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,420
That's better. So you got a World War one disease

134
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,460
You weren't ready for college because you were a little pussy

135
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,260
Now that that's cleared up we can talk imagine

136
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,820
Imagine if that Zach had been sent to World War one dead so quickly

137
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,700
All Zach you and I would thrive in war

138
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,060
Oh, yeah being told that I like having an exact thing that I have to do. We have to get into the

139
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
It's not as bad as the last episode

140
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,980
But the episode where it took 20 fucking minutes to get to gameplay, let's do it, let's go

141
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,340
I'm rearing. This is gonna be fun. Let's do it. I'm Cal, Colorado and I'm rearing

142
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
So you guys are up in this

143
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,180

144
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,500
bodega

145
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,900
Adjacent bodega adjacent apartment bodega adjacent if you guys just told you through tears that

146
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:41,020
Even though she had stolen the footage as she was leaving a couple of police officers not in

147
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,980
Uniforms came out of a police car used police badges and stole the rest of the footage

148
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,460
Including the thumb drive that she had stolen from Beck Wilder

149
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,220
We got all that when Luke said the dang bald numbers took him. That's my bad. I've got double stone. Mm-hmm

150
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
It got took took got took once

151
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,260
Tom inks at the in the post-apocalyptic part of cloud atlas

152
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,020
It's

153
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,380
It's good, it's a c-plus movie

154
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,620
I think we need to go look at the security cameras at the office. Boom

155
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,820
In Cal sick Mercedes we all vroom to the office. This is nice

156
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,940
Thank you. I I own I don't lease and he's like have you ever seen cloud atlas? It's my favorite movie

157
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,980
I saw it five times in theaters. Julius is watching cloud atlas on the back of the headrest on the yeah

158
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Cuz Cal always auto plays it

159
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,220
That's based on a real guy Joe and I know

160
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,860
Was absolutely obsessed with a b-minus movie

161
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,540
It's working its way through through your ranks already though, you said c-plus I think

162
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,300
I quickly autocorrected. I don't remember it other than I saw it and I was like you speak the true true

163
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,700
Sounded like it was about geography and I wasn't ready for it. Oh

164
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,340
It'd be so much better

165
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Here we are

166
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,120
Let's turn that bad boy off huh? Yeah, what's that? I mean, it sounds like the heater which is what I call my piece

167
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,580
So is that the episode

168
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,380
Well, here we are at the can offices, oh, yeah, so it is now

169
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,460
3 p.m. At this point. We do not have a lot of time to get this on the evening news. We have to find this footage

170
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,820
Let's go straight to the security office. We gotta see like if there was any like identifying Mars

171
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,620
Maybe we could see the car that they drove. It was a police car

172
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,660
I think she said it's gonna have like a number on it. Sounds good to me. Let's let's do that

173
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,540
Let's review the footage

174
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:14,060
So you guys head to the can security office over the marvelous floor the glass and the beautiful?

175
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,340
Can station you walk through the halls?

176
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,580
Confidently, there are other people here at the station. So on the way there Beck

177
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:30,980
I'm gonna need a grip check for you for the attire of some of your co-workers that you're passing through the hall

178
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,540
I pass 35 and a 49 nice

179
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,540
So you see you start to see these flashes as these people approach and how do you like contain yourself?

180
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
It's a head down looking at the feet

181
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:49,260
Like like somebody who is trying to be as inconspicuous as possible and just get through this hallway to the other end

182
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,540
And you've been through these hallways time after time

183
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:59,820
in the morning and you pass through the same way you always head to the can security office and as you guys pass in you

184
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,780
See that's on shift today is ray. It's Raymond. It's the son

185
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,100
Perhaps the the worse of the sons of tife

186
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,800
Rayland so Julius, this is your cousin cousin cousin ray ray

187
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:25,020
Yep, cousin ray ray and he's like on his phone feet up in the chair not looking at any of the

188
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:33,020
Myriad screens on the wall in front of him with this range were made by myriad. There's a little logo and

189
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,060
He's watching tiktoks on his phone. He's just like

190
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,280
And you hear the tiktok voice over the top like walking with my partner in

191
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,020
Frisco Julius walks over

192
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,180
Julius has never really it when you call it Frisco

193
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,300
Julius has never really liked ray ray so he goes over and he sees him screwing off and

194
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,340
Just kind of like pushes his feet off the desk and makes his chair like swivel around school

195
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,240
Julius Julius Julius Julius. Hey, what's up, man?

196
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:18,940
We ray ray we need to see some some footage from from yesterday anything from my Lucy. What's up?

197
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,460
No, no, just just now right? No, I would have been last night. It was like calm down everybody

198
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,780
Wins it wins it wins it

199
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,860
It's like it's like last night at like with with it like midnight or something

200
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,500
I think is when we left with it was shortly after we left

201
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:40,060
Where are we looking for okey all over but we're naming like the parking lot. Mostly we just came in here

202
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:47,760
So what can you please just I just was wondering like maybe give me a little backup and he's like kind of spooling through

203
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,860
It's all digital. So he's by spooling. I mean he's going backwards

204
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,800
Hey, hey, Zach. What time was this you guys left around like midnight?

205
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,360
So you're probably looking at like 12 15 12 30 except it was like even later

206
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,160
Because I went to the hospital cuz you're like everything's negative 40 if you do anything else

207
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,720
So I was like, I'll go sleep. So it's like 3 so you guys are looking at like 3 15 3 30

208
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
We

209
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,940
Left the offices like a roundup

210
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Here's you guys leaving?

211
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,560
Okay, it would be shortly after this. Yeah, we're looking for two men and a he plays it at regular speed

212
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,520
Can you go quickly Ray Ray? Yes, please fast fast Ray Ray

213
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,760
Beck is gonna push him out of the way because he knows how to use this equipment

214
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:42,600
Come on, man. At least let me do it. It's my only job. You do well Ray Ray Beck is the best and time is of the essence

215
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
You just got to turn the knob it it sets it up to be 1.5 speed

216
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
It's good. We might even want to go to at this point

217
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:57,320
Okay, let's take a double and he goes to two times speed pushes it through and we see Vivica sneaking back

218
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,800
into the city action news station after you all have left looking over her shoulder the whole way through as she

219
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,600
Crosses into the foyer. She digs deep into her pocket. She pulls out this thumb drive

220
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,560
And there's this determined look in her not grainy face because it's pretty decent quality

221
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,660
This quality is amazing even five years ago

222
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,600
She would have been grainy as fuck and then she puts the thumb drive back in her pocket

223
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:33,960
It shows it in there and heads back into the editing Bay surely in your minds to delete the footage or at least take it

224
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,540
What was my character's name when we played with?

225
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,440
Can I say the name and don't has it has it been played already? No, it hasn't come out yet her name is

226
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,940
What's up? What was my guy's name? He owned a security company. So you see the the security system is made

227
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:55,440
We just looked it up. What's who's the security system made by Vincente boring? Yeah, so it's the security system called like

228
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,340
Yeah, it's on there yeah, you'll have to wait to hear Luke's character who chokes every line out

229
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,100
Oh, wow, this is the best security system in the whole city. I

230
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:21,980
Actually had these people install some security in my home and both my my Peabody and three local Emmys were stolen in that time. I

231
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,500
Ended up going with Shakira toss. Well for your home, you should go with a ring doorbell

232
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,700
Target oh, I do have a ring doorbell found a target but for for the office, it's a fun story

233
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:41,780
We actually used it to some effect earlier to see Stevie running away from my basement with her brother. That's that's right

234
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,020
I remember on that beautiful ring doorbell crystal-clear picture every time hold on. Hold on

235
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,320
I could see the shame on her face. That was a present from my daughter

236
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,660
She gave me a gift receipt in case I didn't want it that gift receipt was to a store called

237
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,860
Target, huh? That's it. That's it. It was Target. Hmm. I love shopping in Target for all my holiday needs

238
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:09,040
I I got you and back such wonderful presents two individuals walk through the doors

239
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:16,800
Are they revolving doors into the can station? Why not? I can't yeah, of course feels like they are the old west saloon doors

240
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
one of these individuals

241
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,340
The can piano players

242
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
I

243
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:36,420
Immediately slumps over two individuals walk through the front door of the can station one is tall

244
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,740
Mousey is wearing glasses and the other one is short jacked and bald

245
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,420
They walk forward scoping out one takes the left side one takes the right side

246
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:53,180
They're looking through the windows on either side. They see the editing Bay you follow them they head into the editing Bay

247
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,620
Ray-ray, you remember every face that's coming in out of here, don't you?

248
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,940
We can zoom enhance zoom and enhance we zoom in enhance you can do that on boring security cameras

249
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,660
We pull back

250
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:13,060
we zoom out to see these two as they walk in once again and zoom in on their faces and

251
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,460
Something it's weird. It's like

252
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,380
Something that they're wearing maybe seems to be obvious skating their face

253
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,660
It's like it's too well lit like pauperizing around their shirt paparazzi clothes

254
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,900
Paparazzi stuffs like the anti-paparazzi shirts. Can I roll to see if Julius would like associate that with?

255
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,860
Fuck, what is the bet? Well, who are the bad guys bad guys?

256
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:45,480
Got a little girl. I don't know. Does it look like God all Corp close gottel tech gottel that some gottel tech

257
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,280

258
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I mean, uh, well Sharon I spent

259
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,600
Several weeks together in the in the mid 80s and and she employed a similar device against the paparazzo

260
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,560
I bet you wish you could turn back time, dude

261
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,600

265
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,200
Ray Ray

266
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,600
It's it's hard to see their faces

267
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,680
But it's like they're wearing some sort of mask have you have you ever seen anything like this or seen them before? Oh

268
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,560
I heard about it on the internet. I heard about what on the internet. It's kind of like clothes

269
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,840
That okay. Yes. I mean, I'm familiar. What would you google?

270
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,960
anti

271
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,300
face

272
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,140
Camera, can you zoom into the car that they arrived in?

273
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Anti face camera

274
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,320
Shirt

275
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,520
Go ahead and zoom into the car that they came in

276
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,880
He whips around with the digital analog knob and shows that they head into the editing bay

277
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,760
They're in there for a couple minutes

278
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,840
They leave the editing bay just the two of them as they're walking out one does a classic like

279
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,520
Flicks the thumb drive in the air off their thumb. It makes a noise. Oh

280
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,480
And

281
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,440
Catches it throws it back in the pocket

282
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:35,340
they head back out to their police car the external camera on the building looks out and you see that this is

283
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,180
CPD number eight three six. Oh, come on

284

286
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Is it a

287
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:09,240
Is it a city police car or contingent police car ooh interesting question, I don't know what contingent is this is season two

288
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,920
It's a city police car. We need to find out who that police car is registered to which which officers

289
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,720
How do you even do that Beck can do that?

290
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,840
I mean I can I can sort of do that but like I'm not a reporter like

291
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,440
It seems like you guys would know more about how to like investigate things

292
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,120
Is there another way you could figure out like a way to follow them? What's that?

293
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:42,160
I know that that the the Bori security company runs almost all the security around here

294
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,480
Maybe if we call one of the higher-ups we can get access to the buildings around us

295
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,880
I have a couple of trusted contacts in the city police force

296
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,600
They might be able to look these badge numbers up for me this car number

297
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:53,920
Yeah

298
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,840
I think that'd be the way to go just like see if they have like who was driving the car

299
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,260
Just like that alone would get us on the right track sick. Yeah

300
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,640
Let's go to the giant phone in the can offices the red phone that goes straight to the police. Yeah

301
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
No, no, that's that's

302
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,000
Too obvious my contacts in the CPD prefer me to contact them more discreetly

303
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,960
Is it like a like a secret drop situation are we doing like by stuff yes, it's very cool. Oh shit

304
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,160
Yeah, it's very fun. I mean, it's not so like we do talk face-to-face, but there is an elaborate and

305
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,240
Fairly pointless system of message drops and exchanges before that process can begin

306
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,560
Are we gonna like put an X on a window Julius is googling the Bori security company hotline?

307
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,680
Everyone roll on

308
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Intelligence or

309
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,200
Bureaucracy 18 on the 75 I pass an intelligence role

310
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Yeah, they're ring

311
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,000
System I'll try to do that again at Target God I went to Target the other day

312
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,840
Classic thing where you go in for one thing and the deals are so hot you end up just

313
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,320
You get your whole week's worth of stuff

314
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,840
That they have at the front. I just like one dollar two dollars three dollars five

315
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,760
Yeah, and I know before Thanksgiving. I bought a stuffed felt turkey there

316
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,960
I'm gonna go back to Target and try to find myself a reindeer in that little front section

317
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,680
Do you think maybe stop by this? Maybe stop by the Starbucks that's always at the front of the target

318
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,940
I kind of feel like everything in that front section has been felt. This is crazy

319
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,060
You bought a stuffed turkey I bought a real strict like turkey and they're extensive grocery section Wow

320
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:48,940
Yeah, that is crazy. Well, and I didn't know where I was gonna get a turkey and a ham for Christmas

321
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:56,380
But at Target they have it and you should go to Target if you check on Target's website. They have recipes for holiday meals

322
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,420
late lunch time late lunch alert and you see that

323
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,900
Thai shitty son Raymond pulls his phone back out of his pocket and he's like

324
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,820
Deborah over traffic hit me up for that lunch time

325
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,140
Me and Deborah from traffic over here at City Action News are gonna head out to lunch

326
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:21,740
So you guys can have at this but like whatever this feels like an everybody loves Raymond joke

327
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,980
But I don't know enough about that show to know if it's accurate

328
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,220
What a good show

329
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,420
Yeah, I had a real good dog named Murphy he used to sound like he was on everybody loves Raymond

330
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:48,700
I passed my intelligence. So did I yes in me three successes and when Raymond brings up the debt

331
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Oh my god. I just got that. I just understood the jerk

332
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,080
Raymond and Deborah. Yep. This is this is me. I'm Zach. What's up?

333
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,840
It's nuts how brands work it's like two people who are so in some way like have a relationship that sounds good

334
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:16,700
As as Raymond starts talking about having lunch with Deborah from traffic at City Action News you think

335
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,980
Julius puts his phone down realizing. I don't want to talk to the boring hotline

336
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,620
We can just use the traffic cameras and Cal has already texted his contact. How's the weather?

337
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,920
You immediately get a text back this is Beck gets a text it says, how's the weather?

338
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,460
It's you don't even have to be old to make a mistake like that like hey, you don't have to be that old

339
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Oh

340
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,520
Cal it looks like you texted me. It's it's it's fine. The weather's fine. And but I think that this was probably for fuck anyway

341
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,120
Yes, yes, yes, he scrolls down like several bees and gets to his contact

342
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
How's the weather

343
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
I

344
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:30,200
You do you get a text back that says stormy something's brewing we need to be at City Park at 3 15 p.m

345
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
It's like three right now. Oh

346
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
Shit Cal we're not gonna make it

347
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,960
You need to drive the can van like you've never driven it before or my sweet Mercedes. Whatever we took here. I

348
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
I

349
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,920
Listen we'll take my Mercedes I get out of tickets all the time

350
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,880
Can I search the security like for like one of the like little red lights you can put on top of a car?

351
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Yeah, go ahead and roll search

352
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,080
That's past 47 on a 70 you find a little red topper

353
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,660
That's got a siren on the top that's got audio and visual aids and siren

354
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Let's get it

355
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Well said

356
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,440
On the way to the can van Julius is going to hook his phone up via bluetooth to this

357
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,640
Oh, you guys are out. You guys are out. You're in the can van. You got this topper on top everyone

358
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,160
That's what I meant by the can van

359
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
the C class

360
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
C is for city Caesar can

361
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,120
Julius slaps that on top of the car and gets in the back

362
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:55,940
Yeah

363
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:02,680
He wants to finish watching some of cloud atlas Cal Cal baby drivers into the the front seat and most

364
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,920
It's amazing, yeah, I'm so well buck and why

365
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,480
That's what if you haven't seen baby driver, that's what it is an hour and a half of that and it's the it's a great movie

366
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,120
Get out of the way get out of the way get out of the way Harry the Henderson out the door

367
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Oh, you're just making that noise yeah

368
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,680
Julius is hooked up in harmony a bluetooth to the speaker that's in the topper get out of the way

369
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Oh the bluetooth speaker. That's smart

370
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,600
Cal is like cows eyes are wide and he's speeding down like one of the main city like thoroughfares

371
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,960
He's laughing and he turns to you guys. It was like, where are we going again?

372
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,040
You said the park it was it was you Cal we were following your lead. That's right. He takes a sudden

373
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
And

374
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,480
Through the gates of the city park we see etched no not etched rot in iron

375
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
I

376
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Got tingles

377
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,000
Cow cow like sheds a single tear as he passes under the gates and thinks about like the brave like proud working men of

378
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the city who rot

379
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,120
120 years ago

380
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,040
twisted it says

381
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,400
The city park. I

382
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,440
Love this goddamn city rolling through you see on either side of you trees

383
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,400
Must have been why don't laugh right away. I must have been why?

384
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,600
That's I don't know you see trees must have been planted here must have been 30 of the fuckers

385
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,820
Must have been purposely planted here at least a hundred two hundred years ago

386
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:22,320
Massive trees lining the roads on either side as you curve and make your way through this park

387
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,480
You see picnic tables. You see ponds you see fountains

388
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,960
You see a little boathouse where a dock has paddle boats the happy couples and families

389
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,840
and

390
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,160
Rangers

391
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,720
There's a medical NPC and there's a long

392
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,120
Green dawn on either side past the the medical person there

393
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,760
That's adjacent to the pond

394
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:54,160
Of course and the big green lawn stretch is up in a hill sort of fashion up to the top

395
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:00,640
where there is a large statue of an old military general on a horse in front of a

396
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,680
Massive building with columns in front of it major general means major gentle means

397
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,540
major general beans major general

398
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,140
And you know for that guy he looks like a cop

399
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:22,800
You see a police officer on a bike in front of you is that our guy no hit him

400
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Where

401
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:32,980
Are you meeting your contact probably under the major general being statue where you can also access the docks to one of the

402
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,080
myriad ponds

403
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,680
And there's there's some like duck boats that you can paddle as you pass the police officer that's on a bicycle

404
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,980
He gives you a kind of stink eye as you head into the the double lanes you as you pass the bicycle

405
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,940
It's the appropriate way to pass someone on a bicycle mind you but he gets a kind of hair

406
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:59,500
Tingles up on the back of his neck and then decides. I don't really want to do anything right now

407
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:05,020
Cal is cows in a you know cows in an odd mood these past few days

408
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:11,380
But he chuckles and he says don't worry boys. We're off to meet that those bosses boss damn Cal

409
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,260
That's only two rings up

410
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,780
Guys still makes coffee

411
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,580
Julius through the speaker on the roof of the car just says oops

412
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,500
Sorry

413
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:36,420
Yeah, I didn't take into account the siren on the top of your car. Did I know that guy was an idiot

414
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:43,400
Let's go meet our man. Let's go meet this man as you approach the statue at the top of this hill

415
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,760
There's like a circle drive around it and Cal pulls the Mercedes over

416
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,480
He kind of looks over it back in the passenger seat looks it was starting to get the camera out

417
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,860
looks at Julius and the in the back and he says um

418
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:03,880
Unfortunately, there's only room for two on the on the goose paddle boats, but could you follow discreetly behind me?

419
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Yeah, hey Cal is it cool if I mic you up very cool back

420
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,440
Also, give me one of your tik-tok phones and I could

421
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,800
Hide it in my pocket square and and lean towards

422
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Julius gives him his tik-tok phone

423
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,880
And Julius is stoked because he knows that he can paddle the shit out of these boats with his fucking huge legs

424
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:37,740
Discreetly but you could pull alongside us at some distance and zoom in. Oh, yeah with the audio

425
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,280
You're mostly gonna be going in circles though from what I can hear from

426
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,560
Julius is gonna sit in the middle and paddle both

427
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,380
That way back can straddling like the goose's neck

428
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:06,760
Hey Cal I can you know, I can splash you if you want no, no, no, don't get too close. He'll know something is up

429
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,960
Okay, okay

430
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,920
Should we go first that would be best if you go before us?

431
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,280
You could we'll get a good we'll get a good spot your pace and advantage you behind that's much easier than trying to I'll get

432
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,180
A lot of footage of like the trees and stuff. So it looks like we're just tourists making making videos

433
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,520
They do call you the b-roll bastard. I

434
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:31,000
Was hoping that was gonna catch on fuck. Yeah. Oh, did you start that back? Yeah, that's a good one. It's working

435
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,960
It's yeah, I heard it from like I heard it from a couple people. Oh, yeah

436
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,800
That doesn't usually work great job back as you're buying the admission tickets to hop on Julie you think about curious cow

437
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,600
Curious cow I like it. That sounds a little weird

438
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,480
Don't spread that one I'll think on it Julius flashes his season pass which allows a guest

439
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
We

440
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,440
Have your boat waiting for you right here, mr. Summers it

441
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,120
It's a goose with sunglasses on and on the side it's gilded it says summers

442
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,920
Which it I turn on to work against my legs and this is my

443
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
I

444
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,480
Let's go will you be having the regular with it today make it the VIP right away, sir

445
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,920
and as you guys are getting on the

446
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Spectacle goose a platter arrives and is sat down in front of you. It's got a top on it. Would you do the honors Beck?

447
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,440
Yeah, man. Do you like do this a lot as he pulls up the Julius just slaps his thighs and kind of like duh

448
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,760
So I'm thinking it's just protein it's a

449
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,200
Like one of those like muscle powder like shaker things

450
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,920
And then like a charcuterie board, but it's mostly it's like two full summer sausages

451
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Plus like four ounces of vodka

452
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Like a big Slim Jim just snaps into

453
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
One of the summer sausages

454
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,620
Beck you better hold on. Yeah. Oh, yeah, and I'm kind of I'm doing what we said just kind of holding on for dear life

455
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,360
Getting into a good angle

456
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
and

457
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,080
Julius flips the motor in reverse and starts pedaling forward quickly

458
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
And

459
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,840
You guys make your way out into the middle of this pond

460
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:04,080
He's like make it like creating like a wake making you awake out to yeah, like it's like bouncing. It's bouncing the other

461
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,840
bird

462
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,880
All right, so the two of you are out there in the water and Cal Cal

463
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,640
Cal is approaching his contact who is in like a classic kind of trench coat

464
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,520
Yes, of course any any taps is he taps his lapel and it's like a back. Can you hear me?

465
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
And we've got we've got our headphones

466
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,440
Doesn't zoom just like goes to the focus of like the very obvious boat with these two with their boom

467
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,320
I say to Julius I didn't set up a way for us to communicate with him

468
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Julius gives a big thumbs up

469
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,460
That's funny for a minute and he turns around

470
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:05,240
He gives you a big thumbs up too and approaches police chief McMillan Oh police chief McMillan who is a

471
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,000
Broad-shouldered

472
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,400
gentleman with a big ol walrus

473
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:17,140
Mustache that is gray and salt and pepper. What's his head look like shiny? Yeah

474
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,520
Yeah, very shiny since he's got a walrus stash. He has to be bald

475
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,480
Haircut and a walrus mustache looks strange. Yeah, he's got he's got these crazy like schoolboy locks

476
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,760
Like fifties, yeah, but his but his mustache is is is more gray than red

477
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,360
But it still twitches weirdly like a walruses almost like whiskers

478
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,660
Mr. Colorado was a pleasure back. I can see that guy sweating from over here

479
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Mac are you okay?

480
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,060
What I don't get out on the boat, oh, yes, I definitely agree

481
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,580
By the way, this is a two-party consent state, so I

482
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,420
Just need to tell you this conversation is being recorded is this normal for the two of you

483
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,540
This is abnormal

484
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,060
but in real life

485
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,460
It might not be abnormal if you just always guaranteed him that he was on what I think it's called deep cover or deep background

486
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,560
That they on background on background. Is that what it is? Can't be quoted

487
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,700
Background is but you are deep back your deep background. You can't be quoted in

488
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,540
It like is very meaningful hello, mr. X

489
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,340
You're on deep background. Oh, then I can use this voice

490
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,980
It's hard easier to understand for sure, please

491
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,220
Just for the sake of journalistic integrity. Could you please speak as clearly as possible?

492
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,380
So there's no issue with the with the transcription. Yes, of course

493
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,120
Thank you

494
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,560
That was as best as I could do that was very good for me

495
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Back I think this guy's having a stroke

496
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,360
He keeps shaking his head as he talks, I think that might be the issue sweat is just flying off of him

497
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:28,160
I'm very nervous cow Mac. You're my best source. I need to know about two of your officers. He

498
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,000
Walks, he looks at you with that big mustache. He walks off the side of the goose boat that we're battling

499
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,600
We've got a goose but not a swan boat

500
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,480
It's a little uglier

501
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,200
Ours has sunglasses on so it's inconspicuous

502
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,360
On the eyes

503
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:59,680
Let's damn got always button to us that's that's what I want to know or do you do you have reason to believe and it?

504
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,600
Seems that you do that. Some of your rank are perhaps compromised by the gaudel Corp

505
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,600
Never come percentage about

506
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
I've never

507
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,680
Mocking you

508
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,160
Speak clearly man, you know, I know your father got you this job, but it's time to show some spine

509
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,840
City is in danger

510
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,880
Persuader bureaucracy or laws is a 20 year old kid

511
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Have no fucking clue where my dice is

512
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,800
While you're rolling Julius you receive a text from tife Rayland your uncle and it reads

513
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Need to see you in my office

514
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,940
Bring Beck and cow. What was I rolling? You are rolling on law

515
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,340
Bureaucracy or

516
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,540
Persuade I win them all with a 29. I win the mice

517
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:27,180
Julius doesn't respond right now. Well, you say that's just a type of the God all company is

518
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,220
When that's where me 10 films all through the city police department

519
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,220
And it's hard to know who you can trust anymore. Who's a real cop and who's a cop?

520
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,940
What percentage roughly would you say are cops?

521
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,940
Mm-hmm

522
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,460
Unfortunately, it's hard to tell these days, but I say it's somewhere between

523
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,740
15 and

524
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,460
25% this thick is a poison is poison

525
00:46:53,460 --> 00:47:00,060
That's going like a virus not poison unless a poison cause a poison that grows maybe a

526
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,900
poison that grows

527
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,040
Mac you may have just given us the name of the segment that wins the next Peabody

528
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,760
Bob what's all in the name to get it all out and make sure that the good people of the city are being taken care

529
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,360
Of and being watched over whether it's by the funny police department or the city. I can news or whatever goes out

530
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,240
Beck turns to Julius. I'm just getting plosives dude. It's all

531
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,040
a

532
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
Make sure you're getting the spit flying

533
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,080
Becca zoomed in on the lips to try to better understand him

534
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
I'm already there

535
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,240
Back I can feel the water level of this pond raising just

536
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,840
Mac that's what I'm trying to use the dire straight

537
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:16,000
I have known you since you were just a beat cop and I was a beat reporter

538
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,800
We would get drinks at suds and buds the bus sides of buds

539
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,600
I have they were the best suds of buds could have and you were my best, but

540
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Do you remember those days Mac?

541
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,520
Well, of course I go

542
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
I

543
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,120
It's amazing, I feel like my voice has grown deeper or more

544
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Distinguished

545
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,800
Except for the gray in your beard Mac. I'd swear you had an age today

546
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,440
Julius is giving back the craziest look

547
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,440
He's returning it

548
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,560
My father was a Mac his father was a Mac his father father

549
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,560
I'm a Mac. Oh, this is where we see he has like

550
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Fishman gills

551
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:20,220
Okay, I'm laughing too hard. Yeah, this is nuts. Let's get to the let's get to the point here

552
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,840
I mean you just keep doing it for a little bit. Well, I don't remember what that is

553
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You can break that what to do

554
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
Hold on

555
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:47,760
You're right Mac we should get to the point I pass him like a little sheet of paper that has the the

556
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:56,400
CPD 836 license plate on it and I say two of your officers were spotted entering the can offices last night and

557
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,480
Leaving with the biggest story of my career

558
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,400
I was hoping you could tell me who they were and where they might have gone

559
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,640
But I do think there are certainly one of those 15% that are

560
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,240
Gops, not cops role

561
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,880
law or bureaucracy

562
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,540
17 big ol pass yo

563
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,780
He's like basic platelet and he pulls out his phone cop that

564
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,580
What is your query I am

565
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,840
6c PD 8 3 6 8 2 6

566
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,600
Hold up two fingers to Thomas like okay, there's two people

567
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,600
It's

568
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
826 say 3 6

569
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:05,840
CPD 8 3 6 2 officers assigned to vehicle officers Richard Riley and

570
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,920
Wilson Wiley, well, why do you have it?

571
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,520
Which are violent and was compiled they show officers. What did they do? They stole the biggest news story since 9-eleven

572
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,760
Whoa

573
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,040
What do Karen to go into any details place? Tell me anything that won't get me into too much trouble

574
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,200
I yearn to learn you should have been a journalist my friend

575
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,080
I tried to get you to go into J school when we were roommates

576
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,080
Like it was yesterday

577
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,320
See me those dawn looking over a single tear trust

578
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,320
Cal's face. I know exactly what you mean Julius is once

579
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,040
once again looking it back like

580
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,720
You know what

581
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,040
We've got a boom hour like organically

582
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,800
If he's like vaguely, uh, like a nautical creature, right? He's a walrus in my head

583
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:04,440
Mac I can't thank you enough for this information. I know I did with some give me a little tease, baby. Oh

584
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,440
Oh

585
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,320
Mac you know, I can't do that. Hey, also, maybe next time just text me

586
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,040
I'll get a burner. It'll be easier

587
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:35,720
But you know these swan boats tire out my legs I you look down and he's just got calves for dogs

588
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,440
He's got the calves that like Julius Summers wishes he had with his thighs. Oh, yeah

589
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,620
We have just been going around in circles

590
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
The can boat circles

591
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,400
While Julius is like looking at back just dumbfounded

592
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:02,240
He is kind of not paying enough attention and goes right by them like a foot away

593
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,640
What is the back to shore?

594
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Cal just like glares at you

595
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,040
Like Tanya and Porsche

596
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,240
My Tanya Porsche

597
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,120
reference

598
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,720
I did think it would be funny. No right now. Well, yeah

599
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,360
Also kind of people will be catching up then over the holidays

600
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,280
And I thought it would be funny if we like just tease Joe about the things he hasn't seen watch it

601
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,280
I don't think that'd be funny

602
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,760
You guys parked the swan back at the dock and

603
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:42,240
Hop on out and he immediately goes to the person who's working there that the young person behind the counter

604
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,240
Thank you so much for an excellent

605
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,600
And heads up

606
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:54,600
For a what experience max on excellent got it Cal didn't catch that but he does tip the kid like 80 bucks

607
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:05,760
Julius finishes up his summer sausages and hops onto the deck and

608
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:11,320
Is just like stoked at what he just experienced but also very confused

609
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:18,120
Yeah, Cal Cal is waving goodbye to Mac as he gets like he walks back to the parking lot and he he turns around and

610
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,940
Runs up to you guys and is like well you heard the man

611
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,360
Yeah about that Cal

612
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:37,620
What the way he talked like is he like is that just like a thing with him Beck?

613
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,940
I don't know what you're on about

614
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:45,260
You know what sometimes I tell you hey watch those peas and I say the word plosives like he had a lot of the plosives

615
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:47,260
dude plosives plosives

616
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,380
Plosives that is a fun word

617
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:56,100
No, I don't know what it means. It's just the audio wasn't great, but I think we got most of it

618
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:03,620
Okay, I mean I you know, that's really your department back so that's a little disappointing to hear

619
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:09,420
Did you remember what the names the cop net said Richard Riley Wilson Wiley

620
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,340
Julius is gonna start googling those names. Oh

621
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:19,960
You're gonna be able to find some social media pages some would cops have LinkedIn

622
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,540
No cops have problematic Facebook's

623
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:32,160
Like no Instagram like no look at the groups. They're in so Julius is Julius finds a blue lives matter

624
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:38,120
Banner yep sticker thing with a frame. That is the Punisher. Yes

625
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:46,360
50 Wilson Wiley's yeah, but most of them are like, okay a third of them are the same like happy dad

626
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,880
He's like recreated all the photos like all the profiles

627
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,660
Every time we forgot his login

628
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,600
And then there's that one

629
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah, you scroll down through a bunch and you get to the the Punisher and the the blue lives matter Julius knows that this

630
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,540
Is who he's looking for? Oh, man, look look who's there in his featured photos. It's Richard Riley

631
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,220
Do they look like the guys I saw on the security ad so

632
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:19,280
Lutely and the the one that is tall mousy and wears glasses is

633
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,620
Wilson that is right. It's Wilson Wiley and the short jacked and bald one

634
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:31,500
That's Richard Riley Richard Riley shout out to Cameron from Kansas City for

635
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:39,340
Wilson Wiley one of our $10 patreon patrons. Hold on. Hold on Kansas City, Kansas or Kansas City, Missouri

636
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,940
It just says Cameron from Kansas City

637
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,740
Well, then I guess we'll see Cameron one has to assume, Missouri

638
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,740
You

639
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,100
Now a target

640
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:05,220
You guys are standing in the middle of City Park we were looking at the Facebook you were looking through the Facebook

641
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:12,460
I want to see if he's posted his like posted a status like with his his location accidentally on that's it

642
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:19,940
Just says an address of like maybe a house. He lives in interesting or like his militia meetup. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and real search

643
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:28,460
57 on a 70. Yeah, absolutely one of the most recent photos that has been snapped is

644
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:36,260
Actually of him and of Wilson it is of both Richard and Wilson together peeking behind a fence over a fence

645
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,180
They are peeking over a fence

646
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:43,800
It does have the geotech locked on there

647
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:57,780
And it is a location that is in the city in the warehouse district look nice

648
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:05,580
Dude does one of you live in the browser that seems like a cool place Julius might live

649
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:12,340
He is renting a house in the center place, of course, we know what kind of neighborhood the warehouse district is. Oh, yeah

650
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,340
Yeah, it's actually it's down by

651
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,780
It's down by the docks. It's like the warehouse district

652
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:23,660
Which is like specifically that's yes, but is it cool or is it not it depends on who you are

653
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:27,460
I suppose for someone like you it might not be cool for someone who is

654
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:34,860
Maybe Beck speed but ten years speedier might be cool. I mean younger or older

655
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:39,060
I think it means young it's cool. Yeah, it could be cool. It's up-and-coming cool

656
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:44,340
I mean clearly these guys aren't hanging out at a cool place guys. I I I think I went to a

657
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,220
Show in a warehouse around this area in college

658
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,060
Which was not that long ago

659
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,060
I

660
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,660
Been doing like a bar

661
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,700
Wait, seriously, you two are you want to go to the warehouse district?

662
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:12,340
I mean, that's it's where the guys are. I did a lot of reporting in the warehouse district in the 80s

663
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:19,220
It's it's actually a kind of a up-and-coming spot. There's a restaurant there called the black widow

664
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,220
Interesting, it's all eggs

665
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:26,900
Spider egg shaped foods. It's where a cool young person might live

666
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,740
It's kind of like two blocks where you would actually live and then the rest is, you know less up-and-coming

667
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:37,180
Exciting but this is definitely right off one block over from where it's cool

668
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:44,100
Well, let's let's go check it out. Joy is to get another text. This just says ETA. Oh fuck guys. I forgot

669
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,100
My

670
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:53,220
My uncle texted us while we were filming that and he wants us to come in but yeah, I mean like I

671
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:59,140
Don't know. We can't like disobey our boss, but I can't show my face in there without that footage

672
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:03,780
We've got to show it tonight Julius. I think you're right. We've got to go find the footage

673
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:09,980
Can you like hold off your uncle tell him we're pursuing a lead and we'll be there in an hour and a half. I

674
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,740

675
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:17,300
Picture that I took while we were on the boat and I'm gonna say get in a workout in

676
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:27,060
Our 1.5 HR question mark and send that to off to oh, oh Julius

677
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:33,180
He's gonna think you're not applying yourself. He knows about my my routine. We talked about it before I got hired

678
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,580
Like he's like listen if you want to be on TV

679
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,060
You're gonna have to give a little Hemsworth

680
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:51,180
My worth is good. My worth my worth is my legs. Your Hemsworth is Hemsworth

681
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,640
So Julius, that's your cock and your pecs

682
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:05,540
Julius sends that text off worriedly and let's get there really fast

683
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,540
We

684
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,700
Which is what Julius is saying into the phone

685
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,540
Yeah, he's holding like a Bluetooth speaker no, it's the topper has one in it

686
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,820
That's right, I forgot as you're going to the warehouse district

687
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:33,240
You're flying through you're checking up on like the locations around where that GPS spot was where the picture was taken

688

KBD I've had some times here. You see what they changed the name to where it's like completely empty

722
01:04:58,660 --> 01:04:59,900
It's not bumping

723
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:06,540
there's an empty patio and you can see like through the windows from the outside that the place is

724
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:13,560
Empty and there's a massive truck sitting all by itself in the parking lot nuts for days

725
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:18,580
For sure, and it's got a big bumper sticker on the back that says in God

726
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:22,980
Oh, we trust my god. What happened to this place. This used to be Gintim and cellar

727
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:29,360
The finest wine bar in the city and now it's what is it called? Well

728
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,620
the owner

729
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,620
Gintim and got cask of Amontillado

730
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,940
And they changed it to where are we

731
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,860
We're a bucket gets barred

732
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:48,460
Which I came Ida which I came to a lot in college if that's the name

733
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,620
Why does it say w h e re in the dare font? I?

734
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:57,580
Forgot I forgot Bucky kid got cask of Amontillado

735
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,700
By the cattle family becoming shallower and shallower

736
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,580
It must have new ownership

737
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,860
oh

738
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:24,860
We made 20 minutes of fucking around turn into a pretty good joke this place gives me the crease

739
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,740
You've got to be brave Julius

740
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:36,780
As you walk in you see TVs everywhere the lights are dim

741
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:44,740
There's memorabilia from city sports teams all over the walls pictures up on the walls as well, and what is it Joe?

742
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:48,260
I realize we should have come up with a game guys. We should come up with a game plan

743
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,840
We're about to like confront cops about stolen property

744
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:55,220
This isn't gonna go in our favor come up with a game plan when it took so long to come

745
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:03,180
Are you insane I don't I don't I don't know if they'll be here
