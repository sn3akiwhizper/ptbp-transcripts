1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Greetings, Dream Babies!

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,260
It's your sleepy daddy, Wolf the Dog,

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,840
and I am here to snooze 18 hours a day

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,940
and eat garbage for the six waking hours.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,520
As for the other four hours in the day?

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,180
Well, I try to catch up on my math lessons.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,700
I am yawning at you live from 694.2 PTBP,

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,500
the only radio station that definitely penetrates your sleep brainwaves

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
even when the radio is turned off.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,260
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Ain't Slayed Nobody,

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,340
a new actual play podcast playing Down Darker Trails,

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,300
the Old West setting for Call of Cthulhu.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,640
They done gone and tagged that pretendin' pod in a tweet, ya hear?

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,100
That's some Western talk for you cowpokes out there.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,140
They write,

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,440
Dear Wolf,

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,180
Isn't it time for a pretendin' to be pups spinoff?

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,500
Think of the subscriber counts before you answer.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,800
Anyway, we reckon we were more excited than popcorn on a hot stove

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,640
when we earned this announcement.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,480
We have some things in common,

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,640
being a comedy horror podcast where we pretend to be people.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,520
In our case, cowpokes, drifters, prospectors.

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,700
But the setting don't matter a lick when death is knockin' down the door.

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,000
Bein' is where the new kid's on the plane.

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,240
We'd sure appreciate anyone who lets us bend their ear for an episode or two.

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,700
Did we detect a little Texan accent there beneath the grit, Wolf?

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,040
Via con diablos, your friends at Ain't Slayed Nobody.

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,700
Now listen here, bub.

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,420
I don't do anything I do for some kind of subscriber count.

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,040
I do everything I do to whet my own whistle.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,800
But I digress.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,020
That sounds like an interestin' settin' y'all got there.

34
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,520
The Old West.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,400
This Texas you speak of.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,980
I feel as though I may have been there in a past life.

37
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,560
Or a future one.

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,520
I have been all places at all times at some point, I am sure.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,240
My existence is persistent like that.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,000
Anyway, it sounds like a good time.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,620
I wish I knew what the fuckin' internet was so I could see a goddamn podcast.

42
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,180
Just a simple tweet with a tag somewhere in it or an Instagram story at Pretending Pod.

43
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,180
That's all it takes.

44
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,640
And then you can write up something for your old Wolfie to howl.

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,280
Plus, all your followers will know what kind of filth you're into.

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,540
Disclosure is good, my babies.

47
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,280
Disclosure and money.

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,680
Wolf the dog has an odd relationship with money.

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,400
Paper money is crazy and I don't understand how nobody uses it.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,560
But coin money?

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,040
Now that's some shit you can get some grease on, baby.

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,160
Grease up them coins and throw them in the bathtub and have yourself a good old time.

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,840
And speaking of money, you can use some of yours to support the show over on patreon.com

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,800
slash pretending pod.

55
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,400
The month of May will be particularly blessed with an edited bonus episode wherein the boys

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,040
take on a legendary house in Call of Cthulhu's The Haunting.

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:34,360
As well as part one and part two, if all goes well, of the scenario voted on by the patrons

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,800
Caleb Stokes, lover in the ice, a delta green favorite that gets nasty real quick.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,780
Those in the den of sin can expect a behind the scenes live stream of the recording process

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,180
for part two of that game in the next few weeks.

61
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,860
To the den of sin now and see the recorded stream of part one as soon as you join, if

62
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,900
you want to see how the sausage gets played, patreon.com slash pretending pod.

63
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:11,700
If that felt like an advertisement, then squeeze that grip tighter until I bloop out the news.

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:18,100
Those gosh dang contention police officers woke up in Ari Manstein's tomb again.

65
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,000
It's the third time this story, what in the holy time traveling fuck is going on?

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,840
They saved an old woman from a freakishly long limb creature in a black suit.

67
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,640
Wow, that's nice.

68
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Then she died.

69
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,200
That's not as nice.

70
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,400
Keith, John, and Clark tried to convince an otherworldly being they were its deceased

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
co-worker, Jim Cook.

72
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,080
Realizing quickly that Keith was not Jim, the creature tried to get some info, but due

73
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,440
to the lack of perspective, mostly just fucked with them, knowing it was going to wipe the

74
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,460
memories of the past week at the end of the encounter.

75
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,180
But did our beloved heroes allow themselves to be brain mopped?

76
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,820
Abso-fucking-lutely not.

77
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,900
They remember everything.

78
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,420
And then Drew Andrews pulled up.

79
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,740
A few folks on the fine internet dropped the line to say Drew sounded too confident.

80
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,360
Others suggested this was a more worldly Drew, like he'd seen some shit.

81
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
I can't see shit either.

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,720
Just a hot pile of yes please and a head full of kudzu with no backbone.

83
00:05:41,740 --> 00:06:04,560
Hey everybody, it's time for episode 77 with my best friends, Thomas and Luke and Joe and

84
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,640
everybody.

85
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,600
We can't sing on the Zoom call together cause there's lag and you can't sing with me.

86
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:21,320
Do you want to go ahead and get a cut of you introducing that better?

87
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,080
Thomas can suck my dick, I would like it, he is my least favorite person in the world

88
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,460
except for he's not, I am a dirty liar and I love him so dearly and I miss kissing his

89
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
face.

90
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,460
Oh boy.

91
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,460
Face.

92
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
Me.

93
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,600
I miss kissing your faces too.

94
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,480
I wanted to start today with a quick game where we try to kiss each other's faces.

95
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:51,120
So we play the Price is Right rules with the mechanics of this game so real quick I want

96
00:06:51,120 --> 00:07:00,240
everyone to answer on like 3, 2, 1 you say us or you on who wins a roll.

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:08,000
So who wins if I roll a 52 on a 50 and you roll a 51 on a 60?

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
3, 2, 1.

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Us.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes, nice.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Us.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,440
And if I roll a 0, 7 on a 40 and you roll a 45 on a 45?

103
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Us.

104
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Us.

105
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,360
And if I roll a 44 on a 70 and you roll an 11 on a 50?

106
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Us.

107
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,640
I don't know on that one actually.

108
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,900
I think you, it's two crits versus you get the higher crit.

109
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
What happens?

110
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,560
In two crit situations the higher crit wins.

111
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
You.

112
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,880
Unless it's a 1.

113
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Unless it's a 1.

114
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,680
I've got one last one for you.

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:48,600
If I roll a 0, 1 on a 10 and you roll a 69 on a 60?

116
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Us.

117
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Us.

118
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,840
Because that's a crit fail for us.

119
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,720
No, no, isn't 69 always a critical success, right?

120
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I don't know that one.

121
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
And it trumps all of these?

122
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,880
No, does it trump all others?

123
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
It trumps a 1?

124
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,640
We've never, I guess it does.

125
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,880
It's the crit.

126
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
It's the crit.

127
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
It's the crit.

128
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,680
So thank you.

129
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,880
You all did very well, almost perfect.

130
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,580
But yeah, no, it's good to get that out.

131
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,160
A solid C.

132
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,200
So here are your degrees.

133
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Who's it signed by?

134
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,680
Oh gosh, who would it be signed by?

135
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
The Hamburglar.

136
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Zach.

137
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Zacho.

138
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,840
This is great, I feel like we're in the last scene of A New Hope where they're getting

139
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
their awards.

140
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,600
Yeah, so if you could all just bend down.

141
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,640
I was trying to remember a scene in New Hope where they were like quizzing each other on

142
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
numbers.

143
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
I couldn't come up with that scene.

144
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,600
It's when they were trying to get into Mensa.

145
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,560
Chewie loses.

146
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,160
He freaks out.

147
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,440
Drew just pulled up in the red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse, rolls down the window, hello contention

148
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,920
police officers, please get in the car and come with me.

149
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Drew.

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So good to see you, Drew.

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Wait, what?

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,480
You are, and you are, and you, who are you?

153
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,800
Oh, hey Drew, well, I'm John Lee Kevin Moore in a manner of speaking.

154
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:29,680
You see, Kevin was Marvin Glass's main enforcer along with Rosemary, but he was actually the

155
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,080
lobotomized, I mean, completely brain-removed body of my, of my father.

156
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh my god.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is John.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,840
I'm John, yeah, I'm John, and I'm in this body now.

159
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,000
John Lee Pettymore, the missing John Lee Pettymore?

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,560
Is that what they're calling me?

161
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,840
Well, John Lee Pettymore the third disappeared so long ago and everyone just assumed he died.

162
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Right.

163
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I...

164
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,040
Yes, he did, right?

165
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
I don't understand.

166
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:05,360
Well, I'm looking at you right now, I'm so, but you're saying that you are, now Drew has

167
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:14,400
been through a lot with you guys, and he did, in fact, witness the Cat Man switching bodies,

168
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,160
so this is, um...

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,800
He can roll with the idea of somebody being in somebody else's body.

170
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
I like what you're saying here.

171
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
A little bit better, yeah.

172
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,520
He's gonna be able to slightly understand that, and so John Lee Pettymore the fourth

173
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:35,400
is in the body of John Lee Pettymore the third, and your body is, where's your body?

174
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,480
Well, my body was rendered useless.

175
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,640
You know what, we can get into all this later, I don't really know if we have time to explain

176
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,120
ball to you.

177
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,280
What's contention like?

178
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,560
Oh, we have to get back, I mean, we are in desperate need of help.

179
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:59,400
Okay, so contention is working still, yes, of course, and we're working on puddle teaming

180
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,200
everywhere, so basically what we gotta do-

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Puddle teaming?

182
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Puddle teaming, yeah, so you guys should probably come, I mean, that's why I'm here, I'm here

183
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,680
to come get you so that you can come back to contention and help, because you are the

184
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,760
only police officers that we had, and you all abandoned us, and I wanted to come find

185
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
you and bring you back so that you could help us, thank you so much for doing that, but

186
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:28,800
we have these deep man-made puddles all over contention so that if somebody sees the residue

187
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,840
coming then you can jump into the puddle that's teaming, right, so, baths.

188
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,800
Whose idea was this, Drew?

189
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,040
Did you organize this, Drew?

190
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,200
Oh gosh, no, it was Pastor Adam Cain, it was Pastor Adam Cain that did that, and he's

191
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
taken over.

192
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Did you call him daddy?

193
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,600
What, no, it's just, it's a fun, it's a fun thing, he's like kind of, um, okay, so contention's

194
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,240
pretty wrecked, right, and so we needed a leader, and Pastor Adam Cain is taking care

195
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,960
of everyone at the First Creek family at contention, and so everyone is there, and that's how we're

196
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,440
staying safe.

197
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,080
Uh, how long have we been gone?

198
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,640
Oh yeah, no, this all popped up in like a day.

199
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah, well I mean, I just want it to be known we didn't abandon you, we were pursuing leads,

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
relevant leads.

201
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We're professionals, Drew, you should know this by now.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,640
Yeah, we were just doing our jobs, I mean, we eliminated a couple huge threats to the

203
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:40,320
town, Marvin Glass won't be sticking his weird looking face in our business anymore, for

204
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,620
one, cause he's dead, or maybe he's not dead yet in this timeline, but he will be due to

205
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,260
our actions in the past.

206
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,260
You haven't seen us since we left contention, right?

207
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
No?

208
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
Okay, good.

209
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,260
Wait, what?

210
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
Probably.

211
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,260
Don't worry about it.

212
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,940
We'll explain all of this on the way back to contention.

213
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,500
Have you been receiving calls from us?

214
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,380
Have you, has your phone been off or something?

215
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:09,900
Oh, I, and pulls out a burner, and is like, sorry, I had to get a burner cause I got wet.

216
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,980
I had to jump in a puddle.

217
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,380
You said, you said that you got this puddle teaming thing going on, and you got people

218
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,020
who are jumping into puddles if they see the ooze.

219
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,500
Are you able to see the ooze now?

220
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,220
No, no, we use kids and crazy people.

221
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,340
Kids can see the ooze.

222
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,640
Yeah, maybe that was just a bit too much tell, not show, but yeah, we use kids and crazy

223
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,980
people to do it because they can see the ooze.

224
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:40,600
No, I think me and my partners are all glad you told us, instead of relying on us to see

225
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,780
those details.

226
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,020
So kids and crazy folks, huh?

227
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:53,700
Yeah, they can see it for some reason, so basically we use them to scout locations,

228
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,420
but these puddles are everywhere, you know, it's really good.

229
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,020
We also call it bass brimming.

230
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,820
Alright, what do you do with people when their foot gets too pruney?

231
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,500
Oh no, it doesn't take long, you just stay in there for like ten minutes and then the

232
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,980
residue will move away.

233
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,620
It seems like a pretty good system.

234
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,140
I mean, we can't live like this forever, is what I'm trying to say.

235
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
We're trying to come up with a solution.

236
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,580
Well, people have been through worse, Drew, you know.

237
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,660
I don't think they have.

238
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,220
Throughout human history.

239
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:26,420
Then being hunted by an unknown ooze that most of them can't see unless they're crazy?

240
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,420
Yeah.

241
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,500
Oh, okay, the war, you know.

242
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,540
I mean, it just seems like you got the puddles.

243
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,500
I agree that the implementation has been fantastic and the safety, thank you for saying that,

244
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,180
the safety measures taken have been very good, but what we are trying to do now is

245
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:49,540
get back to a sense of normalcy and we would appreciate having the police officers of contention

246
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,420
help us in that regard.

247
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,820
Well, okay, of course we will come back and help you, but it is way too soon, I think,

248
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:04,020
to close the puddles.

249
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,460
I walk over to the passenger's side and get in.

250
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,060
Drew, you say you want to return to a sense of normalcy and that you guys have been working

251
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,060
on ideas.

252
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,620
Have you or Pastor Adam Cain come up with any ideas that seem viable so far?

253
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,820
I'm sorry, Daddy Cain is who he means.

254
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,260
Oh, no, you can call him.

255
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,940
You can call him pastor.

256
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
It's fine.

257
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,700
You know, it's just, anyway, what was the question?

258
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,460
Do you have any ideas, any thoughts on any theories?

259
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:36,020
Have you developed any idea about how to maybe vanquish the ooze once and for all?

260
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:44,260
Okay, so we can collect it with fish.

261
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
With fish?

262
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,260
Go on.

263
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Right.

264
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
So how'd you figure that one out?

265
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,260
Oh, okay.

266
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:56,140
So I wasn't there, but apparently a fish can like gather the residue, it like sucks up

267
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,540
into it, basically into its mouth and then you can squeeze it out.

268
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
To what end?

269
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,540
Oh, to get rid of it.

270
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,380
I mean, if you needed to put it all somewhere, right, so we're just kind of collecting fish

271
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,380
that have it.

272
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,500
How do you know if the fish have it?

273
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,980
What you're saying is the pastor is collecting all of the ooze in one place?

274
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,700
Oh, yeah, I guess you could say that is what we're doing.

275
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,260
Oh, my God.

276
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,460
Is he putting it into like barrels or how's he collecting it in one place?

277
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
I don't know.

278
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,460
I'm not there.

279
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,460
I don't like the sound of that.

280
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,340
Okay, I think we need to go talk to this guy.

281
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,900
We need to get back to contention.

282
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,540
Remind me not to eat Nia's fish fry on Friday.

283
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,340
How quote unquote crazy would a feller have to be to see the ooze?

284
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,340
Oh, um.

285
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,880
If you put a numerical value on your sanity from one to 100, sure, sure.

286
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,460
What threshold might you say someone would start to see the ooze?

287
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,860
I think it's totally a matter of either losing five or more at once or hitting a breaking

288
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,820
point or going to zero.

289
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:07,300
That's a very concise and to the point and I appreciate how you ran with my metaphor

290
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,300
straight away.

291
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Yeah, you picked that up real quick.

292
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
That was good.

293
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,100
I'm just trying to be more forthright here in the end times.

294
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,940
Hey, Drew, did you ever get that cat carrier we sent you off for?

295
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Yeah, of course.

296
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
All right, just checking.

297
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
I mean.

298
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,340
Hey, have you been spending your money?

299
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Yeah, no.

300
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,340
No.

301
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,580
Yeah, that sounds rad.

302
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Hey, the feller we sold it to.

303
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
He's dead.

304
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
Wait, what?

305
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
Yeah.

306
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,340
The Duke is dead?

307
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,340
It was Keith's brother.

308
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,340
The Duke was Ferguson Beans?

309
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,340
Yeah.

310
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
And Keith killed him.

311
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,020
Why don't we talk about it on the way back?

312
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,020
Okay.

313
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,020
Montage.

314
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,020
Road trip montage to contention.

315
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,020
Road trip montage to contention.

316
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:56,620
Drew looks at you guys and is like, so you guys had the gun and the camera and the Nike

317
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
bag.

318
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,020
Do you guys have all those with you?

319
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,620
The gun and the camera are back at Marvin's, but don't worry.

320
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,380
We've got a plan that eventually our past selves are going to pop out of the ground

321
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,740
and then we're going to go and get them.

322
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
So don't worry about that.

323
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Thank you.

324
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,740
Say that again.

325
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,420
How much time do you reckon we have to get back to contention?

326
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:20,660
Like could we maybe go run and see a movie and wait until the wee morning hours to leave

327
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,660
the city?

328
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,620
Because if we do, then we could bring the gun and the camera back.

329
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,020
Does he have the bag too?

330
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,020
Yeah.

331
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,900
Marvin's got that bag too, huh?

332
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,900
So yeah.

333
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,740
I mean, if you think people could, uh, you know, puddle it out for another 12 to 18 hours

334
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,060
say, and until we can just stroll on into that glass compound, which will pretty soon

335
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,500
be, be ruined.

336
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,100
How is it going to be ruined?

337
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,400
Well, uh, a pretty funny sequence of events, honestly, we could probably just go get some

338
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:59,960
seats and watch it happen again, if you think we can, we can spare the time.

339
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,040
I mean, do you need us back in contention by this evening or can we, can we wait until,

340
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,820
you know, maybe we get the gun and the camera and then hit up a diner and get a nice like

341
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,120
breakfast and then head back to contention tomorrow morning.

342
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,360
There is something in contention.

343
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,520
I think that would be important for us to check out.

344
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
What's that?

345
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
What's that?

346
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,900
I'll just show you then to explain, but we need to go back to my, my hotel first and

347
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,360
it'll make a lot more sense.

348
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,120
Are you talking about checking on your, on your dog?

349
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,440
Oh shit.

350
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:37,880
Yeah, I guess I do need to do that too.

351
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,240
That's my question to Drew.

352
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,120
Drew, do you think we need the gun and the camera and the Nike bag before we head back

353
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
to contention?

354
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
Okay.

355
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Here's what I'm going to say.

356
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,160
I think that having the gun and the camera and the Nike bag would be a huge plus.

357
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:00,840
However, the most important thing is that you guys come back with me to contention.

358
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,640
I will say though, if we do wait, contention will be a different place when we get there.

359
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm sure of it.

360
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
What do you mean by that?

361
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
That doesn't sound good.

362
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,740
No, I just mean like I have a feeling the situation happening in contention currently

363
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,700
will have changed, maybe even escalated if we were to not handle it currently.

364
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Sure.

365
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,700
Sure.

366
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,700
If we were to go do something else.

367
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,740
It's entirely up to you guys because there's three of you and there's only one of me.

368
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,940
And this whole fish thing collecting the ooze.

369
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,480
Oh right, yeah.

370
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,140
The pastor rubbed me wrong the first time I met him anyway, so.

371
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,660
The pastor did what to you?

372
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,340
He was not very welcoming to me.

373
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,260
I find that deeply hard to understand.

374
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,660
What a wise man.

375
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,100
You know, Keith kind of, Keith that up to be honest.

376
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,460
Have you always had this admiration for pastor Adam Cain or is that a risk to them?

377
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,060
It's just that when someone steps up in the face of crisis, you have to give thanks where

378
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
thanks is due.

379
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,100
Drew, you haven't, you haven't tithed to this fella, have you?

380
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Roll human.

381
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,060
Ooh, 55, what do I have?

382
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,660
Fuck, I've got a 50, so critical fail.

383
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,460
Dang!

384
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,580
Don't leap anymore.

385
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,340
No matter which body you're in, I think that you of all people would understand that what

386
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,380
is Drew Andrews' money is Drew Andrews' money.

387
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,700
Alright, just don't get taken for a fool.

388
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,700
No one could ever call me a fool.

389
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,900
Wow, that sounded really ominous.

390
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,060
And forceful for you, Drew.

391
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,460
Drew, have you ever branded somebody a fool?

392
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,140
I've been gone for one day, maybe.

393
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,320
You've been gone for one day and like, I know we said the whole thing, but you think

394
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,980
I started branding people with my newfound fame and fortune?

395
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,520
Not fame, but fortune?

396
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,620
I'd like to human this.

397
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
No.

398
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,620
No, okay, good.

399
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:04,300
I, for one, am going to throw the hat in the ring that I don't know what the gun and the

400
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
camera help us much down there.

401
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Yeah, we don't really know how to use them.

402
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,580
I think we should get down there, do what we can first.

403
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,880
Do we have one name left on us or two?

404
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
We got two.

405
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
We got Tildy.

406
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,420
Okay, so this isn't-

407
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,260
And uh, Drew?

408
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,460
We don't need to bring everything.

409
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
Wait, hold on.

410
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
You guys have my name on you?

411
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,060
Two contention to wrap it all up.

412
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,780
No, no, no, it's uh-

413
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,780
You're on our mind.

414
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,540
Keith was just about to say, Drew, you're uh, it's so great that you came and got-

415
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:33,040
Yeah, I was gonna say we got Tildy written on us and Drew, this is another thing we'll

416
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,060
have to explain on the way, but we got names written on us.

417
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Wait, okay, you got my name written on you and-

418
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,380
No, no, no, no, no.

419
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
Oh, you got Tildy?

420
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,780
I mean, Keith, you just-

421
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,780
Even though that is what it sounded like Keith was saying again, you just said it.

422
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,620
He just said the word almost exactly, word for word.

423
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,620
I mean, it sounded like-

424
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,620
I, I interrupted myself.

425
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,140
Do you even know what you're talking about, Keith Vigno?

426
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:58,300
When you speak, do you ever know what's coming out of your mouth?

427
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Bubble gum tree.

428
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,020
Now, Drew, you don't get to talk to him like that.

429
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
Bubble gum tree.

430
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Oh yeah.

431
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
Okay.

432
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,400
He could just be repeating what we said, bubble gum tree.

433
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,620
He could just be repeating what we said, bubble gum tree.

434
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,020
Oh God.

435
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
Oh shit.

436
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,540
But yeah, I do wonder, is this the real Drew Andrews?

437
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,920
Tell us something Drew Andrews would know.

438
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,660
I sold a pallet of cocaine with John Lee Pettymore IV for $10 million to the Duke.

439
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
No, everybody knows that.

440
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,940
Wow, Drew, you just said that out loud with other officers in the car.

441
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,940
This was a sting, Drew.

442
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,420
Drew looks around to see if there's anybody besides you guys in the car.

443
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,540
I thought they knew.

444
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,700
I'm just messing with you, Drew.

445
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
I know about it.

446
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,060
I'm disappointed in it, but.

447
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
What's your cousin's name?

448
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,060
Emmett.

449
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
He's the EMT.

450
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,580
Yeah, Emmett the EMT.

451
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
Okay.

452
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,740
If you're still wondering who I am, Keith Vigna, thank you very much.

453
00:23:53,740 --> 00:24:01,500
I went and picked up a cat carrier to go take a cat that had the soul of an FBI agent inside

454
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,740
of it.

455
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,300
So maybe don't question me.

456
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Okay.

457
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Okay.

458
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,060
We just got to be careful, you know.

459
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,620
Well, if he is fake, he's a very good facsimile, so.

460
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,780
I get behind him and start peeling his face off.

461
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,220
No, I don't do that.

462
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,740
It would be really hard.

463
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,060
Drew, can you take us to my hotel?

464
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,660
Yeah, real quick.

465
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,700
Who has the best humant?

466
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
I have 80.

467
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:37,060
Oh, go ahead and roll that 80.

468
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
Check that out.

469
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,220
I can't see what that says.

470
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,220
It's a 79 on an 80.

471
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Oh, nice.

472
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,900
Keith Vigna, you know that something is up.

473
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Drew is acting strange, obviously.

474
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,180
That's why you questioned him on it, but he definitely skipped out on the question of

475
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,380
how he knew where you were.

476
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,380
Yeah.

477
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:07,740
John Lee Pettymore's eyes roll back in his head and he feels 10 points lucky.

478
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
Unluckier-less.

479
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
Unluckier?

480
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,740
Luckless.

481
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,740
Can we watch this?

482
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,740
No, I'm gonna kick you out.

483
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,740
Hey, Thomas.

484
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,740
Hey, Zach.

485
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:29,460
What are you looking for in the deep depths of John Lee Pettymore's mind?

486
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,740
John Lee Pettymore is going to use his clairvoyance talent by spending 10 luck, and he wants to

487
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,500
know if this Drew can be trusted.

488
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,780
Like even if it is the real Drew, can we still trust Drew?

489
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,500
John Lee Pettymore as your...

490
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Sorry.

491
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
John Lee Kevinmore.

492
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:54,260
What I have on my character sheet is Kevin John Pettymore the third.

493
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,060
I love it.

494
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,060
Kevin John Pettymore the third.

495
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,920
But I think John Lee Pettymore the third works too.

496
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,580
John Lee Pettymore the third.

497
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:09,700
Your eyes roll into the back of your head and you see a reflection, it's your daddy.

498
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,740
Well it's the body you're in currently, but it's back when he was still your daddy.

499
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,960
You recognize the face from pictures.

500
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,700
The reflection is poor, clouded and gray.

501
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,580
It's a television screen.

502
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:31,260
Then the television turns on, and you see the empty interior of the contention police

503
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
station.

504
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,260
And it's a mess.

505
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
It's a wreck.

506
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,460
There's water that's been splashed all over the place.

507
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:42,620
There's files just like riddling over the floor, over everything.

508
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,500
It's where it's in the state that you last saw it.

509
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,480
And the channel changes.

510
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,840
You see Jim Cook in an abandoned gas station briefing three familiar faces you recognize

511
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:02,480
from a file in Marvin Glass's compound as a team called K-Cell, comprised of this young

512
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:10,100
John Lee Pettymore the third, aka Kevin, a man called Kyle, and Karen, which is the alias

513
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,300
of Anne Love.

514
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:18,460
As the three are leaving this derelict come and go, you see Jim Cook calls Karen back

515
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,260
real quick to have a word in private.

516
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,060
The channel changes.

517
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:30,820
Back in the disheveled contention police station, Drew Andrews leans on a two-tiered plastic

518
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,520
cart as he pushes it towards the evidence room.

519
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:41,180
He punches in the code, enters with an empty cart, and rolls on out with the radio on top

520
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,820
and the helmet on bottom.

521
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:50,780
And that helmet is sitting on the briefcase that you know contains Drew's cut.

522
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,900
Five million dollars.

523
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:59,860
The channel changes, and you see Drew pushing this full cart up through the sanctuary of

524
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:08,020
the First Church of Contention, which is hard to recognize with all of its pews removed.

525
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,860
And the TV turns off, click.

526
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:18,020
But then, the glass of the television screen slowly rolls down like a car window as Karen

527
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,140
screams.

528
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,140
She's holding these two people at gunpoint in their own hallway just to the right of

529
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,660
you, and they refuse to tell her what she wants to know.

530
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,460
Where is it?

531
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,620
She screams behind the screen.

532
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:40,260
Inside this television, you see there's a book.

533
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:47,060
It seems to be made of a strange, uncured leather that's got like, maybe some hair on

534
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
it?

535
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
A few freckles?

536
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,300
It's the human book.

537
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:58,100
You blink, and you're staring at your reflection again in this completely normal television

538
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,300
screen.

539
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:06,220
You stand up and turn to Karen, who is now maniacally laughing as she shoves her pistol

540
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,160
into the man's mouth while forcing the woman to watch.

541
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:18,760
You feel a decision inside yourself being made.

542
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
It's not here.

543
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,940
I mean, he talks like that now, but it probably sounded normal back then.

544
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
It's not here.

545
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,140
Hey, we got it.

546
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:39,580
Karen's eyes light up as she begins chanting in some tongue, either ancient or alien, and

547
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:47,640
this couple begins rising slowly, steadily off the carpet.

548
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,220
Do I recognize the couple?

549
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Yeah, you've seen-

550
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,480
Is it Clark's parents?

551
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
It's Clark's parents.

552
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,140
It's Eunice and Jerry Bishop, Clark's parents.

553
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,740
You've seen their picture every day for a while sitting on Clark Bishop's desk.

554
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:07,140
Your vision shifts completely to a close-up of a man's left hand.

555
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:14,060
Blood is flowing down from his forearm and dripping from his fingers, and you see Drew

556
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:27,000
Andrews lean into frame and kiss the ring on this man's hands, bloody fourth digit.

557
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,680
What I'm getting from my question, can we trust Drew, is no.

558
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,120
Yeah, I think that's going to be a no dog.

559
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Okay.

560
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,680
Did Keith say he was in the front seat or the back seat?

561
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Front seat.

562
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm going to say I am directly behind him.

563
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680
Okay.

564
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Do you want me to bring the other two back?

565
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:53,840
Right rear passenger seat, yes.

566
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:01,660
All right, John Lee Pettymore III is 10 luck lighter as his eyes immediately come fluttering

567
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:10,360
back into reality, and he looks to his left and sees Clark Bishop in the back seat right

568
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
next to him.

569
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
Are we driving right now?

570
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,040
As you're driving, yeah, on the highway towards contention, and Keith Vigna is up sitting

571
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,320
shotgun with Drew Andrews driving this red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

572
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,800
I've seen it before, and it led to good things, so I just let it happen.

573
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,520
I might, you know what I'll do, I'll like tap Keith on the shoulder and just kind of

574
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
point.

575
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
He's doing the thing.

576
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Remember?

577
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
He was able to like see things last time.

578
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
And then he's back.

579
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
I don't know what the-

580
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,960
Uh, hey Drew, can you pull off at the next exit?

581
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,320
I'm so sorry, but I really have to pee.

582
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,640
This old body, the bladder isn't, you know, not as strong as I'm used to.

583
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:58,040
I'm still adjusting to the new Corpus, so, uh, could we, could we pl- I just, I'm about,

584
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,700
I'm about to piss all over your car if we don't, you know, pull over right, right, right

585
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,640
now at this next exit at this gas station.

586
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,200
That really freaks Keith out.

587
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,840
Hey, Jon, I understand that maybe when you're in an older body, you know, some bodily functions

588
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,440
don't work the same way that we used to, and, you know, you're not as trained in knowing

589
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,840
when your body needs to go, but I ain't gonna need you to maybe just like hold it because

590
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,960
as you well know, there aren't any gas stations in between the city and contention, it's only

591
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
an hour drive.

592
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
Uh, uh, okay, well, um, I lied.

593
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,160
I don't need to pee.

594
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,760
I'm about to shit my pants.

595
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,120
I'm gonna shit, and this car is gonna smell like shit the whole ride.

596
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Please pull over, Drew.

597
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Oh, Drew, please pull over, we don't want that.

598
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,080
These guys have some bad memories about an old man shittin' all over the place, it'll

599
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,700
probably make them barf all over the car.

600
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,080
It's just because of the memories, though.

601
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,400
Even if we just find a field or something.

602
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,920
Oh, no!

603
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:01,800
Exactly, yeah, so, uh, yeah, I mean, I like just pull over on the side of the road and

604
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,560
I will go shit in that long grass, I swear to God.

605
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,520
Yeah, no, of course, for sure.

606
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,760
Uh, yeah, I'll drive you.

607
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,840
He sees this like little country road that's going off, little gravel road.

608
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll take this, turns off, and drives down it just a little bit, and

609
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,840
then is like, hey, do you think here is fine?

610
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,960
Yeah, yeah, oh my God, just pull over, just pull over to the side of the road.

611
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,880
You're next to a cornfield, but it's December.

612
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,040
Perfect, perfect.

613
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,880
So it's just flat land that you can clearly see through.

614
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,040
I'll just, I'll just, I'll just duck down low.

615
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,480
As we're pulling in, I'm nervous and I have my hand on my gun, but not like out.

616
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,120
I think Clark is oblivious, he's thinking, oh shit, John's got a shit.

617
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,760
To that end, uh, John steps hard on your toe.

618
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,360
Oops, John, you got me on my foot there.

619
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,560
John gives, gives Clark, like he, he stares daggers at him.

620
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,320
Okay, so the car has stopped.

621
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,200
The car, as soon as the car stops, John pulls his gun on Drew.

622
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,040
As soon as I see that, I pull my gun on Drew too.

623
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,680
All of our eyes just got so big.

624
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,000
Clark doesn't pull his gun right away and is startled.

625
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,080
John says to Drew, put it in park or I'll blow your brains out.

626
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,720
Oh, John, John, John, fellas.

627
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,600
Put it in fucking park, Drew.

628
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Drew puts the car in park.

629
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,920
Take the keys out and hand them to Keith.

630
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,500
Drew takes the keys out and hands them to Keith.

631
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,280
All right, now slowly exit the vehicle.

632
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,240
Clark, Clark, you get out too and you keep them covered.

633
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,600
As soon as he's out, I want you to put them in handcuffs.

634
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,520
This ain't our Drew.

635
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,080
Oh, it ain't our Drew.

636
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,920
Money changed.

637
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,440
Clark has gone ahead and starting to get out.

638
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,840
I answered all your questions.

639
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,200
I answered all your questions.

640
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,280
I don't know why you don't think I'm me.

641
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,160
It happened all the sudden.

642
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,960
John, I mean, you're not even John, what's going on?

643
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,800
Hold on just a second.

644
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,400
Murphy keeps barking at the door.

645
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,120
What the hell did that mean?

646
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,680
I think he's got a shit real bad.

647
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,500
Murphy's barking at the door.

648
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,340
He's barking at the door.

649
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,340
That's what it means.

650
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,020
I know you already said you have to go poop.

651
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,820
Drew Andrews slowly opens the driver's side of this car.

652
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,980
Get on him, Clark, cover him.

653
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,820
I'm doing it.

654
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,940
And hands in the air.

655
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,760
Okay, guys, I don't know what's going on here,

656
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,020
but I would really thank you

657
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,020
to not do whatever you're about to do.

658
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,860
Drew.

659
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,220
Drew.

660
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,060
Drew, stop talking.

661
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,300
Stop talking right now, Drew.

662
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,260
I'm putting his hands behind his back

663
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,060
and I'm saying, Drew, I'm sorry, but I got to trust

664
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,660
my partner here and I'm cuffing him.

665
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,860
Okay, yeah, I mean, Drew's not gonna resist.

666
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,700
Drew.

667
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Wait, hey, I turn back to you.

668
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,720
All right, John, what's going on here?

669
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,680
I don't like having Drew in handcuffs.

670
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,520
This isn't right.

671
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,040
I know, he knows it too.

672
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Ever since I came back into this body,

673
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,960
I've had the ability to peer beyond the veil.

674
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,720
Now it takes something from me,

675
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,080
but I can see moments from this sphere

676
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,880
in which I did not participate.

677
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,260
Like the future or?

678
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,660
And the past.

679
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,760
This time it was just the past

680
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,480
and what I saw in the past was that Drew took the radio,

681
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,880
the helmet, and all his money from the evidence locker

682
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,780
and gave it to the church.

683
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:40,120
And then he kissed some creepy bloody hand with a ring,

684
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,220
a wedding band on its finger.

685
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,240
So Drew, my question to you

686
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,080
is why did you take those items to the church?

687
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,880
I mean, it's simple really.

688
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,880
When someone is quick to take control of a situation,

689
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,000
then they have all the power

690
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,480
and people who have all the power have the ability

691
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,760
to make other people do things that they may not wanna do

692
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,500
and I was one of those people

693
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,560
who was made to do something that I didn't wanna do.

694
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,000
They said that I could be saved.

695
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,360
I could have my life, I could be safe

696
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,280
if I brought these things

697
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,280
and so it was my only option.

698
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh, Drew.

699
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,200
Drew, you didn't think to ask us or call us?

700
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,040
Roll a human.

701
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,880
Me?

702
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,700
Yeah.

703
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,860
38 on an 80. You all can.

704
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,340
Three.

705
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,980
Ooh, a seven. I pass with my little dinky score.

706
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,700
Joe and I just human-ed the shit out of Drew.

707
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,580
I lost my dice.

708
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,660
Those are pretty important

709
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,940
for what we're doing here today, Zach.

710
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,820
That's a crit fail.

711
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,140
Make some numbers up.

712
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,100
Yeah, if you just wanna say numbers, that's fine.

713
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,460
That's what we've been doing.

714
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,460
When I dropped my dice earlier, I couldn't find it, so.

715
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,780
I accidentally threw away my character sheet.

716
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,660
I've just been winging it.

717
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,220
That's a pass.

718
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,740
Okay, what did everyone roll?

719
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,900
38 on an 80.

720
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,500
Three on a 50.

721
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,340
Seven on a 30.

722
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,060
Yeah, it seems like he was stuck

723
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,900
between a rock and a hard place

724
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
and had to make a decision

725
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,800
and this is the call that he made.

726
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,060
How'd the pastor know about the money?

727
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,780
Well, he kinda tortured me.

728
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,620
What?

729
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,680
Drew.

730
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,260
When he says that, I kinda look him over.

731
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,220
Is there any visible torture on his body?

732
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,940
Drew lifts up his shirt.

733
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,940
There is a ring of blistered skin on his stomach,

734
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,420
on his round belly.

735
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,660
Oh, God, Drew.

736
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,740
There are scratch marks, cuts, and bite marks

737
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,220
all over the inside of this circle.

738
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,620
The pastor did this to you?

739
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,620
Well.

740
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,500
You do that thing where you heat up a container of rats

741
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,620
and they try to escape by clawing through your belly.

742
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,380
And Drew just pukes.

743
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,620
Something crosses his mind and he just like retches

744
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,620
and is like, ugh, ugh, ugh.

745
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,500
Vomit splashes on his feet.

746
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,220
John, can I get him out of these cuffs?

747
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,820
This is just sad.

748
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,180
I don't know if we should take him out of the cuffs.

749
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,020
I mean, I think we can keep him with us

750
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,500
and not fear for our safety,

751
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,220
but maybe we should keep him detained

752
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,860
until we know the full extent of the hold

753
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,460
this pastor has over him.

754
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,680
If we haven't patted him down,

755
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,980
it might be a good time to make sure

756
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,100
he doesn't have any kind of-

757
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,680
I get out of the passenger seat,

758
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,400
I go over and I hug Drew,

759
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,600
but then I pat him down after I give him a hug.

760
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,600
There is a small piece of cheap carpet in his pocket.

761
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,900
It is a little damp

762
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,900
and it's been rubbed on something that is like red

763
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,580
or like dark red.

764
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,460
Basically looks like a tiny piece of cheap carpet

765
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,820
that's been dipped in blood.

766
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,660
Drew-

767
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,500
But maybe not dipped,

768
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,460
but just like a little bit rubbed on it.

769
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,460
Drew, what is this?

770
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,780
It's nothing.

771
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,980
Drew, come on.

772
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,020
It's obviously something.

773
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,260
It's something that was in your pocket, it looks like.

774
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,520
It's a real strange item you got there.

775
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,820
No, it's just, I found it in the car.

776
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,780
In this car?

777
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,940
Drew.

778
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,140
Everybody roll human.

779
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,820
Everybody roll human.

780
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,260
72 on a 80.

781
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,500
43 on a 50.

782
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,020
He didn't find it in the car.

783
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,080
Drew, we know he didn't find this in no car.

784
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,660
Just tell us what it is.

785
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,300
You know we're just trying to help.

786
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,500
We're the good guys.

787
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,620
I don't, I-

788
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,860
Are you still a good guy, Drew?

789
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,940
I don't know if you are.

790
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,980
Do you remember what happened to the town of contention

791
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,740
while it was under your watch?

792
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,740
It was under your watch too, Drew.

793
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,660
Everyone.

794
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,300
People lost their animals, people lost their families.

795
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,700
Drew, you know as well as us

796
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,540
that we did everything we could.

797
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,580
We were working the case the whole time.

798
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,560
It's not like we abandoned anybody.

799
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,060
Didn't talk to anyone about anything.

800
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,760
Didn't let the public know what was going on.

801
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,580
Didn't respond to any calls.

802
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,860
Drew, we responded to every call we could.

803
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,020
Now you well know, working for the department yourself,

804
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,500
that we were ill-equipped

805
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,460
and had none of the resources we needed

806
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,260
to face a full-on reality-shattering catastrophe.

807
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,640
John, are you ill-equipped for everything

808
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,060
that you've ever come across in your life?

809
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,360
Drew, does this little carpet sample,

810
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,360
is this some kind of magic talisman

811
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,520
that the preacher's using to control you?

812
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,360
Yes.

813
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,960
Wow, that was a hell of a swing and a hit there, John.

814
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,800
Good work on that.

815
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,520
I'm fucking kidding.

816
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
It's not what it is, thank you very much.

817
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,480
You can just say something and then it's true.

818
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,760
Drew, you've never been sarcastic a day in your life.

819
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,280
Something's wrong with you.

820
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,880
Something in you is not you.

821
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,040
What's going on here?

822
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,560
I just don't understand why you guys don't believe me.

823
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,120
We believe that you were tortured and gave up the gun.

824
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,960
Okay.

825
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,080
We just, or not the gun, you know, the Adams.

826
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,920
Yeah.

827
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,260
Obviously that affected you.

828
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,360
Sorry about the whole rat thing.

829
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,240
Yeah.

830
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,320
Rat, yeah, that's rough.

831
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,720
So what have I done wrong?

832
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,840
Tell us what this is, where it came from.

833
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,440
We need you, yeah.

834
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,240
We need you to tell us what this is.

835
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,220
Okay, I'll show you.

836
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Hand me the, just put it in my mouth.

837
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,200
And Drew opens up his mouth.

838
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,520
I look at the other officers.

839
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,680
What do you think, fellas?

840
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,520
I mean, he's cuffed still.

841
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,520
You're the one who's been real suspicious here.

842
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,280
Do you think it could be something

843
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,960
you could use against us in some way?

844
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,020
What are you gonna do if I do that?

845
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,840
You asked earlier, if telling you about this

846
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,120
will make us like be cool,

847
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,880
cause I don't know why you put me in handcuffs

848
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,080
all of a sudden, like I haven't done anything wrong.

849
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,360
So if this'll make us cool,

850
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,960
then I'll just tell you the truth about this.

851
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,480
I didn't wanna blow your minds or anything,

852
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,120
but just like you asked earlier

853
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,560
about how I knew where you were

854
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,900
and this is how I knew where you were.

855
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,480
So tell me like who you wanna know where they are

856
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,840
and like what they're doing or something

857
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,000
and put that in my mouth.

858
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,080
Okay, yeah, why don't you just tell us

859
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,200
the nature of this item?

860
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,600
I believe you, you don't have to demonstrate.

861
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,440
Why don't you tell us exactly.

862
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,640
If you believe me, then take me out of these handcuffs.

863
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,880
Thank you very much.

864
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,020
No, no, no, you gotta tell us what exactly it does

865
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,660
and how you came across it.

866
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,700
I put it in my throat and it chokes me out

867
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,260
until I almost die and I go unconscious a little bit

868
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,240
and I see where whoever I'm thinking about is.

869
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,900
Drew, I'm almost certain someone is playing a prank on you.

870
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,220
Keith gets excited, puts the carpet in his mouth

871
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,360
and says Tildy.

872
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,060
Holy shit.

873
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,120
You gotta shove it in there,

874
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,260
like making a dog take a pill.

875
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,780
Okay, describe it in detail.

876
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,280
This seems like something that someone should draw.

877
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,880
Mid-sentence, he just grabs Drew's mouth,

878
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,180
opens his mouth up, shoves the carpet in there,

879
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,380
closes his mouth and says Tildy B.

880
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,900
Drew?

881
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,340
Drew, you there?

882
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,540
Oh, I almost threw up.

883
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,120
Hold on, Clark, you gotta let him nearly die.

884
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,320
I'm looking at his eyes, though, is he conscious?

885
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,060
Is he aware of his surroundings and all that

886
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,500
as he's choking?

887
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,940
Yeah, he's just choking.

888
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,260
He's gotta pass out for the magic to happen.

889
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,460
He slowly gets on his hands and, well, no, he's handcuffed.

890
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,260
Is he handcuffed behind the back or in front?

891
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,380
I said behind earlier, yeah.

892
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,780
So he gets down on his knees and-

893
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,940
I'm kinda helping him down.

894
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,300
Okay, yeah, and then help him onto his side.

895
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,580
That's what he's trying to do.

896
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,420
That's what I do.

897
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,140
And he's just choking, choking, choking,

898
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,940
and then he's completely still.

899
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,180
And then this small, little violently red burst

900
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,420
shoots out of his mouth,

901
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,680
and the carpet only comes halfway out.

902
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,560
It's mostly just blood he spits out.

903
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,500
Carpet's hanging out of his mouth,

904
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,120
and he starts chewing on it a little bit.

905
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,960
Oh, God, oh, yeah, that is not wonderful.

906
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,720
If you could unhandcuff me, please, now that we're friends.

907
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,520
Tilly B. Mitchell is in a dark container.

908
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,080
It seems to be four walls made of some sort of material

909
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,120
that she cannot get out of,

910
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,040
and I couldn't really make out everything

911
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,000
that was her whole deal,

912
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,120
but she didn't seem to be tan.

913
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,800
It was very, very pale.

914
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,880
Cool, anybody else you guys wanna know?

915
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,760
No, no, please, please.

916
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,080
What's Jay Leno doing right now?

917
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,580
I just can't, I can't, did you see what-

918
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,920
Shove it in there, shove it in there.

919
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,840
Let's see what old Jay's up to.

920
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,280
I bet he's driving a car.

921
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,060
I need a sanity roll from Clark Bishop

922
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,640
and John Lee, Pettymore the Third.

923
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,280
I mean, you think we give a shit

924
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,560
about his little vision carpet?

925
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,000
I hope so, you like-

926
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,240
With everything we've seen at this point?

927
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,400
No, you're rolling sanity for making him choke

928
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,260
and basically torturing him.

929
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,400
He's crying on the ground right now.

930
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,280
I mean, Keith did that.

931
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,720
Plus, Drew told us it would happen.

932
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,060
It's not like it was unexpected.

933
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,760
So you're cool with just being like, yeah, that's fine.

934
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,440
No, apparently not because I rolled a 97.

935
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,500
John, this hits you deep.

936
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,560
This hits you so deep.

937
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,500
You feel like all at once you're like,

938
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,560
oh, I could have stopped Keith from doing that.

939
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,160
And we could have asked Drew

940
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,560
if we could have made it more comfy on him somehow

941
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,400
or at least gotten him out of cuffs

942
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,080
before we got him like choking violently on the ground,

943
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,900
gasping for air, unable to like see any future

944
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,640
for himself in that moment.

945
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,040
I do not regret keeping him cuffed

946
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,160
while we tested out the magical item

947
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,900
with only his word for what it did.

948
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,360
I think that's super fair.

949
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,080
Lose one sanity.

950
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,640
I failed my roll.

951
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,640
You're gonna lose one sanity as well.

952
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,420
That makes me hit my breaking point on the dot.

953
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,660
Okay, well, let's roll on the table, baby.

954
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:25,160
I'm gonna get Thomas and Luke out of here.

955
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,000
Bye.

956
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,960
So you're gonna roll a D100 three times

957
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,280
while I pull up the core rule book

958
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,720
for Call of Cthulhu seventh edition.

959
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,240
Got a 56,

960
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,200
a 98,

961
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,120
and an 89.

962
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,080
That's weird.

963
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,000
Also to calculate breaking point,

964
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,600
it's your sanity minus power.

965
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,200
Sanity minus power.

966
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,020
Correct.

967
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,720
So I've got a new breaking point of six.

968
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,000
One more mania to go.

969
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,800
All right, yeah, we're gonna do a mania on the first one

970
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,080
and a phobia on the second one.

971
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,640
How about, how about mania?

972
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,880
All righty, Joe, you rolled a 56,

973
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,000
which is ichthyomania.

974
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,300
Oh my God.

975
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,140
Is it fish?

976
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,840
It's an obsession with fish.

977
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,680
Yup.

978
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,400
Well, I think we got our winner right off the bat.

979
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,240
Pretty much.

980
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,400
Just to hit the other ones,

981
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,200
98 is typhlomania, which is pathological blindness.

982
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,040
Okay.

983
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,140
And then scribblomania, obsession with scribbling

984
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,960
or doodling, that would have been good for.

985
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,520
If we didn't have a fish thing in there,

986
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,960
we could have had that.

987
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,840
Yeah, so it's an obsession with fish.

988
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,320
The way that I should play this though,

989
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,680
is like when they are present, right?

990
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,040
Like I don't have to like seek out fish from now on, right?

991
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,220
I think maybe now and then you can seek out fish

992
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,860
if you would like to.

993
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,120
Maybe if Clark Bishop, oh, I brought them back too soon,

994
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,400
but otherwise you don't need, yeah.

995
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,600
When you guys rolled sanity,

996
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,840
Thomas rolled over his power, did Joe as well?

997
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,300
No, I did not, I rolled a 34 on an 18, on a 19.

998
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,440
Okay, so as Drew spits some more blood out of his mouth,

999
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,620
he's kind of like leaning up as Clark Bishop

1000
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,340
is like helping him up.

1001
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,900
I think maybe even losing the sanity,

1002
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,660
like helping him up even quicker,

1003
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,920
like, oh shit, what have I done kind of thing.

1004
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,920
He's like, yeah, Tildy, yeah, Tildy is a dark room.

1005
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,340
Does he still have the carpet like hanging out of his mouth?

1006
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,180
Yeah.

1007
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,000
I want to pull it out for him.

1008
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,840
Thank you.

1009
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,480
Who are you going to ask about?

1010
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,560
Keith, I don't want to put him through that again.

1011
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,560
That was awful.

1012
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,240
That's a worst case scenario deal right there.

1013
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,740
John is running off into the field

1014
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,440
and it looks like he's trying to pull his own head off.

1015
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,200
John.

1016
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,160
You just hear him, like he's screaming

1017
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,760
and it just starts like it's fading

1018
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,160
a little bit in the distance.

1019
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,980
Keith watches that for a couple of seconds

1020
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,520
and then turns back to,

1021
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,120
Drew, who else did the pastor make you look for?

1022
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,180
Clark is maybe starting to head off toward John,

1023
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,160
hollering after him.

1024
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,720
You see John like trip over a golfer hole

1025
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,800
or something out in the field

1026
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,880
and he just like eats dirt and he slowly gets to his feet

1027
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,500
and he kind of like, he looks back

1028
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,460
and he shakes himself off.

1029
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,920
You're all right over there?

1030
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,780
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

1031
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,620
I'm all right.

1032
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:45,060
It's just a consequence of body swapping.

1033
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,100
Sometimes, you know.

1034
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,140
You gotta run, you gotta run it off.

1035
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,860
The mind gets a little at odds with the body.

1036
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,740
Kind of like why am I here, who am I,

1037
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,020
you know, what's going on, what's.

1038
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:56,980
I'd say I understand.

1039
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,260
It's all good, it's all good, it's all good.

1040
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,060
But if you're saying you're okay now, that sounds good.

1041
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,620
You see his arms like twitch

1042
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,860
and try to pull his head off like seemingly one more time.

1043
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,860
Then he flops him around like spaghetti

1044
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,360
and takes a big, big breath of air.

1045
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,200
And he pats his legs and like dust himself off

1046
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,780
and it starts walking back to the car.

1047
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,380
As they're out in the field,

1048
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:25,200
Keith asks who else the pastor wanted to look into.

1049
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:31,380
Yeah, you know, thankfully I just did it a few times

1050
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,520
just to find you.

1051
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,940
Did you look for all of us or just one of us or what?

1052
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,460
It was you mostly.

1053
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,300
Me.

1054
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,300
And as he says that,

1055
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,220
you see a flurry of movement in the distance.

1056
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,700
Far beyond John and Clark,

1057
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,540
both walking back through the field, there's a barn

1058
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,020
and a dark blur is whipping around from behind it,

1059
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:00,220
energetically bounding hurriedly into the foreground.

1060
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,220
Drew no longer sees any of you.

1061
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:09,220
He is only gawking eagerly at this frenzied black lab

1062
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,620
making its way toward you all.

1063
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,260
His big ass gums flapping about in the brisk

1064
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,720
December 6th wind, Drew cries out, Tyler!

1065
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,100
Yeah, Clark is, Tyler!

1066
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,940
Clark is really fucking excited.

1067
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,940
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

1068
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:06,780
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

1069
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,200
If nobody knows, nobody knows.
