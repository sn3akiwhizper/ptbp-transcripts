1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Salutations, my babies. You are listening to 694.2 PTBP,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,760
Contingent's best and only radio show. Now, Wolf got a little bit of news for y'all today.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,240
Now, I heard through the grapevine that Officer Keith Vigna didn't get the chief a birthday

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,280
present. Now, that's some cold shit. She did, however, receive a box with a single rose,

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,080
a white hard hat, and a black silk bow tie before leaving town. And Julia Maxwell crashed her car

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,960
driving drunk and was pronounced dead at the city hospital. Now, ain't that some shit for you?

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,680
A body was found at the piston junkyard. The body has a brand on the back reading,

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,440
This is a fool. That's some spooky stuff, y'all. That's just some spooky stuff.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,280
Now, we got a new jam for y'all today. It's Kudzu with No Backbone.

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Alright, Joe, if you wouldn't mind giving me a quick description of your character,

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,600
Clark Bishop. Yeah, sure. Clark is a 17-year veteran on the force. He's in his late 30s,

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,320
balding and letting himself go. He's a hard worker and does his best, but it's often not enough.

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,160
He pretends to know what he's doing. Often he doesn't, though. He's gotten pretty good at

14
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,240
faking it. Clark is from contention, and he knows the town pretty dang well. He's a lonely guy who

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,120
gets home from work, heats up his TV dinner, and watches Wheel of Fortune.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,760
And then he goes to bed and dreams about being a noir-style detective.

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,960
Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Okay, so you are going out to Carrie Page's home,

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,720
where she is called in last night that her dog is missing.

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,200
Councilwoman Carrie Pages. She is regarded highly in the community. You know of her,

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,160
you probably don't know her very well. She's got a night to play. She's in the old neighborhood.

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,600
It's where all these old houses are lined up. They've all been taken care of really well. These

22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,160
houses have been passed down from family to family. They're like rarely bought and sold

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,440
in this neighborhood. What do you want to do when you arrive at her house?

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
I'm gonna just walk on up and knock on the door.

25
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,280
All right, cool. So she answers the door. She has a beehive bun, cat-eye glasses,

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
and is wearing a bejeweled pantsuit.

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,320
No shit.

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,280
It is lightly bejeweled, but any bejeweling of a pantsuit is immediately noticeable.

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,160
And she is kind of freaking out a little bit.

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,080
Hello, thank you so much for coming.

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,640
Miss Page.

32
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,240
So my dog is missing. Tyler, you know Tyler? Have you seen Tyler?

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,960
Tyler, do you have a...

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Here's a picture. Here's a picture of him. And she hands you a picture. He's an old black lab.

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,600
Every morning he goes out and he typically just uses the restroom and comes right back inside

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,800
before I feed him his breakfast, before I leave for the day. But today he did not come inside.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
And, you know, I saw some... There was something...

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,920
Last night in the backyard, I thought I saw something moving, but,

39
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,800
you know, there's this rash of homeless people. Are you doing anything about that?

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,200
There seems to be more homeless in the community these days. And I just think...

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm very worried about Tyler. He's got a lot of meat on his bones.

42
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,920
And if the homeless people are looking for something...

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
But I'm not trying to say that homeless people...

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,720
Oh, no, man.

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm not trying to say that homeless people eat dogs. But I am saying that

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,840
perhaps he is a good-looking eating dog. He's a good dog to eat.

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm not... He is the kind of dog who would be... He's my... He's everything to me.

48
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Ma'am, has Tyler ever gotten out before?

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,720
Tyler is a very good dog. He is always very patient with me.

50
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
And he goes out the backyard and he comes right back in,

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
because he loves his home and he loves his food.

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,960
Has he ever gotten out of the backyard before?

53
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,280
No. We have very tall fences.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
Have you put up pictures yourself already?

55
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,880
No, that was this morning. Early this morning.

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,920
And I have not seen him since about 5 a.m.

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
It is 9 o'clock now and I'm late.

58
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,920
And I would really appreciate you to find my dog.

59
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,080
Would you mind if I took a look in your backyard?

60
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,640
Go for it.

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,920
I go in the backyard.

62
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,760
You go into her backyard. It's a nice backyard.

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,040
She's got a little back deck set up. She's got a little grill out there.

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,800
Lawn chairs and such. Big grassy area for the dog.

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
8-foot privacy fences all the way around.

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
Do I see anything out of the ordinary? Just on first glance of the yard?

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,360
No.

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,440
And then I want to just do a perimeter around the fence and see if there's any holes on the bottoms.

69
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
Go ahead and roll search for me.

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,960
Fail. 63 on a 20.

71
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,120
Okay. You see no holes in the fence. Nothing out of the ordinary as you're searching.

72
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,520
She comes outside and she's like, have you found him?

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
No, you're right. He's not here.

74
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,440
I know.

75
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,480
Do you ever take him for a ride or anything?

76
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,840
He goes out to the vet every once in a while when he is in need of a veterinary's assistance.

77
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
Do you ever take him for a walk?

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,000
I have taken him for many walks, but I'm in the car is when we go to the vet.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
When you take him on walks.

80
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,440
Sir, I am a good dog owner. I take my dog for walks all the time.

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
I'm just trying to think of where that dog might have gone off to on its own.

82
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,320
He would come back. I know him.

83
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,960
But he hasn't yet, right?

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
You have not found my dog. Is that correct?

85
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,680
Correct.

86
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,760
Okay. I would like you to find my dog.

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm working on it, ma'am.

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,220
Thank you.

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,520
Does that dog like to go anywhere?

90
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,760
I don't know what you mean. He comes inside and he eats his food every morning and now he's not

91
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,200
there eating his food. He should be in the room eating his food right now.

92
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,920
When you take him on a walk, what route do you take?

93
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,520
I go around the neighborhood.

94
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,920
All right. I'm going to take a quick lap around and I'll come back if I find anything.

95
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,200
Otherwise, here's the plan. We're going to put up some signs.

96
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you so much.

97
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
And we're going to find that dog.

98
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,800
I appreciate this. Would you like more pictures of him?

99
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,760
If you got them, sure.

100
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,560
She hands you five framed pictures of Tyler.

101
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,320
I take them.

102
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,480
And then she grabs one back and she's like, I'm going to hold on to this one.

103
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,480
Thank you.

104
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
You can hold on to any of these.

105
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,240
Thank you.

106
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,720
All right. And then I do what I said I was going to do. I'm going to do a lap around the

107
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,000
neighborhood and yell Tyler out the window as I go.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,500
Awesome.

109
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,520
Kind of hating every moment of it.

110
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
For sure. For sure.

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,080
Tyler.

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,080
As you go around the neighborhood, you don't see anything out of the ordinary.

113
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,040
You also don't see any homeless people in the area.

114
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,480
You would notice as you're going around the neighborhood, the dogs in this neighborhood

115
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,160
do seem to be like the ones who are outside, which there are probably a handful.

116
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,680
They're all barking pretty loudly at different points.

117
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,960
Not constantly, but like in spurts, you'll hear a bunch of dog ruckus and then nothing.

118
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,200
Does Clark have knowledge of dog disappearances lately?

119
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,160
There've been no dog disappearances lately from any council members who would have called

120
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,960
the police about it.

121
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,560
Sure. Clark's plan, I don't know how much you want to do right now, but he would go back

122
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,400
to the office. He would literally do a missing dog poster as part of his service to the council

123
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,840
woman. He wouldn't do it for anybody else probably, but he's going ahead and doing it,

124
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,880
making copies of the photos.

125
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,640
Just begrudgingly making dog, missing dog posters.

126
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,160
And then going out and posting them.

127
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,960
Okay. Awesome.

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
Oh, and he would also check the vet. He would call the vet or the dog pounder,

129
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,880
wherever dogs would turn up if they are found.

130
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,680
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. There's a dog pound. Yeah. There's like an animal shelter, dog pound

131
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,920
combo thing going on in this town. I would assume.

132
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,600
Clark calls them up and inquires about an old black lab.

133
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,400
Yeah. Nothing.

134
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,880
Okay. Cool.

135
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,920
So yeah, that's what his day is.

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
They say lunch explorer?

137
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,760
Lunch explorers.

138
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,080
Yeah. That's my, that's my dream job.

139
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
I would absolutely explore many lunches.

140
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
That's like Anthony Bourdain, but for daytime TV.

141
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,440
All right, Thomas, if you could give me a quick, quick, a quip.

142
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
Does it quit equip?

143
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,480
How about those fat cats in Washington?

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,800
Let's take that.

145
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,640
All right.

146
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,640
All right. Do you want to give me a description of John Lee Pettymore?

147
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,760
Yeah. So John Lee Pettymore, he is the fourth of his name.

148
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,160
He is a, well, he's half contention native.

149
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,920
His, uh, his father was killed by the DAA on his drug farm when like just after John

150
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,160
was born and his, uh, his mother moved them back to contention where she was from.

151
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,200
So he comes from kind of a, a pretty rough and tumble background,

152
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,400
but he definitely wanted to turn his back on that a little bit.

153
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
He's about six feet tall.

154
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,280
He's got light brown hair.

155
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,960
Um, and just a fucking killer cop stash.

156
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,240
He's pretty average build.

157
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,480
Like he was very scrawny in high school.

158
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
So he's a little like touchy.

159
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,280
He like, he looks fine, but he thinks he's like still for sure.

160
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,880
He kind of had a, he kind of had a pretty wild teenage years.

161
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
He really, he got in trouble a lot.

162
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,560
He raced sprint cars for a while, but an injury kind of scared him out of those and,

163
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
uh, ended his career there.

164
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,840
Got him into a safer line of work.

165
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,320
Kind of. Yeah.

166
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,920
He was, yeah, Cthulhu hunting.

167
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,280
In every campaign I've ever played that line of work has worked out great for my character.

168
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,000
Absolutely.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,320
Yeah.

170
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,640
Oh man.

171
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:22,960
Who was it?

172
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,520
Was it Archie who got ripped through the wall by the hell dogs?

173
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,920
Yeah.

174
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,640
That was tight.

175
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,000
All right.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,400
Perfect.

177
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
Thomas, John Lee Pettymore is going out.

178
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,640
Do you want to go to the spot where he called it in or do you want to go talk to Jimmy?

179
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,080
I, uh, I want to go to the spot and I will probably call Jimmy on the way and ask him

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,560
to meet me there.

181
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,640
You said he's my, like a distant cousin or something.

182
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:42,880
Sure.

183
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,160
Yeah, that totally works.

184
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,280
You guys, uh, known each other for a long, long time.

185
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,320
So you call him up.

186
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Uh, Hey, uh, John?

187
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,280
Yeah, Jim.

188
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,840
Yeah.

189
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,480
What's going on?

190
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,720
You called us, Jim.

191
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,320
What do you mean?

192
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
Well, you said there was an oil spill.

193
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,520
Uh, I mean, I don't know what oil spill you're talking about.

194
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,080
Listen, Jimmy, uh, Drew said you called in pretty early in the morning, 4 AM and there

195
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,040
was an oil spill.

196
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,200
I called the police station last night.

197
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,080
You sure did, Jimmy.

198
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, okay.

199
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,400
Um, were you tying one on buddy?

200
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
No, no, no.

201
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,440
You know, I don't mess with that stuff anymore.

202
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
Um, God, I, uh, I don't know.

203
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
I don't know what I know, Jimmy.

204
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,040
Uh, well, um, I don't know, man.

205
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,160
I don't know what to tell you.

206
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,480
All right.

207
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,160
Well, um, where are you at right now?

208
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,040
No, I'm at the shop.

209
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,920
I'm going to head down there.

210
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,240
All right.

211
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,360
I'll see you in a second.

212
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,680
Subtropolis is literally two blocks away from the police department.

213
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,480
Uh, I will, and we're both downtown, so I'll walk over there before I leave.

214
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
I want to ask Drew some details.

215
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,840
What, you got a call from Jimmy?

216
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,640
I got a call from Jimmy at a 4 AM.

217
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,120
Yeah.

218
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,040
I, he was describing to me this, uh, this, this black, uh, oil that was all over the

219
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,840
ground out on a country road out Southeast.

220
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,800
That's strange.

221
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Did he, did he describe the location more?

222
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,040
Exactly.

223
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Do you think you could get me to that place?

224
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,000
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
You hold the Fort down, raise MIA, of course.

226
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
Oh yeah, for sure.

227
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,520
All right.

228
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,400
I'll be back soon.

229
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:10,800
Okay.

230
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
So yeah, I'm going to go.

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,640
I'm going to stroll down to, I guess actually I want to take him with me.

232
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
So I'm going to pop over there in my cruiser.

233
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:16,880
Okay.

234
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,240
So you go to Subtropolis, you know, Jimmy is the manager there.

235
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
He's like pretty much always stone.

236
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,440
Just slinging sandwiches.

237
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,720
Hey Jimmy, first of all, uh, can you have your, can you have your boy make me a number

238
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,280
five and then, uh, I need to talk to you for a minute.

239
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,760
All right.

240
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,880
Um, yeah.

241
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,760
Uh, what's up?

242
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,360
So you don't have any recollection of talking to, talking to Andrew last night.

243
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,480
Uh, um, uh, nope.

244
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
What'd you, what'd you do last night, buddy?

245
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,520
Oh, you know, I was just, uh, uh, at, out at the house, uh,

246
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,280
hanging out.

247
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,160
Where does he live?

248
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,040
Went for drive.

249
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,560
Uh, he lives, uh, he lives out kind of by the country.

250
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,920
That part of town.

251
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
Yeah, it's down there.

252
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,520
He's like kind of got some land out there.

253
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,040
Your, your family, like all of your distant relatives just kind of like have a plot of

254
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
land that they've had forever.

255
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,520
Um, so he's down in the Southeast part of town.

256
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,280
It's a little bit more farmy out there.

257
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,080
Gotcha.

258
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,000
So Jimmy, what do you recall from last night?

259
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
Go ahead and roll humid.

260
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,200
Should Pat.

261
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,520
Yeah.

262
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,480
24 on a 50.

263
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
He's going to level with you.

264
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:28,800
Man, uh, I, I got some pretty good mushrooms in recently and I hadn't, you know, tripped

265
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,360
in a while.

266
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,480
So I went ahead and just did some, I did some mushrooms last night, man.

267
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,040
And I don't know, I kind of went off into my own little space in my head.

268
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,160
And, uh, I mean, it was a crazy fucking trip.

269
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,640
Yeah.

270
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,920
I, uh, I definitely don't remember calling the police station.

271
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm really sorry, but don't worry, man.

272
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,360
It's no big deal.

273
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,080
I feel bad.

274
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,720
Sorry, man.

275
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,760
Okay.

276
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,280
I mean, I'm still, I'm going to have to ask you to come down to the spot with me and take

277
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,840
a look at things.

278
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,480
Oh, just.

279
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,800
Okay.

280
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,360
Yeah.

281
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Jimmy, I'm not arresting you.

282
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,360
Oh my God.

283
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,400
Jesus Christ.

284
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,160
I thought as long as you sell me some of those mushrooms.

285
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
I was like John Lee Powell.

286
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,800
You know, I actually, I, I've got an eighth with your name on it.

287
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,600
I love you guys.

288
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,400
Hey.

289
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,040
And so you guys drive out there and as you're driving, he's kind of telling you, uh, about

290
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,760
his trip.

291
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,000
And, uh, yeah, I'm eating that sandwich.

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,240
Yeah, chow down that number five.

293
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,280
It's good chip layer.

294
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,640
Of course.

295
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
And, uh, you guys make it out there.

296
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,200
It's the exact spot that he had told Drew that he was at when you saw the oil spill

297
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
and there's, uh, seems to be nothing out there on the ground.

298
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,360
Got any recollection of being out here last night, Jimmy?

299
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,720
Uh, he kind of stares off and he's like, no, man, pretty, pretty good stuff.

300
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,080
It was crazy, dude.

301
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,360
It was nuts, man.

302
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,560
I was having these crazy dreams and like, I could have sworn it was real, man.

303
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,200
There's just,

304
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,920
Jimmy, uh, you know, you normally don't black out from mushrooms.

305
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,360
I never have before.

306
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,880
Uh, it was, uh, it was a nuts night, man.

307
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,400
I mean, I was drinking.

308
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,200
I'll admit it.

309
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,840
Yeah.

310
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,000
I was drinking a bit too, uh, but I'm pretty sure I didn't come out here.

311
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,720
Maybe I did.

312
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
I don't fucking know, man.

313
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,520
And he like goes through his phone and he sees that he made a call to the police station

314
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,400
which is the first time he actually believes you that this happened.

315
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,640
And he's like, Oh wow.

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
Yeah, that's my bad.

317
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,840
Jimmy man, I love you, but I watched

318
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,240
a woman's face destroyed last night cause she was driving drunk.

319
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,640
So you're going to have to promise me, be a little more careful.

320
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,720
I promise John, we don't want nothing to happen to that face of yours.

321
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,520
Oh, and why would you?

322
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,480
It's a good face.

323
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,120
Pretty good face.

324
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
Hey, don't worry man.

325
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,840
It's just no big deal.

326
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,640
I'll take care of it.

327
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,280
It's fine.

328
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,680
It's fine.

329
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,800
And I'm sorry about the call.

330
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,440
I don't know what that was about, but shit, you know, who knows what I was seeing?

331
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
All right, well I'm going to poke around anyway.

332
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,400
All right.

333
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,120
All right.

334
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
So do you like get out?

335
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,760
Are you parking and getting out of the car?

336
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,000
All right.

337
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,440
So you park and get out of the car.

338
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,880
You're out on this country road.

339
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,240
There's like nobody out here.

340
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
Um, you see a few houses in the distance and stuff.

341
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,440
Yeah.

342
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Nothing, uh, nothing too particular and checking the road, man.

343
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,040
There's not even like a stain on the ground.

344
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,600
Well, Jimmy, I mean, Hey, you know, even in that compromised mental state,

345
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,760
I'm glad you saw something and said something.

346
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,160
Yeah.

347
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,880
You called us.

348
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,840
That's the right thing to do.

349
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,800
Um, I am, I've got some vacation time looking up, coming up next month and I am looking

350
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,960
forward to these mushrooms, man.

351
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,440
Yeah.

352
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,640
Come on out to the farm.

353
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,080
You want to choose some shotguns?

354
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,360
Abso-fucking-lutely.

355
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,760
I do.

356
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,320
Yeah, dude.

357
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,560
Yeah.

358
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
It sounds like a good time.

359
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,480
Yeah.

360
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,280
Bring those sandwiches.

361
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,840
Thanks, John.

362
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,280
I really appreciate this, man.

363
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,920
I know, I know that you, you're trying to, you know, stay on, on your grind and, and

364
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,480
do your job and, you know, I should probably get back and, and, and take care of these

365
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,120
good people at contention, get them the sandwiches they need.

366
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,000
Something about this just bugs me.

367
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,880
I call Ray.

368
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,320
Listen, Ray, if you are south east of town, just keep an eye out around old County road.

369
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,240
Perfect.

370
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
Let me know if you see anything out of the ordinary.

371
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,400
For sure.

372
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,160
He will fucking something.

373
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,480
All right.

374
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,840
Yeah, that's perfect.

375
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,800
All right, Luke, if you wouldn't mind, could you describe Keith Vigna to me?

376
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,120
All right.

377
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,000
Keith Vigna is, uh, about five eight.

378
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,640
He's a 170 pounds, but he's down from 200 a little, he's been working out.

379
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,280
So he's slightly muscular, but he's still got a bit of a gut.

380
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,600
Because of his weight loss, his favorite pants are too big.

381
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
So he wears a belt and suspenders.

382
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,240
He's got the on purpose, messy hair look, but he doesn't pull it off very well.

383
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,920
So nobody can tell that it's on purpose.

384
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,240
Messy.

385
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,440
It just looks kind of messy.

386
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,160
Perfect.

387
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Like dirty blonde.

388
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,040
Typically he's in uniform, but the uniform he wears tends to be worn quite a few times before

389
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
he washes it.

390
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,800
When he's off duty, he wears like cheap thrift store finds that tend to be like ratty button

391
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,240
up shirts as opposed to like cool vintage clothes.

392
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,960
He's got like a crooked smile with a slightly yellowed teeth, like one crooked tooth.

393
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,640
He's always got a bit of scruff on his face and he's got like bright green eyes, but they're

394
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,880
a little bit sunken in, uh, kind of like tired look about it.

395
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,600
Cool.

396
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,560
Cool, cool, cool.

397
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,360
All right, Luke.

398
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,920
So you are Keith Vigna.

399
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,800
See, Keith Vigna is going to check out this, uh, house that has the doors swinging open

400
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,280
or whatever.

401
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,040
And it was called in by Mildred Mitchell, who is the neighbor.

402
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,080
So would you like to go to the house or the neighbor's house first?

403
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,600
Uh, I'll go talk to Mildred.

404
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,280
As you pull into the old neighborhood where all the old nicer houses are in town that

405
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,680
have been well kept through generations and stuff, uh, you pull up and you see the house.

406
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
It's across the street from Mildred's house.

407
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,640
Mildred's house is like really well kept and the house across the street is just very

408
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,080
plain normal looking.

409
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,120
However, she is right.

410
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,720
The screen door is swinging back and forth and the front door is actually open.

411
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,560
There's mail piling up in the mailbox and the next to the mailbox.

412
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,800
Okay.

413
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm going to Mildred.

414
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,520
Yep.

415
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,920
Okay.

416
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:21,280
So you knock and the door opens and you see a woman who has shock white hair and big rainbow

417
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,680
earrings and she is wearing a Snuggie and drinking tea out of a big mug.

418
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,160
Hey, Hey, how's it going there?

419
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,360
It's going good.

420
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,640
Did you called in about this house next door?

421
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
Yes, I believe so.

422
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,200
Who lives there?

423
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,320
I don't know the man, but he is, uh, he's lived there for some time and he, uh, years

424
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,560
or a couple of years for sure.

425
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,240
I don't, I don't, I don't talk to him very much.

426
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,320
He's, he's very, uh, closed off.

427
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,800
He, uh, he doesn't seem to be out and about much, but how old of a man are we talking?

428
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,240
He is, uh, probably in his like mid thirties, I'd say.

429
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,640
Okay.

430
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,280
So younger, younger guy, kind of a younger guy.

431
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Um, when's the last time you saw him?

432
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,320
Uh, I saw him, uh, a couple of days ago, I guess, uh, a couple of days ago.

433
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,840
Was he at the house or where?

434
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,080
Yeah.

435
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,400
Yeah.

436
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
He always, you know, comes and goes, you know, he's a person.

437
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,440
Yeah.

438
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,520
How long has the mail and stuff been piling up?

439
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,280
What?

440
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,920
The, the mail over there, I see that the mailbox looks full.

441
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,240
Uh, how long has that been going on for?

442
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,560
A couple of days, probably since the last time I saw him.

443
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,800
Uh, yeah, no, he, um, I don't know.

444
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,480
Has anything weird, has he done, is he just reclusive or is he, do you think?

445
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,240
No, no, he's just a normal guy.

446
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,480
You know, we're, we're pretty friendly in this neighborhood, but, uh, he's, uh, it's

447
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,560
cold out, so I don't go out too much.

448
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:44,960
Right.

449
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,520
Yeah.

450
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,400
Look comfortable.

451
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,760
Yeah, yes, of course.

452
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,720
And you kind of look behind her and like, it smells like pot.

453
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,040
Okay.

454
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,880
It smells like bottle over in this house.

455
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,720
And, uh, she's just this kind of crazy looking hippie lady.

456
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,440
Yeah.

457
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,760
Okay.

458
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,520
Uh, well, you know, I'm going to go, uh, run over there and kind of check out the

459
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,000
scene.

460
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,880
I appreciate the call.

461
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,120
Um, I might be back over to, uh, ask a few questions, but I think for now you've been

462
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,440
helpful.

463
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,240
So beautiful.

464
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,080
Yeah, no, it's just, uh, I didn't, I didn't think too much of the door being open and

465
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,240
stuff, uh, but it hasn't shut in a while.

466
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,960
So I thought I'd make, give you guys a call.

467
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,280
Okay.

468
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,240
Well, we appreciate it.

469
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,440
I will say, um, the other night I was here at the house and I, my blinds are typically

470
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,680
open and I was, I was just enjoying the view of the neighborhood and there was like a weird

471
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,760
flash of light coming from the house.

472
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,120
Uh, I don't know what that was.

473
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,080
From inside that house?

474
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,520
Well, it seemed to be from that house, maybe, uh, definitely from the neighborhood in that

475
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,320
area, I guess.

476
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,960
But it was so bright, it shined into my house, uh, which is pretty rare.

477
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,160
I thought it was strange.

478
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,560
I looked to see if there was a, a car of some sort, but, uh, you know, it takes me a while

479
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,000
to get up sometimes.

480
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,680
So I must've missed it.

481
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,360
I don't know, but it was pretty strange.

482
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,680
Okay.

483
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,920
Well, uh, I might be back over to, to kind of finish up everything.

484
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,000
Uh, but for now I'll be next door.

485
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,360
So, okay.

486
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,160
Okay.

487
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,480
Bye.

488
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
Thank you officer.

489
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
And she like shuts the door behind you.

490
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,080
Okay.

491
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,240
Uh, I'm going to walk over to the house and, and actually I want to go check the mail and

492
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,320
see if I can find out this guy's name.

493
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,680
His name is John Peters.

494
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,280
John Peters.

495
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,400
John Peters.

496
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,960
There's a car and his driveway and the screen door is swinging back and forth in the wind.

497
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
The front door is wide open.

498
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:22,880
All right.

499
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,080
I'm going to go just right up to the front door and just kind of yell inside and see

500
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,800
if anyone's home.

501
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,480
Nothing.

502
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,280
Nothing.

503
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,680
All right.

504
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,120
Uh, we get my flashlight.

505
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,800
Are we, it's daytime right now.

506
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,600
It is daytime.

507
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,080
All right.

508
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,120
I'm gonna get my flashlight out.

509
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,680
Anyway, um, get my flashlight out and just kind of go look inside the house and see if

510
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,280
I can find anything.

511
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,600
Okay.

512
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,360
So it's a large wooden door.

513
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,480
It is open, but as you walk by, you notice that the doorknob is like fully embedded into

514
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,720
the drywall on the wall where it is.

515
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,200
Okay.

516
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,000
So it's like stuck open basically right in the living room, which is the room that you

517
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,240
see when you first walk in, there are a couple of picture frames broken on the ground and

518
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,280
there is a large trunk also sitting there.

519
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,480
It is wide open.

520
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,720
There is a broken lock and a pair of bolt cutters sitting in front of it.

521
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,280
There's a bunch of like empty cans of beer around and there's bottles all over the place.

522
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,960
This guy clearly liked to drink.

523
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,440
Okay.

524
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,680
But the house doesn't look like ransacked.

525
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,120
No, I mean this trunk.

526
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,440
Yeah.

527
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,760
I mean the, the, the picture frames that are broken on the ground, but it doesn't look

528
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,600
like anyone stole a bunch of stuff.

529
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,640
The TV is still there.

530
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm going to look at the pictures and see if, what do those pictures look like?

531
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
Anything out of the ordinary?

532
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,080
It's just the owner and his family.

533
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,400
Basically there's some family pics, but it doesn't look like it's his nuclear family.

534
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:46,960
It's a bachelor pad.

535
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,040
Are we talking one story, two stories?

536
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,520
One story.

537
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,160
One story.

538
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,280
I'm going to just go search the rest of the rooms in the house.

539
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
Go to the kitchen and whatnot.

540
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,800
So as you go through the house, you're going to see, oh gosh, let's see.

541
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,560
Go ahead and roll search for me.

542
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
Oh, 33 crit success.

543
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
That is a critical success.

544
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,760
Well done.

545
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,120
So as you go through, you're going to see a key chain hanging by the door.

546
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,040
It has his house keys, a bottle opener, his car keys, a few small keys that say G10, G11,

547
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,560
G12, and a key fob for a rewards program at Dirty Dog Grooming.

548
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,400
And you would know from your time in the city that that is a pet salon franchise in the city.

549
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,880
Okay.

550
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,800
Also, as you're going around, you would see like when you get into his bedroom,

551
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,240
going through his stuff, maybe on his night table,

552
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,120
there are some stubs that seem to be like bedding stubs.

553
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,480
What?

554
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,120
So you know how like when you go to a horse race?

555
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,520
Yeah.

556
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
You've got the like bedding.

557
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,360
Yes.

558
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,920
Sorry.

559
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,200
Bedding stubs.

560
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
I was thinking like a mattress tag.

561
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
And these basically just have numbers on them.

562
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,480
There's nothing that really shows what he was bedding on or anything like that.

563
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,360
It's just a bunch of numbers and stuff, but you can tell with your search that they are

564
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
stubs from some sort of bedding.

565
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,600
Okay.

566
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Also, as you're walking past it, you didn't notice anything inside of it,

567
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,720
but on your way back, you saw that there were words burned into the top of the trunk.

568
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,680
What did they say?

569
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,920
It says in all caps, do not open if you want to live.

570
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,120
I want to peek inside that trunk and see if there's anything left.

571
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,520
There is nothing in there.

572
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
There's like padding at the bottom.

573
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,080
Okay.

574
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,040
But it's empty.

575
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,160
It's like foam padding.

576
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,360
There are indentations.

577
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,920
I gotcha.

578
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,240
Yeah.

579
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,360
And there are four indentations, one large, two medium, and one small.

580
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,320
One more thing.

581
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,080
As you were like searching the house through on that critical success,

582
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,680
you would see that the deadbolt was smashed.

583
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,600
Like basically this door was kicked in and the wood in the frame of the door is like broken out.

584
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay.

585
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,240
Okay.

586
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,440
So obviously somebody came here to get whatever was in that trunk.

587
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm gonna call into the station.

588
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,920
Bring up a contention PD.

589
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,720
Hey Drew.

590
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,480
It's Keith.

591
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,400
I'm at this house.

592
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,320
Are you familiar with John Peters?

593
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,040
Do you know that name?

594
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:14,880
No.

595
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,440
Okay.

596
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,240
Could you do a quick search for that name and see if anything pops up on him?

597
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,840
I'm at his house and he hasn't been here in a couple of days and it looks like there's been a

598
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,520
break in and so I'm thinking that we might have a missing persons kind of thing.

599
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,560
Oh geez.

600
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,520
What is happening?

601
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,240
I know.

602
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,560
Okay.

603
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
So let me look him up real quick.

604
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,000
Go ahead and roll luck for me.

605
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,960
What's your luck?

606
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,440
60.

607
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,360
That is a seven.

608
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,880
Yeah baby.

609
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,600
Let's see.

610
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,920
What would you learn about John Peters?

611
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,080
He has had very little contact with the police.

612
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,800
Like he has never, he hasn't done anything wrong really.

613
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,360
Yeah.

614
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,360
He did find, uh, he was in the hospital for a while, like a long time.

615
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,480
He had a long stint in the hospital and that was like a couple years ago.

616
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,520
Does it say why?

617
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:05,920
No.

618
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,560
Okay.

619
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,680
Well thanks Drew.

620
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,560
Yeah, absolutely.

621
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,080
I want to go back to that trunk and try to get the fingerprints off of it.

622
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,200
Go ahead and roll forensics.

623
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,920
I have a zero.

624
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:14,880
Okay.

625
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,960
25.

626
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Well it wasn't a crit fail, you just failed.

627
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,600
Yeah.

628
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,080
Okay.

629
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,560
You get some fingerprints off of it that you think are all right.

630
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,600
Probably.

631
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,800
You're like, I've never done this before, but uh, we'll give it a shot.

632
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,560
Okay.

633
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,400
You think you know how to do this?

634
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,720
Uh, you like get some scotch tape out and like...

635
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,280
I try my hardest.

636
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,160
Is there anything else you want to do?

637
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,600
If I've searched around the house and looked through everything, I don't know.

638
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,480
I guess I'll file a report just saying that it looks like a break-in.

639
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,200
I mean, I guess I can't file a missing persons because I have no other reason than the break-in

640
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
to suspect that, um...

641
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,880
Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me.

642
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,880
48 on a 50.

643
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,600
Yeah.

644
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,480
On his key ring was a rewards program for...

645
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,600
The doggy daycare or whatever.

646
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,640
Yeah, the dirty dogs.

647
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,680
Dirty dogs.

648
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,560
And uh, there doesn't seem to be a dog in this house,

649
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,200
or any like thing that would tell you that he ever had it.

650
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,560
Okay, I'm gonna give a call there, see if he maybe works there.

651
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:10,960
Okay.

652
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,840
Uh, he doesn't.

653
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,440
Do they know his name?

654
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,800
Go ahead and roll human.

655
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,760
Shit.

656
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,200
98.

657
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,160
Uh, you have no idea.

658
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,480
Cool.

659
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,320
I'm gonna make a note of the daycare or the doggy thing.

660
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,640
Yeah.

661
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,200
There's no signs of any animals living here.

662
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,600
Nope.

663
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,240
Okay, I'm gonna go back over and talk to Mildred real quick.

664
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,740
Okay.

665
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,920
Hold on.

666
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,240
She opens the door like waving her hand in front of her face and she's like,

667
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,200
Sorry, what's up?

668
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,960
You gonna skunk, skunk in there?

669
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,240
Oh yeah, um...

670
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,740
Yeah.

671
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,600
I'm not worried, I'm here to help.

672
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,160
Let's see, do you, have you ever seen John with a dog?

673
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,600
Uh, John with a dog?

674
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:51,920
No?

675
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,200
I don't think he has a dog.

676
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,680
Okay.

677
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,280
These dogs have been going crazy.

678
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,160
I know.

679
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,480
Yeah.

680
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,680
Okay, that's all I needed to know.

681
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,080
Okay.

682
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,920
And something clicks in Keith's mind.

683
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,160
All right.

684
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,720
Okay.

685
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,520
Is that all?

686
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,720
That's, that's, that'll do it.

687
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,680
You can go back to, uh, tending to your skunk.

688
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,560
I'm knitting.

689
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,840
Yeah, go back to knitting.

690
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,560
Thank you.

691
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,120
Yeah, I'll come see what you did later.

692
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,040
Anyway, okay.

693
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,600
Have a good night.

694
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,880
Have a good night.

695
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,120
Yeah.

696
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,560
Um, okay.

697
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,400
I'm gonna go back to the station and, um, I also want to get in contact with Clark and

698
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,640
see what he found out about this dog.

699
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,360
You guys are gonna meet up for lunch probably right about now.

700
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,840
Cool.

701
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,480
All right, sounds good.

702
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,320
Y'all ready for this?

703
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,840
The three of you meet up for lunch at the police station.

704
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,080
This is a weird place to eat lunch.

705
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,440
Let's go to Klinker's.

706
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,160
Clark definitely has a bologna sandwich in a brown paper bag and he's, he's already probably

707
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,360
chomping on it at his desk.

708
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,680
I know you probably won't be hungry after the bologna sandwich, but, uh, I'm thinking

709
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,480
subtropolis.

710
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,320
Already ate a subtropolis today.

711
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,680
I'll just canonically, I'll just get a, I'll order a pizza.

712
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,800
I'm interested in this dog cause I've got a connection to make.

713
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,080
Well, maybe you can shed some light on it cause I didn't make much headway.

714
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,400
She's missing a black lab named Tyler.

715
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,840
She hadn't done anything to find it.

716
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,680
So I went ahead and put up some posters for her and did a lab around the block and called

717
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,640
the humane society.

718
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,960
But I did note that them dogs was barking all around that neighborhood.

719
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,920
So I went and checked out that abandoned house.

720
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,240
I talked to the neighbor Mildred Mitchell.

721
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,040
She is a quirky little hippie lady, but anyway, she let me know.

722
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,400
He's kind of a reclusive guy.

723
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,640
His name's John Peters that lives there.

724
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,560
Obviously it looks like somebody had broken in.

725
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,520
It was kicked open.

726
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,800
The dead bolt had torn off some of the wood from the door frame and door handle was sticking

727
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,080
into the dry wall.

728
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,040
He had left his key chain with like his key fob and stuff.

729
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,720
So it looks kind of a little suspicious that somebody broke in and he had a big trunk there.

730
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,560
And on the top of the trunk, it said, do not open if you want to live.

731
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,120
Looks like somebody had taken bolt cutters and chomped the lock on there.

732
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,080
Totally empty.

733
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
Like nothing else had been stolen.

734
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,040
The TV was still there and all that.

735
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,520
But I did notice on his key chain that he left, he had like a rewards, like loyalty

736
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,120
card for dirty dog, dirty dog grooming.

737
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,360
He, there was no, there was no signs of a dog living there.

738
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,360
And I asked, I went back and asked the neighbor and she said she'd never seen him with a dog,

739
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,920
which kind of makes me think, I don't know why he would have that loyalty key chain.

740
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,760
Definitely bizarre and dirty dogs.

741
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,560
It's in the city.

742
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,800
Not sure why he would have that, but I was thinking, I was thinking, uh, he's, he's gone.

743
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,240
He hasn't been seen in a couple of days.

744
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,360
This dog's gone.

745
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,280
I don't know what the connection there would be, but I, it could, it could be something

746
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,720
just to think about.

747
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,240
Isn't it as plain as day?

748
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,280
Man loves dog.

749
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,480
Dogs loves man.

750
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,760
They run away, run away together.

751
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,360
Damn.

752
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,840
That's why you're the best detective on the force.

753
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,960
What'd you find out?

754
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,840
What kind of oil?

755
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,440
Canola?

756
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,720
All, you know, my, my cousin, Jimmy, cousin, Jimmy oil, my cousin, Jimmy, who runs the

757
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,600
subtropolis, he, he was just up real late and pretty tired.

758
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,720
I think he was seeing things.

759
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,440
So there was no sign of a oil spill?

760
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,240
No sign.

761
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,040
Nothing like that.

762
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,640
He was, is he a drinker or a smoker or a tweaker?

763
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,680
No, Jimmy's all right.

764
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,960
He, uh, I think he's burning the candle at both ends.

765
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,520
You know what I mean?

766
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,600
He's, he's going a little too hard at subtropolis.

767
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,040
Okay.

768
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,600
Hmm.

769
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,560
Interesting.

770
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,640
But he did, what he, what he said, he described in depth what he saw to me.

771
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,920
Well, what did he see?

772
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,840
He said it was like, no, he didn't.

773
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,800
He didn't remember this at all.

774
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,000
Andrew had a little more details about what the car had said.

775
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,120
I said it was like a thick black oil just all across the road and the fields.

776
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,520
Yeah.

777
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,360
This was at 4am in the morning.

778
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,760
Yeah.

779
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,720
I went out there and there's no sign of it at all.

780
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,840
Nobody would have cleaned it up.

781
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
That would have been something that we would have known about.

782
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,800
Yeah.

783
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,480
And I'm certainly, it's probably not something revolved, like involved with any kind of elder

784
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,200
God death cult.

785
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,840
I wouldn't suspect.

786
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,320
Probably not.

787
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,960
Probably not.

788
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,920
Miss Paige did say that she had seen, she thought she had seen something in her backyard

789
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,640
not previous to the dog disappearance.

790
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,240
She thought it was a homeless person.

791
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,760
She said there's been a rash of homeless people in the neighborhood.

792
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,840
And she, for a moment floated the idea that the homeless men had eaten her dog.

793
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,800
Wait, which neighborhood, which neighborhood did the council woman live in?

794
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,080
She was in the old neighborhood.

795
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,160
Let's compare addresses to where she lives and where this abandoned house is.

796
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
Either the rose or the bow tie.

797
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,720
Are we talking the same, same street?

798
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,000
Same neighborhood for sure.

799
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,400
I would say that, uh, you were, sorry, uh, Keith Vigna, the house that you checked out

800
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:38,240
is on the same street, but south of the council woman's house on the same street.

801
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,720
Okay.

802
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,440
Interesting.

803
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,720
Um, we should have compared those.

804
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,000
How many blocks away?

805
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,120
Hold on just a second.

806
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,880
TNT.

807
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,480
We know drama.

808
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,360
We know drama.

809
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,920
Uh, you asked how many, you asked how many, uh, how many blocks away?

810
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,680
How many blocks away?

811
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,120
I'd say like a block.

812
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,600
Cool.

813
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,400
So I think John Peters is the dog and he ran away.

814
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,600
That makes the most sense to me.

815
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,280
Is this some kind of joke?

816
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
Yeah, it's a, it's a, I'm sorry.

817
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,480
We're talking about missing people, missing dogs.

818
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,520
I shouldn't be joking around.

819
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,480
You're not a, you're not a bad cop, but you are a bad cop.

820
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,920
I gotta, I gotta grow up into these britches.

821
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,600
In your investigation of the house, could you tell how long it had been vacant?

822
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,040
So Mildred told me that she, the last time she saw John Peters was two days ago.

823
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,960
And I checked, she didn't know his name.

824
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,880
I had to check his mail to see what his name was.

825
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,440
Mostly just junk stuff, but I don't think that he was in the house when it got broken

826
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,520
into because there didn't seem to be signs of any struggle or anything like that.

827
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,000
But as far as I know, nobody's seen him in at least two days.

828
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,200
You also found out one other piece of information from Drew.

829
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,960
The piece of information that I found out from Drew was that John had been in the hospital

830
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,360
for a long stint a couple of years ago.

831
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,000
With what?

832
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,200
He, uh, had trouble transforming back into the dog.

833
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,920
Uh, no, it, uh, they, uh, uh, it didn't, it didn't say,

834
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,720
it just said that he was there for a while, but I did, I don't know why.

835
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,600
My shape shifting abilities all fucked up.

836
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,720
Take a look at my dog.

837
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,680
I still have a tail.

838
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,040
Oh goodness.

839
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,200
Yeah.

840
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,360
So I don't know why, but, um, I found that out.

841
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,160
I told you about the key chain, the trunk.

842
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,240
Oh, uh, Mildred said that, sorry, was it a couple of days ago she saw that she saw like

843
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,080
a flashing light coming from that area or like inside of his house.

844
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,080
But she said that she, you know, didn't get up in time to like see exactly where the source

845
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,600
was, but I couldn't find anything that would have caused that coming from inside the house.

846
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,800
Was his car still there?

847
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,000
His car was still there.

848
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,880
His keys to the house and the car were still there as well.

849
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,760
Um, the only thing out of place was the trunk.

850
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,360
The key chain has his house keys, a bottle opener, his car keys, a few small keys that

851
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,120
say G 10, G 11, G 12, and a key fob for rewards program at dirty dog grooming.

852
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,200
What a series of bizarre and presumably unrelated.

853
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,600
It seems that he has a proclivity for alcohol because there's a lot of beer bottles and

854
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,680
beer cans just kind of strewn about the place.

855
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,280
The little keys that have the G numbers of those, uh, storage units.

856
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
That is a good detective work.

857
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,680
I've never done this before.

858
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,080
I've never done this before, but I also, here's, I hold up a piece of scotch tape.

859
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,320
I'm like, I try to get some fingerprints off the truck.

860
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't know if this is how you do it, but do you want this?

861
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
That could go to police school.

862
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,160
I plead the fifth Clark.

863
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,440
When you look at the scotch tape, it's got a, it's got like, it's a paw print.

864
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,840
It's like, it's like literally like five fingerprints all smashed on top of each other.

865
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Half of them are mine.

866
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,320
Did I do this?

867
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,520
Uh, no, I graduated from the police academy.

868
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,240
I won't tell you which one up in the city.

869
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,120
Yeah, I went to the city.

870
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,880
I'm, I'm a good cop.

871
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,560
I'm a good cop.

872
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:29,040
Keith, you would know that you didn't actually put any crime scene tape up or really close it.

873
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,280
You didn't even close the door of the house.

874
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,480
Not even when I went in.

875
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,120
Well, cause I didn't want it to preserve it.

876
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,960
You know, also I was a little scared.

877
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,240
It's a creepy old house.

878
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,280
You guys want to go back?

879
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,320
No, I mean, we're pretty busy.

880
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,360
We should probably have Ray.

881
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,600
I didn't even look in his car either.

882
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,160
Damn.

883
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,040
That could have been good.

884
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,880
Do you call the dog groomer?

885
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,240
I did call the dog groomer.

886
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,400
He did one thing.

887
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,200
I called the dog groomer.

888
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,280
John Peters does not work there.

889
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,440
And the person that I was on the phone with was not familiar with his name.

890
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Probably because I rolled at 95.

891
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,720
Sometimes I just don't have any idea what the hell you're talking about.

892
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,480
It's a, you, you went to the police academy in town.

893
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,640
I went to police academy in the city.

894
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,760
There is no police academy in this town of 5,000 people.

895
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
I was in your class.

896
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,000
You know what?

897
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,480
I think maybe I should go check out what was in his car.

898
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,520
Cause people tend to keep things important to them.

899
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:31,600
Yeah.

900
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,440
Maybe we should all go check this house out.

901
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,920
It sounds like it might be a linchpin in this whole mystery.

902
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,560
We can double check your work.

903
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,600
You know what they say?

904
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,120
Three's better.

905
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,080
Three's company.

906
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,160
So you guys head out to go back to where John Peters lives?

907
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,120
On the, on the way there.

908
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,320
I want to call back into Drew because I, on the posters I put up,

909
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,240
I put the station's number on it.

910
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,720
Yeah.

911
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,520
Hey Drew, you get any calls about that dog?

912
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,640
No one has called yet.

913
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,360
All right.

914
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,320
Keep me posted.

915
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,600
I absolutely will.

916
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,320
That's all I wanted.

917
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,160
Perfect.

918
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
You take a nice little drive into the neighborhood,

919
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,600
go past Bean's pond on the way to the house.

920
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,320
As you pull up, Keith, I think you would probably notice right away that

921
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,040
John Peters' car is not in the driveway and the door is closed.

922
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,520
How did he move his car if I had the keys?

923
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,120
Are you asking the world?

924
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,320
I'm wondering out loud.

925
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,120
How did he move the car if I had the keys?

926
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,440
Are you asking how car thieves stole a car?

927
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
We don't know that it's a thief.

928
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,480
Is the mail still there?

929
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,360
Still there?

930
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,360
No, we're looking for the mail, John Peters.

931
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,000
Yikes.

932
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,800
The whole point is there.

933
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,520
Uh, the mail, the mail is gone.

934
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,960
The mailbox is empty.

935
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,080
Is the door still open?

936
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,280
No, it's closed.

937
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,160
I go ahead and take the lead and go and knock on the door.

938
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,840
Come and knock on our door.

939
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,720
So you pull up around the house, you got two cop cars in front,

940
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,640
maybe one in the driveway and you go up and knock on the door and you get no response.

941
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,120
I try it.

942
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,920
Oh, I mean the door has been kicked in previously.

943
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,840
It was basically set back into the frame.

944
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,560
I go and open it.

945
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,400
You open the door into this house.

946
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,760
You see there are, there's some glass on the ground.

947
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,960
There's a bunch of like bottles and cans out and about.

948
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,480
I holler in.

949
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
Hey, anybody in here?

950
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,360
You hear nothing.

951
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,800
Is the trunk still in there?

952
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,440
The what?

953
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,320
The trunk.

954
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

955
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,560
In the house?

956
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,760
There's no trunk in this house.

957
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,560
Fuck.

958
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,600
Uh, hey, where's that trunk you were talking about?

959
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,480
It was right there.

960
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,320
The one that said, do not open if you want to live.

961
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,600
Yeah, it was right there.

962
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,480
It's not there now.

963
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,840
Are you supposed, who are you supposed to be?

964
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,320
Yeah, the DM is fucking with us now.

965
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,600
I'm just telling you what you see.

966
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Yeah, well it was sitting right there.

967
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,160
Yeah, but you said it like he had no previous knowledge.

968
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,280
Like gaslighting me.

969
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,640
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

970
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,480
Look, uh, we actually, this is the first time any of us have been to the Peters' house.

971
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,520
Uh, am I John Peters?

972
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,760
We're in the wrong house.

973
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,040
You like quietly tuck a tail into your big britches.

974
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,040
Keith wrote down the address wrong.

975
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,880
Keith brought us to the wrong house.

976
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,000
Oh, we swatted this dude.

977
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,640
You can see, uh, as you're looking around now, there's some glass on the floor from

978
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,880
where the picture frames were, but they're now like all sitting on like a desk.

979
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,240
So it probably was John probably had a spare key, but fuck.

980
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,040
Why would he have moved the trunk and not like called?

981
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,240
Well, we're probably dealing with some shit that he didn't want to talk to the police.

982
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,560
Can I see an outline on the floor of where the trunk was?

983
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,600
Yeah, there seems to be.

984
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,560
All right, I believe you Keith.

985
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,040
Carpet.

986
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,280
There's like a little indentation where Keith claims the trunk was.

987
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,240
Believe me guys.

988
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
And you searched the, you searched the house before?

989
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,040
Yeah, I searched the house.

990
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
All I found, like I said, was those keys.

991
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
And you're a strange particular parlance.

992
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,320
Did you roll to search this house?

993
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,760
I crit succeeded.

994
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,440
I don't know what that means, but it sounds good.

995
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,560
I do a real good job searching this house.

996
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,200
Are you making fun of his accent?

997
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,000
The hell Vigna?

998
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,480
Sorry dude, it's kind of rubs off.

999
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,680
You also found something.

1000
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,800
You found the betting stubs.

1001
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,400
Oh shit, yeah.

1002
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,160
Guys, I'm a good police officer.

1003
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,880
I'm trying my, I want to do good.

1004
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,640
Yeah, so I found these stubs that look like some sort of betting receipts.

1005
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,680
What was he betting on?

1006
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,160
That's, you should take a look at him.

1007
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,840
What kind of money was he throwing down?

1008
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,920
He was throwing down some heavy money.

1009
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,600
There are dates on these as well.

1010
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,800
Like hundreds or thousands.

1011
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,160
Hundreds per night, but on multiple nights.

1012
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,560
I wonder if this, if he was betting on horses or dogs.

1013
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,760
He's betting on himself.

1014
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,040
So basically these stubs are from the past, not this month, like not anytime in November.

1015
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,720
These stubs are from the future.

1016
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,760
What the hell is going on here, Jim?

1017
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,280
They're, none of them are from November.

1018
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
They're all from October and previous.

1019
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,920
And there was a lot of money being bet and he never won.

1020
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,160
And there is no indication what he was betting on.

1021
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,360
Nope, none whatsoever.

1022
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,680
Is there any commonality between the bets?

1023
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,520
Is he always betting on the same thing?

1024
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,440
He's always betting on it and oh yeah.

1025
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,080
And you would also see there is a payout scale on there and he's always betting on these

1026
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,640
crazy bets, like 30 to one, 50 to one bets.

1027
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,160
None of these are like two to three.

1028
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,440
None of these are good bets.

1029
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,720
He's making bad bets.

1030
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
And this seems, are we assuming, like, are there names?

1031
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,400
Is this racing of some kind?

1032
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,440
There's numbers.

1033
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,960
It seems to be that the numbers are dictating what the bet is on.

1034
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,360
And I was kind of asking, are those the same ever?

1035
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,680
No.

1036
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay.

1037
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,680
Oh, maybe sometimes.

1038
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:43,920
Yeah.

1039
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,520
Maybe sometimes.

1040
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,040
Maybe sometimes.

1041
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,400
And there's a knock at the door.

1042
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,440
Hey, yeah.

1043
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,800
It's clearly open.

1044
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,600
Come on in.

1045
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,480
You see a woman.

1046
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,080
Does she have a face in the front door?

1047
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,720
She is.

1048
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,280
She has shock white hair and big rainbow earrings.

1049
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,080
She's wearing a Snuggie and she has a big mug of tea.

1050
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,960
Are you all back?

1051
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,000
How's your knitting going?

1052
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,960
What's going on?

1053
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,640
Why, why are you so concerned?

1054
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,960
Well, I just thought that there were some, you know, they came by, so I just didn't know.

1055
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,320
Who came by?

1056
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,120
Well, miss Mildred, the men who came by.

1057
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,400
Have you ever seen these men before?

1058
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,400
No, but I figured they were working with you all setting up the John one with them.

1059
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,600
They look official at all.

1060
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,280
I mean, they were just a couple men.

1061
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,640
I didn't really think too much about it, but were they in suits?

1062
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,520
One of them was wearing a suit and the other one had a big old jacket.

1063
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,960
I mean, they both had big jackets on, you know, did the jacket say anything to see if

1064
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,840
they were homeless or not.

1065
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,640
Oh, eating dogs, eating dogs.

1066
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,360
Oh, they didn't, they didn't seem to be eating any dogs.

1067
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,960
Is that your is real quick.

1068
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,080
Is that your Lippmann test?

1069
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,840
Like, is he in a suit or not?

1070
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,120
He's homeless.

1071
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,040
Yeah, no, it was to fish for what they were wearing.

1072
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,540
Yeah.

1073
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,800
Did the jacket say anything on him or are they just.

1074
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,760
No, they just pulled up and then they got in his car and one of them got in that car

1075
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,600
and the other one took the other car and they both left after they came out into the house

1076
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,240
and such.

1077
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,120
And I just didn't know why you guys were back.

1078
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,600
If it was there, I just want to make sure my neighbors.

1079
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,480
Move the trunk.

1080
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,320
Were they carrying anything?

1081
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,960
The trunk?

1082
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,320
Yeah, they carried a trunk.

1083
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,160
They put it in John's car.

1084
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,720
Yeah.

1085
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,000
And they drove off with John's car.

1086
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,060
Yeah.

1087
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,520
They both drove away.

1088
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,480
See which way they went.

1089
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,440
They both, they both drove away in the same car or did they.

1090
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,320
They were in separate.

1091
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,280
One of them drove their car and the other one drove his car.

1092
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,320
Do you know what kind of car that they showed up in?

1093
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,160
It was just like a car.

1094
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
It was like a white Toyota.

1095
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,320
White Toyota, the four door.

1096
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,960
I don't remember how many doors I had on it, son, but I appreciate you asking.

1097
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,080
I'm glad you would value one old lady's opinion.

1098
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,480
Are you mocking her now?

1099
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,440
You know, this is a freeform medium.

1100
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,680
Well, shit boys.

1101
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,120
Keith, you, you got, you wrote down his license plate, right?

1102
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,000
Yes, for sure not.

1103
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,440
I do remember that it was a.

1104
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,960
Why don't you roll to see if you did that?

1105
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,160
What color was the car?

1106
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,000
It was a red car.

1107
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,920
Go ahead and roll intelligence for me there, Keith.

1108
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Oh, that's a 54 on a 50.

1109
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,840
You have, it was a car.

1110
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,560
It was maroon.

1111
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,040
It was a maroon car.

1112
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,800
Put an APB up for that.

1113
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,080
This woman Mildred Mitchell is kind of like staring and looking around at you guys.

1114
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,920
Watching the three Stooges routine.

1115
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,800
Exactly.

1116
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,520
And she's like, well, okay.

1117
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,880
If, if you guys need any water or tea or anything, I'm right across the street.

1118
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,720
Hey Mildred, do you remember what kind of car Mr. Peterson drove?

1119
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,200
Who?

1120
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,120
Your neighbor, John Peters.

1121
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,360
Oh, he had that maroon car.

1122
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,040
Do you know what it was?

1123
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,480
You seem to be.

1124
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,360
I used to drive a maroon 97 Oldsmobile Cheeto.

1125
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,640
Was it one like that?

1126
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,440
I don't know.

1127
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,360
Is it a Cutlass Supreme?

1128
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,640
A La Sabre perhaps?

1129
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,840
What kind of car do you drive?

1130
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,480
This is a conversation that I don't care anything about.

1131
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,480
Well, you know what?

1132
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,160
I mean, but I think the world cares.

1133
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,680
This is what people want to hear.

1134
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,200
Oh, I drive a white car.

1135
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,400
That's real nice.

1136
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,440
All right, go.

1137
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,720
It's cold out here.

1138
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,080
Go home, Mildred.

1139
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,880
It's actually unseasonably warm if you recall.

1140
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,400
It's a pretty nice day today.

1141
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,080
It's cold out, Mildred.

1142
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,720
Go home.

1143
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1144
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,720
Drowning out on the nose.

1145
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,720
With no mind at all.

1146
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,720
No mind at all.

1147
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,720
No mind at all.

1148
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,720
Fly to fly to the stream.
