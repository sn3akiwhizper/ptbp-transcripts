Dimension where biscuits are the only currency in jam shit, baby. You don't even want to hear about jam

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,600

Maury

13
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,080
It's crazy that you promised to kill your friends on a public radio show like this one now

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,220
I promise not to kill my producer and that's a threat or a promise

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,600
Which one is the one where I'll probably kill them for sure

16

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,720
Go ahead click right now and peruse while I read the news

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,680
Last time not much happened the three leads of this absurd production fell

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,820
Upwards into an impossibly dark and equally vibrant nothingness all while witnessing

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,920
unnatural visions of scenes that were are or will be played out

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,160
Involving themselves in either this or a different timeline

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
They landed in a world made of this same wild texture

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,760
But the ground was made of pure light as that setting faded

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,080
They found themselves in a junk filled room with Leo piston before the uber driver spud

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,280
exited without watching his footing and fell out of this elevated room to his abrupt demise of swift

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,640
smothering of the shimmering silver sea a boat approached that held two figures one a

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Ferryman in overalls a beanie in a big white beard and the other was John's uncle Don D. Pettymore

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,120
I've been wolf. That was the news. I could use something heavy and dripping in sin

37
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,640
It's dragon in three with what kind of world are you living in?

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Bad girls on top of the water

39
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Leaving my mind at your altar

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

42
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,280
What kind of world are you living in?

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,880
So we had the same dare officer all through like middle school and then into junior high and then into high school

45
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,720
He was like our police officer that worked at our school and then in high school freshman year

46
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,040
He came to our health class to teach sex ed

47
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,400
It was a in the time where you had those cell phones that were like flip phones and you could set them to a

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,320
setting that was vibrate then ring and

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,760
So his phone starts vibrating in class as he's teaching and he looks down and he goes

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,400
Oh, it's just my wife and he clicks the button or he tries to and so he thinks he's turned it off

51
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,740
But then the ringtone starts and it was like wow. You're a crazy bitch watch your fuck so good

52
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
And buck cherry played and

53
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,680
Nice, not sure I ever recovered buck cherry played here in Springfield and the guitarist

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,800
shopped at our local music place Hoover and

55
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,600
bought the exact guitar that my guitarist was saving up for

56
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
He was in the store at the same time and watched him walk out with it

57
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Really sucked

58
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,040
When you say you've never recovered from that like you mean that was the moment that set what you wanted to be in life or

59
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,660
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I was just like man. There's not there's not much that's better than that, huh?

60
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,480
Yeah, I

61
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't know how we how we get back. Oh, I guess we just start the I guess we just start yeah

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,760
For once we could just have an episode start with us playing

63
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Oh

64
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,840
No, we kind of do the Dragon Ball Z thing where like you think it's gonna fill up the whole time slot

65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,480
but then it's like short and half of it is recap and then fucking around I

66
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,680
Thought you meant that we were just dragging our balls same thing

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,180
Well instead of dragging our balls, let's get some oopsies out of the way

68
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,640
I've got some whoopsies to whoopsies to be exact to start out with

69
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,240
First whoopsie what you guys woke up in the mausoleum and

70
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
You've been through some shit

71
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,400
Especially this time. You've definitely been around lots of unnatural learn lots about the unnatural and

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,920
Every time that's happened so far

73
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:21,240
We've changed the entire nature of the role-playing game that we're playing by having you guys roll to d20 for a natural

74
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,240
And adding that to your skill point so I need

75
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,040
Joe Thomas Luke to roll to d20 for a natural and

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,920
Justin hi, I assume that on your character sheet your unnatural score is at a zero no

77
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,080
It's it's quite high actually. Oh good. That is what did we talk about that? Mm-hmm

78
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,360
Okay, good a rest of you might get some real high numbers here. So let's hear those 2d 20 rolls

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,480
29 total for me 29 total. Okay. So what does that put your total at? That's a good question

80
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,360
That's why I asked it. I love asking good questions. Okay, I have 79 now Jesus

81
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
fucking Christ

82
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,640
Yeah, I'd smoke that guy's cum cool

83
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
And Joe

84
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
I

85
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,800
Rolled back-to-back sevens, so that's that's a 14 added to my head 49. I think so. I'm at 63

86
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,600
No, that's really really high for an unnatural score and Thomas speaking of 14

87
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,720
I rolled a 14 and a 9 which is 23 added to my previous score that gives me 67

88
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Nice, we're all good at unnatural

89
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,320
Zach's like, why did I give them 2d 20?

90
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,900
Nah, you know this is we're in the um, I know that you guys aren't fans of quality film

91
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,380
But I believe they call this the end game. I

92
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,000
Hate myself and so you guys are going to have a lot of

93
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:07,880
Natural skill points Luke is a member of the moxie our local independent theater, which means that according to his contract

94
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,140
He's not allowed to watch Marvel movies

95
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Hill's films have

96
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
climaxes and dinner moves

97
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,860
Badass shit like end games Luke likes to go to the cinema. We like to go to the right. Yeah

98
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,860
Cinema yeah, okay. I enjoy kenel. I only watch movies where the women have armpit hair

99
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
It's kind of my dating policy

100
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,160
Oh, you guys have a lot of unnatural

101
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,760
Yeah, we do at this point and you can use those whenever you want to do things that are unnatural

102
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,240
Wasn't there a big downside to it if we if we oh, yeah. Yep, if you fail, it'll it'll be real bad

103
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,680
No

104
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,060
When you when you are dealing in the unnatural

105
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,520
Things don't always

106
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,120
Go the way you planned and when they go awry the true horror being involved with this

107
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,520
This nature of items or beliefs or thoughts or words

108
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Can really come back and bite you in the little butt come in the butt

109
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,260
cool

110
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:31,260
So if you were wanting to do something that you didn't think was humanly possible we could roll that skill to see if it happens

111
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,380
I want to eat a million sandwiches

112
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,080
Natural doesn't seem humanly possible. I want to see sandwiches. Yeah

113
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Okay, so with all that

114
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,380
Unnatural business out of the way. I need Justin Luke and Thomas to remove their headphones

115
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,340
Hi, I thought this might be the other oopsie

116
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,720
You almost got away with it almost snuck one right past yo dungeon master

117
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,920
It's time for you to roll for a mania

118
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,820
Cuz I hit my breaking point you remember what it was it made me hit it was

119
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:24,780
when you saw a giant wave of black ooze that was about to pour down over the

120
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,860
Vw bug or not bug the van that you were in

121
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,900
23 92 89 Oh

122
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,260
23 Michael Jordan

123
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,680
Cardo koi card cart card a coif these hmm an uncontrollable

124
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,180
Compulsion to see maps everywhere to see what the fuck does that mean a compulsion to see maps?

125
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,800
So like you think everything is a map

126
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,240
That means we have to go this way maybe I could be kind of fun that could be fun

127
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,240
I just read it. I just read a Dan Brown book, so I'm kind of hip to seeing maps and shit

128
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,960
Angels and demons

129
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,040
Actually, it was the lost symbol is the one I read. Oh, I don't know

130
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,560
Those are the only two things that I know about Dan Brown is that he wrote those two books and he's played by Tom Hanks

131
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,280
in real life

132
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,800
Rolled up 23. What else did you roll a 92 92 the year I was born

133
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
technomania an obsession with new technology

134
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,280
Okay, and finally 89 89 in the year someone else was born me yeah, that's what I thought oh

135
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Scribble o mania

136
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,120
obsession with scribbling or doodling so maps everywhere

137
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,420
Obsession with new technology or obsession with scribbling

138
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,720
Doodling do I have anything on my person that I could scribble with at this point. Oh, you know

139
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,620
Yeah, I think I've whipped out a notepad a few times. Oh, yeah

140
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,280
Notepad pain I'm between maps and notepad. What do you what do you think?

141
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,640
Do you do you have a narrative one that would help you? I think both would be excellent

142
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
I will say two things one

143
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,840
We have had a virus of sorts in this show before where?

144
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,400
scribbling was

145
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:24,120
Happened by the people who had it and I think that would be narratively interesting because if you start scribbling stuff constantly

146
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,000
I think the other PCs will think there's something wrong with you, which could be interesting and

147
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:37,120
Then I think the map could be narratively interesting as well because you are currently looking for a way out of this place

148
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,720
So that would lead you very easily to play out that one. Fuck. They're both good

149
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,040
Well, I can see how I could play both of them. I'm gonna go

150
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
I'm gonna go I

151
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,880
Think I'm gonna go fuck shit. I'm gonna go see maps. I'm gonna go see maps. Okay. Yeah that see maps

152
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,840
on this on the shimmering silver see

153
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
All right, let's get the boys back in here with Matt man

154
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
My man

155
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,160
Birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie eagle albatross par birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie

156
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,280
bogey double bogey triple bogey, they really ran out of

157
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,880
Ideas for bad golfing pretty quickly. They came up with such cool names for good golfing

158
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,480
And then I've just remembered who I'm talking to but Zach. This is a great point. We know the golfing things

159
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:39,160
We know those days. Yeah eagle. We just don't know what happens when you go to a golf course and like talk to the lady

160
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,080
Yeah, for those of you who are not a citizen of contention over on patreon.com slash. Oh, yeah

161
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
This didn't happen on the mainstream

162
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,840
No

163
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,280
It's not we recently had it at a game where these boys had to

164
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,040
Had to meet for a delta green mission on a golf course and they didn't know what the fuck to do

165
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,760
I I feel like I feel like in real life people would have been a lot more helpful than Zach was

166
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Yeah for some first-timers

167
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,040
That's super fair. Alright, so let's start by

168
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,440
Everyone, I want you to google real quick

169
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,200
I know this is an audio podcast and you rely on me to tell you

170
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,600
What you are seeing visually to think about in your head

171
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,520
But I used a certain picture for inspiration

172
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,240
Google red

173
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,760
sands

174
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,920
S-a-n-d-s red sands fort is a picture. I came across a while ago and it went in my

175
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,480
Photos on my phone and an album that I've labeled inspiration

176
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,400
Oh, okay

177
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,580
The hell is which also has of a weird fish that has human teeth

178
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,940
And it's all just shit I found on the internet and a picture of Dolly Parton

179
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,300
Inspiration it's sort of like the saying the thing that could became Sealand

180
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:07,420
It's very similar to the sea fort that became Sealand if you know what that is if you've ever watched a water world

181
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:14,060
It's very very much probably the aesthetic that they based their movie off of it's the exact rusty

182
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,540
aloft above an ocean

183
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Yeah dilapidated basically

184
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,720
What I'm picturing as you guys are poking your heads out of this

185
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:33,660
Door of this hatch that kind of opens out down you see a ladder looking down on this boat about 10 yards below

186
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,460
This bay boat made out of this the same familiar inky black yet

187
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,760
Unnaturally colorful material that also makes up the sky you see the two men standing on this craft

188
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,160
One is a short stout man in his latter years a thick white beard

189
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,440
Makes his round face look even rounder and the bags under his eyes are large and fluffy

190
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,440
He's wearing a dark navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy

191
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,900
Overalls and the other man is John Lee Pettymore the fourth's uncle

192
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,220
Don D. Pettymore as you all poke your heads out of this hatch

193
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,460
We can see from the outside that you are in this kind of this

194
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:26,380
Lofted room that is made out of the similar inky black yet colorful substance that is on stilts

195
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,140
It is like a stilted room that the still legs then go down

196
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,580
into this shimmering silver sea

197
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,660
below you

198
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Everyone roll sanity

199
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:51,500
Cuz you haven't rolled sanity since you arrived wherever you are now and I do think that that was a third whoopsie

200
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
so we're

201
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,420
Lost I don't know if that's a whoopsie cuz this just happened

202
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,580
Your brain finally caught up to the situation and you're all like fuck

203
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,940
What were we like?

204
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,420
Zach I didn't I didn't roll a score that passed

205
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,660
But it is the inverse of a passing score. It's 32 instead of 23. So does that get me anything?

206
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,900
That would be an interesting luck mechanic like spend five luck to reverse the numbers on your dice

207
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,360
But we don't use that currently so that is a fail. It's actually a very cool mechanic

208
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,100
I I doesn't that fun d4 plus one. I bet we would remember. Yeah, we would remember it and use it

209
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
And

210
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,940
Luke I heard you say that you failed, right?

211
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,660
I did so roll a d4 and add one and lose that much sanity three. I'm at 11

212
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,060
I a dangle crit failed. I'm still under my power

213
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,140
I'm not freaking out, but I critically know you are cuz you lose five sanity ouch

214
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
that puts me at 11 and

215
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:09,660
Clark Bishop with losing five sanity all in one go at the sight of all this. I'm gonna need a fight

216
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,140
Or freeze from yeah

217
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Go ahead and rank those please

218
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,380
Honestly at this point freeze would be number one

219
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,780
Standing. Yeah. Sure. So four five six, you'll freeze and then probably

220
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:30,020
Flight, okay, so run away is number two and then yeah fight is my third and then fight is if you roll a one

221
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,340
I don't know what the fight is gonna be if I fight probably fuck somebody up dude. Yeah

222
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
Kill Leo piston again

223
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,020
Julie did it once you can do it twice

224
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Go ahead and roll a d6 for me

225
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,720
It's a two, okay, that's gonna be run away run away

226
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,780
Clark Bishop has not yet made it down this ladder as you're all looking out this door and

227
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,340
He is looking for a place to run. He looks down at the ladder

228
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,760
He sees the boat down below with two men one of whom he vaguely

229
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,640
Remembers from his time growing up in contention as being a petty more and

230
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,600
The other he does not recognize at all. This is not running away going towards this boat. So he turns back

231
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,340
He opens up the other hatch in the room across the room from the hatch that is currently open

232
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,940
He slams the lever into the up position

233
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:34,400
He flings it open and he runs through it closing the door behind him. None of you were able wait, let me get a quick

234
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,340
Alertness or search from sorry Justin

235
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,100
Okay, good, thank you

236
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,920
I needed that Luke and Thomas give me a search or alertness and Thomas because you're looking at your uncle right now

237
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,260
I'm gonna put you at a negative 20. No pass. Oh, no, actually

238
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,480
I'm not gonna put you at a negative 20 because you really wanted to go through that door

239
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,460
Yeah, I think I'm pretty stoked on what just happened because I really wanted to see was like Uncle Don

240
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,460
It's cool to see you and all but weird things are happening all the time around here right now and

241
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:16,740
Frankly, you know, I learned I could distrust as many elder members of my family as I could trust

242
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,740
so who knows if you're just gonna try to rope me into some

243
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,380
shitty con or

244
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:30,260
You're gonna make me wait in the car for hours while you just get drunk in some bar a lot of bars. Yeah

245
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,540
And it's hot in this fucking car and so I want to see

246
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,120
What's through that other door? I really do no offense to Uncle Don

247
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,960
I've got a personal theory that we're just gonna see Uncle Don and this other guy in that boat again. I

248
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,820
Hope I didn't just give zacking out

249
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,820
Wait, hold up

250
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,980
But if that's true

251
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,760
Then in John Lee Pettymore's mind did Clark Bishop just fall to the same fate as spud

252
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
I haven't thought it all the way through

253
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,040
Or even a second step to be honest the way that you describe it

254
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,200
I pictured me wily coyoting my way out that door

255
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,160
So Clark Bishop is gone Joe take off your headphones

256
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,920
Keith Joe who the fuck is Joe John Keith John Justin looking down you see the two men

257
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,200
I would also see Keith right because he slid down the ladder at the end of the last episode

258
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,760
Oh, he did go down the ladder. Yes up above. I'm just like Keith

259
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Don Don Keith

260
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,680
Don you'll do the plat thing and introduce Keith to that stranger

261
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,820
I'm gonna go poke my head through this other door real quick just to be sure

262
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,280
What's on the other side be careful? I will

263
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,800
What if it's scary kind of think we're in purgatory or whatever. So, you know, do we need to be careful?

264
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,100
I don't we'll probably just be in like, you know some kind of endless torture for the rest of you know

265
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,300
Eternity, so I might as well see what's through this other door

266
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
So I'm not wondering the whole time, you know

267
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,860
For the next thousand lifetimes or whatever the fuck until we get back to here

268
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,860
So I'm gonna poke my head through that door and I will be right back. Okay, be careful

269
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:25,660
As you're walking back through Leo piston is still just in his in his own eternal junkyard

270
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,180
Just squealing away in pain and you walk over to the other hatch

271
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,460
Yes, open it up and walk on through take off your headphones. I don't walk on. I just want to peek through

272
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,200
Okay, much like we did through this door or some of us did sure

273
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,820
Go ahead and take off your headphones

274
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,760
Who are you guys? Oh, right that man said that uh

275
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,100
Your name was Keith, huh? What the hell? What why do you sound like that?

276
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:01,220
Oh, my name is Jack Russell. Nice to meet you. He puts out his hand. I shake it

277
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,460
Have you seen the door what door and he turns back and he looks at dawn

278
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,420
He's of no use to us if he hadn't seen the door

279
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:15,420
It just kind of walks back and starts messing with some some I've seen the door inky black on the back

280
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:21,080
I saw the door Jack Russell turns around with his big Santa Claus eyebrows

281
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,600
Raised real high and he looks real big-eyed over at dawn boy says he's seen the door

282
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,760
Uh-huh. Can I tell if he's lying? Oh

283
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,220
Are you lying? Mmm. Yes, I am. He says he's lying. No

284
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Yeah, go roll human, ooh

285
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,480
Is this my first time rolling a character in?

286
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,640
In the game, I don't think I ever had a character she did I

287
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,660
Did you not for Donovan was something or other? Oh, wait. No, I don't think I think we just kind of winged it. Oh

288
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,760
My god, we were so loosey-goosey. Yeah, this is Justin's first character sheet in the game

289
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,180
Crazy to me. Okay, so I'm rolling human. He's rolling persuade. Is that what you said? It's correct

290
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,180
Luke go ahead and roll persuade for Keith Vigna. I a crit succeeded I crit fail

291
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,320
88

292
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:28,920
What do you think? I'm gonna grab this man by the arm. Why are you lying boy? The door was a purple

293
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,240
I kind of tighten my grip. Don't lie to this man orange the orange. I

294
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Saw it why are you here?

295
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:55,200
Yeah, the talk about the door what brought you here. I've came then through a door that one

296
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,240
Game a point up at the up there that one. How'd you is that how you got in here? What is this place?

297
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:09,600
Immediately Jack Russell pulls the boat up to the ladder and starts tying off both the rope and the ladder itself are made out of

298
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,480
this extremely colorful

299
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,440
Very black dark substance is tying off a euphemism

300
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,360
Jack are we gonna are we gonna go up here and search a little bit?

301
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,320
Well, if you're looking for you're looking for I'm looking for what I'm looking for

302
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,200
Let's explore sounds good

303
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,760
I let go of him and start climbing up the ladder as you guys are all at the bottom of this ladder

304
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,000
You can see that adjacent

305
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:43,960
So basically the the room above you that is about 10 yards up its square it has four walls, uh,

306
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:51,000
You are on one side of this square. So you would take the ladder up now on the adjacent wall

307
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,680
There seems to be a bridge and you're just now seeing it for the first time as you look up

308
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,760
There is sort of a rope bridge that is also

309
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,080
Unsurprisingly

310
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,200
made out of this flag we're colorful darkness and

311
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,040
It leads across to a second

312
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,960
Stilted room. So there's another

313
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,280
Identical stilted room that is attached with a rope bridge. That's cool

314
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,300
Yeah, nice Luke roll sanity

315
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Oh

316
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
12 and I have 11

317
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:40,700
Okay, you just lose one. So now you have 10 as you realize the other hatch in the room above you is

318
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,940
across

319
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:50,580
from the hatch the two hatches are on opposite sides of the room and yet the rope bridge is

320
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,940
Coming from the adjacent wall not the wall that is parallel

321
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,500
It is the wall that is perpendicular that has the rope bridge attached to it. What are you looking at? So we had son

322
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,140
You got something wrong with you boy, I don't

323
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,000
Whoo, it's hard to look at that. I don't really know I can't even comprehend

324
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,080
I'll trust you on my boat by yourself and we're going up there. So you go up first. I'll go after you

325
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,960
I don't know who you want to go in the middle or you want to go first in the middle. Okay?

326
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,520
Jack Russell begins climbing. I start climbing after him

327
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Nice view

328
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,140
All right, don I assume you're going up I'm so take the boat and dip

329
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,700
No, I'm continuing along

330
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,820
Birded me back in

331
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,020
Yeah, butter did me

332
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,540
Is it just me coming back or is Thomas need to be bad Thomas Thomas?

333
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,740
and

334
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,540
Justin and Luke bye. Bye. What kind of come are you?

335
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,220
Smoking

336
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,820
Get it. No. Yeah, I do not be there for you

337
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,620
When you come starts to fall

338
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,620
All right, you guys ready?

339
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,900
Yeah, yeah

340
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:30,660
A crazed Clark Bishop sprints through the door Wile E. Coyote style and you are suddenly in

341
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:38,780
Another one of these similar rooms except this one does not have nearly as much junk in it as the last and as you bust

342
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,980
In really the only things you see in here are a

343
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,140
hatch in front of you and

344
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,940
Two figures Oh, dr. Marie Jacobs is an older plump woman with mascara

345
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,840
smeared all over her entire face

346
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:02,460
Her hair is a disaster and she is wearing white coveralls and long

347
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,500
Neoprene gloves she is in the exact same

348
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,620
State that you saw her when she was locked up in the contention police department

349
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:19,640
except for the last time you saw her in the contention police department was on tape when you saw her body being lifted and then

350
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
slammed repeatedly into the ground

351
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,620
so you do notice the matted blood caked all over the back of her head and

352
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,580
She is laying on the ground next to the body of Doug Jacobs

353
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,260
With dried blood all filling his broken nose

354
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,120
He's still wearing that same pair of novelty boxer briefs

355
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,100
Featuring Pepe Le Pew and he has a black collar around his neck. He too has bruises all over him and

356
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,420
blood

357
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,140
coming out the back of

358
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,220
His head they are cuddling while laying on the ground

359
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,620
Looking straight up into the sky above you there is no

360
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,540
Ceiling in this room the only thing above you. Oh, wait. No, is that the ceiling?

361
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:14,380
You wouldn't even fucking know because it's the same inky black darkness

362
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,700
that is so colorful shining down on you and

363
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,200
Giving you peace while you sleep man

364
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,940
Maybe you know that the Lord loves you very very much and you bust in here and they really don't even fucking notice

365
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,000
Are they literally the only two things in here? Yes

366
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,540
How crazed is Clark does he just keep running past them doubt the next door?

367
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,860
Yes, I a hundred percent and as you run through the next door as

368
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,980
You run through the next door you slam it open and as you run through it

369
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:54,700
You actually bump into the back of John Lee Kevin Moore the third from behind somehow and the two of you fall

370
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,060
Kind of into the same room that has nothing in it except for

371
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,780
dr. Marie Jacobs and

372
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
Doug Jacobs

373
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,180
Clark I thought you were in front of me

374
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,460
Let's try that next hatch

375
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:19,340
What do I see when I look behind me first you see a junkyard of a room with and you can hear the cries of?

376
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,100
Yeah, go go go to that door that door that door and I'm kind of pushing you along to go out the next door and as

377
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,980
You go through it. You run through the same room again. Both of you are all sanity

378
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,980
Hey 17

379
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:41,660
Nice hey 10 I passed I do a 10 on an 11 lose 10 lose 10

380
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
I need one of you

381
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,980
Lose any as you realize nope this is exactly how this room works. Oh, okay, so it's just like a loop through that door

382
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,980
It's just a loop thing a loop

383
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,660
Loopy loop. Oh, it's like it's a lag. Yeah, damn it. So it's just the boat in this

384
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,260
Fucking dawn. I think I owe money or something. It's been a while

385
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,820
He's one of these one of those ones where it's like oh you're spending the day with Uncle Don and then it's like spending the

386
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,300
Day with Uncle Don was four hours in a hot car and then Uncle Don driving you home drunk. I

387
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,220
Mean yeah, he financed my racing career, but also, you know, fuck that dude

388
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,820
Isn't that the that the doctor isn't that the doctor and the the cat man body right there who?

389
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:41,000
Right there on the floor there. Yes. I see them those those people on the on the ground remind me. Dr

390
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,940
Marie Jacobs and that's Doug Jacobs her husband and he

391
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,540
He's actually Salem her cat remember the radio switch that the Doug Jacobs and the cat

392
00:32:53,180 --> 00:33:00,460
You and she's like caressing his hair Doug Jacobs his head as it lays upon her breast and

393
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:08,660
They're just staring up into the endless ness above them and you as she kind of looks over and catches your eye

394
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,860
Oh

395
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,380
fuck

396
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,900
Now see Clark, that was a very succinct a very succinct summation as a war

397
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,420
I was just asking for the benefit of folks who might not have ever heard any kind of recap about this sort of story

398
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,660
you

399
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,940
absolute total fucking pieces of garbage

400
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:36,040
Sorry doctor police officers my ass. You're gonna lock us up when we're in love

401
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,840
And that's why we're here oh wait, okay, so

402
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
If we wouldn't have been locked up we wouldn't be here

403
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,000
Hey fair enough, but you weren't locked up because you were in love

404
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,480
But if you are admitting right now to being in love with your cat

405
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,480
Even though he's in the body of that man. That is a crime. I am so sorry

406
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,480
You cannot what part of it is a crime loving your animal. You said we're in love that that replies that implies romance

407
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,580
You see I love my friends. I love my partner

408
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,040
Clark here, but we're not in love. I love you too, John

409
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Yeah, thanks, man

410
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Thank you, I

411
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,840
Think I think we actually we yeah, we we kind of went over this but when we first

412
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,160
There I we don't know that there's a crime here, but it doesn't feel like it's

413
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,440
Doesn't feel like it's not a crime. Yeah, I am getting a real sense of deja vu with this conversation

414
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,780
But ma'am once again like while I understand the appeal of having a cat

415
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,680
Will you just leave us in a person-sized body and just like rolling around on the floor with that?

416
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,200
When you start to say like I'm in we're in love that implies a level of

417
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,840
NFC being reached with that body that I don't think is appropriate

418
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,400
Either for the original owner of that body the cat's mind. That's now in it

419
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
Or

420
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,780
God frankly or God. Yeah, that's not what Asian on this relationship without knowing anything about us

421
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,800
Hmm. Well, then maybe just be more careful with your words, you know, no, it's like a cat mine in a human body

422
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,480
That's that. Yeah, I don't know the the context and we see you rolling around on the floor there. I'm not trying

423
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,640
Yeah, I guess I am trying to yuck your yum

424
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
This this is yucky

425
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:34,680
And she kisses Doug Jacobs on the head and goes and looks directly in your eyes and says yummy

426
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:45,460
You know, there was nothing inherently gross about you kissing your cat man on the head until you said yummy again

427
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,520
It's just the way you're approaching all of this. That is very

428
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,400
It just seems like it's coming from the wrong angle. It's not making me comfortable at all good

429
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,280
Go away what doctor help? How long have you been here?

430
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,880
She looks up into the stars above that don't exist. I've been here forever. I

431
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Was born here. I

432
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,640
Will die here and when I die, I will remain here

433
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,880
Well, I don't I don't think that's the case because we had you in a jail cell. We just talked about that

434
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,640
So you weren't yeah, you're literally talking about yeah your memories with us

435
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,840
Outside of here, so you won't remain here. Oh

436
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,280
Sorry you cut out on the discord call of little faith, oh you just didn't finish your sentence

437
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,100
In a normal time you Michael borrowed it

438
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,280
Really just sounded like you got cut right off. So

439
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,520
Is it clear that my?

440
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Intention

441
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Is to annoy you

442
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:04,320
Yeah, you know ma'am personally, you know, I don't she begins licking the hair of Doug Jacobs, oh

443
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:11,380
Yeah, again, that doesn't bug me cuz that just seems like if she's being a cat like I don't know

444
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,960
We're all cats down here. What bugs me is when she implies that she fucks the cat. I'm with you

445
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,200
I'm with you on that and she's like

446
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,600
Why do you think I'm applying that and then she implies it more and I don't care about rolling around with your big cat, man

447
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,000
That sounds enjoyable and adorable. I

448
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,880
Just don't don't fuck the cat man. Don't I

449
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,360
Just cross a line from time to time every now and then she does imply that there's a line being crossed

450
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,400
Yeah, it seems like a cat man's getting fucked

451
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,400
Scratch his ears, you know lick his hair. All right, whatever

452
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Rub his whiskers, but he does both don't please don't fucking have whiskers anymore

453
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,580
Please I was being I was being you know imaginative

454
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:05,060
I was being playful like the spirit being very imaginative when you keep talking about me fucking this cat when

455
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,660
It seems like that's all you want to think about to be fair

456
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,620
Yeah, exactly I knew it I'm not gonna engage with you because you know exactly what you're doing

457
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,540
So I'm not just gonna get in little word games with you where you're like

458
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,180
Oh, you're the one who wants to fuck cat cuz you're the one fucking this cat apparently

459
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,680
It's good to know that setting doesn't change the show at all

460
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
On

461
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
That note I think I'm gonna switch back over

462
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,720
She's getting to a point where we could

463
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,000
Yep, this is about the right time to switch

464
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,680
But could we real quick just ask her some questions?

465
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,760
Like I literally just want to be like if she can engage with me on a real level

466
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,760
I want to just be like, what are your impressions having been here? Okay fucking do it

467
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,760
Maybe you fuck that cat. Maybe you don't let us put that aside for a moment

468
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,000
Petty more. I didn't know you were from here. Now. What do you mean by that?

469
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,120
Bishop look at his face. I look at his face Clark

470
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:24,120
You can clearly see just the the booze that's pouring out of his eyes and his ears and his nose and his mouth

471
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:31,880
Is the same inky dark substance that is extremely colorful at the same time. It's like dripping down from my eyes

472
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,140
Oh, yeah, do I look really fucking goth and badass? You look so

473
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,960
Cool, you're also in like Kevin's body

474
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:47,040
Which is like scarred up and you're in all black tactical gear like and I think canonically he was described

475
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
As Sam Elliott in Roadhouse

476
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Oh my god he was

477
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,480
So Sam Elliott in Roadhouse but in like

478
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,640
an

479
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
amazing and possibly like

480
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,440
multi-fluorescent goth makeup just like

481
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,260
Streaming down his face Clark recoils John John your face

482
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,600
It's like you didn't even notice it Clark before but you knew like it was there

483
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,100
But you didn't know and it wasn't there at all because when you look into someone's face you see

484
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:24,700
What you know their face to be right you don't really see what they look like, you know, you see who they are

485
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,460
John you're you're you've got to you got something under your eye

486
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:36,740
It's it. I don't know. It's maybe it's maybe it's all maybe it's always been there. I don't I just never noticed that

487
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
You know this stuff around us

488
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,340
It's on you pass me your pocket mirror

489
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:49,900
Here's my compact I open Clark's compact and I take a look do I see yeah you see

490
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,620
Does it does it hurt?

491
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:59,620
He says it John's not quite responding, but you do see that he's crying again and it's kind of like

492
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,100
Those juggernauts here is he's not upset

493
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,740
That doesn't doesn't hurt

494
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Look at me look at my glorious

495
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
Look at my glorious war paint

496
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,380
It

497
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,640
It's it it kind of suits you it's like I it's like I'm seeing you for real

498
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:31,860
It doesn't startle me the way I thought that it should I'm at this place. It's uh

499
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,660
You're here like a you're like a part of it, I don't understand John but it's

500
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,860
Yeah, yeah, that's right. It's it's you

501
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,620
He turns to dr. Marie Jacobs and it's like

502
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
Yeah, I'm from here

503
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
