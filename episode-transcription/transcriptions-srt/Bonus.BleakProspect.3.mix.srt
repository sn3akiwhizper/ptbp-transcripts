00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
This is yet another introduction from your big boy Wolfie.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello to anyone out there that is listening.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,320
I'm Glistening, live here from 694.2 PTBP.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,160
Recorded live in front of a studio audience.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,160
And live in front of my producer, at least.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,040
Producer don't seem to talk too much these days, though.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,320
Speaking of my possibly deceased producer,

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,200
we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,440
Who's delivering these to me?

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,200
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Big Danny Dan Dan,

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,800
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,600
which is a top notch internet move in my opinion.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,720
They right.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,760
Hey friends, just wanted to say thank you so much

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,380
for the great work you put into this pod.

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,440
It has brought me an immense amount of joy and comfort.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,480
Zach, your world building and storytelling is top class.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,320
Justin, your music is absolutely on point.

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,920
And to our dear PCs, your characters always managed

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,920
to accentuate the absurdity that is human nature just right.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,120
PS, to everyone, winter is coming.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,960
Love each other and remember your vitamin D.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,040
Also to whom it may concern, your tea is getting cold.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
Love, Big Danny Dan Dan.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,320
Well hello, Big Danny Dan Dan.

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,080
The only pod I know about is the ones

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,720
from which my spawn will hatch out of.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,180
Millions of tiny baby wolves, many limbed

29
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,960
and frothing at the mouth, hungry for father's special maulk.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
They will probably devour us all rather quickly

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,120
when the birthing concludes.

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,160
But as I posted on my dating app profile,

33
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,040
I'm here for a good time, not a long time.

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,940
But also, what the fuck is time anyway?

35
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,200
If you want to howl at your wolf, tag us on the internet

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,440
or write a five star review and shoot us an email.

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,840
All the links are in the show notes.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,040
It takes like two minutes tops, fuck.

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,640
And if you're sitting on the toilet

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,880
or trapped by a sleeping pet right now,

41
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,560
you have absolutely no excuses.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,480
Get on it.

43
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,640
Wolf can and will wait, but only like barely

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,760
because it's time to get scary.

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,200
I don't want to be gruff or forward,

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,320
but I would do weird stuff to scot doorward.

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,040
Those who would love to are not alone.

48
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,400
It's time for kudzu with no backbone.

49
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,440
THEME SONG

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:03:09,280
So, you're there at the doorway of what you

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,520
presume is Astin Hawkes' laboratory.

52
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,240
It is dark inside, there is that sound of

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,120
something perhaps moving in liquid towards the

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,960
back. There are indistinct shapes in the gloom,

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,600
but there really isn't enough light to work out

56
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
what anything is.

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,080
Do you guys want me to run away and tear again,

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,320
just in case you want to recheck your pockets

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,160
with another luck roll for those flashlights?

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,960
No, but Frederick Mellon is a seasoned burglar

61
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,160
and has worked in the dark many, many times and

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,720
has learned to rely on his keen sense of ears as

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,160
well as smell.

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,680
And so he is going to try to really dig past his

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,440
inability to see, to make out anything else

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,600
that's going on in this room.

67
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,400
Yeah, give us a daredevil roll.

68
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,520
Carl's going to check his pockets to see if he

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
has a lighter in there.

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,160
OK, well, give me a luck roll.

71
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,840
Seven on a 20.

72
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,600
You do have your trusty old Zippo in there.

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,520
I see Frederick making some weird faces, like

74
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,360
sniffing around and trying to hear, and I flip

75
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,600
that on like this, this might help.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I passed my listen roll, so I hear the lighter.

77
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,560
But also, yeah, that listen roll does help you

78
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,880
identify where that sound is coming from.

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,840
And sure enough, as you've got a bit of light in

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,320
there and it's a lighter, so it's not lighting up

81
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,520
the whole room, but as Dr.

82
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,320
Rothstein mixes way in a bit, you can make out

83
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,920
details and you can see a glint at the back of

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,880
glass and metal, and you reckon the sound you

85
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,160
heard of something moving in liquid came from

86
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,320
back there. And in the little bit of light you

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,040
have, it looks, well, maybe not quite like a fish

88
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,360
tank, but certainly, you know, there's more metal

89
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
on it than a fish tank.

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,920
But there's glass windows and it definitely looks

91
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
like some kind of large tank that's holding

92
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,280
liquid. But you can also make out that there are

93
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,480
a number of workbenches that have got all sorts

94
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,200
of equipment on them, including more of these

95
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,760
cylinders and forceps and gloves and aprons and

96
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,640
stuff like that.

97
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,960
Frederick Mellon will grab a pair of forceps.

98
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,600
Good.

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,680
Yeah, we should stock up on all of those, all

100
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,760
those things. A forcep and a canister for every

101
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,800
man. Do we see any light fixtures?

102
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,760
Yeah, there are a number of light fixtures.

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,960
There is also something that looks like an

104
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,160
electrical wiring loom with all sorts of

105
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,680
equipment. And yeah, you're not quite sure

106
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,720
initially what it is, or maybe with a bit of

107
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,320
time, Dr.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,800
Rothstein could work it out.

109
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,960
But what looks like some fairly complicated

110
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,040
electronics just covering an entire part of the

111
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
wall on this loom.

112
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,480
And there is a bigger knife switch that's there

113
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,840
and a few controls.

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,480
The other thing that attracts your attention is

115
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,000
the floor. The floor is flag stoned, but there is

116
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
this big ring of metal of some kind, maybe

117
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,200
copper, that seems to have all these strange

118
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,960
carvings and designs in it that is connected up

119
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,440
somehow to this electrical loom.

120
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,280
Are the workbenches all outside of that?

121
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,880
Yes.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,480
Or does it kind of run around the room

123
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,080
indiscriminately?

124
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,600
No, it's a circle that's within the center of

125
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,760
the room. All the other equipment, everything

126
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,240
else is outside that circle.

127
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,840
Cool, yeah.

128
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,360
Hey, Luke, what's Karl Rothstein's electrical

129
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:03,960
repair?

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
60%.

131
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,240
Dope. I was hoping it was higher than mine

132
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,200
because I actually pulled 50 in it because I

133
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,360
thought Frederick Mellon might have cut

134
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,920
people's power when he went to rob them, you

135
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,800
know, gotten adept at handling that kind of

136
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
stuff. But then I was like, Oh, no, what if I

137
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,040
put my electrical repair higher than the

138
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,680
physicist?

139
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,080
Did you?

140
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,680
No.

141
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,760
This copper circle, is there anything on the

142
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
ceiling directly above it?

143
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,200
No, it's just on the floor.

144
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,040
Good question.

145
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,000
But Dr.

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,560
Rothstein in particular can work out fairly

147
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,600
quickly, I guess, that there is no power source

148
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,960
in this room. But obviously, you saw those

149
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,600
cables going off to the other outbuildings.

150
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,800
And, you know, it probably makes sense to you

151
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200
that those must be external generators.

152
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,360
Rothstein, we heard about some kind of portal.

153
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,000
Do you think this here is that?

154
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,200
I mean, if anything was a portal, that would be

155
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,800
it. Don't you believe?

156
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,280
It is very portally.

157
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,160
I mean, when you think of portal, you think of

158
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,920
that, don't you?

159
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,200
I don't have a great sci-fi horror frame of

160
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,560
reference at this point in history.

161
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,400
You know, this might not be science fiction.

162
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,760
This is real life.

163
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,480
So I didn't know.

164
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,200
I just the answer to my question is, yes, it

165
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,160
looks like a portal.

166
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,240
I think it is.

167
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,320
Frederick Mellon is like standing in the middle

168
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,960
of it and he's like, oh, this jumps out of the

169
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,880
middle of the circle back on the other side.

170
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,600
I believe those there might be generators on

171
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,360
the outside. Should we try to turn the power on?

172
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,800
No, absolutely not.

173
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,160
We should try to destroy the generators.

174
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,480
That way the power can't ever be turned on unless

175
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
we're trying to send these things back.

176
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
I thought we were going to send them back.

177
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,280
No, I think we just light them on fire.

178
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, sending them back would be much more fun.

179
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,840
While this conversation is going on, Nathaniel

180
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,000
wants to walk back further toward the tank and

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
inspect it a little closer.

182
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,880
OK, well, you're obviously now moving outside

183
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,400
the penumbra of Rothstein's Lighters, so it's

184
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,200
fairly dark. But yeah, you get back there and

185
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,480
yeah, there is some kind of dark liquid, probably

186
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,680
water, maybe not, inside this tank.

187
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,320
And in the little bit of light you have, you can

188
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,440
just make out shapes moving within it, including

189
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,960
one fairly large one.

190
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,160
Are the shapes roughly like the bugs I've seen

191
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,440
before, or is it a wholly new thing to me?

192
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,280
There's...

193
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,040
Well, give me a spot hidden as you're doing this

194
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,360
in the gloom.

195
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,680
I pass a 7 on a 25.

196
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,160
25.

197
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,520
So, yeah, you can see that a few of the things

198
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,160
that wriggle past do look like the specimens

199
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,560
that you saw earlier, albeit larger versions.

200
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,560
But there is something in that tank as well.

201
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,000
You can't really make out the details a bit, but

202
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,400
from the size and shape of it, it looks...

203
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,080
No, it looks very, very different, paler and

204
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,040
larger. And there are tendrils coming off it.

205
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,160
I turn around and announce to the guys, it looks

206
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,400
like maybe they keep them here swimming around

207
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,880
or something. There's another one.

208
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,000
There's another thing in there.

209
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,400
I don't know if it's like insects in our world.

210
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,080
It's maybe it's queen or something.

211
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,160
As he's pointing behind him, Thomas Dolan

212
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
dramatically flips on the lights and nothing

213
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,640
happens.

214
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,480
Fuck.

215
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,080
All right, well, I lost rock, paper, scissors, so

216
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,840
we're going to try to turn this thing on and

217
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
send these things back to where they came from.

218
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,280
So I guess we get ready to push over the tank

219
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,800
into the big old copper circle and then two of

220
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,040
us go to the generator rooms, flip on the

221
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,720
switches on the count of 50 and then, you know,

222
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
the two left inside here push over the fish tank

223
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,520
into the into the circle and then we'll turn it

224
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,120
back off.

225
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,880
Sure.

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
I have no objections to this plan.

227
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,920
I think it's an OK plan.

228
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,760
We don't know a lot about this portal.

229
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,520
We could turn it on and they come flooding out

230
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,160
at us.

231
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,920
I don't know if it's how it works.

232
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,080
I think it's worth a shot.

233
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,960
That's let's push that tank over.

234
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm too weak to do it.

235
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,800
So I have to be one of the ones working in the

236
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,640
electric city, which I have some experience with.

237
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,400
So if they do come flooding out, that's a risk

238
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
I'm willing to take.

239
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,320
Rothstein, let's go.

240
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,360
Sweet.

241
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,880
Perfect.

242
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,640
Coombs, do you think you can push this tank over

243
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,200
on your own?

244
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,600
I don't know.

245
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
I'm not there.

246
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,160
I just figured instead of counting to 50, I could

247
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
I could be somewhere in the middle and I could let

248
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,600
out a note on my fiddle and everybody works

249
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,720
together at the same time.

250
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,120
Five, six, seven, eight.

251
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,120
But I could also be there standing by the tank

252
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,600
with you.

253
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,440
Well, we'll know when the lights come on.

254
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,200
I guess that they did their part and then we tip

255
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,880
the tank over.

256
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,800
We could even have once they get the generators

257
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,160
going, they could just join us back in here.

258
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,600
We still got to flip a switch on the machine, right?

259
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,480
Oh, we want to be ready to turn off the generators,

260
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,840
right?

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,160
We just turn the flip the switch back off.

262
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,720
Right.

263
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,800
The portal switch seems to be in here.

264
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,680
Okay.

265
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm going to stick with this confidence that we

266
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,720
have, that we know what's going on with this and

267
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,640
be like, oh yeah, fuck yeah, dude.

268
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,880
All right, let's go.

269
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,240
What?

270
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,800
Are you think we're going to fuck up and do them

271
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,640
all humanity?

272
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,680
Like, come on.

273
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,760
I doubt it.

274
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,840
Nothing mentioned, nothing gained.

275
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,520
People like us don't have the power to change

276
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,400
human history.

277
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,360
They've told us that over and over our entire

278
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,880
lives, they've let us know.

279
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,880
I mean, my entire life for you guys just recently.

280
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,240
But we're not the ones who are here to, like,

281
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,520
shake up this.

282
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,200
How old are you?

283
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,520
I'm like 27.

284
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,440
I'm 44.

285
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,600
No, my character sheet says old.

286
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,760
So Frederick Mellon I is firing up the generators,

287
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,480
is that right?

288
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
At least one of them.

289
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,280
Okay.

290
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,000
And I could do both now that we're not doing it

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
at the same time.

292
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,480
Sure.

293
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:37,720
Yeah.

294
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,680
It's not like a pressure plate puzzle or anything,

295
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,240
I don't think.

296
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,360
Yeah.

297
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,920
I mean, it doesn't take much to fire up the generators.

298
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,720
You can see that there are a few drums of diesel

299
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,600
there as well.

300
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,440
So, but there seems to be enough fuel in there that

301
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,880
you fire up the generators and then, yeah, the lights

302
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,080
inside the laboratory start flickering on.

303
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,760
It takes a minute for Mellon to come back because

304
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,360
he's going to roll one of those tanks of diesel

305
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,560
back to the lab.

306
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,240
Sure.

307
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,840
Just in case we all need to die in a horrible

308
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,440
conflagration, I get you.

309
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,560
That's exactly right.

310
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay.

311
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,520
But for the rest of you, once the lights are on,

312
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,080
you can see much better what's inside here.

313
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
As I said, there's fairly complex a wiring loom

314
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
with all sorts of weird stuff going on in there.

315
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
There are the workbenches with odd bits of equipment.

316
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,480
You also see that there is a journal or at least

317
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,480
a notebook of some kind on the bench as well.

318
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,760
The tank, you get a better idea now.

319
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,040
Pulling it over is going to be difficult because

320
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,880
it is bolted to the stone wall.

321
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,120
The things moving around inside, yeah, most of them

322
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,680
do look like this thing that Caspar Brink had

323
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
referred to as species 17.

324
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,360
There's something else, though, this larger thing.

325
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,440
There's something about it that reminds you of a

326
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,840
monkey in the shape of it, but maybe a monkey

327
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,720
that's been turned inside out.

328
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,800
And it's floating there in the water.

329
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,640
Its limbs do look more like tentacles than arms.

330
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,920
It's just floating placidly in the middle of all this.

331
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,360
Let's have a sanity roll off Dr.

332
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,400
Coombs as he was the one taking an interest in the contents of the tank.

333
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,400
Taking an interest in the inside out monkey?

334
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,080
I fail, a 93 on a 32.

335
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,280
OK, so you lose a D4.

336
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,680
One.

337
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,600
OK, but yeah, I think the rest of you here, Dr.

338
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,480
Coombs, just cry out an alarm as the lights come on.

339
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,840
And basically, he's been standing there trying to

340
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,560
stare into this tank and all of a sudden he gets a

341
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,320
really good look at what's on the other side of the

342
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,080
glass and just staggers back and lands heavily on

343
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,720
the ground.

344
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,880
That's such a good shot.

345
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,120
Dr.

346
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,280
Osteen is now in a position to actually get a better

347
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,960
look at some of this equipment.

348
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,960
There's also, like I say, this journal, this

349
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,800
leather-bound volume, at least, that's sitting on the workbench.

350
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,960
What, are we going to read the journal like a bunch of nerds?

351
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,480
Let's just flip the switch.

352
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,240
Luke, I think your mic is off.

353
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,000
OK.

354
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,640
Ah, I thought you were quiet.

355
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,680
That makes more sense.

356
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,880
That's much better.

357
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,160
Rothstein is going to go inspect the switch for what he thinks is the portal.

358
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,200
And then is that book near here, that journal?

359
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,520
Yeah, yeah, it's just by all this wiring loom.

360
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,120
Yeah, I'm going to look around and I see that and I'm

361
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,200
going to open it up and read from the start, see what's in it.

362
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,440
Yeah, I mean, there's too much here for you to read through quickly.

363
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,720
I mean, you can skim it just to try to pick out the pertinent points.

364
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,200
It's written in English, which isn't your first language.

365
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,480
So if you're skimming it and trying to dig out the meaning,

366
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,000
let's have a read English roll.

367
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,760
Off you.

368
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,440
I do not pass a 95 on a 50.

369
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,880
Oh, Luke, your mic's off.

370
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,480
Maybe roll again and tell us where you're at.

371
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,120
Right.

372
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,840
You're skimming through, but it's going to take you a

373
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,960
bit more time to make sense of this.

374
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,840
You could just sort of try to ignore the others around you and just really

375
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,320
focus on digging this and push the roll.

376
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,600
But I mean, you know, there's always the chance that you'll just

377
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,120
catastrophically misunderstand what it's saying.

378
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm going to, I'm going to push the roll.

379
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,080
I look over at them and, uh, I'm going to read this.

380
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,520
You got, while you guys work on the fish tank and then I rolled a four.

381
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,440
I mean, I wish you would have failed it, but so do I.

382
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,840
Yeah, the DMs would.

383
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Can we spend luck to fail the roll?

384
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,160
Yeah, I'm going to spend 16 luck.

385
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Zach's like, can I spend my luck to nerf his numbers?

386
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,240
I've got 70, so I can make it a pretty bad fail.

387
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,040
When Frederick Mellon I comes back to the laboratory, obviously Dr.

388
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,240
Rothstein has got his nose in the book.

389
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,760
Dr. Coombes is still sitting there on the ground, looking at the fish tank in terror.

390
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,400
What's Dolan doing?

391
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,080
Dolan is probably pacing around kind of nervously and just trying to pitch in wherever

392
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,960
you can. But I bet his anxiety is like, doc, other doc, are you ready over there?

393
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,320
Are we going to do this? So we're going to, what's going on?

394
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,600
I'm reading.

395
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,200
By the way, the other thing that you've noticed, that Frederick Mellon I has noticed

396
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,120
as he comes back towards the laboratory, is as you've turned the generator on, a few of

397
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,440
the lights, not all of them, but a few of the lights in the main building have come on as

398
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,760
well.

399
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,480
I was wondering about that.

400
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,760
I'm going to do a little roll for him real quick, just to see.

401
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,520
He looks up at the lights and he's really drawn.

402
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He loves stealing, like from rich people specifically.

403
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,200
And so he really wants to go up there, but better judgment says, ah, okay, let me at least

404
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,400
check in with the boys.

405
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm so disappointed in you.

406
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,720
I rolled intelligence and I passed.

407
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,920
But yeah, as I said, then you make your way back to the laboratory and you see all that

408
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,160
other stuff going on.

409
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:01,000
Can I from the ground now shocked by the creature, but I also, can I notice the bolts and

410
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,480
then we, uh, we gotta, we gotta find a wrench guys that this thing's bolted to the wall.

411
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:05,840
Okay.

412
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,680
I'll go find one.

413
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,400
I'll be right back.

414
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
Well, Freddie, Freddie, hold on.

415
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,440
We, maybe we should pursue other options.

416
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,560
Can't you just break it?

417
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:14,840
Yeah.

418
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,320
That's, that's what I was going to suggest.

419
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,800
What if we, what if we break it and we create some kind of channel or funnel, uh, directly

420
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,920
into the center of the portal?

421
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,640
You know, just some planks or whatever that run to it.

422
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,920
How big is this room?

423
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:35,320
Uh, the room is about, yeah, about 10 meters in diameter and it's up against the wall.

424
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,560
The, the ring in the floor is fairly large.

425
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,600
It doesn't take up the whole room by any means, but yeah, I mean, there's still a few

426
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,880
meters between the tank and the, the ring in the ground.

427
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,920
So if it were to tip over, it would tip over into the ring.

428
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Um, or at least just up to the edge of it.

429
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,640
Yeah, perfect.

430
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm a little worried about our plan now that we've seen that thing.

431
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,200
And I point to the creature in the glass that that's, that looks, that looks a little, a

432
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
little more mobile and dangerous.

433
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,120
It's got, it's got, it's just floating there.

434
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,240
He's having a good time.

435
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,160
It's a happy monkey.

436
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,280
That's what makes me not want to just break the glass picture, breaking the glass and

437
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,400
then letting a monkey out into this room.

438
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,480
That would not be good.

439
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,880
I'd like to have a monkey friend.

440
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,200
I don't

441
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,960
monkeys are horrifying.

442
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,080
Haven't you seen the move in pictures?

443
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,520
I think you could probably make a lot of money with a monkey act to around train your

444
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:29,960
monkey.

445
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,880
That's opportunity right there.

446
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,720
Maybe that's how those, all those men became faceless.

447
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,720
We should probably let the doc read his book and see what he finds out before we make

448
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,360
any moves.

449
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,840
Well, while he's reading, we can at least unscrew it.

450
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,600
What if it desperately needs to stay where it is?

451
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:54,160
Is the floating monkey creature, is it, are its eyes open?

452
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,040
Eyes?

453
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,840
What eyes?

454
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,040
Are you reading anything good and the fun is there doc?

455
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,880
Yeah.

456
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,200
So what Dr.

457
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,040
Osteen is picking up from the book is you to remember Dr.

458
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:19,200
Hawks was obsessed with the work of another physicist or an inventor who had also, well

459
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,320
not vanished, but died under mysterious circumstances a little over 10 years ago, a

460
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,080
man called Crawford Tillinghast.

461
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:35,320
And he'd created some kind of device that would shape human perceptions and allow

462
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,200
people to see through to other dimensions of reality.

463
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:49,040
But what Hawks seems to have done is taken the subjectivity out of the Tillinghast

464
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:56,160
resonator and created what he refers to as the Hawks device, which creates much the

465
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,520
same effect, but in objective reality, rather than it just being an individual who

466
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:09,680
perceives it because of the changes to their pineal gland, that it does actually reshape

467
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,320
an area of reality so that it shifts through the dimensions.

468
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,800
Hey, Scott.

469
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,560
Fuck yeah, dude.

470
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,640
That's awesome.

471
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,440
But you think from having flipped through this journal that you do have a better idea

472
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:37,240
now of how to operate the Hawks device, that, yeah, your initial surmise was correct, that

473
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:44,920
the ring in the floor does seem to be containment of this hole or whatever it is that's

474
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,200
being ripped through reality.

475
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,360
From some of the later entries, though, as you flick through the whole thing, there are

476
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,120
some worrying indications.

477
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,840
Now, that's another thing. Up to about eight years ago, the entries in this were being

478
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,760
written by Aston Hawks.

479
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,760
They changed hands, though, and the later entries are all written by someone else.

480
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,320
You're not quite sure who.

481
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:18,360
And the indication is that in recent weeks, as they've been going on their fishing

482
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,960
expeditions, pulling things through from these higher dimensions, the containment from

483
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,240
that ring on the floor is failing.

484
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,560
We were right, but it may not be working as intended.

485
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,360
So maybe like the best idea is kind of what Dr.

486
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,040
Nate was saying earlier.

487
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,200
And what if we just shove it in real quick and then shut it off?

488
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,280
And hopefully nothing breaks containment in that short amount of time.

489
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,280
I like it.

490
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,000
It seems like a good experiment.

491
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,760
Do we get the sense that if we did get it unbolted from the wall, would we be able to do

492
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,720
what we're thinking of?

493
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,040
Do we feel like we could push this tank?

494
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,800
In fact, yeah, the whole thing looks unwieldy enough that, you know, if you unscrewed it

495
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,320
from the wall, it would probably do most of the falling over work itself.

496
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,960
OK. Perf, consider it unscrewed.

497
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,880
Well, with the tools you've got there, let's have a mechanical repair roll off one of you

498
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,840
just to see whether you can do this in an orderly manner.

499
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,600
I'll do it. What do you have?

500
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,880
70 luck. I have a 50 mechanical repair.

501
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,160
Yeah, I've got a 40. I have a 20, but I feel good.

502
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,680
You feel good? Yeah.

503
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,760
And I mean, Dr.

504
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Rustine is still busy reading the journal.

505
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,880
Right. This is what the others are doing while you're doing that.

506
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,040
All right. 54, so I'll spend 34.

507
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,160
OK. At first, obviously, this has been bolted into the wall for some time.

508
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,600
And at first it's fairly rusty.

509
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,080
So you're having to put a bit brute force in there.

510
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:11,120
And a few times the spanner slips and things judder in an alarming manner.

511
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,360
But you do manage to just keep it under control.

512
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
And you're getting down to the last few bolts.

513
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,120
The thing is, like I say, it's not very well balanced and it seems to be pulling itself

514
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,160
away from the wall at this stage.

515
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,440
And if you remove the last few bolts at this stage, it is going to come crashing down.

516
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,720
Wait for it. All right.

517
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,560
Holding on dearly.

518
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,080
Docs, respectively. Freddy's ready over here.

519
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,640
We're ready to flip the switch.

520
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,720
Should I turn it on?

521
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,680
I'm going to go to a workbench and make sure that I have a pair of forceps and a metal

522
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,480
canister handy, ready, just in case.

523
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,760
Grab the big one first.

524
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,440
I think I'm ready.

525
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,400
I think I'm ready.

526
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:59,680
Then let's have a physics roll, first of all, or electrical repair, whichever is higher,

527
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,280
from Dr. Rothstein, just to operate the machinery based on what you've read.

528
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,600
OK, my physics is 70.

529
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,680
OK. And I got a 22.

530
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,120
Nice. It's a hard success.

531
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,880
So, yeah, you've picked up enough from this book that this is all fairly simple.

532
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,160
And you can see that, yeah, perhaps, you know, whoever has been working on the journal

533
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,560
since then has perhaps got some of the settings slightly wrong, or at least you hope

534
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,840
that you're not compounding the problem as you make a few changes.

535
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,480
But then if you're ready to do the deed, are you just pulling down the live switch to

536
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,360
activate it once you've got everything set up?

537
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,800
That's what I was going to do.

538
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,960
So if that's what I've gotten from the book, then.

539
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:55,200
Then you do that and, yeah, there is this sparking and the metal ring of the ground

540
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,120
starts glowing and almost immediately it's like a heat haze, something rising from the

541
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,920
ground. Where you were looking across the room before, now in the center of the room,

542
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,280
in that ring, there is something else.

543
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,960
There is a shifting landscape, maybe.

544
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,120
I mean, your eyes and brain are trying to make sense of it and, you know, it sort of

545
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,120
makes sense to try to imagine this as a landscape, but that doesn't really work.

546
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,800
There are certainly shapes there and things that are moving, all sorts of strange

547
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,640
things, some of them small, some of them large.

548
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,440
It is perhaps like looking into a fish tank or some kind of display of deep sea

549
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,960
creatures. And there are perhaps, you know, some like the creature you've seen before.

550
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,800
There are other things that are larger, that look more predatory, that are shifting

551
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,640
around. Some of them have eyes, some of them have other sensory organs.

552
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,520
And there is the uncomfortable feeling that as you're looking at them, they're starting

553
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,080
to look at you as well.

554
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,920
Let's have sanity rolls up.

555
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,440
It's working. It's working.

556
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,720
Hell, yeah, I fail with a 90 again, I think I've rolled 90s on all of my sanity rolls.

557
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,800
31, I fail, 34.

558
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,400
Pass. I pass with a 13.

559
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,920
So it was melon coons.

560
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,960
OK, so can each of you lose a D6, please?

561
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,280
Come on, baby. I lost three.

562
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,680
Five.

563
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:47,000
So, Dr. Coons, he's shaken, but at least he's not out of his right mind at the moment.

564
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,600
Sort of jumps back from the circle and bumps up against one of the workbenchers, knocking

565
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,440
tools off. But he is composing himself.

566
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,360
Melon, on the other hand, needs to make an intelligence roll.

567
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,800
Fredrick Melon, so smart, 24 under 60.

568
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,200
Yeah, at this stage, all good sense has left your mind.

569
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,640
You are panicking.

570
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,360
You've misjudged this whole situation.

571
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,360
You need to get out of here as quickly as possible.

572
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,400
The problem is that, you know, in your panic, you can't see a way out of here.

573
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,280
There was that thing that Rothstein mentioned before about containment failing.

574
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:37,720
And as you're looking around here, you can see that this isn't just contained within this

575
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:44,080
circle. You can see that there's ripples in the air all around, that you're there trapped

576
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,200
at the back of the room.

577
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,920
How the hell are you going to get out of here without falling into this and getting lost

578
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,640
forever? How are you going to get out of this alive?

579
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,360
Fredrick Melon, the foist, as he's doing what he was meant to do, which was to, like, push

580
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:08,000
this this big aquarium over, instead turns and is trying to claw through the stone behind

581
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,200
him and falling to the ground, kind of like claws down into the floor, trying to escape

582
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,760
like a like a rat trapped in a heated up metal bucket stuck on a snitch's belly.

583
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,320
Nice.

584
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,680
Can you give me a luck roll, please?

585
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,000
I can.

586
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
32 on a 36.

587
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh, dear. Oh, well.

588
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,480
So, yeah, no, you are just clawing.

589
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,560
Oh, no, I misread that.

590
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,920
It's actually a 100.

591
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,400
Whoops.

592
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,880
Classic mistake.

593
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,440
So it's a 100, is it?

594
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,040
No, I passed.

595
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,920
OK, so no, you're there on the floor, you're clawing away and you jog the tank for a

596
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,320
moment and it creaks and almost comes away from the wall, but doesn't quite.

597
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,480
And there's bits of the liquid sloshing down the side, dripping on the ground.

598
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,000
And you can hear something above as you jostle the tank.

599
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,800
There's you saw that there's some kind of metal hatch on the top and there's something

600
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,600
you're convinced now that's just slamming against the tank, just slamming against the

601
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,400
hatch, trying to force it open from the inside.

602
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,160
You know, it knows you're out there.

603
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,760
It's it's clearly coming for you.

604
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,640
Oh, my God.

605
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:46,440
Scott, we'll we'll send you a clip of that because the video slowed you down so

606
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,520
intensely. Did you guys see what I saw?

607
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,920
Slowed you down so intensely as you're describing.

608
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,320
And then there at the end, it sped you up.

609
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,800
So it's coming for you.

610
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,160
Nice. It was really great.

611
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,880
Oh, anyway, so what's everyone else doing while Frederick is losing his shit?

612
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,120
Do we notice that? Right.

613
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,400
Do we see something happening to him?

614
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,040
I mean, he is clearly just panicking.

615
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,000
I mean, you can see him.

616
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,600
He's down on his hands and knees.

617
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,320
He's actually beneath the tank now, just clawing away at the ground.

618
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,840
From my point in the room, can I would I be able to get to one of those bolts, one of

619
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,040
the less bolts?

620
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,120
I would like to try and do that while I'm yelling out to Frederick.

621
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,440
Frederick, get it together.

622
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,640
We got to we got to finish this.

623
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,920
Now is not the time for this.

624
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,600
Frederick is now under the tank.

625
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,920
So, oh, as in if it comes off the wall, it'll crush him.

626
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,960
There's a chance. Glass isn't that dangerous.

627
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,800
He's under it. He might be in the safest place.

628
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,400
You know, a lot of this seems to be made of metal.

629
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,800
Actually, I mean, it probably has occurred to Dr.

630
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,840
Rothstein that the metals in this room, none of them seem to be ferrous metals.

631
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,040
They they mostly seem to be aluminium, which makes sense because science.

632
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,720
Well, that means they're non-conductive, right?

633
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,040
Or magnetic. Yeah.

634
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,240
Yeah. Rothstein doesn't even think to mention it because he's like so obvious.

635
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,280
Yeah. If let's say that there were like two bolts left.

636
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,760
He's loosening. I'm trying to get one of them loosened also.

637
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,320
Dolan is running over to help Coombs.

638
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,880
So, yeah, I mean, between the two of you can get the last two bolts off.

639
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:36,240
Are you getting Freddy to safety before you do this or are you just taking your chances

640
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,320
and hoping that the tank doesn't crush him?

641
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,360
You know, ideally, we get Freddy out of there, but...

642
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,720
Yeah, I'll try and get him out.

643
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,920
I'll try to get him out. That's for sure what Nathaniel Coombs would do.

644
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,880
Yeah, it's part of his bio.

645
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,120
He would try to help.

646
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,680
Which frees Dolan to focus on the tank.

647
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,760
Well, then for Dr. Coombs, give me a STRENGTH roll just to see whether you can drag him

648
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,280
to safety before this thing comes crashing down.

649
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,240
OK.

650
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,080
I FAIL a 95.

651
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,840
You've got hold of him, but he's just pulling away too hard.

652
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,160
And you can see that Dolan's got just about the last bolt out.

653
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,680
You can try pushing the roll, but that means that you're not going to get free either

654
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,480
if this comes crashing down before you do so.

655
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,400
Oh, shit.

656
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,320
Sedgwick, they said it was Sedgwick.

657
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Sedgwick was the one who was taking over, but he was he was he's not the closer.

658
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,080
He's not the closer. He can't close it.

659
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,000
He can't contain it.

660
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,640
It's not Kira. It's just not Kira.

661
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,240
I'm going to I'm going to push the roll.

662
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,160
I'm going to try it.

663
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,040
Nice.

664
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,600
I FAIL.

665
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:13,040
OK, so, yeah, Dolan can see that Coombs is just pulling Mel into safety, just

666
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,840
getting him out of the way as you're taking this last bolt out.

667
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,520
And you think you're free and clear just to get the last bolt.

668
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,160
And then just as you get it clear, Melon pulls Coombs back in the path of all this,

669
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,360
just as it comes topping down.

670
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,920
So what I will do is I'll give both Coombs and Melon the chance to do a DODGE roll just

671
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,440
to roll clear as this tank comes crashing down.

672
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Thank you.

673
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,760
I pass. I got a fourteen on a thirty five.

674
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,760
Nice.

675
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,120
I got a fifty five on a fifty.

676
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,320
So I'm going to spin five luck.

677
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,920
Nice. Fuck yeah.

678
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:55,920
OK.

679
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:04,080
So you both just managed to roll clear as the tank comes crashing down and the glass

680
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,560
shatters, liquid comes pouring out the front and these things come flopping and

681
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,920
wriggling out from all over the place.

682
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,680
Let's have LUCK rolls off the two of you as you're both down on the ground beside this

683
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,040
to see whether any of the creatures take an interest in you.

684
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,240
Ought nine.

685
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,080
I fail a forty on a twenty five.

686
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,040
So Dr. Coombs, as he's lying there on the ground, trying to get his breath, having just

687
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:45,240
rolled out of the way, sees just the tail end of one of these spiny creatures

688
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,760
disappearing into his side and wriggling inside him.

689
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,560
Oh, I got one in me.

690
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,600
I got one in me.

691
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,200
Don't worry too much, Doc.

692
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Obviously, you know, there's the fellow in the woods and probably a few back on the

693
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,720
camp. We're going to have to do this whole process at least one more time so we can get

694
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,320
that one out of you.

695
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:17,720
Dr. Rothstein is obviously trying to maintain the containment as best he can, I guess.

696
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,200
Yeah, he, once it got flipped on, was just awestruck by it.

697
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,640
And he remembers the conversations that he had had with with Hawk about stuff like this.

698
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,120
And he's just amazed that it's right there in front of him.

699
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,360
And then he hears a giant crash and focuses on, like, maintaining the portal.

700
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,040
So far, the containment seems to be OK.

701
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:50,200
You do notice that you can't actually see the ring in the ground anymore and that every

702
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,000
now and then out of the corner of your eye, you can see just shifts in the air around

703
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
you as if it's not all just happening within the center of the room.

704
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,800
That freaks him out a little bit, but he, I guess, kind of still skimming through the

705
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,520
book, looking for any notes about how to change it or anything.

706
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,880
Yeah, I mean, there's all sorts of ideas in there, but it looks like whoever has been

707
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:23,360
writing these notes has changed his mind so often that it's proving not very useful.

708
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:32,760
Whoever it is who's been maintaining Hawk's work since then does not seem to really fully

709
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,400
grasp how all this works.

710
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm going to start helping throw worms into it, into the center then.

711
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:51,800
OK, then let's put this down then to whichever one of you would like to make a DEX

712
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,600
roll, who's busy throwing these things in, just to see how long it takes you to wrangle

713
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,520
all these creatures and throw them into the center.

714
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,720
I've got a 50.

715
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,560
I've got a 50.

716
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,760
I've got a 70.

717
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,440
Would I be able to take part in this?

718
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,520
Yeah, I assume you're all just throwing these creatures in.

719
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,240
Yeah.

720
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,000
So, yeah, let's have Dr.

721
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,840
Coons do it.

722
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,800
I pass a 58 on a 70.

723
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:25,440
OK, that's good, because what you notice as you're throwing the creatures in is that the

724
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,000
other creatures you can see within the zone or whatever it is that's being created.

725
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,600
And it's difficult to read their intentions like you would animals, because you can't

726
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,000
really hear them and they don't necessarily behave in the same way.

727
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,440
But you're seeing what you consider to be perhaps some kind of flock behavior or

728
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:53,040
certainly the kind of behavior you might see in birds or fish or whatever that are

729
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,600
beginning to look agitated and moving in formation away from maybe some approaching

730
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,240
predator.

731
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,120
Oh, shit.

732
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
What's Inside Out Monkey doing?

733
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,040
Did he get into the portal already?

734
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,160
It's just flopping on the ground at the moment.

735
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,160
It's bigger.

736
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:19,200
And so it's just, yeah, it doesn't look like it's very mobile outside of a liquid

737
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,960
environment.

738
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,720
I'm trying to kick it into the center.

739
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
You're kicking it into the center.

740
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,680
Oh, OK, good.

741
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,840
Right.

742
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,320
Then...

743
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,280
You love to see it.

744
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:45,160
OK, as you kick it, it doesn't seem very happy about this and it lets out what you

745
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,720
think is probably a scream of pain, or at least that's what you get for the first

746
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,080
couple of seconds of it.

747
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,720
But the sound, it does something to your brain as you hear it, and you can just hear

748
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,880
or feel your brain just shutting down in response to this sensory overload that's

749
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,560
coming out of this pained creature.

750
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,360
Yeah, I would like everyone to make power rolls, please.

751
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,640
66 on a 40.

752
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,280
I failed 79 on a 40.

753
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,760
I passed with a 34 on a 40.

754
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,880
Extreme pass, ought to.

755
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,040
OK, so two of you are just, you're having to fight through this pain and confusion

756
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:44,440
and you can see that your two companions have just dropped the ground and are just

757
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:53,200
sitting or lying there looking vacantly as this thing sings or screams or whatever.

758
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,240
But yeah, with that, I mean, you've got enough time that if you want, you can just

759
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,560
finish the job of kicking it in or shoving it in through the barrier.

760
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,480
Guys, you should try kicking it.

761
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,920
Frederick Mellon will kick it.

762
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,480
OK, and with a good punt, then, yeah, he goes, well, not quite sailing through the

763
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,400
air, it's a bit big for that, but you managed to shove it and as it disappears

764
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,360
into the the center of the room, then the sound stops.

765
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,920
Your two companions, however, are still sitting on the ground looking quite glassy eyed.

766
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,600
I'll kick them.

767
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,640
I want to approach Carl because he's the one who's running this machine where he's

768
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,360
going to be the one that we need to turn it off.

769
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,800
So I'm rushing over to him and maybe like shaking him by the shoulders.

770
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,520
Carl, Carl, you with us?

771
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,280
We're going to need you to turn off this machine here pretty soon.

772
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,200
And Carl is not responding in the slightest.

773
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:10,240
I am going to grab forceps and try to pull the creature that went into Coombes

774
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,800
earlier and then put it into Rothstein.

775
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:26,440
So, yeah, you grab the forceps and you did see where the creature went in.

776
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,920
So, Coombes, remember earlier we learned that they do the power.

777
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,440
They suck it out of your body.

778
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,160
We got to get the one that went in when you screamed earlier.

779
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,200
We got to get it out of here.

780
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,400
We got to put it in Rothstein.

781
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,840
That way his eyes come back from the glassiness, OK?

782
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,880
Just long enough for him to turn off the machine, right?

783
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,240
Then we get it out of him, too, right?

784
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,000
Enjoy.

785
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,040
All right, all right.

786
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,320
And I hold my arms up, giving him ample angle.

787
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:59,400
Yeah, sure enough, you start fishing around inside the now molten flesh of Dr.

788
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:07,160
Coombes, sticking your forceps in through his side and just digging around until you

789
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,160
grab hold of something that you maybe hope isn't his pancreas and start pulling.

790
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,320
I got it.

791
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:28,040
So, for Dr. Coombes, can you roll a d3 twice, please?

792
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,160
This could be very, very bad for you.

793
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,520
I got a 1 and a 3.

794
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,600
OK, so you lose 10 points of power and you lose 30 luck.

795
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,160
That's more luck than I have.

796
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,760
Does that matter?

797
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,120
Or it just goes to zero?

798
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,520
You die instantly.

799
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,080
Your luck is now zero.

800
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,200
So your group luck roll now is zero.

801
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,560
Just putting that out there.

802
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,440
Perfect.

803
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,640
Kick him into the circle.

804
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,840
I just wanted to get that pressure off you, Thomas.

805
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,240
That's all that was.

806
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,680
You're a good friend, Joe.

807
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,760
OK, so, yeah, you can sort of see some of the life draining out of Dr.

808
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,720
Coombes as you drag this screaming, thrashing creature out of him.

809
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

810
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,360
Yeah, his skin definitely looks drier and flakier and he just looks older somehow.

811
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,080
Oh, that one got a lot.

812
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,160
He's about to crumble.

813
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,040
I'm very thirsty.

814
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:42,960
And I'm going to kick Rothstein over and lift up his shirt.

815
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,240
OK, so he's on his back and you're dropping the creature into, I'm

816
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,440
going to, I'm not going to drop it.

817
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,560
I'm going to hold onto it in the forceps.

818
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,600
OK, and you're placing, you're placing it inside his body.

819
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,960
I mean, it's what the man who I killed said to do.

820
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,120
Yeah, I mean, you're going to have to release it because until it burrows

821
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:09,560
its way into his body, his flesh isn't in that state where you can get the

822
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,480
forceps in, at least not without cutting him open and gouging him.

823
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,160
I'm going to try it first.

824
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,680
I'm going to try it first where the forceps keep just like...

825
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,920
Poking him really hard.

826
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,320
Oh, God.

827
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,240
Casper Brink, you dumb piece of shit.

828
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,040
But eventually you do manage to get the creature into him.

829
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,480
I'm going to wait until his eyes come back and then I'm going

830
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,960
going right into his belly.

831
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:47,160
Dr. Rothstein can gain 10 points of power and 10 points of luck as this

832
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,240
creature wriggles its way inside him.

833
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,120
And yeah, I suppose with that, with that jolt of energy, you do start

834
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,480
to come out of your fugue state.

835
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,680
Oh my, I feel fantastic.

836
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,240
Frederick Mellon is just screaming.

837
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,760
I like to think the entire time this is happening.

838
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:12,880
He's just, let me, let me get a fresh set of eyes on these knobs and stuff.

839
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,800
Mellon's still screaming.

840
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,560
I was about to say, let's have a group luck roll to see what's happened

841
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,320
with the containment while Dr.

842
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,680
Rothstein's been unconscious.

843
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,800
But of course we know what your group luck roll is now, don't we?

844
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,360
But then you remember it would be pointless.

845
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,080
So as Dr.

846
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,200
Rothstein is coming out of this fugue state, he can see, yeah, that this, this

847
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:41,560
area of otherness is spreading and has, you know, is now pushing up against where

848
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,680
you are and it looks like it's almost about to engulf your feet where you're

849
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,800
lying on the ground.

850
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:55,440
You can also see now that all the smaller creatures have fled and there is the

851
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,240
shadow or the outline of something very large coming your way.

852
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,600
The scream turns into, shut it off, shut it off, shut it off, shut it off.

853
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,880
I jump up and shut it off.

854
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,880
Yeah, as you're jumping up and trying to shut this off before whatever it is

855
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,680
reaches you, let's have a DEX roll to see whether you can do this nice and quickly.

856
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,880
Can I try to help him up?

857
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,760
I got a 13 on a 50.

858
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,080
Oh, so, yeah.

859
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,960
I whack your hand away from me and you're helping a ghost, man.

860
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,960
He's already gone.

861
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,440
I do.

862
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,480
I lean down and try to help him up when he's standing on the other side.

863
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,160
Yeah, I just flip the switch.

864
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:37,920
Yeah.

865
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,320
And, and I mean, the rest of you can see that there, yeah, there is something just

866
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:52,800
huge that is just beginning to move into the center of the room and just pushing

867
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,440
beyond the bounds of the containment here.

868
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,480
And there's something that is reaching out towards you.

869
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,720
And then just all of a sudden, the knife switch goes click.

870
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,240
And there's just the metal ring in the center of the room, the stone floor.

871
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:09,840
Whoa.

872
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,520
Did it, did it work?

873
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,280
Are we all here?

874
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,040
Dolan is still dazed, right?

875
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,680
Dolan is beginning to come out of it now.

876
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,960
You've got no memory of what's just happened.

877
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,760
Yeah.

878
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,840
I mean, one moment, you know, the tank was going over and the next moment you're now

879
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,960
sitting here and everyone's in different positions and you're not really sure what

880
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,520
happened.

881
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,280
Dolan, are you with us?

882
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,160
Uh, park the car.

883
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,440
I'm not really sure.

884
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,880
Uh, park the car.

885
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,560
We parked the car halfway down the driveway.

886
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,480
It's facing out.

887
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,960
That way we can get out quickly.

888
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:49,800
Are they gone?

889
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,880
Uh, did we, did we do it?

890
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,200
Uh, yeah, we've solved everything.

891
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,280
But how do you like them apples?

892
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,920
Oh, except for we don't have the two missing kids.

893
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,440
You know, that was always going to be icing on the cake, I think.

894
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:06,760
Yeah.

895
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,400
We don't have the two missing kids.

896
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,760
And also I'm sure there's a lot of squeamy things out there in the woods that seem to

897
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,840
still be out there.

898
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,920
There's that guy that's fucked up.

899
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,440
I can't, not on this, not on this one.

900
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:28,960
And, uh, and, uh, yeah, I can't think of anything else, uh, left to do with anybody

901
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,800
around here.

902
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,920
We, we will have to do this again.

903
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,200
Right.

904
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,400
We're going to have to open the portal again to get for the things that are in

905
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,360
Nancy and, uh, yeah, the other one.

906
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,800
And then the, you know, that guy in the woods just seemed to be silly with them.

907
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,640
So, uh, we might just have to throw him all the way in there.

908
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,920
Didn't we buoyant some though?

909
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:49,560
It's true.

910
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,160
That's true.

911
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:50,640
Yeah.

912
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,440
We could just burn that fellow alive.

913
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,800
I honestly don't think I want to take the risk of having that giant, giant thing at

914
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,520
the end there.

915
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:04,920
Did you see the, the, the, the, and like words being to fail him as he really just

916
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,280
has no idea how to describe what was reaching out there at the end, right

917
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,760
before it came down.

918
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,960
You just see in his eyes, like, uh, the twinkle of constellations unknown.

919
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,880
I don't have any recollection of that, but if you saw some kind of terrible

920
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,040
shadow moving towards you through the thing, you know, presumably it would just

921
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,560
move on.

922
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,960
Like if we did it in 15 minutes, I don't, you know, 20, you know, an hour is still

923
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,640
going to be waiting around for that portal.

924
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,200
It saw no, it's going to be eating fishes somewhere else.

925
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:40,040
Do you guys think that we should, uh, destroy this then if we're going to, if

926
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,640
we're just going to burn the remaining ones, should we, should we destroy this

927
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,080
machine?

928
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah.

929
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,520
Are we on team burn the remaining ones?

930
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,720
No, we keep the machine.

931
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:56,160
It's very, uh, I might make use of it, uh, to repurpose it.

932
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,240
In what way, Doc?

933
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,680
Uh, I won't, it will be safe.

934
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,920
I don't know if we can trust this thing existing.

935
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,520
I mean, we've seen what it can do.

936
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,720
That's, that's, there's no way that that can be used for good, right?

937
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,320
Ultimately it should absolutely be destroyed.

938
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,600
I'm just saying, are we done destroying things with it?

939
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,320
We should probably at least look at the lights in the house, right?

940
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,440
Well, we got to go check out the lights in the house.

941
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,240
We still got to find the kids.

942
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,520
We've got to find Billy and Esther.

943
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,160
Yeah.

944
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,320
And the closer.

945
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,240
How did you wake me up?

946
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,920
How did you make me feel so good?

947
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,840
Uh, you just kind of snapped out of it.

948
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,360
Oh, fantastic.

949
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,240
Well, nothing left to do there.

950
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,320
Well, great.

951
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,560
No, I'm just kidding.

952
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,200
Lay down.

953
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,440
What?

954
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,560
I want you to lay down, lift up your shirt, and then I want you to do not

955
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,440
look, do not look down.

956
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,640
I immediately lift my shirt up and look.

957
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,120
Okay.

958
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,400
If you get it, did it eat its way inside me?

959
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,800
Don't press.

960
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,480
Don't, don't you dare press your fingers right above your belly.

961
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,560
Press my finger right above my belly then.

962
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,680
Okay.

963
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,600
And, and your fingers sink right through your skin into your flesh.

964
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,960
There's no ripping or tearing at the flesh.

965
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,560
It's just like putting your fingers into a bowl of warm oatmeal.

966
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:22,120
Oh, I immediately pull my hand out and I'm like, go ghost white.

967
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,440
And flick the oatmeal off.

968
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,320
Yeah.

969
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,360
Let's have a sanity roll for that as you have just probed the

970
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,720
inside of your own abdomen.

971
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,720
I got a 69.

972
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,000
A fail.

973
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,240
So that's going to be a D4 San.

974
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,800
Did you say 69?

975
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,320
Yeah.

976
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:41,680
Yeah.

977
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,360
Do we, do we want to tell Scott about a really immature house rule?

978
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,480
Which is that that's a crit success.

979
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,280
Yeah.

980
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,160
Usually I'm happy to see that number, but.

981
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,160
I'm not going to force Scott to roll with our 69 as a

982
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,760
critical success house rule.

983
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:16,880
I am happy to, when in Rome, I shall embrace the 69.

984
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,400
When in Rome, 69.

985
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,200
Okay.

986
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,640
In which case, yeah, you, you don't lose any San.

987
00:55:36,760 --> 00:56:02,880
Sorry.

988
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,640
Just trying to get 30 minutes of silence to really get the

989
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,320
noise quiet meditation time.

990
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:10,840
Shut up.

991
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,040
Sorry.

992
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,600
I had, uh, I had a bunch of fans going that I had to go turn on.

993
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,000
Okay.

994
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,440
Well then let's get 30 seconds of silence from Thomas.

995
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,760
Uh, cause it'll way over compress.

996
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,120
If it's trying to cut out the fans that are no longer there.

997
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,360
You guys can talk about it.

998
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,320
Yeah, but you can't.

999
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,560
Can we get a verbal confirmation that you understand?

1000
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:36,840
Yeah.

1001
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,960
Without Thomas able to talk.

1002
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,120
Is there a point in the rest of us speaking to each other?

1003
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,640
Can't think of any.

1004
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:57,080
Well, not apart from to taunt Thomas, but anyone got any good taunts?

1005
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,880
You look like you can't swim.

1006
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,000
I can swim.

1007
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:03,720
I can swim.

1008
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,520
I've put on a lot of weight lately though.

1009
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,160
So you could float better.

1010
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,920
No, it just, that's a place you guys could go.

1011
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,640
Dude, there was a, uh, I'm ashamed to start a story with this, but there

1012
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,640
was a tic talk the other day that I saw.

1013
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,240
But it's just this guy.

1014
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,440
Considering your, your internet culture consumption, that could have

1015
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,000
been like a billion times worse.

1016
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,480
Yeah, but, uh, it's this guy just like messing with his brother.

1017
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,080
He's like, dude, you just look like you like have never bowled a strike.

1018
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,880
And he's like, just like gets irrationally upset, like arguing.

1019
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,920
He's like, dude, I have my own ball.

1020
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,880
Like just getting really mad.

1021
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,600
And I'm like, that is a hilarious insult.

1022
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,760
Like do you see Thomas's eyes were darting around?

1023
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,840
He was trying to remember if he'd ever.

1024
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,120
I don't, I don't know if I have, I don't bowl that often.

1025
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,080
Um, I don't think I've bowled a strike in my adult life.

1026
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:14,640
You, you have, I was there and it was because we were all bowling and you asked

1027
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,320
Ben to give you a tip and he's told you about the bringing the hand up and

1028
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:22,000
touching the ear and the very next ball you rolled was a strike and we all were

1029
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,480
like, Ben knows how to bowl and knows how to teach people how to bowl that.

1030
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:26,840
Wow.

1031
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,080
You're telling me I just had to touch my ears this whole time.

1032
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,160
He's a teacher now, which is great, but I don't, I have never remembered that tip.

1033
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,480
So he's probably not a good one.

1034
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,040
I'm assuming you let go of the bowl, the bowl before touching your ear, because

1035
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,280
otherwise that's going to smart, right?

1036
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:41,800
Correct.

1037
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,720
Yeah, correct.

1038
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,040
That, that would hurt quite a bit.

1039
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,200
No, you actually bowl best with a concussion.

1040
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:56,080
So that's the, so actually my high game, I was on pain medication and wearing a

1041
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:02,880
boot on my ankle because I had like fractured a bone in my foot, but my family

1042
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,040
still decided that our outing that Saturday was going to be bowling.

1043
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,000
No, exactly.

1044
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,960
You can, you can do it.

1045
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:10,960
I bet.

1046
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,960
And I was like, yeah, okay.

1047
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,920
So I like would waddle up and I bowled seven strikes in a row to start off the

1048
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,160
game.

1049
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:19,920
Hell yeah.

1050
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,720
I don't remember it all exactly, but I do remember I left a couple open frames

1051
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,760
there upsetting.

1052
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,360
So the secret to good bowling is to be smacked off your tits.

1053
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,000
Yep.

1054
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,200
I think that's about right.

1055
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,320
That's the takeaway for sure.

1056
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,000
That is not what I found to be true.

1057
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:38,800
Yeah.

1058
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,640
My highest I ever bowled was a two Oh two.

1059
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,360
I had to go to Instagram to look cause I was so proud of myself.

1060
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,160
That's good.

1061
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,680
That is good.

1062
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,480
Yeah, that's really good.

1063
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,880
My high game was two 47, but my previous high game was like 160.

1064
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:00,720
So I've never bowled in between 160 and two 47.

1065
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,720
That's crazy.

1066
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,480
When I worked at the order, I picked up some, some tips from Jake that made me a

1067
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,640
much better bowler and it made it really fun.

1068
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,600
It's fun to be good at something fun to play it when you're good at it.

1069
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:19,080
But he taught me how to do the like spinny curve throw game changer.

1070
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,160
Plus it's way more fun to do it that way.

1071
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,560
When you get the hang of it, that it does, it feels really good when you

1072
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,880
get the spin thing working and you can just like throw the ball at the pans.

1073
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,880
That's a good strategy.

1074
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,160
As long as you knock them all down, you got to just touch your ear.

1075
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,080
And that's what I've always said.

1076
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,760
So, um, we, so Luke run it back for me.

1077
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,280
Um, we went to the house.

1078
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,280
We did.

1079
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,200
Uh, what was the house called the house?

1080
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,880
Yeah, we've talked about this while you were on the line.

1081
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,520
The home who must be named the name of the scenario.

1082
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,080
Bleak Oh, prospect.

1083
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:54,920
Yes.

1084
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,520
I yep.

1085
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,400
Good.

1086
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,240
Uh, I was just testing you guys to see that you remembered

1087
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,400
that there was a name for it.

1088
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,040
We went to prospect thing.

1089
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:05,560
We passed.

1090
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:05,880
Yeah.

1091
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,440
Otherwise I would have refused to do the rest of the recap.

1092
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:16,040
So we went to prospect, uh, after, before, before we went there though,

1093
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,720
we, uh, the slugs escaped, right?

1094
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,240
Kinda kind of.

1095
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:22,480
Yeah.

1096
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:28,680
We went back to the, um, not the, like the camp or whatever.

1097
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,760
The Herbert town.

1098
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,600
Yes.

1099
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,600
Are they called Hoover towns?

1100
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,440
Cause they suck.

1101
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,920
I love vacuum humor.

1102
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,440
And then we went to the house.

1103
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,720
We did some sort of portal, uh, broke a fish tank.

1104
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:46,840
There's a monkey.

1105
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,480
Yeah.

1106
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:56,640
This is going to be, I mean, I'm probably going to edit this out for sure,

1107
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,960
especially because this will be in the same episode as what just happened.

1108
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,680
Incredible.

1109
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,960
We're coming in in the middle of an episode here,

1110
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:14,040
but I think we'd left it that you just sort of finished everything that you

1111
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,200
wanted to do in the laboratory.

1112
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:21,600
And that your plan now was to go to the main house and see whether you could

1113
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,560
find out what had happened to the kids.

1114
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:23,880
Right.

1115
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,720
I remember, if nothing else, that the kids were our next plan of attack.

1116
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,160
Yeah, we're going to go attack those kids.

1117
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,720
Well, it is now fully dark outside.

1118
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,720
There is, however, some light because when you switched the generators on, you

1119
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:45,400
switched on some lights within Prospect itself.

1120
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,280
There isn't a lot of light coming out.

1121
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,000
It's not like every light in the place is now blazing.

1122
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,480
But there are a few.

1123
01:02:53,880 --> 01:03:00,440
Now, you're around the side of the building at the moment, so you're pretty much

1124
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,160
equidistant from both the front and the back entrances.

1125
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:11,000
With the new lights on, do we see any movement or signs of life within the house?

1126
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,560
Yeah, there is a light on upstairs, a fairly faint one.

1127
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:24,680
You don't see any movement, but the window, yeah, the window looks a bit weird from down

1128
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:31,320
here. It looks like it's got perhaps some strangely colored curtains across it, some

1129
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,040
very moist looking curtains.

1130
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:46,800
I've seen a lot of acquaintance in my day, but none that look oh, is that you can tell

1131
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,400
the thick and heavy with moisture?

1132
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:54,640
Yeah, but are they thick and heavy like cloth is thick and heavy when it's got moisture

1133
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,280
on it, or is it more thick and heavy?

1134
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,280
Like he's an older gentleman.

1135
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,200
Let's say he's got that like turkey neck thing going on.

1136
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,880
So he just kind of grabs it as gobbler and he's like, oh, is it more like, and he just

1137
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:11,160
starts kind of shaking around the like part by his Adam's apple, just kind of violently

1138
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:16,080
making a kind of a wet slapping noise of the skin against his Adam's apple.

1139
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,120
Uh, skin draperies?

1140
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:25,800
I mean, the answer really is neither.

1141
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:27,800
Oh, good.

1142
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:34,120
Yeah, no, it doesn't quite seem to be those things.

1143
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,440
I've seen a lot of a lot of skin in my in my time as a doctor.

1144
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,880
That doesn't look like skin curtains to me.

1145
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,280
I don't know why you would have floated that.

1146
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,960
That's kind of an out there thing to kind of jump to the conclusion.

1147
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,760
I'm kind of losing it a little bit, obviously.

1148
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,880
What's your first name?

1149
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,400
For some reason, I can't remember.

1150
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,040
It's Doc out here, Doc, and it's hard to tell.

1151
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:58,320
It's Nathaniel, you really can remember that?

1152
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,360
Let me let me take a look at you.

1153
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,480
Did you get hit?

1154
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,560
Are you all right?

1155
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,640
It feels like months have passed between the last moment we saw each other and now.

1156
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:11,120
Yes, I wonder if I'll have the same accent.

1157
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,280
It sounds better.

1158
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:25,120
Okay, so if it's not my turkey neck that's hung up in the windows, then I feel a little bit safer going in there.

1159
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:30,600
Doctor, now that you've told me that you've seen skin that ain't skin, then yeah.

1160
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,080
Okay.

1161
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,520
Are we going in the front of the back?

1162
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:37,960
Because they might expect us in the back, because if we're supposed to be sneaky, then we would go in the back.

1163
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,240
Right.

1164
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,600
And they clearly know something's up because we turned on the power.

1165
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
What about a window?

1166
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,600
What's it about?

1167
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,440
Yeah, God damn it.

1168
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,000
I was doing you.

1169
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,840
Yeah, a window.

1170
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,040
Yeah, I think that's a good idea, Luke.

1171
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,240
Why don't we look for a window down here?

1172
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,000
Thank you.

1173
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,240
One thing I was going to say, though, is Dr.

1174
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:09,320
Coons can attempt to spot hidden role, actually, because unlike the others, you have a bit of medical knowledge that you can draw upon here that might help.

1175
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,640
I will give it a shot.

1176
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,280
I...

1177
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,000
Oh, shit.

1178
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,760
I don't pass.

1179
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,840
It's a 27 on a 25.

1180
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,800
You could spend two points of luck.

1181
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,760
I ain't got no luck, boys.

1182
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,800
That was one of the things that happened last session.

1183
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,280
Oh, yes.

1184
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,080
Yes.

1185
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,280
Shit.

1186
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,080
Does that mean our...

1187
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:30,960
You've reminded Scott.

1188
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,680
...group luck roles are now at zero?

1189
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,720
Yup.

1190
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,320
Guess who's about to call for a luck role?

1191
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,720
Well, I guess it doesn't matter if I spend some of my precious 13 points anymore, because it can't affect the group.

1192
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,280
Can I help him with that role?

1193
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:46,800
You can't.

1194
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,640
With some of my luck, or...?

1195
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,200
No, no, you can't.

1196
01:06:49,200 --> 01:07:02,640
But what I will say is that, and it's difficult to tell what you're looking at through that window upstairs, because there's condensation on the inside of the window, and there's definitely something obfuscating the view.

1197
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:12,200
But, yeah, there's something about the color and the texture of what you're looking at in the window that is just tickling the back of your brain.

1198
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:16,480
But you just can't get a good enough view to really work out what it is.

1199
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,640
There's something up with what's going on in that window up there.

1200
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,840
I don't think it's skin, but there's something odd about it.

1201
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,800
It's tickling the back of my brain.

1202
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,320
It's fucking kooky, that's for sure.

1203
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,720
Look at the color of it.

1204
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,640
I prefer not to.

1205
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,720
I don't want to look at this thing at all.

1206
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:42,800
I don't know if it's kookier or spookier, but I think we should be looking for a window that doesn't have these sort of abnormally wet...

1207
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,560
These kooky, spooky curtains.

1208
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:44,960
Yeah.

1209
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,800
Exactly, exactly.

1210
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,640
Maybe it's a fluky curtain, too, and there's more that don't have them.

1211
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,960
Are there any windows on the bottom floor that don't have the spooky curtains?

1212
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:56,720
Thanks, Luke.

1213
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,520
There certainly are.

1214
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:05,320
The windows are shuttered, but it wouldn't take much to pry the shutters away.

1215
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:13,920
Yeah, if you head around the side of the building a little bit, you can see that there are a few windows at Grand Devil here that you could investigate.

1216
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,120
Hey, guys, I found one.

1217
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,600
OK, but like, do we even have a plan?

1218
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,040
Get inside.

1219
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:24,040
Yeah, but what happens when we get inside?

1220
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,520
We save the kids, cue in on.

1221
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,360
Explore, save the kids, get out.

1222
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,160
What if we run into trouble?

1223
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,480
We are the storm.

1224
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,240
We made a portal already today, so we can do anything.

1225
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,600
I like this guy's optimism.

1226
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,720
We can't do anything we put our mind to, Doc.

1227
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,000
You're absolutely right.

1228
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,840
Let's let's get in there.

1229
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,400
Let's save these fucking kids.

1230
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,640
Let's find a goddamn window we can open.

1231
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,600
I start trying to pry the boards off the window.

1232
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,440
OK, well, it's not boarded up.

1233
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:06,200
It's like I say, shutters, which have largely been put in place, but you don't really need to make a roll or anything.

1234
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:12,000
There's a bit of creaking and grunting as you pull these rusted shutters away.

1235
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,560
And there is some light on inside.

1236
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,320
You can see that you're looking into a room.

1237
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:33,960
Yeah, I mean, it's obviously a room, but the walls are covered with wallpaper or paint of some description that is glistening,

1238
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:40,640
that it's sort of reddish purple and there's liquid trickling down it.

1239
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:49,600
Maybe we see if another room in this house isn't quite so kooky and spooky.

1240
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:55,760
This one seems to have a lot of the same vibes as that, the moist curtains.

1241
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:04,360
Now, we already spent the volume, you know, when you're breaking into a house, you really want to only break in through one place.

1242
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:11,960
That way, they, you know, if they hear you coming in through the first place, then they wouldn't be able to.

1243
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,000
Fredrik, are you OK?

1244
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:16,800
You're really?

1245
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,520
Yeah, no, it's really early for you.

1246
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,480
Let me let me help you up into the window.

1247
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,560
And I like offer him my hands to step into.

1248
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:40,440
Zach's tired, so if we just suggest thanks for his character, we can kind of we can kind of canary him through all these doors.

1249
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,800
Here I go through the window.

1250
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:54,680
OK, well, the window frame, you look at it, you don't think it's locked.

1251
01:10:54,680 --> 01:11:02,160
But when you try pushing the sash window up, there's resistance.

1252
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:16,960
And as you do so, there's a sort of noise and there's something sort of wet and rubbery around the bottom of it that just pulls the window back down as you pull it up.

1253
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:26,720
And just for a moment, you get a blast of warm, moist air come out that fogs in the cold air.

1254
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:43,840
And there's a smell to it, maybe not an entirely repellent smell, but yeah, there's certainly some nasty undertones to it, but mostly it's is kind of warm and moist and meaty.

1255
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:48,160
This goddamn house is fucking alive.

1256
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:55,880
The squelching stuff that brought it back down is was it was it literally there?

1257
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,400
If we had if we had a knife or something, could we could we could we cut it away?

1258
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,680
Yeah, I mean, looking at it, I mean, it perhaps reminds you a little bit of kind of bubble gum, maybe.

1259
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,480
Does does anybody have a knife?

1260
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,440
We could we could we can get our way in here.

1261
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,880
No, but my fingers are due for bubble gum.

1262
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:20,160
This is just like some nasty smelling bubble gum that they're trying to keep the windows closed so that it's a weird sort of way.

1263
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:29,120
I've never seen a house like this with a security system that uses bubble gum on the exterior of the interior of all the rooms to try to keep everything closed.

1264
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,040
But I figure I could chew it away, probably.

1265
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,320
Guys, two things.

1266
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:39,960
One, I think we obviously let Freddie keep volunteering for all this all this dangerous shit.

1267
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,160
But then to Freddie, I love your enthusiasm.

1268
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:50,920
Maybe go back to your original plan of the hands, not just eating the bubble gum, because I don't think that's bubble gum.

1269
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,720
But also, why don't you use my knife?

1270
01:12:54,440 --> 01:13:00,680
So Frederick Millen I takes the knife and will open up the window once more.

1271
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:11,440
And as he slowly opens it up, he'll slide the blade just in between the window and the threshold and just kind of like, slide it along.

1272
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,880
Slide is probably optimistic.

1273
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,680
It is more hacking.

1274
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,720
Ah, yes.

1275
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:20,120
Well, Frederick Millen I is nothing if not optimistic.

1276
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,760
I thought you were going to say a hack.

1277
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,880
I thought you were too.

1278
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:38,520
But yeah, with a bit of elbow grease, you can gouge away and there is fluid now bubbling down over the edge of the windowsill.

1279
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:49,920
And inside the house, you can hear what sounds like a creaking, groaning sound coming from deep within.

1280
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:55,120
And just for a moment, the wall shakes and trembles.

1281
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,480
After you, Freddie.

1282
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,280
I'm in.

1283
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:05,240
As you cut the last of it away, you get the window up, you can climb in.

1284
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:13,960
What I do want is not a CLIMB roll, but just the DEX roll, I think, just to see how gracefully you can do this.

1285
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,200
Because what you realize as you're clambering through is everything inside is slippery as fuck.

1286
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,920
Extreme success.

1287
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,640
I rolled a 12 on a 65.

1288
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,640
Fantastic.

1289
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,080
Nice.

1290
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:42,120
OK, then, yeah, despite the fact that you're coming in on what is a window ledge and then there's maybe a few bits jutting out of the floor that once upon a time were furniture,

1291
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:47,560
but are now again covered with this pulsating pinkish purple stuff.

1292
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:53,560
I mean, despite that, you've managed to land on your feet and not slip over the floor.

1293
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:59,120
The floor is also covered with all of this, plus a few inches of fluid.

1294
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,800
Yeah, it is incredibly slippery.

1295
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,280
Hey, guys, it's like an ice skating rink in the air.

1296
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,160
Now that you're inside and get a good look at all this.

1297
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,600
You've got to be really careful.

1298
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,160
I would like a sansi roll.

1299
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,280
Oh, yeah, because you're in the meat house.

1300
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,240
Sixty two on a sixty four.

1301
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:22,040
OK, then, yeah, you don't lose any.

1302
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:29,320
It's just a very wet, very squelchy, very slippery room.

1303
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,360
Completely normal.

1304
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,520
Thomas, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc.

1305
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,280
Can you hear anything from where you are?

1306
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:41,360
Yeah, I can hear groaning coming from deep within the house.

1307
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,440
Doesn't sound like missing children, but.

1308
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,840
And then he just kind of shrugs his shoulders.

1309
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,480
If you wanted to try to discern more than that, you could give me a listen roll.

1310
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,600
Give me a second.

1311
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,280
I'm going to try to discern more than that.

1312
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,880
I rolled a sixty seven on a fifty, so that's a fail.

1313
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,800
But he is going to like

1314
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:09,880
he's going to try to slide across the room as quietly as possible to hear better,

1315
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:16,240
because if he's further away from the three men and the outside, he might be able to hear better.

1316
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:20,080
He pushes himself along the room.

1317
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,520
Yeah, you can push the roll here.

1318
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,520
I fail.

1319
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,400
No.

1320
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:37,040
Well, as you're pushing your way across the floor to try to find somewhere quieter away from the others,

1321
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:44,360
you hit a bit of the floor, which it wasn't obvious because it's all covered with this

1322
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,200
membranous whatever it is.

1323
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:55,760
But there's a bit where you suddenly realize as you reach it that the wood underneath or the flooring underneath has rotted away.

1324
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:03,200
And you work this out just as your foot goes straight through it with this sort of wet ripping sound.

1325
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:10,360
And the next thing you know, you're up to your waist in the floor and desperately scrabbling, holding on,

1326
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:18,200
trying to hold on to this as this wet, slippery surface as you are falling or slipping through this hole in the floor.

1327
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:24,000
From down below you, you can smell this indescribable stench.

1328
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:30,240
There are acid acrid vapors coming up, burning your eyes and this overpowering smell like

1329
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:35,080
the worst septic tank you've ever smelt down below.

1330
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,920
Oh, God.

1331
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:46,680
Help, help, help, help, help, help, oh, God, oh, God, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

1332
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:51,280
Guys, while we're still all outside, do we help him or do we just leave him here?

1333
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,400
You're a doctor.

1334
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,840
You've got to help him.

1335
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,160
I've got to get in there.

1336
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,080
I've got to get in there. Give me a boost.

1337
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,600
Give me a boost.

1338
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,600
You're a doctor, too.

1339
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,240
Not that kind of doctor.

1340
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,960
OK, so, yeah, you can push Dr.

1341
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,480
Coombes in through the window.

1342
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,880
Again, you know, if you're going to try to avoid just sliding around helplessly, I do want to DEX roll.

1343
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:14,960
Sure.

1344
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,160
I fail, fail.

1345
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,040
Push it.

1346
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,840
But I want, yeah.

1347
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:29,960
When I get up, I get a hand on something firm and my hand just slips right off.

1348
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,080
Oh, damn.

1349
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,960
And I'm kind of, I'm kind of wiggling, rolling through.

1350
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:40,640
And I'm going to try and restabilize myself by grabbing hold of the window frame and getting a better purchase on everything there.

1351
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,120
Oh, OK.

1352
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,600
And then I pass.

1353
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:44,600
Oh, good.

1354
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:51,480
Because otherwise that was going to set off a motherfucker of a chain reaction.

1355
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:08,400
But, OK, yes, you managed to grab hold of something that, yeah, from the general shape of it, you think might be a chair.

1356
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:15,520
And certainly your fingers go through a couple of things that you hope are wooden struts and not, say, ribs.

1357
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,760
But, yeah, holding on to it, you managed to get yourself onto your feet.

1358
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:32,080
You can see Freddy just about five feet away from you, just slowly slipping down this hole, his fingernails digging into this wet tissue, ripping holes in it.

1359
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,840
But it's just so slippery.

1360
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,120
He's just falling down in slow motion, inch by inch.

1361
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:45,200
I want to try and anchor myself on the nearest solid object and reach for him.

1362
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,440
It might be the frame of the window, if it's all.

1363
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,840
If he's grabbing the frame of the window, I want to grab his arm from the outside.

1364
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,360
OK, yeah, yeah, you can try to do that.

1365
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,080
How tall up is, like, the window?

1366
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:04,120
It's about three foot off the ground from within and about five foot off the ground from outside.

1367
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,440
So I'm kind of reaching up and just trying to hold onto his hand.

1368
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:19,000
OK, I think in order to give Freddy something to hold on to just because of the distance involved, the best thing you're going to be able to do is stick your leg out and hope that he can grab hold of your ankle.

1369
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,040
Freddy, Freddy, grab on, grab on.

1370
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:26,360
Then, yeah, I think Freddy can make a DEX roll here to see whether he can grab hold of Dr.

1371
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,880
Coombes' ankle, because otherwise shit is going to get real.

1372
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,960
Yes, 52 on a 65.

1373
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:49,480
OK, yeah, you just managed to grab hold of the cuff of his rather frayed trousers and your fingers have got a firm grasp and you can just you can pull yourself up, you know, using it almost like a rope.

1374
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:58,560
And there's this horrible, wet squelching sound as you're pulling yourself out of this hole and more of this hideous, hideous stench coming up.

1375
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,640
Aw, look at my pants.

1376
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,280
All right, let's let's get them both out of there, guys.

1377
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,080
Carl, help me, help me pull them out.

1378
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,720
I grab on to Thomas's waist and try to yank them out.

1379
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,880
We got to go deeper.

1380
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,080
When Freddy's close enough up onto me, I grab him up under the arms and kind of just tumble backwards out of the window with him.

1381
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,760
Yeah, yeah. I mean, between you, you can get him back out through the window.

1382
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:30,520
He is absolutely covered in just slime and bits of tissue and...

1383
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,400
Not much different from his normal appearance.

1384
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,040
Or me in seventh grade.

1385
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:43,520
Dr. Coons, I think, can make an education roll here just to piece something together.

1386
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,080
Pass, twenty four on an eighty.

1387
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,800
So that's a that's the that's a good pass.

1388
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,560
Yeah, that is what we call a good pass.

1389
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,000
Yes.

1390
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,960
It's the pass right before Easter.

1391
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:17,760
So as Freddy's picking bits of this tissue off himself and you get a better look through the light that's coming out through the window.

1392
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:30,160
Yeah, you can see there is something very much about this that reminds you of the lining of the large intestine.

1393
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,240
Fellas, I don't I don't know how to how to say this.

1394
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,640
Then maybe keep it to yourself.

1395
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,400
We got to know.

1396
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,680
This all looks it looks like it's it's it's the stuff that you use.

1397
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,600
It's it's it's intestine.

1398
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,240
It might have been trying to digest you in some way.

1399
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,440
I don't I fucking knew it.

1400
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,800
The house is alive.

1401
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,920
It's a goddamn monster house written by Dan Harmon.

1402
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,240
This is this is a lot bigger than we thought, boys.

1403
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:08,920
Is there like a groundskeeping garage or home or anything?

1404
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:14,720
Boys, here's what I think we got to do before we get back into the house is we got to put some hobnails on our boots.

1405
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:20,240
So I literally just want to find nails to run through our shoes.

1406
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,600
We're going to take our shoes off first, though, right?

1407
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:26,080
Well, yeah, you're going to take the shoes off because you don't want to drive them through your feet.

1408
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,200
Good point, Freddy.

1409
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,840
OK, OK, thank you.

1410
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,360
It's important to be clear when delineating a task.

1411
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:36,120
So, yeah, you want to take your shoes off.

1412
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,960
Step one, step two, you drive the nails through the bottom of the shoes.

1413
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,000
Step three, you got sticky shoes.

1414
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:42,880
I love it.

1415
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,360
And then I think we could walk through this house with more ease.

1416
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:51,280
What if we also become like, what would an intestine not like?

1417
01:23:51,320 --> 01:24:00,080
I could do some research on, but houses generally like to eat and then what they think is gross and then we become what is gross to them.

1418
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,480
So it does not want to eat us.

1419
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,000
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, guys.

1420
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,120
When when the body ingests something that is gross to it, it expels it.

1421
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:13,520
So I don't think we want to be vomited out forcibly by this by this house.

1422
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,640
So we want to be tasty?

1423
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,360
I think we want to be I think we want to be as as as inconspicuous as possible.

1424
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,040
Can a house be in devour?

1425
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,400
This house is one hundred percent in devour.

1426
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,960
We know it just tried to eat you.

1427
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,160
You heard it groaning and creaking as it happened.

1428
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:31,560
Come on.

1429
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,600
This is a disgusting boar house.

1430
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:46,880
Uh, Scott, the Good Friends of Jackson Elias podcast is a podcast about vore gaming in general.

1431
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,480
Is that right?

1432
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:52,280
Yeah, we wear our fetishes proud.

1433
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,640
Hungry, hungry hippos really changed your life.

1434
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:02,560
Oh, God.

1435
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:10,720
So, yeah, if you're looking for nails to hammer through your shoes, if you poke around the

1436
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:16,520
outside of the house a bit, you can find there are a couple of other outbuildings just

1437
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:21,160
around the back. In fact, really just around the corner from where you are now that have

1438
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:29,360
got all sorts of tools, a tool shed and a workshop that's obviously used for some

1439
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:29,920
maintenance.

1440
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,320
Rope?

1441
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,560
Rope. Hmm.

1442
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,920
I think this would be a good opportunity for a group luck roll.

1443
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:39,720
Well, we can't.

1444
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,240
Okay, Joe, come on.

1445
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:41,640
Roll it.

1446
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,320
Roll your luck, Joe.

1447
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,200
You got it.

1448
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,880
It's a, uh, oh, it's a eighty eight.

1449
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,440
Oh, wait, you can still crit fail.

1450
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,280
So there is some rope, but it is really badly rotted.

1451
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:04,120
Do you think that it wouldn't stand any chance of supporting one of your weights?

1452
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,240
Well, then it's a good thing there's a hose right here.

1453
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,560
Yeah, I see it, too.

1454
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,480
Yes, as long as that rubber hasn't perished, you'll be fine.

1455
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,920
But we'll save the luck roll on that one for when you're actually in trouble.

1456
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:28,400
Perfect. I was just picturing the four of us all tied together like ice, like mountain

1457
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:36,280
climbers with the hobnails in our shoes, our lifeline, which is this crackly dry hose.

1458
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:43,200
And then just like any random tools, I think, uh, would be necessary.

1459
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:43,840
Yeah.

1460
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,760
Hammers, saws, gasoline cutting implements in particular.

1461
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,520
I think it'd be handy.

1462
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,800
We could burn the house down.

1463
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,600
I'd like to see if there's a very long, a flat bladed screwdriver.

1464
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:54,320
Yeah.

1465
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,480
I mean that there are going to be screwdrivers here.

1466
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,040
I won't make you make a luck roll for that.

1467
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,840
It's a workshop, there'll be screwdrivers.

1468
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:06,680
As far as the gasoline's concerned, I mean, you do remember there were drums of diesel

1469
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,400
out by the generator.

1470
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:08,960
That's right.

1471
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,320
I actually, I mean, Dr.

1472
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:17,120
Rothstein would probably know this just through having worked with stuff like this

1473
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:17,640
before.

1474
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,680
If you're looking to set a fire, diesel is a really shit thing to use.

1475
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:23,760
Yeah.

1476
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,880
So I don't even mention it to the rest of the group.

1477
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,360
If only we had some of that sweet, sweet, leaded gasoline around.

1478
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,000
A cup a day keeps the doctor away.

1479
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:37,200
That's a joke because leaded tastes sweet and there wasn't unleaded gasoline yet.

1480
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
So, oh dude, that was fucking weird.

1481
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,240
Yes, it was.

1482
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,080
I knew Scott got it.

1483
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,160
I just saw you guys like,

1484
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:54,960
so now that you're all lashed together with perished hose and have nails through

1485
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,000
your boots, what are you doing next?

1486
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:03,920
Freddie, can you think back when you were being devoured, did you notice that was

1487
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:08,000
there any place in that house that wasn't fleshy?

1488
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,520
Was there any hardwoods anywhere?

1489
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,320
You saw what I saw.

1490
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:17,080
Just to give you some idea of what you saw just before you sort of started falling

1491
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:21,240
through the floor, there were at least three other doors or at least three doors

1492
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,360
rather in that room.

1493
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,280
There was one that was ajar.

1494
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,800
In fact, no, two of them were ajar, but two internal doors.

1495
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:36,720
One of them seemed to go deeper within the house, possibly into a corridor.

1496
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,320
And yeah, that looked almost as fleshy.

1497
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:46,480
There was another door, which you reckon was just the back door leading outside.

1498
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,640
We could just go through the back door.

1499
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,120
Yeah.

1500
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,440
I guess we could just open that door and look inside and see what we think.

1501
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:06,400
Sounds a lot less life threatening than our first approach.

1502
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:10,520
Uh, what order are we in and in our hose train?

1503
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,360
Oh God, marching order, fuck sake.

1504
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:16,400
Okay.

1505
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,400
Well, someone's going to have to go in first.

1506
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,200
It may as well be the one with foist in their name.

1507
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:24,440
That's me.

1508
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,520
I'm Frederick Mellon the foist.

1509
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:25,800
Exactly.

1510
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,560
I, uh, no objections.

1511
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,000
But right now I feel more like Frederick Mellon the moist.

1512
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:40,120
So just to be clear, you're going in through the back door.

1513
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,960
You're, you're not going around the front.

1514
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:42,360
Yeah.

1515
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:46,720
I mean, opening up the back door again, isn't that difficult.

1516
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:52,200
You do have to get the knife out and cut some of these strands of flesh away from

1517
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,240
the door frame, but the door itself isn't locked.

1518
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,640
And, you know, once again with a sort of squelching noise, you managed to pull it

1519
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:06,400
open and yeah, inside you can see what do you now reckon must be the kitchen?

1520
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,680
I mean, it's difficult to tell because, you know, every identifying bit of

1521
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:14,680
furniture or surface or whatever is covered in flesh.

1522
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,400
But as I said, there, there are two doors.

1523
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:26,360
There's a sort of side door that looks like it may go to some steps down and then

1524
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:30,960
there's another door that's going deeper into the house.

1525
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,920
Yeah, actually, I mean, I forgot to do this for Dr.

1526
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:34,640
Coombs earlier.

1527
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:39,400
Now that the rest of you are there on the doorstep within the house, dealing with,

1528
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:43,800
you know, everything, the sensory overload that this is providing.

1529
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:47,480
I do want San rolls off the rest of you, everyone except for Freddy.

1530
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:52,000
Three.

1531
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,320
I failed a 40 on a 28.

1532
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,400
I passed.

1533
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,920
So is it just Dr.

1534
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,840
Coombs who loses a D3 of San?

1535
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:06,800
A two.

1536
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:13,760
So I think what the way this evidence is an involuntary action is, as the group

1537
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,120
of you are stepping in, Dr.

1538
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:20,680
Coombs is just there hesitating on the doorstep with the frayed hose suddenly

1539
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,200
getting pulled taut and creaking a bit.

1540
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:28,040
You can see some of the cracks and getting that bit longer as he's just standing

1541
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:32,000
there digging the nails of his shoes into this flesh.

1542
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:37,000
I told you guys that I think this might be a digestive tract and you guys just want to

1543
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,600
walk in.

1544
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:41,400
Well, but it seemed like he was getting digested down there on the floor, right?

1545
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,840
This would be the upper part of the body.

1546
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,040
I mean, essentially all the body just exists to support digestion.

1547
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:51,720
So, you know, we're basically just a tube from our mouth to our asshole, but.

1548
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,760
That's what they taught us, correct?

1549
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,840
Yeah, that's, that's what, that's what any doctor would tell you.

1550
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,040
Day one in medical school.

1551
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,320
Listen, I understand you had a traumatic experience the last time you went to this

1552
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:12,320
property, but we got the nails in our shoes now.

1553
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:17,280
And I step a couple of times into the, into the floor to see if I slip.

1554
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,760
You don't see no more slipping, no more sliding.

1555
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,440
We can maybe, unfortunately, I think we're going to have to go up to that fucking

1556
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,880
creepy moist curtain and check out the light in that room.

1557
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,960
But it seems like we have the tools to do that now without getting sucked in by the

1558
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,920
floor. We got the hose.

1559
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,480
We're all holding hands.

1560
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,640
They're just like kernels of corn.

1561
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:41,880
We just go straight through, uh, unbothered.

1562
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,720
That's exactly right, doctor.

1563
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:47,960
I live my life by three rules and three rules only.

1564
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:52,960
Take chances, make mistakes, get messy.

1565
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,760
And I, I, my three rules are live, laugh, and love.

1566
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,160
And you got, it's just time to live, Dr.

1567
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:03,000
Coombs. I love you.

1568
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,000
We're going to laugh about this later.

1569
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,480
We're going to laugh about this later.

1570
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,520
So I, I, I, I, I, uh, corn.

1571
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,160
Sure. We're like, we're like corn.

1572
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,520
Yeah. We'll go on. That's the one that works for Tracer food.

1573
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,120
Yeah, of course. I like that one.

1574
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:29,240
Okay. And with that, you start heading in.

1575
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:34,240
So you're going through into, yeah, this little

1576
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:39,000
corridor that's got a door on the other side, uh, and then

1577
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
seems to go round to your left.

1578
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,040
I continue.

1579
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,040
Yeah. If you're following the corridor around on your,

1580
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,760
Oh, perfect.

1581
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,840
Zach has changed his background.

1582
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,280
Zoom background. Yeah.

1583
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,440
To the magic school bus inside the human body.

1584
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:03,040
Take chances, make mistakes, get messy.

1585
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:08,960
I, as you're following the corridor around, the walls are

1586
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:13,520
getting less flashy around here, but the carpet is still

1587
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,400
very, very moist here.

1588
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:21,080
There's still a kind of constant, as you're walking

1589
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:26,280
across it and you come across and you can see, you know, in

1590
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:29,840
the few lights that are coming around that to your left is

1591
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,600
probably the ruins of an old conservatory round to the

1592
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:39,320
right is the sort of main entrance with staircases up the

1593
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:43,200
ruins, the front door and doorways to a couple of other

1594
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,400
interior rooms.

1595
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,040
Can we do another, like gauging the sound and everything, just

1596
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,720
taking our surroundings one more time around here.

1597
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,360
So if there's anything that's changed, another word for

1598
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:52,760
deeper in.

1599
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:56,760
Yeah. In fact, if each one of you wants to give me a, I'll

1600
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,400
tell you what, I'll let you choose either a listener, a spot

1601
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,600
hidden role, they'll tell you different things.

1602
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:10,680
I'm taking a spot hidden and I failed a 35 on a 25.

1603
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:12,080
Failed.

1604
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,160
I got a nine on a spot hidden.

1605
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,640
I did a hard success on a listen.

1606
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:20,040
Okay.

1607
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,360
So you pick up two different things.

1608
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:27,960
What Thomas feels is, yeah, there is movement of the air in

1609
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:28,760
the house.

1610
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:33,360
Uh, for a moment you thought it was like a breeze coming in

1611
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:37,480
through the front door, but it's not that, that the movement

1612
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:42,200
of the air seems to change direction on a slow, regular

1613
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,040
basis.

1614
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:47,960
Like, like, um, like breath?

1615
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:48,960
Hmm.

1616
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,200
Something like that.

1617
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:59,680
What, uh, what Freddie notices with his listen role is that,

1618
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,200
yeah, it's like what you heard earlier.

1619
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:10,120
There is a sound coming from upstairs, a sort of rasping,

1620
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,520
groaning sound.

1621
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,640
I mean, it's difficult to discern because it's so low.

1622
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,800
Uh, it's almost infrasound.

1623
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,560
It's rumbling through the house.

1624
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,800
But you, you reckon it is originating upstairs.

1625
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,440
I mean, I think we got to go upstairs to that flush curtain room.

1626
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,600
If we've learned one thing, so when you enter a house and you

1627
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:33,840
hear something upstairs, you got to go up to the bedroom and

1628
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,840
kill the sleeping occupant, you got to go up to the bedroom and

1629
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:37,880
kill the sleeping occupant.

1630
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:38,480
Yes, exactly.

1631
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,440
That's what tonight is tonight.

1632
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:47,720
Do we, do we feel like that worked at will for us last time?

1633
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:51,040
Is that, is that the, I thought this is, we're standing on there.

1634
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:51,600
Okay, gotcha.

1635
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,800
He's dead, isn't he?

1636
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:57,960
Is this something like, uh, is this a saying that there is or, um, yeah.

1637
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:58,760
Yeah.

1638
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,240
Ah, I've not heard that one.

1639
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,560
You're not from around here.

1640
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,320
Don't worry about it.

1641
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,320
Yes, I agree.

1642
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:08,440
It's just like, what they say, kill the sleeping.

1643
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:16,880
Okay.

1644
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:17,800
Oh, okay.

1645
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:22,840
Well, with, with, uh, with a song in your heart and murder on your mind,

1646
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,840
you make your way up the stairs.

1647
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:30,960
We got this guys.

1648
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:33,880
Yeah.

1649
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:34,720
Is your fiddle wet?

1650
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:37,880
Yeah.

1651
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,880
Can I give us Bardic inspiration?

1652
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:48,520
Well, again, the carpet, the stairs going up is, is moist.

1653
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,200
Uh, and when you get up to the landing, there are a few doors.

1654
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:58,600
I mean, there's, you've got short corridors going off on other side, but you're fairly

1655
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:03,720
certain, you know, off the back of the rolls you made earlier, that the main movement of

1656
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:07,640
the air is coming through the double doors of what you assume is the master bedroom

1657
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,720
directly in front of you.

1658
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:09,440
All right.

1659
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:16,160
On the backs of the rolls that we had earlier, I'm fairly certain that the air is

1660
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:20,840
pushing in and out through these double doors, which is likely the master bedroom.

1661
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,480
This is my whisper.

1662
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,760
So we're all keeping our voices down.

1663
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,400
We're going to all go in two by two, right?

1664
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:30,120
Double doors.

1665
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,320
It can fit two by two.

1666
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,400
So I say we push in double doors wide open.

1667
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,320
We can all, we can all just rest for that.

1668
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:43,560
It's two doors, wide open, two doors, four men, one rush, doors down.

1669
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,800
What would Neil put do is what I'm trying to say.

1670
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,360
Die.

1671
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,200
He was sleeping.

1672
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,080
All right.

1673
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:57,200
So we'll let's, um, let's rush in there.

1674
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:57,760
Okay.

1675
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:58,960
You rush in.

1676
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:03,800
There is a single flickering light in the ceiling here.

1677
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:11,520
It's not giving off much light and yeah, it keeps cutting out.

1678
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:16,120
Obviously the moisture has got into the works and it's just flickering on and off.

1679
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:25,640
But you can make out that there, again, the walls here are disturbingly fleshy.

1680
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:28,120
It's not the same color.

1681
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:33,160
It doesn't look like the same kind of tissue as you saw downstairs.

1682
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,920
It's, it's something different.

1683
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,360
It's pulsating.

1684
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:48,000
There is on the far wall, this, well, I guess the only word for it is orifice, this

1685
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:53,960
pulsating hole in the wall, this large hole, and you can see something

1686
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:56,840
worm-like moving around inside it.

1687
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:58,480
How big?

1688
01:39:58,640 --> 01:39:59,480
Huge.

1689
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,840
I mean, like larger than any one of you.

1690
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:06,560
Does it look like it's sticking out like a tongue or it's not sticking out

1691
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:11,800
entirely, but yeah, now that your mind has made the connection with the

1692
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:15,240
tongue, that is absolutely a tongue.

1693
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,040
You see what I'm saying, boys?

1694
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,120
Mouth to asshole.

1695
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:19,600
That's all we are.

1696
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,280
That's all this monster house is.

1697
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:26,600
And I think, I think that is a good chance for another sand roll here,

1698
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:33,520
particularly here at that point, you can hear this rumbling sound

1699
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,440
coming out of the hole.

1700
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,880
I got an 88.

1701
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,320
I got a 94.

1702
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:48,280
The rumbling sound coming out of the hole seems to be saying Rothstein.

1703
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,800
Oh shit.

1704
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,480
I'm fucking sorry, Carl.

1705
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,440
Are you acquainted with this goddamn monster house?

1706
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,320
Did anyone pass their sand roll?

1707
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:03,240
Okay.

1708
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,440
So each one of you loses a D6 of sand.

1709
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,320
Oh my God.

1710
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,920
I rolled a big old sixers.

1711
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:14,480
I got a six as well.

1712
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,360
I got a four.

1713
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,480
And what about Freddie?

1714
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:19,480
Oh, I passed.

1715
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,880
I got a 19 on my sand check.

1716
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:21,640
Oh, you passed.

1717
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,880
So, so, so you still lose one.

1718
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,360
Okay.

1719
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:24,840
Okay.

1720
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,280
For the two of you who lost six.

1721
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,120
Can I have intelligence rolls please?

1722
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:31,560
I failed that one.

1723
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:33,440
Also a 65 on a 60.

1724
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,360
I passed 37 on a 70.

1725
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:35,760
Dr.

1726
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,560
Coombes failed, so you failed your intelligence roll.

1727
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:40,200
That's good.

1728
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,720
You're not having a bad and madness.

1729
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:42,800
Dr.

1730
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,080
Rothstein on the other hand is, I think, you know, that makes sense.

1731
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:47,960
Total sense.

1732
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:48,920
I heard your name.

1733
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,400
I think at that point, Dr.

1734
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:57,920
Rothstein in blind panic runs, just runs out of the room.

1735
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:04,360
Suddenly that rope that you've got is, well, rather the hose is stretched taut.

1736
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:09,000
And well, we've already established you're not going to pass a group luck roll here.

1737
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,080
So that's the point at which it just snaps.

1738
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:15,760
This frayed rubber just, just snaps completely.

1739
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:22,960
And the rest of you, as you stumble and fall as this jerks, just lose Rothstein

1740
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,280
as he runs off somewhere within the house.

1741
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,400
You don't see where he's gone.

1742
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:38,000
From a role-playing perspective, we would definitely want to go after him.

1743
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:43,200
But from a game, gamey perspective where we are trapped inside this

1744
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,880
monster house that wants to eat us.

1745
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,480
Uh, I don't know.

1746
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:52,240
Yeah.

1747
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,200
What's the answer there?

1748
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:53,920
Cause I don't know.

1749
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:57,480
Well, I don't want to say what I'm nevermind.

1750
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,200
Fuck him.

1751
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:01,200
I don't want to give Luke or the DM any ideas.

1752
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,840
So I'm not going to continue my sentence.

1753
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:05,720
Holy shit.

1754
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,080
We got to get them boys.

1755
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:15,560
Coombs, I think is, is distracted through all this by the fact that the mouth,

1756
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,680
the wall tongue mouth has just spoken.

1757
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:24,760
And he's going to kind of look wide-eyed at it and say, you, you can, you can, you

1758
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,280
can talk, you can talk.

1759
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:37,600
And the voice again, just that it takes a deep breath in that just moves all the

1760
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:42,960
air suddenly quite fast through the room around you enough to ruffle your hair.

1761
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,640
This time, it just says a bit louder.

1762
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:54,560
Rothstein, help me.

1763
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,560
How, how can, how can Rothstein help you?

1764
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:00,800
We got it.

1765
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,000
We got to get Carl back in here.

1766
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,400
He, he could help.

1767
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:06,840
It sounds like, well, I think you're doing a great job right now talking to the,

1768
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,360
you know, whole house.

1769
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:14,080
So like, uh, that's definitely, uh, Austin Hawks, right?

1770
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,760
Like Sedgwick turned Hawks into a fucking house.

1771
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:21,200
So let's, uh, keep talking to them, I guess.

1772
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,480
And let's get some answers.

1773
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,920
Are you, did you hear that house house mouth?

1774
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,240
That's are you, are you Austin?

1775
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:31,680
I'm less worried about if you're Austin Hawks and I'm more worried

1776
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:32,960
about how we can help you.

1777
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:33,840
That too.

1778
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:34,120
Yep.

1779
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:36,160
I'd like to know the answer to both, please.

1780
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,720
But you're talking so slow.

1781
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,800
I think we don't have time.

1782
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,160
Maybe.

1783
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:42,640
And again, it's after another deep breath.

1784
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:51,000
It just goes Rothstein and this time the walls shake.

1785
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:51,800
All right.

1786
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:52,040
All right.

1787
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:52,360
We'll get them.

1788
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:52,720
We'll get them.

1789
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:53,080
We'll get them.

1790
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:53,400
Hang on.

1791
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:53,760
Hang on.

1792
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:55,840
Carl.

1793
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:59,000
Okay.

1794
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:02,640
Uh, can I have a luck roll for Dr.

1795
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,680
Rothstein please?

1796
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,160
A 94.

1797
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,040
So I fail.

1798
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:09,680
Okay.

1799
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:17,920
So yeah, you basically at this stage, obviously just running off the memory

1800
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:25,600
you had run back out through the way you came back in, but in your panic, you have

1801
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,080
clearly forgotten about that hole in the floor.

1802
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,240
Oh no.

1803
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,280
Yes.

1804
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,920
So you sort of come out of your, your fugue state.

1805
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:39,040
Yeah.

1806
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:45,040
As, as your foot just goes down through this hole and you're off balance, you've

1807
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:51,320
gone down, you slammed your face down into this pulsating, warm flesh at the floor.

1808
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:57,040
And again, you're in a very similar situation that Freddie was earlier of

1809
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,800
just beginning to slip down this hole.

1810
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:08,840
Down below, you can hear this, as well as this horrible smell, you can hear just

1811
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:14,520
this dripping liquid and the sound of liquid moving around and you can give me

1812
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:18,600
a listen roll as well, just to see whether you can pick up something else.

1813
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:21,720
Fail.

1814
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,160
33 on a 20.

1815
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,480
No, you can, you can hear, you can hear it.

1816
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,360
Like I say, liquid moving around.

1817
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:29,760
Spend your luck.

1818
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,720
Uh, not yet.

1819
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:32,960
I'm not going to spend my luck yet.

1820
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:36,320
Yeah.

1821
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:39,280
Don't spend your luck while you're being eaten alive by the house.

1822
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,840
Not for a listen roll.

1823
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:48,680
On the other hand, I mean, you can hear that there is something else down there.

1824
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:52,080
I mean, yeah, maybe if you just let yourself slide down a bit further, you

1825
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:57,960
could push the roll and get a better listen.

1826
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:58,320
Yep.

1827
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,800
No, a 35 on a 20 this time.

1828
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,360
Oh, okay.

1829
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,880
Oh my God, you idiot.

1830
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,640
I love you.

1831
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:11,240
This makes me so happy.

1832
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:17,240
So in the process of doing that, there is suddenly, I mean, you put your head

1833
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:23,160
underneath and yeah, you do actually at that point hear what it is that you were

1834
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:29,000
struggling to, which is just the sound of someone crying.

1835
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:36,040
It sounds like a little girl crying somewhere inside, somewhere down below.

1836
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:42,040
And, and yeah, I mean, as you strain your head down just to get a better, a better

1837
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:47,800
lock on where she is, that's the point at which just the remaining bit of the floor

1838
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:52,040
holding you up collapses and you fall down into darkness.

1839
01:47:52,320 --> 01:48:01,400
Yeah, this is a real Hannah Montana moment for me because I really wanted to know

1840
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:04,640
what was down there, but I really didn't want Frederick Millen the first to fall

1841
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:09,000
down there and I really got the best of both worlds out of this.

1842
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:14,200
I, the whole time I'm like, I don't, I'm not familiar with Hannah Montana enough

1843
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:19,680
to, I was like, you really brought it together at the end there.

1844
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:24,440
And really at the, uh, with a story like this, it's not about, uh, how fast you get

1845
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:27,840
there or what's waiting on the other side, but it's the climb.

1846
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,240
I think this house needs a wrecking ball.

1847
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:39,960
A party in the USA.

1848
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:49,880
