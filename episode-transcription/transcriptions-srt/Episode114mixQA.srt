1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Salutations, my fellow interdimensional friends.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,760
It's your time and space traveling trash sommelier,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,240
Wolf the dog.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,240
And I'm live from somewhere, some time,

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,400
but probably still from 694.2, maybe?

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,720
Listen, I don't know where the fuck I am right now.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,400
It's somehow both dark and bright

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,520
and there is everything and nothing all at once.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,960
There's also a possum wearing a cowboy hat.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,680
His name is Jeremy.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,180
Uh, anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,200
is from Newman's Necromorium Funeral Home.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,680
Who got Wolf here reading an ad copy

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,780
all because they tweeted about the show

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,280
and tagged at Pretending Pod,

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,840
a smart business decision in this cutthroat business

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,080
of dead folk parlors?

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,440
They right.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,080
Ever wondered what to do with your dead friends and family?

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,160
Here at Newman's Necromorium Funeral Home,

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,320
we take the wonder out of death.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,240
For an astronomical and non-negotiable

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,840
price of our choosing,

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,040
you won't have to worry about the finer details.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,280
Still not sure?

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,520
Meet Stu.

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,960
Stu says, the dead make great listeners.

28
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,180
Except Lewis.

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,960
That guy keeps screaming that he just wants to go home

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,960
and there's been a terrible mistake.

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,840
Classic Lewis, now that you sold on the idea,

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,640
let us handle you dead.

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,680
We'll even wear gloves.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Well damn, thanks Newman.

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,080
I would advise you to not listen

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,480
to the screams of Classic Lewis.

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Every Lewis I've ever known has been a lie and a cheat.

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,280
This one is probably no exception.

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,540
And every Lewis is also a rat bastard.

40
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,000
But especially a Lewis named Classic Lewis.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,280
Remember, if you want to write up something

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,240
for your wolf to howl, tag at Pretending Pod

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,960
on Twitter or Instagram.

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,760
Or write up a five star review on the Apple Podcasts.

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,280
Huge shout out to a concerned observer,

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,000
Lobster Memories and Huge Earn for writing reviews.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,780
It makes this interdimensional traveling little wolfie

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,560
so gosh darn happy.

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,480
And if you want to meet other listeners,

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,680
AKA super rad weirdos like yourself,

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,400
check out the link to Discord

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,520
and the subreddit in the show notes.

53
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,480
Our community isn't big enough yet to be toxic

54
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,580
and it's a real good time to hang out.

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,940
Honestly, I'm just there for the memes and pet pics.

56
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,960
But there's a good amount of role play chat as well.

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,600
Or maybe you want to put together a one shot

58
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,800
with a group of other listeners.

59
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,160
Bubble gum tree my babies.

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,120
The links, as always, are in the damn show notes.

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,080
And not to be weird about it,

62
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,960
but if you've listened to the entire first season

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,200
of Pretending to be People

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,400
and you've been considering joining the Patreon

65
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,760
but you've never done it,

66
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,200
the link to the Patreon's in the show notes.

67
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,120
It's worth it.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,740
And apologies to the PTBP crew

69
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,220
for letting you in on this little secret.

70
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,840
But you can actually sign up for like five bucks.

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,720
Then listen to all the bonus episodes in a matter of days.

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,920
Then delete your pledge.

73
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,060
They can't stop you.

74
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,280
Is it cooler to just let it ride

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,940
and support the creative dreams of some small town weirdos

76
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,860
that you really like to listen to?

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,360
No, it's obviously cooler to rip these dumb idiots off.

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,460
But you do whatever feels right.

79
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,600
I heard they just finished up another arc

80
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,560
of a 13 episode long mostly homebrew campaign.

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
And the 26th episode is a session zero

82
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,120
for the upcoming run of Control Copy,

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,220
a Delta Green scenario by Dennis Detwiller

84
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,220
chosen by a poll over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.

85
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,440
The link's in the show notes as I have mentioned many times

86
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,600
but you can probably remember it.

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,760
It's just patreon.com slash pretending pod.

88
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,240
Sign up for the Circle of Knowledge shirt club

89
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,520
before Halloween and you can receive an exclusive shirt

90
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,600
a whole month sooner.

91
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,320
And check out the YouTube channel.

92
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,440
The composer, some freak named Justin,

93
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,800
continues to slowly upload tracks from the show

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,800
onto the ultimate TTRPG playlist.

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,880
Guess what that damn link is, you freaks?

96
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,940
Also in the show notes, you can find a link

97
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,480
to a music video for this hot new track.

98
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,600
It's Kudzu with no backbone.

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,760
So.

100
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
It's Q&A time.

101
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,240
It's Q&A time.

102
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,080
Hell yeah.

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,920
Whoa.

104
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,560
The season is done.

105
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,040
The season is over

106
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,400
and it's time to answer questions about the season.

107
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,820
Now we get to find out what happened.

108
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,420
Yeah, in some ways,

109
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,840
I like to think that most of the questions

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,840
as far as what actually happened have been answered.

111
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,120
Although, I understand

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,260
that that's not the case

113
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,620
and that's okay.

114
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,460
Dude, today a coworker of mine asked me for my phone number

115
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,180
so that they could send me a playlist.

116
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,380
And what are the seven,

117
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,100
not 10 numbers that you told me?

118
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,820
No, I won't be saying that.

119
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
He sent me this playlist.

120
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,780
Oh, hell yes.

121
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,180
And it had,

122
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,580
what's the band that sings Radioactive?

123
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,420
Oh, is that Imagine Dragons?

124
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,820
Imagine Dragon Deez Nuts Across Your Face.

125
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,660
Oh, no.

126
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,100
I kept wanting to tell it,

127
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,080
but I was like, wait until we're recording.

128
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,980
We've been hanging out for a while

129
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,940
and I'm not sure I've ever been more proud of you

130
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,020
that you held onto that.

131
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,700
I feel like I got hit by a train.

132
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,500
I did get,

133
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,980
I got Joe with a-

134
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,460
He got me before we started recording

135
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,820
with such a genuine one.

136
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,660
I was like-

137
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,520
It was really good and I was like,

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,340
oh, you should have saved it for the pod.

139
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,180
I didn't even see that coming.

140
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
I had another one.

141
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,540
I straight up don't,

142
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,900
I don't know if I was in here,

143
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,740
if I wasn't listening.

144
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,580
You were not.

145
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,480
But it was a,

146
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
dude,

147
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,160
I just like,

148
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,260
it was like both of us looking at our phones.

149
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,100
I was like,

150
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,900
dude, did you see that thing about the article

151
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,380
about Cho Ken today?

152
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,460
And I went,

153
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,300
Cho Ken?

154
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,140
Oh my God.

155
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,380
Yeah, Cho Ken on Deez Nuts.

156
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,220
Jesus.

157
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,780
I was so genuinely,

158
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,140
I have not heard about this.

159
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,980
Please tell me.

160
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,820
You're like, who's Cho Ken?

161
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,420
My

162
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,260
God.

163
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,740
Anyway,

164
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,940
that was good.

165
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,880
Yeah.

166
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,720
Proud of you.

167
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,540
I think that's enough.

168
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,780
We have enough questions for that to be

169
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,380
our jumping off point.

170
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,740
So let's dive into these.

171
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,980
I'm gonna go ahead and start

172
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,740
with a question here from me.

173
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,420
I'm Zach and I have a question.

174
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,820
We asked for questions,

175
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,980
comments or compliments on Twitter and Reddit and

176
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,820
Zach felt he didn't get enough compliments.

177
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,660
So.

178
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,960
So I'm gonna start this thing off

179
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,280
by complimenting myself.

180
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,360
Zach,

181
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,040
I don't say this a lot,

182
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,880
but

183
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,460
you actually finished a thing.

184
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,300
Good job, man.

185
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,120
That's huge, dude.

186
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
Yeah.

187
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,660
All right.

188
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,500
That was genuine.

189
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
And I didn't expect to

190
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,600
negate my horrible self-talk to myself,

191
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,540
but here we are.

192
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,500
And so I do have a compliment right off the bat

193
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,460
for the three of you,

194
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,580
each of you.

195
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,400
Joe,

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,820
I'll start with you as it's-

197
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,740
Oh, literally individually.

198
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,220
Do you also have one for the group?

199
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,780
I literally didn't plan this at all.

200
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,460
I am not looking at anything.

201
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,840
I didn't have these planned,

202
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,260
but I have a compliment for each of you.

203
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,100
Joe,

204
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,620
having you as a player makes my job

205
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,660
as a GM more fun.

206
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,500
Dope, dude.

207
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,860
Legitimately watching your reactions

208
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,640
to things that happen

209
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,380
and how stoked you get

210
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,860
and how into the story you are at all times

211
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
makes me,

212
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,380
oh, I was gonna say horny,

213
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,900
but I'm being genuine.

214
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,420
No, you can say it.

215
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,340
That's so nice, dude.

216
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,500
At first, I thought it was just

217
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,960
a veiled jab at Luke and I.

218
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,900
But no, it makes it more fun as a player at the table.

219
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,180
Yeah, it totally does.

220
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,500
So moving on from the compliments.

221
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,360
End of praise.

222
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,500
No, moving on to Luke.

223
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,220
Luke, you are without a doubt

224
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,680
the most fun and spontaneous person

225
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,500
I've ever like hung out with even.

226
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,380
You are extremely enjoyable to be around

227
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,220
due to your ability to take any situation

228
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,300
and find the levity in it.

229
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,100
I appreciate that so much.

230
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,420
And I specifically within the realm of role-playing,

231
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,580
anytime that I feel you grab the reins out of my hands,

232
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,260
I'm nothing but overjoyed.

233
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,500
Hell yeah.

234
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,320
Thank you.

235
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,460
And back to the questions.

236
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,620
I can't do the same joke again.

237
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,140
And Tom.

238
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,980
You could.

239
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,160
I thought, I almost thought you were just gonna go

240
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,580
into the question, so I was like, I was fine with it.

241
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,820
Thank you.

242
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,820
Thomas, you make jokes that are literally standing

243
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,740
on the precipice of like in and out of game

244
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,460
in a way that, in my opinion,

245
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,180
speaks to the soul of like how we role-play.

246
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,060
Your ability to constantly have one hand in hot water

247
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,760
and one hand in cold water is like absolutely excellent.

248
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,080
Also, I respect you and any opinion that you bring

249
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,900
to the table, regardless of how opposite

250
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,500
of what I've just said is.

251
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,020
Basically, you.

252
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,020
You are one of the only people whose opinion I trust.

253
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,580
Thank you.

254
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,580
Also, the earliest stuff about me being the voice

255
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,900
of a role-playing generation, I wonder if you said yes.

256
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,040
Agreed.

257
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,540
Legitimately though, I have a hard time taking

258
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,260
anyone else's opinion.

259
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,540
I'm very controlling.

260
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,540
I think we all know this and I respect that a lot of you

261
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,740
and I think you're a great dude.

262
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,580
Thanks, bro.

263
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,460
Same, please.

264
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,820
I love you guys so much

265
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,340
and you have changed my life for the better.

266
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,180
Same.

267
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,420
Back at you, man.

268
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,620
I like you so much.

269
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,300
I like barely, I barely remember a time with you.

270
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,940
I love so much about you.

271
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,300
I like don't remember a time in my life

272
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,980
not playing this, even though it's only been.

273
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,060
Yeah, I've blacked out all memories of life.

274
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,900
Even though it's been more.

275
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,980
Yeah, we've been doing it for like 10 years.

276
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,700
No, I love you too.

277
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,540
We love you too.

278
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,360
Fuck all that.

279
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,200
Shut up.

280
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
All right, we've got a question from.

281
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,860
Oh, wait, no, no.

282
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,700
You said you had a question for us.

283
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,620
We have to jerk each other off real quick.

284
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,460
To finish.

285
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,900
All right, so the question that I have is actually

286
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,620
a question that I will ask at the top of the next episode,

287
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,800
the next Q&A episode.

288
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,060
I have a personal question for you guys.

289
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,540
It's a teaser for next week.

290
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,080
We could say you can expect to hear Justin

291
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,260
on that next episode.

292
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,900
That's right, that's right.

293
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,180
Justin will be here for next week's Q&A.

294
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,780
Check back in at 8.30.

295
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,260
Justin's busy right now.

296
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,540
All right, let's dive in here.

297
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,860
We've got a question from.

298
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,180
It was all a snow globe.

299
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,100
They say, I hope it's okay to ask a few.

300
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,940
It is.

301
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,580
That was a classic reference to that one show.

302
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,420
I was gonna say, do you millennials get that reference?

303
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,220
Yeah, it's the thing where Chris O'Dowd

304
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,220
dropped the snow globe in Travel Man.

305
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,180
Okay.

306
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,620
It's Saint something, right?

307
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,520
Oh, okay.

308
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,420
Saint Elmo.

309
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,660
It's a spoiler no matter what.

310
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,340
Once I'm a very drunk mom.

311
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,540
Be careful.

312
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,220
Oh yeah, just in case anybody's trying to watch

313
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,060
Men in Black.

314
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,620
That hospital show or whatever.

315
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,700
They were in a marble and the marble had fake snow in it.

316
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,100
Was it Saint Elsewhere?

317
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Saint Elsewhere, yeah.

318
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,260
Okay, so real quick.

319
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,780
Once I'm a very drunk mom in a bar in Colorado.

320
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,580
It could be so much quicker.

321
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,300
Once I'm a very drunk mom in a bar in Colorado

322
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,940
asked me how old I was and I was like 29 at the time

323
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,620
and I said 29 and she goes,

324
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,220
oh, you're just like my son.

325
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,700
You're a millennium.

326
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,380
You're a millennium.

327
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,860
I am.

328
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,700
I'm a millennium.

329
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,540
That's really good.

330
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,380
Yeah.

331
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,220
Okay, that's perfect.

332
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,540
They asked, it was all snow globe, asks,

333
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,500
who was the person in the woods in episode six?

334
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,940
Charles Donovan.

335
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,780
Okay.

336
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,420
I should have asked who you thought it was

337
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,740
but that would just belabor the whole part.

338
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,580
Moving on.

339
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,400
I would say, oh.

340
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,240
Next question.

341
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,040
Who is the ambiguously British man

342
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,120
in the circle of white powder?

343
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,360
I believe they are talking about the person

344
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,480
that Lindsay's character talks to

345
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,000
in the contention woods arc.

346
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,200
That was an agent of Pisces.

347
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Delta Green has a British wing of its existence

348
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,920
and they are called Pisces.

349
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,460
And I believe that man had a tattoo somewhere

350
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,220
and I believe, I did not look this up,

351
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,460
but I think that I made that tattoo a reference

352
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,800
to the fact that he was in Pisces.

353
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
It might've even been a fish.

354
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,220
Like it straight up might've been a fish tattoo.

355
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,060
So, okay.

356
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,880
So if any of us had run into him,

357
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,340
we would have known right away.

358
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,780
Yes.

359
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,700
Next question.

360
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,540
Fish, Pisces.

361
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,220
So that's deep lore for somebody

362
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,460
who knows Delta Green lore.

363
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,700
Oh, that's some real deep lore.

364
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,600
That wasn't for us.

365
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,820
No.

366
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,660
Zach, yeah.

367
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,860
Speaking of like your own deep lore,

368
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,260
I totally thought you were like,

369
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,580
oh yeah, that was Pisces.

370
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,660
They were competing against Myriad.

371
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,140
You never really ran into them,

372
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,420
but they were there the whole time.

373
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,860
You guys literally never ran into anyone from Pisces.

374
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,300
My cool fish men brigade.

375
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,540
Actual company behind, was it Bar Corp?

376
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,220
Bar Corp owned by Pisces.

377
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,040
No.

378
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,880
So next question.

379
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,320
What does Joe smell like?

380
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,480
What flavor vape do you have?

381
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,320
Yeah.

382
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,520
I got some strawberry milk tonight.

383
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,660
Oh, that is an answer.

384
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,500
All right.

385
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,640
That's pretty much what he smells like just in general.

386
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,240
I've known him since middle school.

387
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,360
Joe, middle school.

388
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,280
You've got the option.

389
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,640
Chocolate, vanilla.

390
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,960
Is it called vanilla milk?

391
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,160
Regular.

392
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,040
2%.

393
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,400
Chocolate, milk, or strawberry?

394
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,240
Strawberry.

395
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,060
Oh, all right.

396
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,160
And moving on, what was the asylum all about?

397
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,240
Specifically the Satan plot line

398
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,200
that apparently got dropped.

399
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Yeah, because I did mention at one point

400
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,080
that the Satan, somebody asked about it mid-game.

401
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,680
And I was like, yeah, like as an NPC,

402
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,600
I think I said, you guys didn't look into that very much,

403
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
so we didn't worry about it.

404
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,000
I thought that you guys were gonna try to follow

405
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,320
the agents, the dead president's cell,

406
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,640
Kennedy, McKinley, and Harrison

407
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,440
back to wherever they came from,

408
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,120
or at least try to hitch more of a ride on what they had.

409
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,440
But as we were role-playing,

410
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,460
it just felt right to kind of leave you out in the cold.

411
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,260
I could use that sentence for all role-playing.

412
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,200
Yeah, that's your go-to instinct as a GM.

413
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,680
And I'm trying to get better at it, all right?

414
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,200
We're all growing.

415
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,280
That's one thing that I'm gonna work on.

416
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,280
No, it's fun and it leads to, I don't know.

417
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,000
But if we do wanna not go 113 episodes again.

418
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,320
Yeah, exactly.

419
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
We go to the mill.

420
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,020
So what was the asylum all about?

421
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,100
So basically there's a woman there named,

422
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,060
code name Satan, not actually birth name Satan.

423
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,280
And she was in charge of running these different teams

424
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,920
of essentially what Delta Green Lore would call cowboys.

425
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,440
So your A through Z cells.

426
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,000
But I decided instead of the modern day

427
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,320
using A through Z cells,

428
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,520
they would have gotten rid of it by then

429
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,440
and come up with some fun alternatives.

430
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,840
So I thought dead presidents was a fun combo of things.

431
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,720
So I went with that.

432
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,500
But that is also where K cell was run out of,

433
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,880
because they originally started with the alphabet cells

434
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,740
as cowboys, essentially fighting against

435
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,400
the unnatural threat to the world,

436
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,580
not with government oversight.

437
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,020
And so that is what the asylum is specifically all about.

438
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,620
The woman who runs it, she's a black and white character.

439
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,900
She's got a lot going on.

440
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,520
She lives in the middle.

441
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,620
Yeah, I don't know.

442
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,060
Everyone's got like a middling agenda.

443
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,940
In Delta Green, from what I can tell,

444
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,160
there aren't a lot of like specifically good

445
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,820
or specifically bad people.

446
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,940
Some people get turned bad by circumstance,

447
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,500
but everyone's kind of like trying to do their best

448
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,300
with the hand they've been dealt.

449
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,180
I don't know.

450
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,760
So that's what was happening at the asylum.

451
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,540
If somebody else asks a question about it later,

452
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,620
which I bet they do, I might add to that.

453
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,320
And that part of Delta Green,

454
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,400
it just really stresses me out when we're playing it,

455
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,160
because it's not like real life where you know right away,

456
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,460
like, oh, do they believe in Jesus?

457
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,300
They're good or bad.

458
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,420
You can just know, and all the uncertainty

459
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,820
and like the grayness, it gives me a headache.

460
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,660
Yeah.

461
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,900
No, thank you.

462
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,740
Yeah.

463
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,740
Hey, why don't you just ask the NPCs if they believe in Jesus?

464
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,900
Are you a good person or a bad person?

465
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,380
So they finish it out.

466
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,140
Snow Globe finishes it out by saying,

467
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,860
thank you all for everything.

468
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,300
This is by far my favorite podcast,

469
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,620
which is just a very nice thing.

470
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,860
Thanks, us too.

471
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,820
It's a nice thing to say.

472
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,560
It is ours as well.

473
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,580
Ain't on a no, no, no.

474
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,420
Is that how you say it?

475
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,260
Ain't on a no, no, no.

476
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,060
Ain't on a no, no, no.

477
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,420
Which is No Way Hang On.

478
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,500
That's one of our beautiful mods

479
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,580
over on the subreddit and the discord.

480
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,620
We've got a question.

481
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,900
What's y'all's favorite karaoke jam?

482
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,340
Soak Up The Sun by Shirl Crow.

483
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,300
That's good.

484
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,780
Soak Up The Sun is real good.

485
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,860
I just do Beatles songs,

486
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,140
cause I know the words already.

487
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,980
Yep.

488
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,460
And what are Beatles songs?

489
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,500
It's this band that I've been into lately.

490
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,460
They're kind of coming up.

491
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,840
And Thomas, do you do karaoke?

492
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,040
I actually never have.

493
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,880
Really?

494
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,700
Really.

495
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,100
Wait, when we did karaoke at my house, did you not sing?

496
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,060
Oh, I probably did.

497
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,700
But like drunk, living room karaoke.

498
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,220
I've never been in a bar full of people,

499
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,780
like strangers, selected a song and sang that song.

500
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,700
Yeah.

501
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,940
Thomas, you were actually there though

502
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,780
for my birthday a couple of years ago.

503
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,820
After the ball game.

504
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,180
Yeah, you got me tickets to a Cardinals game

505
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,020
for my birthday.

506
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,980
That was a surprise, which was fucking rad.

507
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,320
We went and hung out and watched a day game in St. Louis

508
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,380
that I didn't know was happening.

509
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,320
Yeah, I got you those tickets,

510
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,220
not your wife and my partner.

511
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,060
You know what?

512
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,060
It actually makes more sense

513
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,660
that it was my wife who got me those tickets.

514
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,020
And then after the ball game, we like-

515
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,560
There's a chance I totally pitched in.

516
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,400
I don't know.

517
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,220
Yeah, I don't know, man.

518
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,060
Who knows?

519
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,900
But I would bet.

520
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,440
I was just willing to give you full credit here

521
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,460
on the recording.

522
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,820
Oh yeah, just like if either of the other people

523
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,260
involved heard that, they would probably be like, what?

524
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,860
Oh, they're not listening.

525
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,060
They're not listening to this?

526
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,900
That's fair.

527
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,000
And so I sing my go-to karaoke jam,

528
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,500
which we have posted a video of me singing

529
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,180
on Instagram and Twitter.

530
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,020
You can find it there.

531
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,860
And that is me singing-

532
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,180
Oh baby, baby.

533
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,380
How was I supposed to know?

534
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,700
My go-to is Hit Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears,

535
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,220
specifically because it is just out of my range.

536
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,780
Zach, I was actually going through my Instagram

537
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,220
story archives the other day and came across those videos.

538
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,700
And do you remember the guy who sung After You?

539
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,060
No, I was on a high.

540
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,780
He was very red and drunk.

541
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,740
Oh yeah, classic.

542
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,580
Like karaoke.

543
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,020
The Cardinals colors.

544
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,060
Well, that's Neil.

545
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,060
Looked like yellow teeth, red face.

546
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,180
It looked like most of the guys at a Cardinals game,

547
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,820
like meaning like late forties, a polo.

548
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,980
And they love the polos.

549
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,140
He was shit-faced, but passionate.

550
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,140
And he was singing Closing Time at like 3 p.m. I bet.

551
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,680
I love that song.

552
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,940
Compliment from ainonanonono.

553
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,900
Nice cock, bro.

554
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,740
Thank you.

555
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,560
Thanks.

556
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,400
Wouldn't you like to know?

557
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,840
All right, and a question from ainonanonono.

558
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,760
I remember Zach delivering some well-deserved praise

559
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,640
to Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency,

560
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,420
which shares some fun elements with season one of PTBP.

561
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,000
What other foundational media or artists

562
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,420
have influenced y'all in this season

563
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,620
as handler and players?

564
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,080
Anyone have an inspiration to you as a player

565
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,200
or just to give you like a head space

566
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,040
of what this game we're playing was?

567
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,920
I just do whatever I want.

568
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,280
Yeah, there, yeah, yeah.

569
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,840
The most truthful answer.

570
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,320
Yeah, Wild West Arc was all Deadwood in my brain.

571
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,160
Yeah.

572
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,000
Deadwood was what I would reference in my brain.

573
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,840
Mine was Red Dead Redemption.

574
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,580
In general, just all police media.

575
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,480
Yeah, like that pop culture is inundated with

576
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,800
so just lots of cop stereotypes

577
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,000
and then the actual place we live for.

578
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,600
Yeah, for sure.

579
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,000
The actual place we live and like going hiking

580
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,880
or just visiting other small towns around

581
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,360
and getting a feel for what life is like in a smaller town.

582
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,480
I actually drove through Mountain Grove.

583
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,600
I mean, literally just passed it.

584
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,840
You literally drove through.

585
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,680
I literally drove through.

586
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,440
You're the one who drove through Mountain Grove.

587
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,280
I drove through.

588
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,920
You drove through the downtown just like

589
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Mountain Grove.

590
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,240
Blues Brothers style like that mall.

591
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Hung out for a little bit, just drove around.

592
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,180
That's the small town that I stole the map from

593
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,760
for contention.

594
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,580
Oh, nice.

595
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,520
Oh, really?

596
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,800
I stole the map from Mountain Grove, Missouri.

597
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,600
The layout of the roads and things.

598
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,640
Yeah, I did.

599
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,360
I dated someone and grew up there

600
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,360
and when I was like 19 and we drove out there a few times

601
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,320
to hang out with her parents.

602
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,240
And it was, it's very small.

603
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,080
It's really small, yeah.

604
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,400
You've been to contention then.

605
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,720
Yeah, you've been to contention.

606
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,920
All right, yeah, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency

607
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,760
and like-

608
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,120
Anything ever Delta Green or not Delta Green,

609
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,240
but like Lovecraft.

610
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,260
I've literally never like read Lovecraft.

611
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,800
I've seen some movies.

612
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,400
It's good.

613
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,040
I don't read, but read Dirk Gently's

614
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,260
Holistic Detective Agency.

615
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,500
I took a lot from that.

616
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,320
Compliment, thanks for making me laugh so hard.

617
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,760
I cried a few times.

618
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,600
Wow.

619
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,440
I'm glad we did it to you

620
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,920
because we did it to ourselves a lot.

621
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,760
Oh yeah.

622
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,800
We had more fun making it than you did listening to it.

623
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,640
Oh, 100%.

624
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,400
And I'm glad our podcast made you so hard, you cried.

625
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,920
L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant.

626
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,960
L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant.

627
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,120
I think it's just L-Elephant.

628
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,840
L-Elephant, L-Elephant.

629
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,720
Like their name is probably L.

630
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,320
Congrats on finishing the first season.

631
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,160
Thanks.

632
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,000
Thank you.

633
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,240
There have been a lot of little Easter eggs

634
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,480
for people paying a lot of attention.

635
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,320
There was, quote, no backbone being,

636
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,040
oh, by the way, we're doing spoilers.

637
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Yeah, big time.

638
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,880
We might need Dog to say that.

639
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,840
Yeah, well.

640
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,680
Who's Dog?

641
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,500
We'll have Dog.

642
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,480
Joe's on a first, last name basis.

643
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,320
Last name basis, yeah.

644
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,160
We know each other pretty well.

645
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
Joe's on a last name basis with Dog.

646
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,160
No, he has to call him Mr. Dog.

647
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,640
Over the years, we've gotten to know each other

648
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,080
pretty well.

649
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,480
I think I can call him Dog.

650
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,080
No backbone being a more relevant song than first thought.

651
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,360
Yes, classic.

652
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,160
The Wizard of Oznod with what everyone lost

653
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
slash was searching for in the raid

654
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,000
on Marvin Glass's compound.

655
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,160
I think at one point you named some corpses

656
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,200
after the last podcast on the left crew.

657
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,400
Actually, those were the costumes that Billy Harrison

658
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,280
was tied up in the back of Charles Donovan's trunk

659
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,360
and also in Charles Donovan's trunk

660
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,320
was Charles Donovan's extra disguises

661
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,400
in which he used the last podcast on the left crew

662
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
as covers.

663
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,120
Oh, what are some of your favorite Easter eggs

664
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,640
no one has mentioned yet?

665
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,880
What's an anagram?

666
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,340
Am I thinking of the right?

667
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,760
Whether it's all mixed up.

668
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,680
It's all mixed up, yes.

669
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay, so Tildy B. Mitchell is an anagram.

670
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,560
Oh, fuck, what's it for though?

671
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,080
I refuse to look for anagrams in every name you give us.

672
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,080
I'm looking up anagram solver.

673
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,500
It's not gonna give it to you because it's like half baked.

675
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,200
It's like lit B.

676
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,040
It's lit.

677
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,880
How do you spell Tildy?

678
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,320
Oh, T-I-L-D-E B as B

679
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,160
and then Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L.

680
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,000
But lit is part of it?

681
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,840
It's lit.

682
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,800
Fucking good, dude.

683
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,140
Meet Bill Ted.

684
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,520
Wait, are you for real?

685
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,880
Good anagram, bro.

686
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,160
What, Bill Ted?

687
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,200
Yeah, like Bill and Ted because they time travel.

688
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
So you had the time travel and the fact that she was

689
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,280
zombie-ish or undead-ish from that early on

690
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,100
that you just named her.

691
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,760
Holy fuck, that's cool.

692
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,000
I thought that came later.

693
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,840
I thought those revelations came later.

694
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,860
That is what Keith might name his meat monster.

695
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,280
Lich meet Bill Ted.

696
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,600
Nice, good one.

697
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,680
But that was her name.

698
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,320
Tildy B. Mitchell.

699
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,240
Tildy B. Mitchell.

700
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,320
Yeah, like exactly.

701
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,680
Like from birth, right?

702
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,520
Yeah.

703
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,340
I guess that.

704
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,180
She was destined.

705
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,020
That was just fun for Zach.

706
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,360
That's just a fun detail outside of the canon.

707
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,200
Yeah, that doesn't mean anything.

708
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,040
It's an Easter egg.

709
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,480
That's just a Zach fun time.

710
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,600
What's another Easter egg?

711
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,620
There's one that a fan found that you definitely put in,

712
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,960
none of us caught was the Mary Coles Institute

713
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,800
or whatever it was.

714
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,760
It was an acronym for consume, was it?

715
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,000
Consume, yeah.

716
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The Coles Orphanage colon new school under modern etiquette.

717
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,000
Somebody pointed that out on Twitter and it blew my mind.

718
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,560
I thought that I made it so stilted

719
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,920
that you guys would be like, why is it that?

720
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,280
Every time you do that, I'm just like,

721
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,120
I'm not gonna make Zach feel bad about his English.

722
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Well, now you know to make fun of me

723
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,700
and reveal my hidden secrets,

724
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,240
but also it might hurt my feelings.

725
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,200
So, you know, it's a time when we're like,

726
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,440
that must be one of your weird things, right?

727
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,700
And you're just like, no, no, no, no, Thomas.

728
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,480
Anyway, so that's one.

729
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,660
Consume is definitely one that I really liked.

730
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,060
Oh, this one's dumb.

731
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,420
This one's so dumb, but Oz Mayhem Wolf,

732
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,420
his brother was Elby, E-L-B-Y, which is not a name.

733
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,180
But like pounds or?

734
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,300
Yeah, L-B and ounces.

735
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,340
That's good, that's a good one.

736
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,180
I like that.

737
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,900
That was real stupid.

738
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,660
That's real good.

739
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,900
Did we ever meet Elby?

740
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,460
No, he just talked about him.

741
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,300
He mentioned him, yeah.

742
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,300
Oh, okay.

743
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,900
He mentioned him once.

744
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,540
Keith Vigna, Vigna is a type of bean or something.

745
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,780
Yeah, Vigna is a genus, I think, of bean.

746
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,680
It's a science version of a bean.

747
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,260
It's a sciency bean.

748
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,460
It's a science bean.

749
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,140
John Lee Pettymore is named from the song,

750
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,140
Copperhead Road by Steve Earle.

751
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,860
We kind of made his dad something else,

752
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,400
but I guess Kevin is literally the character

753
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,240
in Copperhead Road.

754
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,040
Exactly.

755
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,880
Clark was born with a tail.

756
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,960
Just a little Easter egg for you.

757
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,400
And never got it removed.

758
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,240
He had it the whole campaign.

759
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,080
The whole time.

760
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,920
The whole time.

761
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,680
If you just looked at his back,

762
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,080
you would have seen it wagging every now and then.

763
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,920
If you'd done an alertness check,

764
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,780
you actually had detailed emotional responses for the tail.

765
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,960
I had rolls I could have made.

766
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,320
For those of you who are gonna go back

767
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,100
and listen through the campaign,

768
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,400
you'll find a slight whooshing sound.

769
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,000
I do remember one last Easter egg.

770
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,280
Right before we started this whole thing,

771
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,560
Zach was like, okay, your character is God.

772
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,480
This is all a dream that he's created

773
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,560
for the other characters.

774
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,360
So just remember that at the end.

775
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,100
I was like, okay, yeah, for sure.

776
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,940
I wrote it down.

777
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,200
The only thing in my notes.

778
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,440
You're God.

779
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
What are you looking at?

780
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
Trying to find my cheat sheet.

781
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,560
Just show you guys my cheat sheet

782
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,040
where I had listed like.

783
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,920
There was, I was frantically reading as fast as I could.

784
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,880
Was trying to consume all the little nuggets

785
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,520
as it went by.

786
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,800
There was a bunch of stuff in there, man.

787
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,040
I was on top of a lot of stuff that was happening

788
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,000
on certain time restraints for a while.

789
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,160
Yeah, that was a weird time when you guys were like

790
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
at the end of your time in contention

791
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,480
when all the moving parts were happening.

792
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,680
And I was trying to keep track of it.

793
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,400
All right, let's move on.

794
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,140
Hope it's okay to do two questions.

795
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,360
It is, we'll keep going.

796
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,640
A little while ago,

797
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,400
I had an idea about a connection to Martin Cupertino

798
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,920
being an influential person wanting to create cube

799
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,000
during the calm comfy campground arc

800
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,280
and the contention boys chasing down the origins

801
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,520
of what they called ball.

802
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,680
I get that Martin was a Steve Jobs stand in,

803
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,680
but was the cube versus ball connection intentional

804
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,120
or am I grasping at straws?

805
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,020
I'm gonna turn this one over to Thomas for the answer.

806
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,780
Unfortunately, grasping at straws cube

807
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,580
was just a parody of the original iMac.

808
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,860
And then like the crazy promises about cube

809
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,780
were just like Zombocom style like nonsense

810
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,180
and over promising like tech world.

811
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,300
Like this will solve every problem anybody's ever had.

812
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,140
It's the normal stuff.

813
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,980
It's a very, very, very simple broad parody of Steve Jobs.

814
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,820
We got to think about our pace.

815
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,140
Cause I think we have 50 total in three.

816
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,060
Yeah, we're on page one of nine.

817
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,140
The reason it was called, we are 30 minutes in.

818
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
The reason it was called cube

819
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,900
is cause the iMac is like a cube shape kind of.

820
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,740
Nice.

821
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,380
Soren Ash asks.

822
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,740
Oh yeah, you guys keep going, I'm gonna go pee.

823
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,580
Oh, I didn't know you were peeing right now.

824
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,980
This isn't one we can answer.

825
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,180
We could try.

826
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,340
I'll read it and we'll try.

827
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,180
Okay, so the things I've racked up over time.

828
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,500
How did Marvin get removed from the myriad hive mind?

829
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,100
That's a question I've had myself.

830
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,620
Yeah, so here's my best guess.

831
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,220
Marvin, he just didn't want to be in it anymore.

832
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,260
That was my, exactly what I was gonna say.

833
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,660
He just wanted it more.

834
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,740
Like kind of the odd, but he like he wanted out and he did.

835
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,940
I can't remember if I said this on the podcast

836
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,460
or if it was after a session one time,

837
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,220
but I wondered if he was some link in an evolution

838
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,740
between Tildy and what we know as myriad,

839
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,900
whether he was in the middle

840
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,260
or he was an evolved beyond myriad.

841
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,780
I think he was just like a funny guy.

842
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,340
He's just a wild and crazy dude.

843
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,180
Next question.

844
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,740
Yeah, were Marvin's sons his biological sons?

845
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,580
Yes.

846
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,420
Was the glass syndicate just a puppet

847
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,820
for some greater organization?

848
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,660
Yes, next question.

849
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,100
Yeah, yes and yes.

850
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,940
What was Stan and Nancy's agenda

851
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,940
and by extension that of the city asylum?

852
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,780
Zach never knew.

853
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,940
He didn't actually have.

854
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,940
And yes, he did just keep forgetting her name.

855
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,820
He wanted, they were actually,

856
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,660
the city asylum was trying to research the brown note.

857
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,900
Right, yeah.

858
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,420
Okay, we've covered the first few.

859
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,700
Yeah, we got it all Zach, pretty thoroughly.

860
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,900
Do you guys have any questions?

861
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,020
Should I add in anything?

862
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,980
I was wondering how did Marvin get removed

863
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,260
from myriad hive mind?

864
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,700
How did Marvin remove himself?

865
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,780
Smart question, Joe.

866
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,300
Yeah, good question.

867
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,380
Okay, so Marvin was like the fallen angel essentially

868
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,620
of these creatures

869
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,980
and that's all I ever really thought about it.

870
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,260
I like it though, that's also cool.

871
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,820
Well, that would also be a great campaign,

872
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,660
a mini campaign.

873
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,140
Yeah, it really, I honestly had a certain thought

874
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,820
as we were recording from 100 on.

875
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,020
I was like, I could do at least three or four more spin-offs.

876
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,300
Like we could do this theoretically forever.

877
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,900
Yeah, oh yeah, Jesus Christ Ministries

878
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,340
could have easily had its own one shot,

879
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,900
which I was planning for a while

880
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,460
and then abandoned at a certain point.

881
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,060
Well, that was Fergie's thing, right?

882
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,900
Yeah.

883
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,860
Fergie's whole crime organization.

884
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,220
With all those little kids that were all like androids.

885
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,940
Yeah, oh, we could play Android orphans.

886
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,040
Yeah, like that would be very fun.

887
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,500
So that's all I really ever had for Marvin.

888
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,940
Oh, were his sons biological?

889
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,980
No, they were not.

890
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,820
What was their deal?

891
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,660
Were they created?

892
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,140
No, he was dealing in trafficking

893
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,980
and so he took two of the strongest ones

894
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,180
from the Den of Sin and made them his sons.

895
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,580
Gotcha, so they know they're not his sons.

896
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,260
They have been, they had been like brainwashed

897
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,060
to basically just like the Glass family was their family.

898
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,860
They were Glass boys like through and through,

899
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,680
but one of them had their mind melted

900
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,480
before the season started

901
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,480
and the other one got sent to the dark place.

902
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,000
So they were not role played through very thoroughly

903
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,780
just because of their circumstances.

904
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,880
Another question here, biological sons.

905
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,400
Was the Glass syndicate just a puppet

906
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,640
for some greater organization?

907
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,160
The Glass syndicate was not a puppet.

908
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,760
The Glass syndicate was held strong by Marvin Glass

909
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,400
who definitely held his own against Myriad.

910
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
That's interesting, so that's, we disagree on that.

911
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,600
Okay, that's fair.

912
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,640
What was your guys' answer?

913
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,480
We said yes.

914
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,320
And who was the hand?

915
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,160
We said yes, next question.

916
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,400
Next question, what was Man Stan Steen's agenda

917
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,760
and by extension that of the city asylum?

918
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,040
Okay, so these are two very different questions

919
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,120
specifically because the city asylum

920
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,080
was holding Stan Man Steen as a prisoner at the time.

921
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,400
He was let out only to go to his daughter's funeral

922
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,240
as a courtesy and he used that time

923
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,240
to get the fuck out of existence

924
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,560
which was his goal due to his ability to see.

925
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,720
He was living the same kind of life where you guys were

926
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,960
where his idea of the world kept changing.

927
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,360
Every single time something unnatural happened,

928
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,440
I changed the town of contention slightly

929
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,720
and the main clue of that change

930
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,720
was the name of your fourth police officer in contention

931
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,120
and small other changes happened

932
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,200
but the only one that we really stumbled across in game

933
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,240
was Randy Angst.

934
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,720
Those were like set about as little things

935
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,800
that could pop up if the right questions were asked

936
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,400
which I should have, again,

937
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,120
just learning how to be a better GM

938
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,400
pushed that theme forward.

939
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,040
But Stan was always aware of these changes like we were.

940
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,320
He very much was.

941
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,600
I thought they felt weird.

942
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,640
Yep, and so he fucked off and when he fucked off,

943
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,320
he landed himself in a heap of trouble

944
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,880
and then eventually got a hold of a phone

945
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,880
and needed some help from the future pulp hero overseer.

946
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Yeah, at the end there.

947
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,080
So that would be a fun thing to look into.

948
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,920
I would love that story.

949
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,640
Okay, so yeah, he only showed up twice

950
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,680
but I thought of him as just another person

951
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,520
who is dealing with the same thing

952
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,040
where he saw what was happening in the world.

953
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,560
There were some other people like that as well.

954
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Mildred Mitchell being one of them.

955
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,280
If you guys had talked about your fourth officer around her,

956
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,520
she would have gotten the name wrong like you guys had.

957
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,280
Were K cell and the FBI agents working for the same group?

958
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,080
Yes, but in different time periods.

959
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,200
Given that in the ending,

960
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,280
the FBI agents were answering to the lady

961
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,960
that got dubbed Satan,

962
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,120
it seems as though there was another pernicious element

963
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,320
at play and that K cell was likely opposed to them.

964
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,160
To clarify, my working theory is that the FBI agents

965
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,760
working for Satan are an M-A-R-Y-esque threat

966
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,560
with some evil agenda in mind.

967
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,600
Yes, I mean, they are as much a threat

968
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,160
as the group of cowboys are a threat

969
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,120
in traditional Delta Green lore,

970
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,200
which, you know, Delta Green agents are a threat, man.

971
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
That's just kind of how it happens.

972
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,800
Their goal is to-

973
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,880
Mr. Steal Your Girl.

974
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,600
Yeah, exactly.

975
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,600
And so that is the reason why the father of Maggie Cook,

976
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,940
I almost said Tim Cook,

977
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,080
well, it was Jim Cook, which is why I called him that,

978
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,600
is Jim Cook, he worked for Satan

979
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,620
and that's why he had a reference to Satan in his house.

980
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,920
But by the end of his time,

981
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,920
he was working against her machinations.

982
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,520
So moving on, what was up with all the numbers plague deal?

983
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,480
What was up with the numbers plague deal?

984
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,720
What was the overseer's original motivation

985
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,060
for setting it off?

986
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,440
Also, it seemed like the overseer considered that run

987
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,340
a quote, success, despite everyone dying on that go round.

988
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,180
Why?

989
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,740
Did we know that Joe set that off, Luke?

990
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,000
I have, I don't think so.

991
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,640
It seemed like it'd be fun.

992
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,360
Get the fuck out of our house.

993
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,460
They got into you.

994
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,300
That was cool.

995
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,560
Answer the question, Joe.

996
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,400
I don't have an answer.

997
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,220
You set off that, you were the overseer at that point.

998
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,880
I had not become the overseer yet.

999
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,160
So basically the overseer got a hold of someone

1000
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,680
with good intentions from the other side.

1001
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,360
I had it so that the overseer would make lots of mistakes

1002
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,640
throughout his time because in Delta Green,

1003
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,740
the characters traditionally 60% of the time

1004
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,960
succeed on stuff.

1005
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,080
And so I kept that in mind as I worked

1006
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,020
through the overseer's plan.

1007
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,020
And his plan for CSU and for Bar Corp was,

1008
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,840
he did not plan for CSU to become a crazy suicide haven.

1009
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,200
That was not his plan at all.

1010
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,200
His plan was to give this woman, this activist,

1011
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,740
on CSU's campus, the ability to change the mind

1012
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,300
of Bruce Robin, the leader of Bar Corp,

1013
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,520
and make him a better leader as the head

1014
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,360
of the biggest corporation in the city.

1015
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,160
And so he failed in that.

1016
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,280
And accidentally set off a whole thing

1017
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,120
where basically the spell went cattywampus

1018
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,160
and the cleanup needed to happen.

1019
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,400
It was almost working though

1020
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,680
because didn't we run into people saying

1021
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,240
that he's had a change of heart

1022
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,480
and has been doing things better lately?

1023
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,320
Exactly. That's cool.

1024
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,600
It was so close to working, but something was off,

1025
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,280
which is just kind of a constant in Delta Green

1026
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,220
is that, yeah, you can use the unnatural

1027
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,520
and sometimes the unnatural can do good things,

1028
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,360
but overwhelmingly, if you try to use the unnatural

1029
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,160
for good, it's not gonna work out.

1030
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,040
And so that was my thought for that whole arc.

1031
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,880
Dope.

1032
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,680
I can tell you why the overseer considered it

1033
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,960
a success.

1034
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,000
That giant is for sure the thing

1035
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,400
that was on his mind the whole time.

1036
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,080
Defeating that was his most solid of a goal,

1037
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,360
at least when I got ahold of him.

1038
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,040
So anything that doesn't hurt that effort is a success.

1039
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,080
Yeah.

1040
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,520
Exactly.

1041
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,920
A wild gazebo asks, I think that story arc,

1042
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,920
oh, they were adding on to what was said by Soren Ash.

1043
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,520
They said, I think that story arc needs

1044
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,080
the most explaining.

1045
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,120
I love how just wild everything got,

1046
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,680
but they didn't really investigate

1047
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,640
and find out any of the plot points there.

1048
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,080
Yeah, they were a little preoccupied

1049
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,140
with all the shit that I was throwing at them constantly.

1050
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,220
Wouldn't change that because it's a great in a way

1051
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,800
to see it all go missed.

1052
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,160
I just wanna know what any of that is about

1053
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,100
and exactly how high did that girl end up going.

1054
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,720
And ShamWow Chameleon, I can tell you,

1055
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,040
got real, real high.

1056
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,880
Did she grab a passing helicopter at some point?

1057
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,560
She did, she got ahold of a passing helicopter,

1058
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,200
got even higher and then in my mind,

1059
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,240
into the rotors.

1060
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,560
I think she probably just convinced

1061
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,560
the helicopter pilot to keep going up and up and up.

1062
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,800
That's what I like to think.

1063
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,440
Got a thing from Jake Medrano, 911 says,

1064
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,120
always love your stuff.

1065
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,600
Hey, that's a big always.

1066
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,000
Thanks.

1067
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,840
What about this?

1068
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,340
Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.

1069
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,680
Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.

1070
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,520
You love that?

1071
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,120
Testing your boundaries.

1072
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,120
He did say always and boy, we're still living in it.

1073
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,060
My God.

1074
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,900
Anyway.

1075
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,040
Yeah, they say Sean McCoy,

1076
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,840
who is the creator of Mothership,

1077
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,400
which is a RPG game,

1078
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,820
recently did an AMA where he mentioned

1079
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,520
he loved your podcast and hope you eventually

1080
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,600
did a adventure campaign of Mothership.

1081
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,280
I've been looking for a good actual play

1082
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,960
and would love to see you guys cover that.

1083
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Hope this finds you well.

1084
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,220
I'm found well.

1085
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm found well.

1086
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,920
Same.

1087
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,480
Yeah, Thomas, you found well?

1088
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,700
Yeah.

1089
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,880
This is the question that Thomas was gonna lead us

1090
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,560
through the answer of.

1091
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,520
Because it is asking about Mothership and Sean McCoy.

1092
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,840
And we are-

1093
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,880
I don't know fucking shit about it.

1094
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,040
He just asked me to look him up

1095
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,540
and see if it was problematic.

1096
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,520
As far as I can tell, no.

1097
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,360
All right.

1098
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,560
And as far as he can tell, no.

1099
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,680
And that is a good thing.

1100
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,880
So we are, with that being said,

1101
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,560
we are super interested.

1102
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,080
We would love to play Mothership.

1103
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,200
It's, as far as I understand, a space RPG,

1104
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,480
which we've all been talking about

1105
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,020
if you wanna play a space thing sometime.

1106
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,480
Yeah, we would love to play it.

1107
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,240
Yeah, hey, Sean.

1108
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,060
Take us to your GM.

1109
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,520
Hey, Sean, hit us up.

1110
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,680
That was a robot, but it was an alien.

1111
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,960
Banstu says, for Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin,

1112
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,200
uh-oh, I will-

1113
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,040
Shut up, Zach.

1114
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,440
Let us read it.

1115
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,240
For Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin,

1116
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,640
can you tell us what happened in season one?

1117
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,320
Zach, how would you describe it?

1118
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
Oh, this is a, all right.

1119
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,680
So we're gonna cut to-

1120
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,360
An hour each of recaps from all of us.

1121
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,960
I think it would take even longer.

1122
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,360
We're gonna skip this one.

1123
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,840
My dude, it would not take me longer and an hour

1124
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,960
to describe what happened in the season of this podcast.

1125
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,640
I think as far as Keith goes,

1126
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,560
what you saw was what was going on.

1127
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,640
Wow, great answer from Luke.

1128
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,120
Luke, what you heard is what you got.

1129
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,760
Keith, he didn't like his brother, you know,

1130
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,360
and then fast forward, Keith tension.

1131
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,520
Justin doesn't need to be here.

1132
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,680
That answer applies to all of us, but Joe.

1133
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:37,160
I mean, did you guys expect the goo to when it grabs you

1134
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,000
and slams you in the ground?

1135
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,800
I didn't expect anything ever.

1136
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,640
Did you?

1137
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,280
Did you think that it killed you?

1138
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,120
Yes.

1139
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,800
I had a hunch that it was doing something

1140
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,640
because we kept getting pictures from a place

1141
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,480
that had no goo.

1142
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Yeah, no, it seemed like there was another goo place.

1143
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,560
Yeah. Yeah.

1144
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,840
But not at all formed like it was.

1145
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,680
No.

1146
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,800
It seemed way cooler to be honest.

1147
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1148
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,840
That's how it works.

1149
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,240
Should have killed you before we got there.

1150
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,200
Bansu also says,

1151
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,960
can you go into a little bit of the goals of each faction

1152
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,200
at the start of season one

1153
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,200
and how those changed as things evolved?

1154
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,280
One of the big changes that I decided to make happen

1155
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,360
each time something unnatural occurred in the world

1156
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,560
was that I would make Maggie Cook more aggressive,

1157
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,600
angrier at her father,

1158
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,960
and more dedicated to taking over the world

1159
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,280
every single time something fucked up happened.

1160
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,640
And so the Maggie Cook that you guys knew

1161
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,600
would be different than the Maggie Cook that you talked to

1162
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,200
anytime you ran into her for the rest of the time.

1163
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,000
And that was attempted to be shown

1164
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,360
through her setting up her own fake death,

1165
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,280
where someone said like,

1166
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,880
oh, she didn't stand up.

1167
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,280
She didn't like hold herself the way that Maggie Cook would.

1168
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,720
Like someone else was trying to,

1169
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,280
Gary Daley was trying to throw like a slight hint there,

1170
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,960
which you guys picked up on and were like,

1171
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,200
okay, so it might not have been her.

1172
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,680
If you guys had actually run dental through Randy Anx

1173
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,440
with her teeth files on file,

1174
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,800
you would have found out that the corpse was not the same,

1175
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,080
did not have the same dental records as Chief Maggie Cook.

1176
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:20,920
Gotcha.

1177
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,240
And then when you ran into her

1178
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,360
after your time at the Sydney Mausoleum,

1179
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,520
you all kind of talked about how aggressive she was

1180
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,240
and how angry she was,

1181
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,720
which is different than we had talked about

1182
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,040
her as a character being previous.

1183
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,960
Right, which I was like,

1184
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,440
yeah, the real Maggie Cook died

1185
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,900
and this is a fake Maggie Cook.

1186
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,300
Exactly, but essentially it was just that

1187
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,100
each time something wild happened in this world,

1188
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,060
you guys were the ones who were kind of split off

1189
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,900
along with Stan Manstein, Mildred Mitchell,

1190
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,620
certain people who continued on this specific timeline,

1191
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,260
trajectory of contention,

1192
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:01,620
as other people continued on the same path of contention

1193
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,460
that they were on.

1194
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,980
I forgot we were microdosing a lot

1195
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,900
when you were writing this campaign.

1196
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,740
Yeah.

1197
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,020
Zach, were the time loops always planned?

1198
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,900
No, did that come about due to the condition

1199
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,540
the characters were in by that point?

1200
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,620
Yes.

1201
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,560
And the microdosing.

1202
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,560
And the microdosing.

1203
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,640
Also, Zach, I know you mentioned the possibility

1204
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,020
if there was enough interest of writing up a setting guide.

1205
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,780
So I wanna say I'd be interested in that

1206
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,740
and TD underscore Woogie says seconded.

1207
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:34,640
Hey guys, that is a goal that we are considering

1208
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,080
putting up on the Patreon

1209
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,000
if we're gonna put up a poll soon for patrons

1210
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
to kind of let us know what they're wanting

1211
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,160
from pretending to be people moving forward

1212
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,920
and that will certainly be one of the options

1213
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,960
of things that we should focus on

1214
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,480
is writing up a campaign setting for contention,

1215
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,160
which I think would be really fun

1216
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,160
and also would take an astronomical amount of my time

1217
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,400
and I would love to do that

1218
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,680
if enough people were interested.

1219
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,920
Edgeworth08 says, how different was episode 100 on

1220
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,620
from what you initially thought the ending would come to?

1221
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,960
How off the rails did it get?

1222
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,800
Right on course.

1223
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,920
Yeah, that's exactly what I planned.

1224
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,440
No, we kind of talked a little bit.

1225
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,720
We could talk about it with Justin

1226
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,400
when he's on next episode about how I told you guys

1227
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,600
I was trying to kill Don D. Pettymore

1228
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,640
and it just didn't happen.

1229
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,560
Yeah, when you guys were fighting against that rabid ball,

1230
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,360
I really wanted to kill Don on the catwalks.

1231
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,000
Yeah, that was the one role I ever lied about

1232
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,240
and I feel pretty shitty about it,

1233
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,280
but I don't actually because it got us, Justin,

1234
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,480
through to the end, so.

1235
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
But I fudged an unnatural success

1236
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,560
because I didn't, I don't know why even.

1237
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,800
I'm a weak man.

1238
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:56,800
Oh, I wish that could have been the end of the episode,

1239
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,880
but we have to get through more.

1240
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,780
Okay, oh, so the answer is that it was very different

1241
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,620
than I expected.

1242
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:15,680
I wrote what was gonna happen in the next session

1243
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,760
after we played the previous session.

1244
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,080
I had literally nothing planned

1245
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,640
and I planned as we played

1246
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,980
through the end of the entire campaign.

1247
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,820
Nice.

1248
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,960
Yeah, that's honestly,

1249
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,720
if you wanna know how I plan the entire fucking thing

1250
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,680
and always have, I plan it based on what happened

1251
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,180
the last session every time

1252
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,640
because you can't just prep a bunch of stuff

1253
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,160
and expect it to work

1254
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,720
because it never does.

1255
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,900
Nice.

1256
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,180
What was the biggest takeaway you got

1257
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,600
from making this podcast

1258
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,920
and what did you learn to prepare for season two?

1259
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,960
Shit's easy, make it up as you go.

1260
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,800
Yep.

1261
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,040
So more of that coming.

1262
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,000
Yeah, the answer you just said from the previous question.

1263
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,300
Yeah, but also for sure on season two,

1264
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,720
gonna take your guys' advice.

1265
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,160
I really liked the idea of, Thomas mentioned,

1266
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,080
recapping what you learned from an NPC

1267
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,040
after your interactions with them.

1268
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,480
We love recaps around here.

1269
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,680
I do that with combat, I realized,

1270
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,000
where I kind of recap each round what happened in combat

1271
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and then thankfully later we had characters do it in game.

1272
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,080
But yeah, I really liked the idea

1273
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,880
of recapping what you guys get from NPCs.

1274
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,640
Characters who would have never been there

1275
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,400
if I hadn't heroically lied

1276
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,600
while Zach tried to murder us on those catwalks.

1277
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,700
Murder Justin on those catwalks.

1278
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,400
Right guys?

1279
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
Biggest takeaway from making the podcast?

1280
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,480
Shit's easy.

1281
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,320
Shit's easy, just make it up as you go.

1282
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,160
Make it up as you go.

1283
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,480
It was fun for me.

1284
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,320
Editing is really hard and takes a long time.

1285
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,160
Yeah.

1286
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,460
And is really important.

1287
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,280
Finally, I just wanted to say

1288
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,560
that when I finally saw your faces,

1289
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,720
I had a completely different image

1290
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,760
from what you sounded like, except for Luke.

1291
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,800
I thought, quote, yeah, that's about right.

1292
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,240
It's, yeah, it's true.

1293
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,240
I mean, we sound like normal people,

1294
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,400
but we're all devastatingly attractive except for Luke.

1295
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,280
No, they just could tell from my voice.

1296
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,580
They're like that guy.

1297
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,920
They say great stuff, guys.

1298
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,760
What confidence that man has.

1299
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,520
And I look forward to more content.

1300
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,760
Tall idiot Milky Way at ShadowWorldVivo.

1301
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,880
Oh, we're on Twitter.

1302
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,080
It must have hashtag PTBPQ.

1303
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,240
Love the podcast.

1304
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,440
I've listened through all of it twice.

1305
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,880
That's hundreds of hours.

1306
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,720
Double hundreds.

1307
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,060
Double, double.

1308
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,240
What did the myriads mean at the end

1309
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,600
when they were saying, quote, for your own safety,

1310
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,880
please remain here?

1311
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,360
Did they think shutting down Overseer and Ball

1312
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,600
was a safe choice?

1313
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,840
I was curious about this one too,

1314
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,920
because on the re-listen,

1315
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,320
you really hit home with that a bunch of times.

1316
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,800
Was there a hint there that we didn't pick up on?

1317
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,280
No, it was simply the thing that I kept hammering home

1318
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,580
is that it's really fucking dangerous

1319
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,960
for you guys to try to go back into the world

1320
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,120
that Myriad was about to shut down,

1321
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,380
was kind of the vibe that I was trying to give you.

1322
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,240
Basically, find another option,

1323
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,080
which you did in the weirdest way that I was not expecting.

1324
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,200
But yeah, I was saying like,

1325
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,920
if you go back to contention,

1326
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,440
I am going to make you blip out of existence

1327
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,760
because Myriad will erase your entire plane,

1328
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,600
which includes all iterations of contention.

1329
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,440
Sure.

1330
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,540
I guess I assumed at the time

1331
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,620
that also meant the place we were in, right?

1332
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,460
The same.

1333
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,280
Okay, I did too.

1334
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,440
I thought for your own safety, please remain here.

1335
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,560
We'll wipe you all out.

1336
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,280
I was like, you're lying.

1337
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,240
I thought it was a threat.

1338
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,780
Nope, they were definitely gonna just leave you there.

1339
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,620
Okay.

1340
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,120
In my head, that's what I had planned.

1341
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,280
That we could have lived in existence there.

1342
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,120
Yep. Gotcha.

1343
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,880
You definitely could have lived in existence there.

1344
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,280
A great fun one.

1345
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,080
So yeah, they were basically just saying,

1346
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,080
for your own safety,

1347
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,540
because jumping to a new plane is really hard.

1348
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,120
And we kind of talked about that

1349
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,040
after we recorded a couple of times where it was like,

1350
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,160
what would have happened

1351
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,480
if you guys would have tried to jump planes?

1352
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,220
And I had a table that you would have rolled on

1353
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,520
and the options were mostly bad.

1354
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,840
Yeah.

1355
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,120
My favorite that I was really pulling for

1356
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:38,120
was going to be a very luscious, verdant, green jungle

1357
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,160
that then you all would have slowly died

1358
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,200
of radiation poisoning and maybe at the jaws of dinosaurs.

1359
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,400
So yeah, there were different places.

1360
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,440
Well, that's not my favorite.

1361
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,200
That you could have ended up

1362
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,040
if you had to try to leave.

1363
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,840
Gazebo, a wild gazebo says,

1364
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,260
I for one look forward to our new lives under Keith's rule.

1365
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,840
I'm sure he'll be a kind and a holy empathetic leader.

1366
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,200
All hail Keith's, hallowed be thy name.

1367
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,040
Hallowed be thy name.

1368
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,280
Looks like the Keiths myriad

1369
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,360
have taken over some Twitter accounts

1370
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,800
and are spreading some disinfo.

1371
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,800
Bless you, my son.

1372
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,700
Lynn is spooky at Jet Sedette says,

1373
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,040
shout out to the handsome boy, Luke.

1374
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,360
Hashtag HZKMP, hashtag PTBPQ, smiley face.

1375
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,600
Keep it up.

1376
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,320
Another Keith on Twitter.

1377
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,800
Who is that really, Keith?

1378
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,840
I don't know who that is.

1379
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,920
Sasha Snow, one of our fantastic mods,

1380
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,240
at MariexLupin says,

1381
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,240
so when y'all releasing the hot dog cut of No Backbone.

1382
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,320
Amazing job on season one.

1383
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,800
I can't wait for the next season to kick off.

1384
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,160
We can't either.

1385
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,360
We're excited for everything

1386
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,480
that's coming down the pipeline.

1387
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,480
Super stoked, super stoked.

1388
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,880
I'll release the hot dog cut of No Backbone

1389
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,880
with the permission of Kudzu on Patreon.

1390
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,600
I'll actually, that's a great question.

1391
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,840
I'll hit up Seth, who's the lead singer of Kudzu,

1392
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,800
and see if he's cool with me releasing the hot dog cut,

1393
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,240
which he will not know what I'm talking about.

1394
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,560
So I'll send it to him and then we'll,

1395
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,840
thankfully the season's over, so he can't pull out now.

1396
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,040
Kyanite fuck cars at 1312 Kyanite asks,

1397
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,560
do y'all have a secret to not getting burnt out

1398
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,800
on the same story, adventure, system, et cetera,

1399
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,320
other than reasonable and restful breaks?

1400
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,480
Those are for babies and I am no baby.

1401
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,640
I am a baby, I took a break.

1402
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,480
We took big breaks.

1403
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,000
We took a big break, yeah.

1404
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,080
We took a couple of big breaks.

1405
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,880
We started recording this season in contention

1406
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,920
a full year before we started releasing,

1407
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,920
we've said a few times.

1408
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,320
So I mean, there were many breaks in there,

1409
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,440
but I'm curious, did you guys ever feel burnt out

1410
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,480
on the story?

1411
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,760
No, because it just changed.

1412
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,000
It was a consistent thread,

1413
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,840
but so many other things where it's like.

1414
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,720
We had the luxury of those mini arcs also

1415
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,560
to break it all up.

1416
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,880
Actually, yeah, by the time we got to the numbers

1417
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,920
and everything without a lot of even hints

1418
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,920
about what was actually going on.

1419
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,520
Yeah, that arc was, I mean, like about that

1420
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,720
in the world in general.

1421
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,920
Though I don't know if you guys had more than I did

1422
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,920
at that point with your characters.

1423
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,280
I didn't know anything.

1424
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,920
Joe is definitely learning that he was the overseer

1425
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,800
during that arc.

1426
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,520
And so that was a very Joe centric.

1427
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,600
There was also a moment where the entire story

1428
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,040
could have changed because Leon wanted to take me elsewhere

1429
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,840
and I had some kind of role that I succeeded

1430
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,800
and or failed on.

1431
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,440
He said, you know what, let's not do that yet

1432
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,040
and let's do the city campus first.

1433
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,600
If I had gone to the other place,

1434
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,840
I guess we're in spoiler territory.

1435
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,560
He wanted to take me straight to Comcomfy Campground

1436
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,520
and meet up with Maggie.

1437
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,400
Meet up with Maggie who was waiting for you on the shore

1438
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,400
with a heavy metal box that would have summoned

1439
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,000
the Gigantum Barpithecus into the world of contention

1440
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,800
and her plan was alongside the overseer, you,

1441
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,400
was to hold the world hostage

1442
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,000
and literally take control of a one world government.

1443
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,960
You guys could have had a very different overseer.

1444
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,080
Yeah, I mean, obviously I love the story that we crafted

1445
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,560
but that's way better.

1446
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,360
So secret to not getting burnt out, I guess,

1447
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,320
is just to keep the story fresh and moving

1448
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,440
in different directions constantly.

1449
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,160
That makes me remember that also even after the fact,

1450
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,520
when I came back from one of the loops,

1451
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,280
I was trying to convince them to go to Comcomfy Campground.

1452
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,120
We had another chance to have done that.

1453
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,440
I was also planning on that happening, yeah, for a while.

1454
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,440
Spine Bazinglingter at Putnam Puppeteer says,

1455
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,440
it seemed that there was an uneasy truce

1456
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,080
between the Circle of Knowledge, Coq, Myriad

1457
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,120
and the majority of factions in the series

1458
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,880
with the possible exception of the Glass Syndicate.

1459
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,760
Was this unity an allied powers-esque counter

1460
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,880
to MARY's agenda?

1461
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,320
No, MARY was the allies and everybody else was the ISIS.

1462
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,160
Yeah.

1463
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,480
Yeah.

1464
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,800
I like to think that Myriad and the Circle of Knowledge,

1465
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,560
Bar Corp, they were all kind of working together.

1466
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,520
You had an NPC kind of say that one time

1467
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,960
that they're all moving in different ways

1468
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,800
toward the same goal.

1469
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,720
Yeah, and Love was talking to you guys about that

1470
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,000
outside of Beans Pond and that is true.

1471
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,640
MARY was not a part of that agenda.

1472
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,780
Everyone was pretty confused about the balls

1473
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,440
and how they work and no one had a grasp on it

1474
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,000
was my thought process.

1475
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,040
There are a couple other balls that are out there

1476
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,960
in this world that were never found

1477
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,600
and I never wrote anything for them

1478
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,240
because I didn't. Make it up right now.

1479
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,480
Didn't think I needed to.

1480
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,480
They're out there, baby.

1481
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,840
Yeah, they're fucking out there though.

1482
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,680
If you do the math, there were a certain amount

1483
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,680
of successes, Kacelle knocked out a certain number of them,

1484
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,380
John was one of them and yeah, the math doesn't quite add up

1485
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,880
there's one or two I think that are left out.

1486
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,720
Nice.

1487
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,560
And so they're still doing this stuff.

1488
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,080
Take some time to feel your spine right now.

1489
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,840
Also, keep in mind if you're stoned

1490
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,240
and you're listening to this and it's late at night

1491
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,920
and it's dark and you're in your house by yourself,

1492
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,000
don't look out the window

1493
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,360
because there's someone looking at you.

1494
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,640
Yeah, and your ball.

1495
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,520
That's right, Derek.

1496
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,620
There's someone looking at you through the window.

1497
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,620
Also, Tyler, shut your door right now, then lock it.

1498
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:55,700
Xylopia or, well, no, it's gotta be that, right?

1499
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,660
Xylopia maybe?

1500
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,620
Oh yeah, probably.

1501
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,860
Xylopia.

1502
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,340
Question, what can you tell us about season two?

1503
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,180
Nothing.

1504
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,000
Nothing.

1505
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,840
Nothing, but we are talking about it.

1506
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,680
Who the fuck told you that?

1507
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,520
I'll tell you about season two.

1508
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,100
How do you know about that?

1509
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,540
How do you know about season two?

1510
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,060
That wasn't supposed to leave this room.

1511
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:11,900
Codename season two.

1512
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,740
I think it's worth saying

1513
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,380
that you've done a lot of work on it already.

1514
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:15,820
Yeah, it is.

1515
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:19,180
It's worth saying that I remembered a couple months ago,

1516
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,460
contention in the main story and everything,

1517
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,980
like with the NPCs that would be moving parts

1518
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,420
were all written out well before we started recording.

1519
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,780
And I was like, oh shit, I gotta get on this.

1520
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:35,700
So I've had the idea rumbling around in my head

1521
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,380
for season two since, I would say,

1522
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:41,220
when we were recording episode 12.

1523
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,220
Nice.

1524
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,920
And I've kind of fine-tuned it.

1525
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,020
Taylor has worked as my story supervisor

1526
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:52,180
to basically me talking out loud

1527
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,720
and her being like, that doesn't make sense.

1528
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,560
Let's fix that.

1529
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,580
And so. Nice.

1530
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,900
Yeah, I'm really, really fucking excited about it.

1531
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:58,740
So that's what we can tell you.

1532
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,300
What were you watching a lot of at that point in time?

1533
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,460
Oh, that's a good question.

1534
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,940
What was I watching?

1535
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,860
Gilligan's Island.

1536
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,960
Fucking one show you were so into.

1537
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,020
Whoa.

1538
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,220
The magic thing.

1539
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,060
Oh. Who?

1540
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,900
Mr. Strange, wait, what was it?

1541
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,060
Jonathan Norrell?

1542
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,440
Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.

1543
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,280
Yeah.

1544
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,100
It's pretty good.

1545
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,240
Yeah, I think it's really fun.

1546
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,240
There's a Faye, and I'm not really super into Faye lore,

1547
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,740
but I really like that story.

1548
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,580
And the acting is really solid in it.

1549
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:33,860
Yeah, definitely.

1550
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,360
Dirk Gilligan had a lot to do with season one.

1551
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,820
John dies at the end, had a lot to do with season one.

1552
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,660
A lot of stuff.

1553
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,340
Anytime I'm watching media or listening to media,

1554
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,820
I'm stealing.

1555
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,900
Question, would you guys ever consider playing a season

1556
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:53,300
of Scum and Villainy or some other spacey flavor

1557
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,420
of tabletop role-playing?

1558
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,380
C Mothership.

1559
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:56,900
Yeah, C colon Mothership.

1560
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,060
Yeah, for sure.

1561
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,660
I've heard Scum and Villainy is dope.

1562
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,140
Is Scum and Villainy the Star Wars one specifically?

1563
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,980
Yeah, I think it is not name brand,

1564
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:08,260
but it is essentially, do you want to role play Star Wars?

1565
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,300
This is a way to do it.

1566
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,140
Cool.

1567
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,500
And I would, you know what I would call it

1568
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,660
the whole time we were playing it?

1569
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,840
What?

1570
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,420
Scum and Villainy.

1571
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,260
Oh, okay.

1572
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,880
Zach, oh, okay.

1573
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,780
Compliment, this is one of my favorite podcasts.

1574
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:33,220
PTBP is my only Patreon subscription at the moment.

1575
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,180
Hey, thank you.

1576
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,620
We encourage you to divest as much if you're welcome

1577
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,500
as you can from other sources

1578
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,860
and invest it all in PTBP.

1579
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,020
It's going up and up and up and up, baby.

1580
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,780
Diamond hands on PTBP.

1581
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,980
That's right, you hold.

1582
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:50,980
It only goes up.

1583
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,100
1KL, oh no.

1584
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,660
1KL Island.

1585
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,620
No, 1K Island.

1586
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:01,300
Oh, 1000 Island Stare, 1000 Island Stare.

1587
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,260
Yep, 1K Island Stare.

1588
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,100
Come town joke.

1589
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,060
Says, what was Maggie Cook's agenda?

1590
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,300
What was the schism in the circle of knowledge?

1591
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,500
Really all about.

1592
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,980
Her relationship with her father depreciated in value

1593
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,280
every single time something unnatural happened

1594
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,220
and that is what led her to come up with the idea

1595
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:25,980
to dethrone him and take over the circle of knowledge.

1596
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,920
So there were unnatural things happening

1597
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,580
before we blipped into existence as characters.

1598
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,420
That is correct.

1599
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:34,500
Because we found a bunch of notes about that schism

1600
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,820
happening previous to us.

1601
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,780
Gotcha, cool.

1602
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,020
Yeah.

1603
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:40,100
Modern Cannabis asks,

1604
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,060
what was the deal with Joe's parents?

1605
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,580
Why did they get the book?

1606
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,760
What was the deal with their hinting him

1607
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,380
about letters slash Wheel of Fortune?

1608
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,660
I may just have spaced something.

1609
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:54,620
What happened the day Joe was in the library?

1610
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,440
I don't know what the deal with Clark's parents is,

1611
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,780
but what's the deal with Joe's parents?

1612
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:00,620
Like Joe's parents, it's a whole ass episode.

1613
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,260
Yeah, we would need some time.

1614
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,500
You'll have to ask why they got the book

1615
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,780
or answer why they got the book.

1616
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,020
I can tell you what I think of as the day in the library

1617
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:16,020
was Clark Old, the overseer, protecting young Clark

1618
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,660
and knowing that that was a timeline

1619
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:18,780
that needed to continue.

1620
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,240
And that's why he chained the doors closed

1621
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:24,020
and created a distraction, a diversion

1622
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:29,020
to get the myriad away from those doors.

1623
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,300
Oh my God, dude, that was so cool.

1624
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,820
I just threw the vague back to Luke and mid answer,

1625
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:40,760
Joe just like snagged it out of the air one handed

1626
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,660
and then handed it to Luke and continued answering

1627
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:47,020
until we couldn't hold it in anymore.

1628
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,380
That was good, because it was like,

1629
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,520
really good answer though.

1630
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,380
And the deal with Joe's parents is just simply,

1631
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,860
they had the book, don't fucking worry about it.

1632
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,860
It's called the McGuffins.

1633
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,900
Yeah, exactly.

1634
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,180
My own thoughts on the way that his story,

1635
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,340
that Clark and the overseer storyline ended

1636
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:10,580
is that he was gonna go back and put the pieces in place

1637
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,780
that then set them in motion to end up where they ended up.

1638
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,940
So the book had to end up with Joe's parents.

1639
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,060
Is that a TV trope?

1640
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,180
With Clark's parents.

1641
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,180
And yes, you're 100% right about the day

1642
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,320
that Clark was in the library as a child.

1643
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,100
That is exactly what the overseer was there to do.

1644
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:31,140
But the overseer was always being chased by myriad.

1645
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,740
So let me hit the ATM.

1646
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,740
A great user name, says, well done guys.

1647
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,580
Thank you.

1648
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,400
Thanks.

1649
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,240
Thanks.

1650
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,080
Thank you.

1651
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,900
It's been a fun ride.

1652
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,740
Thank you.

1653
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:44,580
Thank you.

1654
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:45,400
Thanks.

1655
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,240
Thank you.

1656
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,300
My question is, what, if any,

1657
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,220
meaning did the actual vocal portion of the spells

1658
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,180
throughout the show have?

1659
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,320
Like, were they a specific language?

1660
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,900
Did they mean something aside from the spell?

1661
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,600
And the answer is slightly.

1662
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:03,460
Yeah, I used a Google translate to take words

1663
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,220
that I thought were meaningful to the spell.

1664
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:12,060
And then I Google translated them into fucking Swedish

1665
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:16,080
and then Arabic and then French and then Spanish

1666
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,240
and then Indonesian and then Dutch.

1667
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,940
And just like somewhere along the line,

1668
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:24,700
pulled out a syllable or two that I liked

1669
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,160
and then did it with the next word

1670
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,420
that also worked toward that spell.

1671
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,880
So if it was like time backwards,

1672
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,280
then I would do it with those two words

1673
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,280
and then put those combination of syllables together.

1674
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,960
And that's how I came up with the spell.

1675
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,800
Yeah.

1676
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,480
So that's how we used hyper geometry in season one.

1677
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:48,480
And I've been working on my magic engine for season two.

1678
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,040
And I'm pretty stoked about it.

1679
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:52,880
So.

1680
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,840
And I did the same with to do hakanu.

1681
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,220
Bacon Monkey says, listener from Thailand here.

1682
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:02,460
Thank you.

1683
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,280
Whoa.

1684
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,120
That's awesome.

1685
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:04,960
Very cool.

1686
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,200
And I love season one and congratulations

1687
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,940
on finishing it on such a high note.

1688
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:08,780
Thank you.

1689
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:09,600
Thank you.

1690
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,440
Thank you.

1691
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,280
Thank you.

1692
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,100
Thank you.

1693
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:12,940
Thank you.

1694
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,220
My question is a bit more pertaining

1695
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,460
to the behind the scenes stuff,

1696
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,220
but I wanted to know how you guys approach

1697
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,020
the various topics or directions

1698
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,100
that the characters will go through.

1699
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,420
I know a lot of the twists were surprises

1700
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,960
and I was wondering if you guys had to talk beforehand

1701
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,380
regarding what topics to avoid

1702
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:32,700
or if certain subjects were too sensitive for some people,

1703
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,580
or if a player didn't like a certain direction

1704
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,140
that the handler took their character down

1705
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,580
because it seemed like everyone took all the surprises

1706
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,100
in stride and strove to continue the story with them.

1707
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,060
And that really stood out to me.

1708
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,740
Excuse my shitty English, which.

1709
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,580
Your English was great.

1710
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,980
Your English was phenomenal.

1711
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,980
Alc underscore the underscore missed also added

1712
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,300
your English is fine.

1713
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,260
Thanks for popping in there to reassure

1714
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:00,920
this poster. Thanks.

1715
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:01,760
Yeah, for sure.

1716
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,420
So let's hit some of these points in here.

1717
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,420
We do talk about some stuff before,

1718
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:07,660
like, do we want to, like,

1719
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:10,140
we discuss some content beforehand,

1720
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,500
not necessarily like surprises that are going to happen

1721
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,360
to the characters that keeps that from us,

1722
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,500
but like we have pretty like serious

1723
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,540
and thoughtful discussions about what we do

1724
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:20,900
and don't want on the show.

1725
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,740
Yeah.

1726
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,320
We definitely have one-on-ones with Zach too

1727
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,780
that are like, hey, here's what I'm thinking.

1728
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:25,620
Exactly.

1729
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,440
He'll do that.

1730
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,020
Like I want to kind of do this with your character maybe

1731
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:28,860
or whatever.

1732
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:29,680
Yeah.

1733
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,900
Which even pre-recording,

1734
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,940
I specifically remember one day at work,

1735
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:36,460
I was, I texted all three of you when I was working

1736
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:41,460
the shitty job and I took my lunch break so seriously.

1737
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,720
And I would, I was at the time,

1738
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,620
I was just spending my lunch breaks,

1739
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:51,500
reading every post on the R slash Call of Cthulhu

1740
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,380
and R slash Delta Green subreddits.

1741
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,100
I went to top all time.

1742
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,480
And I read for like 10 pages on both of those,

1743
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:03,260
just consuming as much content as I could

1744
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:07,280
to try to try to get more info on how to be good at this.

1745
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:12,220
But I texted you guys something about your characters

1746
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,620
and Joe texted me back immediately.

1747
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:18,180
And then we literally started like role-playing

1748
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,860
like a solo thing with his character over text message

1749
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,700
on my lunch break to prepare for like the next session

1750
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:25,540
that was happening.

1751
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,020
So sick.

1752
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:31,460
Yeah, okay, you guys sexted, that's good brag.

1753
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,340
There's also a part of the question that says,

1754
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,860
if a player didn't like a certain direction

1755
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,380
that the handler was taking their character down,

1756
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,160
I never felt that way, but I also always felt comfortable

1757
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,520
if I needed to, to tell you that.

1758
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,580
I think you were receptive to anything we said.

1759
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,040
And I think there have been a couple of moments

1760
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,420
where we're like, I don't,

1761
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,940
I can't think of anything in particular,

1762
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:52,840
but it does feel like maybe we've done that.

1763
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,220
Yeah, I feel like at least before we recorded,

1764
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,960
there might've even been a couple of times

1765
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,480
where just mid campaign,

1766
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,340
you might come up to me and be like, hey.

1767
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,180
I'm Irish now.

1768
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,020
I'm Irish now.

1769
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,600
Meaning to talk more about it in character,

1770
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,860
if you could kind of prompt it in the role-playing.

1771
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,420
Like Joe said, that's my hope obviously,

1772
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,720
is that you guys feel comfortable coming to me

1773
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,800
with any concerns that you have.

1774
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,880
There's nothing so sacred that I would feel

1775
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,040
like I couldn't say, hey,

1776
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,660
I don't know if this is what I want.

1777
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,700
I hope you feel comfortable coming to me,

1778
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,600
Zach lustily texted Joe.

1779
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:35,300
Luke and Thomas read Joe and Zach's sex ASMR style.

1780
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,360
Yeah, that's the ultimate Patreon goal.

1781
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,900
Yeah.

1782
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,880
And then as far as like hot topics go,

1783
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,520
we've been friends for a long time and like-

1784
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,560
We all know kind of.

1785
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,000
Yeah, we know our boundaries, I think.

1786
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,860
Oh yeah, we also wouldn't be friends

1787
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,500
if we didn't have like the same general values.

1788
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,980
Yeah.

1789
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:59,300
I like respect you guys as people.

1790
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,140
Yeah.

1791
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,660
And I wouldn't, if you were gonna joke about stuff

1792
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,180
that I wasn't comfortable with.

1793
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,300
Yeah, for sure.

1794
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,540
All people as people.

1795
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,140
Exactly, which is-

1796
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,140
It's a really, really basic concept.

1797
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,900
It's like so simple.

1798
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:16,600
It's just like really, really easy and super cool to do.

1799
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,260
Jacob pegging, nope.

1800
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:25,500
I see where you're going for there.

1801
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,660
Jacob pepping.

1802
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:29,300
Pepping, Jacob pepping just says,

1803
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,220
love the show, only actual play to really grab me

1804
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:35,940
and drag me down into the ooze and never let me go.

1805
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,780
Thank you.

1806
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:37,620
Thank you.

1807
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:38,440
Erotic.

1808
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,280
Yeah, that's great.

1809
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,680
If everyone had to pick a moment from the show,

1810
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:42,520
what would it be?

1811
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,980
Coolest, funniest, most memorable, or just most nuts?

1812
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,520
There's tons.

1813
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,740
Most recently.

1814
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,940
Yeah, man.

1815
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:51,980
The Keith turn.

1816
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:55,420
I think the Keith turn had us all like dying.

1817
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:56,260
It was incredible.

1818
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,300
That was nuts.

1819
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,340
Yeah, that was so fucking insane.

1820
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,300
That was a really, that was a really good one.

1821
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,620
The death of Anne Love.

1822
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:07,180
I was gonna say that for me, for sure.

1823
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:10,020
Really important, the way that that all went down

1824
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,940
and the fight with John and Clark,

1825
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:16,940
like the roles just happened the way that told a fun story.

1826
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,080
Yeah.

1827
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,240
I really loved the robot fight we had.

1828
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,600
I was like, dude, this is sick.

1829
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,440
That was one of the most intense things, I think,

1830
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,540
like as a player that I felt like-

1831
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,560
Are you talking about in the house?

1832
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,580
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1833
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,200
Where I was like, oh, we're gonna die.

1834
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,040
Like this is-

1835
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,520
Yeah, yeah, right, totally.

1836
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,320
I don't know how to fight this robot.

1837
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,720
Your guys' eyes, like each of your eyes,

1838
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,360
when I described the top half of that robot

1839
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,080
breaking off from the bottom half,

1840
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,320
probably like put another plus five years

1841
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,920
of role-playing for Zach, like.

1842
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,760
Yep.

1843
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,280
I'm chasing those eyes.

1844
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,600
I saw the look in their eyes

1845
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,440
and I've been chasing that feeling ever since.

1846
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,280
And you gave us just an old man

1847
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,040
shitting himself the whole time, too?

1848
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:01,880
Yeah.

1849
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,400
Not the plan I had for Randy Angst.

1850
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,840
You guys were so aggressive about the guns with him.

1851
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,360
That seems like so long ago.

1852
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:18,400
It was so long ago we did that, but that was dope.

1853
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,120
Thomas, is there like a moment

1854
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,640
from the season one of pretending to be people

1855
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,980
that when you think about the show,

1856
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,720
like reaches out to you as a particular moment?

1857
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,800
No, I'm way more into the later seasons.

1858
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,000
Well, for me, for you as a role player,

1859
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,080
I can think of two specifically.

1860
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,720
One, Martin Cupertino, trying to convince the group

1861
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:42,680
that he was in the right about where to go

1862
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,780
when you guys were in the woods

1863
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,340
and looking for the door.

1864
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:50,340
And you had a much lower skill in survival

1865
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,100
than the alternative,

1866
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:57,060
which was the archeologist played by Joe.

1867
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:58,900
Whose name was?

1868
01:14:58,900 --> 01:14:59,720
I don't remember his name.

1869
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,560
I don't either.

1870
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,400
I don't either.

1871
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,660
And it was not Angela.

1872
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,340
Angie, Angie, Angie.

1873
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,600
Which that cracked me up when I was like,

1874
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,300
hey, can I name your wife, Angela?

1875
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,840
And you're like, yeah, whatever, whatever you want to do.

1876
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,040
And then I was like, ha ha ha.

1877
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,040
It's Anne Love, motherfucker, mommy fucker.

1878
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,280
If I remember right, did that reveal happen

1879
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,240
off the podcast, didn't it?

1880
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,080
To me.

1881
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,720
Oh, I think it might've.

1882
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,040
I think it might've.

1883
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,760
I think I wasn't recording when you put two and two together.

1884
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,760
Gloating three AMS, by the way, idiot.

1885
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,840
Idiot.

1886
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,960
Shouldn't have let me name your wife.

1887
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,640
And then the other one for Thomas is,

1888
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,320
when you decided that,

1889
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,560
when you passed a sanity check in the Old West Arc

1890
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,480
and you said, no, I don't want to be sane,

1891
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,520
and then just grabbed the head of the preacher,

1892
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,000
chair of Dr. Bobby Custard,

1893
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
and started moving his mouth and talking through his head.

1894
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:01,980
That was another.

1895
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,560
Thanks.

1896
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,680
And then additionally, I'll throw up one more

1897
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,320
just because we're on the topic and I'm thinking of it.

1898
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,680
When you threw Drew Andrews against the wall,

1899
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,040
when it was just me and you,

1900
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,560
and you threatened his life.

1901
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,880
Oh, yeah.

1902
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,020
If he fucked you over on the cocaine deal,

1903
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,680
that was really intense.

1904
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,520
By the way, Drew-

1905
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,080
I just thought about what I would do to you, Zach,

1906
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,500
if you tried to screw me out of our cocaine deal.

1907
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,220
Drew was not adamant,

1908
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,940
but he did throw out the idea top of like,

1909
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:45,260
okay, so this much money split four ways.

1910
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:48,500
And Thomas was like, no.

1911
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,360
Two ways, Drew.

1912
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,660
Drew was definitely, in my head,

1913
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:57,860
like I thought I was going to be able to rope all of you

1914
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,340
into being the worst fucking cops.

1915
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,140
Oh, which you did on your own for the most part.

1916
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,560
Keith would have probably been in,

1917
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,320
but then when we found Fergie Beans,

1918
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,500
it might've just instantly gone to gunfire.

1919
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,860
Oh, that would have been-

1920
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,020
That would have been really cool.

1921
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:14,520
That was the reveal that I was hoping for

1922
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,900
is the four of you out there for a drug deal

1923
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,520
and then Keith's fucking brother shows up

1924
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,020
with a van full of android kids.

1925
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:26,980
At the same time, imagine the Keith that we know

1926
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:29,220
is essentially the villain of this whole story.

1927
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:31,700
Definitely the villain of this whole story.

1928
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:35,260
Getting like a million dollars and some change

1929
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:39,380
to fund those dreams earlier than, you know,

1930
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:40,980
then he might've otherwise realized them.

1931
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,300
I don't think it's a, it wouldn't be prudent.

1932
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,460
It wouldn't be prudent.

1933
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,820
To quote a relevant and popular sketch

1934
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,840
from a relevant and popular show.

1935
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:55,280
A highlight of Keith was being Silas Cole.

1936
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,780
Yes, that was super fucking fun.

1937
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:01,260
The orchestration of his brother's murder.

1938
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,580
Yeah, that was really fucking good.

1939
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:07,400
Your Wild West character was also fantastic.

1940
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,560
Ephraim Corland and then the turn that Ephraim

1941
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,140
got to take where you got got first

1942
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:16,180
and then were able to take them down

1943
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:19,740
is another key role-playing moment that-

1944
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,140
That was great.

1945
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,260
That actually is like, I was like,

1946
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:26,300
oh my fucking God, I'm such a goddamn idiot.

1947
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,180
I'm the dumbest man alive.

1948
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,980
Man, being a player is fucking hard.

1949
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,540
Come on guys, come on in and look at this.

1950
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:40,780
Like in D&D, you literally played the hero of the story

1951
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:45,060
and you know that like the story is on your side.

1952
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:48,540
Right, in Delta Green, you're not like supposed to win.

1953
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,700
No, anything you do.

1954
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,560
This is why DMs like it so much

1955
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,780
because it's literally like, yeah, like maybe they'll win,

1956
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,900
but it's still gonna let you get

1957
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,300
your sick little rocks off.

1958
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,180
That's why he brought bringing us back.

1959
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:05,020
He still gets to tell the man, really do it somehow.

1960
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,660
It's like, I killed him, yes.

1961
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,060
Oh no, what have I done?

1962
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:10,860
Post kill clarity.

1963
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,100
I gotta bring him back, I gotta bring him back.

1964
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,300
Load up the mausoleum.

1965
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:22,340
So thank you all so much for listening

1966
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,460
through this first Q&A.

1967
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,060
We're gonna do one more to finish out

1968
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,420
the rest of these questions that everybody asked.

1969
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,060
I think we got through exactly half of them.

1970
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,060
Yeah, hell yeah, we got through exactly half

1971
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,920
and we'll come back with Justin next week

1972
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,500
to answer the remaining questions that you all have

1973
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,180
and thank you.

1974
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,020
Thanks for listening.

1975
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:40,980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1976
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,820
If you've listened this far, whoa.

1977
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,100
Whoa.

1978
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,760
Yeah, whoa and also do tune in next week

1979
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,420
with the exciting conclusion

1980
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:52,460
of the question Zach was gonna ask us.

1981
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,980
Oh yeah, I haven't been teased it.

1982
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:57,300
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you guys.

1983
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:58,940
I'm gonna eat a woman, a woman.

1984
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,580
Sorry, sorry."

1985
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,500
I know you really can't.

1986
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,240
Another one, there's a scene where you videos

1987
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,460
pace game sort of tennis cinematography.

1988
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,540
That's different from competing to competing.

1989
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,220
It would be insane if we missed several videos

1990
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,300
with some contradictoryuns.

1991
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,640
I thought that was just funny to me too.

1992
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,080
That's right, we got O Edge on theMoment.

1993
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,460
What do you think about O Edge?

1994
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:21,700
O Edge, the moment of that edict Jesse

1995
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,040
or whatever your point is,

1996
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,580
where'd the audience go?

1997
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:32,340
How am I the only one trying to fool all?

1998
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:41,340
How can you have enough drowning out of the notes?

1999
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:47,340
There's no point in going.

2000
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:55,340
No point going.

2001
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:58,340
Fly to fly to stream.
