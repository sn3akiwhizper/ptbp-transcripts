1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
What is happening my students?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,300
It's your professor of wolf studies, Wolf, the dog.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,520
And I'm here to lecture you about the various bones

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,780
that wolves like me possess.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,720
How much cream is in the body?

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,080
How much grease the fur retains?

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,360
You know, college stuff.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,360
And I am teaching it you live from 694.2 PTBP,

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,320
the only radio show that delves into factual things

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,080
regarding wolf the dog biology, my babies.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,760
Speaking of knowledge, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,960
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf was sent by Derek

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,040
from the RGV, the Rio Grande Valley.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,380
They write, howdy y'all.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,320
Big shout out from South Texas

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,940
to all the PTBP peeps near and far.

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,000
Can't wait to get back to the boys in contention.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,920
And finally get to the bottom of this mystery.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,320
Don't get me wrong, all this timey wimey stuff

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,100
is fun and all, but boy howdy does it give me a headache.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,440
If only there was a handy dandy recap

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,240
that retold these events in a succinct but thorough fashion.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,660
Anyways, stay safe out there.

24
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,120
Lots of love to the PTBP crew

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,080
and a big eye woo to wolf the dog.

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,860
Thanks for writing in Derek from the Rio Grande Valley.

27
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,040
I hope one day to visit this mystical Texas

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,920
that I've heard so much about.

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,320
It sounds like a place that a wolf really could lay down

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,560
a garbage nest to lay many eggs in.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,240
Anyway, if you wanna write up a little something

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,780
for your wolfy wolfy to howl howl,

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,560
tag us on the internet at PretendingPod

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,840
or write a five star review on Apple Podcasts.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,520
And send us a screenshot at pretendedpod at gmail.com.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,360
And if you want 23 bonus episodes,

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,520
become a citizen of contention for $5 a month

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,280
over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,620
The link is in the show notes.

40
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,040
There's a recording of the session zero

41
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,680
for building contention and brainstorming PC ideas.

42
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,200
There's some Q and A's,

43
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,980
there's some really silly one shots

44
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,660
and 10 of the episodes tied together in an ongoing story

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,200
that has featured 11 different agents

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,200
due to the brutal approach Zach has leaned

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,500
into this more delta greenie, delta green campaign.

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,420
All of which is homebrew except

49
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,100
for the wonderfully disgusting scenario lover in the ice.

50
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,960
But I'll stop peddling so y'all don't snooze.

51
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,340
You know where I'm heading, it's time for the news.

52
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,700
Last time, our three leading men came to

53
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,340
in the darkness of Ari Manstein's mausoleum again.

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,720
That's number four, if I remember correctly.

55
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,740
And every single name on their bodies has been crossed out.

56
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,780
After Keith revealed he went back in time,

57
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,220
became Silas Cole and invented ball.

58
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,040
Well, John got real angsty

59
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,740
and poured out some pent up daddy issues

60
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,780
while in his dad's body.

61
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,780
The trio called an Uber and headed off to contention

62
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,780
to nab the book on the way to calm comfy campgrounds

63
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,120
to confront Maggie Cook.

64
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,660
But the driver Spud in his vintage Volkswagen van

65
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,140
couldn't evade the goo-nami

66
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,020
that first consumed the bodies of Councilwoman Carrie Pages

67
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,620
and Salem the cat atop a familiar four wheeler

68
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,860
with an odd radio on the back

69
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,460
before it eventually swallowed

70
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,460
our narratively central characters as well.

71
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,540
Same fucking shit got me too, goddamn goo.

72
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,340
And now I can't see my pa in front of my ma,

73
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,060
but I can hear, oh, I can hear.

74
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,940
Be eternally grateful that you can too,

75
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,340
if only for the privilege of blessing your body

76
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,760
and the space between your functional ears

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
with this impossible to over-hype song.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,040
And if I'm not right, then it's best to be wrong.

79
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,480
It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In?

80
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,480
["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]

81
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,600
Bad girls on top of the water

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,800
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Leaving my mind at your altar

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,960
Crossing the double line

85
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,480
Doing it every time

86
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Tell me what kind of world are you living in

87
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,280
What kind of world are you living in

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,920
So I've realized we kind of have a finite number of episodes left

89
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,200
before we start on like a new story

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,360
and people might be like listening to it for the first time.

91
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,600
We only have so many intros where people have already listened

92
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,480
to like a hundred episodes of this probably

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
if they're listening to this.

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,520
So we can say some pretty messed up stuff

95
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,880
and they'll keep listening.

96
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,240
So I looked up on Quora

97
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,080
what are the most inappropriate questions to ask people.

98
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,780
So Joe, are you pregnant?

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,840
Yes.

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,080
Luke, are you wearing a wig?

101
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,920
Yes.

102
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,160
And Thomas, were you in jail because you murdered someone?

103
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,920
Some ones, but yes.

104
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,080
Someone's what?

105
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,720
Some's one.

106
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,200
I have a legitimate question though.

107
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,120
Put it on Quora.

108
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,920
Will it feel like if I put orchids in my bong and smoke it?

109
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,960
Why on earth would I do that?

110
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,840
Here's the deal.

111
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,560
I have over 500 orchids

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,760
and not one of them will get anyone high.

113
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,280
So the other day you posted a thing on Instagram.

114
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,640
You were like my favorite corner of the house.

115
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,920
Yeah.

116
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,360
You just kind of didn't mention that they were all

117
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,400
it was a picture of plants, but they're all mine.

118
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Wow.

119
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,540
That's stolen valor.

120
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,380
I did not.

121
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,380
That's stolen valor and I'd like an apology.

122
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,380
I'm not going to apologize because nowhere in that post

123
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,340
did I say that they were mine.

124
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,140
They exist in my house and what I posted was

125
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,900
this is the best corner of the living room, which is true.

126
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,660
I did not say these are mine.

127
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,700
So I'm not apologizing.

128
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,020
Plant emoji and then a colon and then tag.

129
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,260
Not going to happen.

130
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,100
I'm going to comment on there right now.

131
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,380
These are all mine.

132
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,380
Thomas, how many plants do you have now?

133
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,380
He has over 500 orchids and they're not going to get anyone high.

134
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,380
I have over 500 orchids.

135
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,380
No, I do have like 20 orchids and a bunch of other plants.

136
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,380
Were you in jail because you murdered someone?

137
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,380
Some's one, but yes.

138
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,380
Adam's cane.

139
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,380
The orchids bring me peace.

140
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,380
I have like 10 full size orchids and then 10 of those are real tiny.

141
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,380
They're little mini orchids.

142
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,380
It's not like I'm crazy.

143
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,380
They're actually all mine is the thing.

144
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,380
That's the deal.

145
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
That's the deal.

146
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,380
I got some orchids.

147
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,380
You got some orchids.

148
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
I got some orchids.

149
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,380
I got some orchids.

150
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
I got some orchids.

151
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
I got some orchids.

152
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Oh, you got some?

153
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
I got some orchids, but I got some orchids.

154
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
You got some orchids.

155
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,380
That's the deal.

156
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
That's the other deal.

157
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Luke takes care of them all.

158
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,380
Yeah, I do all the work.

159
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Luke, I watered your orchids yesterday.

160
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Thank you.

161
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,380
You're welcome.

162
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Luke does have two orchids.

163
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,380
I sprayed the orchids the other day and I watered my little palm tree.

164
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,380
That's what he calls his penis.

165
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,380
I was in jail because I put my orchids in a bong and smoked it.

166
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,380
Should we start the episode or should we talk about cat suck house?

167
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:20,380
You begin falling upward through a technicolor swirl composed of unnatural hues your eyes

168
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,380
cannot quite comprehend while at the same time completely dark.

169
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,380
The nothingness is endless and you feel content physically.

170
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,380
It's a familiar feeling, one you felt upon each of your resets in Ari Manstein's Mausoleum

171
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:46,380
and above you in the direction you're weightlessly falling is nothing but the complete absence of light.

172
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:54,380
Somehow both a maelstrom of overstimulation and a wholly empty void.

173
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,380
Do we have our faculties about us?

174
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,380
Seemingly.

175
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Completely warped, completely confused.

176
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,380
You see that John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth has rolled himself up into a ball

177
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,380
and he is floating up alongside with you as is.

178
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,380
Do they see that?

179
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Are you rolled up like a ball?

180
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,380
I thought we couldn't see anything.

181
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,380
Oh you can't but you can clearly see each other.

182
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,380
That's a thing.

183
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:23,380
You can't see anything but you are all seeing each other as well as this weird light around you

184
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:30,380
that is the most colorful thing you've ever seen, hues you've never experienced and it's also completely pitch dark.

185
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,380
Cool. Cool.

186
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,380
And you're all there.

187
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
And you're falling upward.

188
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,380
Endlessly.

189
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,380
And who else is there but Spud?

190
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,380
I had no shit, went to middle school with a kid named Spud.

191
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
Really?

192
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Yeah.

193
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,380
Oh.

194
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,380
This is where I should say shout out to Bip from Hebo, Oregon.

195
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
Hebo?

196
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,380
For giving us Reginald.

197
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,380
You cut out a little bit when you said your name.

198
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
Arthur McKenzie.

199
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,380
I didn't hear it.

200
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,380
Bip from Hebo, Oregon.

201
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,380
I also did not hear the name again.

202
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,380
Let's say Hebo, let's not say Hebo.

203
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,380
That sounds like somebody just slipped a slur past us.

204
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,380
What if the name is really Hebo though?

205
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,380
I think it's better safe than sorry.

206
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,380
Bet you're going to have to beep all of this out dude.

207
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,380
Yeah.

208
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,380
Dude, holy shit, the population of Hebo is 182.

209
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Wow.

210
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Small town.

211
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,380
They're a small town Bip.

212
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,380
I was born in a small town.

213
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,380
It's not even a town, it's an unincorporated census designated place.

214
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,380
In Tillamook County.

215
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,380
I bet it's beautiful there.

216
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,380
There's definitely something, this is where crazy shit would happen.

217
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,380
Yeah, it's named after Mount Hebo, there's a Mount Hebo Air Force base.

218
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,380
Now he's saying it.

219
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,380
Yeah dude, come on man.

220
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,380
Was the site of the Mount Hebo Air Force base until it closed in 1980.

221
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,380
So haunted Air Force base.

222
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,380
I wonder why it closed.

223
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,380
I wonder why it closed.

224
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,380
Find out on the next arc of our Patreon Delta Green game.

225
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:14,380
Guys, did you know 7.4% of the population there is 18 to 24.

226
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,380
Do you guys want to clap in to reset yourselves?

227
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,380
Sure.

228
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,380
Zach, have you fucking started having your classes of six year olds clap in to calm them

229
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
down?

230
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,380
No, do you guys want to sing what I sing?

231
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,380
Everyone's sitting nicely.

232
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,380
Everyone's sitting nicely.

233
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,380
Thank you.

234
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,380
And then I go around and I tell them each good job with their name and I give them a

235
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,380
high five and a low five.

236
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,380
Okay, but yeah, can you fucking resolve that melody though?

237
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,380
Nope.

238
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,380
So as you guys are literally falling upwards.

239
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,380
Keith is kind of content because he knows it's not actually happening to him.

240
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,380
You feel very physically content.

241
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,380
Physical distance wise, can I move?

242
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,380
Am I able to get closer to anybody in any way?

243
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,380
Oh yeah, and like the minute you get closer you're super far away from them and then you're

244
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,380
right next to them.

245
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
It's all kind of happening at the same time.

246
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,380
You're very much moving wherever you want to and further away.

247
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,380
That's cool.

248
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:19,380
The disconnect between the physical contentment he feels, the breakdown between his mind and

249
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:27,380
his body, not to mention the time and spatial anomalies means John Lee Pettymore just barfs

250
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,380
into this blackness.

251
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,380
All of a sudden the barf that is floating into this void turns the same color that you're

252
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,380
seeing all around this, which is this insane inky black darkness that is coming out of

253
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
you and the rest of you see it too.

254
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,380
It's the ooze that's coming out of John Lee Kevin Moore, the thirst mouth as he vomits,

255
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,380
but the ooze is like lighting up with sparks of this unnatural color that is just like

256
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,380
abreasting your eyes.

257
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,380
You have no idea how to handle this and your brain is essentially just like fucking melting

258
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,380
because it is just a complete overstimulation and at the same time physically you feel more

259
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,380
calm than you ever have in your life, maybe next to the time that you were commanded to

260
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,380
feel calm by that giant, gaunt, translucent skinned man.

261
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,380
God damn it, that fucking Uber driver was one of them things.

262
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,380
Whoa!

263
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,380
He says as he floats in and out of your view simultaneously.

264
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,380
Oh, well maybe not.

265
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,380
Hey, hey man.

266
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,380
You see that his pants are made out of a similar patchy material with all the clothes and you've

267
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,380
brought this character with you into the next part of the story.

268
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
Whoa, dude.

269
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Fuck.

270
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
Is he laughing like that?

271
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,380
Yeah.

272
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,380
Is he feeling good about it?

273
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,380
Shit.

274
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,380
Yeah, dude.

275
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,380
Oh, man.

276
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,380
Why are you saying he though?

277
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,380
It's weird, man.

278
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,380
Is he feeling weird about it?

279
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,380
And he points at you and as he's pointing at you, you see that he's pointing at Keith

280
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,380
and he's pointing at John at the same time and he's kind of pointing at himself with

281
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,380
four fingers because that's what happens when you point a finger and he's like, dude,

282
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,380
dude.

283
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,380
What?

284
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,380
You see John looking at his fingers as he's pointing and he's like, holy shit, that's

285
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,380
right.

286
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,380
Except it's only three fingers that point back, not four.

287
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,380
It's true.

288
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,380
No, there's a fourth finger and there's not.

289
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:30,380
Keith reaches up to buckle his seatbelt and is concerned when it's not there.

290
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,380
It's not.

291
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,380
And as your hand reaches out, there's like a trail behind it of this color, like a like

292
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,380
tracer, like on the back of a bullet in a video game or something.

293
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
I don't know if that happens in real life.

294
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,380
I've never seen a bullet moving or not moving.

295
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,380
And as your hand moves, it's just like this crazy color scheme is just like failing behind

296
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
it.

297
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,380
Like you just won solitaire.

298
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,380
Thomas, you're going to say something about bullets?

299
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
Yeah.

300
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:08,380
Tracer, tracers happen when you have tracer rounds, which are bullets that are specially

301
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,380
designed to have a chem trail, have a chem trail.

302
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
Is that what's doing it?

303
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380
Yeah.

304
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,380
Yeah.

305
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,380
You all see a series of scenes play out around you, the subjects in settings, like a hologram

306
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,380
made of the same unnatural light.

307
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,380
First, you see the sanctuary of the first church of contention decorated for a funeral.

308
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,380
Two coffins are closed up in front of the lectern with pictures of the deceased burn

309
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,380
victims on either side.

310
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:47,380
Adam Cain's parents looked happy in their wedding photo, but somehow even more joyful

311
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:53,380
in a JCPenney photo shoot with a smiling, toothless baby Adam Cain.

312
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:59,380
The orphaned boy with black eyes and a balloon head sneaks slowly out of a conversation with

313
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,380
extended relatives before running quickly for a closet door.

314
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,380
He does not, however, find the solace he seeks.

315
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Rather, he finds himself in this small, dark space cluttered with old hymnals and extra

316
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,380
candles, one of which is lit.

317
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,380
And the orange light illuminates the face of a crazed, heartbroken Clark Bishop.

318
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,380
Nice.

319
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:29,380
He is not much older than he is here in this vacuum seemingly outside both time and space.

320
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:36,380
Clark reaches out and tucks a note into the inside pocket of Adam Cain's blazer previously

321
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,380
only worn on Easter and Christmas Sunday.

322
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,380
The closet suddenly goes dark.

323
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,380
The balloon-headed boy pulls the metal chain attached to the singular bulb above and finds

324
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,380
himself alone with the spare songbooks and vigil lights.

325
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:58,380
He pulls out the note, unfolds it, and you all see a list of directions.

326
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:04,380
Underlined at the top is the sentence, one day, years from now, it will be imperative

327
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,380
that you replace Keith Vigna as Silas Cole, the founder of contention.

328
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,380
Step one outlines where to find and how to use the strange helmet Cain eventually bought

329
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,380
at Forgotten Treasures.

330
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,380
Step two includes an incantation that claims to change the shape of water.

331
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,380
Step three discusses the properties of the ooze and its relationship with fish and fish-filled

332
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,380
water.

333
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Finally, at the bottom, it simply reads, I'm real sorry about your family.

334
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,380
That's crazy.

335
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,380
You don't want to change the shape of water because that film was very of its moment and

336
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,380
obviously it won the awards it won because of that.

337
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,380
And I think if you mess with that formula, it's just not going to be the same.

338
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,380
I mean, obviously it doesn't necessarily hold up to a lot of scrutiny, but come on, you

339
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,380
know.

340
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,380
The set design was just delightful.

341
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,380
Other than that, that's insane.

342
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,380
Literally, John Lee, Kevin Moore III, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna, seemingly as well

343
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,380
as this other man, Spud, witnessed this.

344
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,380
Are we physically seeing a scene play out before us in those moments or is it something

345
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,380
that's happening internally with us?

346
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
Oh no, it's external.

347
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,380
You can kind of see each other through and around it as well.

348
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,380
At the same time, you can't.

349
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,380
You're very much standing in that closet with them.

350
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,380
But you're also falling upward through this fucking bifrost.

351
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,380
Bifrost?

352
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Yeah.

353
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,380
What does that mean?

354
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,380
Yeah, tell us more about that.

355
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Where did you just let slip out?

356
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
It's just what that thing is.

357
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,380
It's a Thor thing.

358
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
The bifrost is how they get around.

359
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
Damn it.

360
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
It's a nerd.

361
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
Mythology.

362
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,380
It's a nerd thing?

363
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,380
No, it's not nerdy.

364
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,380
It's Norse mythology.

365
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Is it?

366
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
It's pronounced bifrost.

367
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
Yeah, it is.

368
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Bifrost is the rainbow bridge that connects Asgard with Midgard.

369
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Duh.

370
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,380
It's real.

371
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
That's amazing.

372
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,380
I thought you were talking about something.

373
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,380
Wait, it's actually real?

374
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,380
It's real.

375
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,380
I thought we were talking about some bullshit that's fake.

376
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,380
I just meant that it's actual Norse mythology, not some Marvel shit.

377
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,380
So it's called beef roast?

378
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
It's called bifroast?

379
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,380
Beef roast.

380
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,380
Like Arby's.

381
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,380
Beef roast.

382
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:32,380
And as you're in this beef roast, just crock potting away, you do see, you're still looking

383
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:37,380
at this letter that says, I'm real sorry about your family.

384
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:45,380
The letters of the word family morph into the city skyline, but an out of place, massive

385
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,380
circle is moving quickly up toward the top of one of the tallest buildings.

386
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,380
Your view approaches in time to catch planet juggernaut with its two wild eyed partners

387
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:02,380
in tow, fling itself from the towering high rise, reach out with its powerful hands and

388
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:08,380
slam two helicopters together like a kid playing recklessly with sturdy toys.

389
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:15,380
Instantly, this wily child dons a helicopter hat as blades begin chopping the air above

390
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:22,380
the gigantic ball that lifts into the sky and slowly disappears into the horizon.

391
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:29,380
Your view zooms into the distance until it is engulfed in an ivory endlessness before

392
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:36,380
the experienced hand of one Vanna White touches it gently and a letter appears.

393
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:43,380
You all see John Lee Kevinmore, the third laying lazily, lying lazily on Clark's couch,

394
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,380
absolutely crushing wheel of fortune.

395
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:53,380
And then in the distance, fast approaching, you hear the whir of helicopter blades as

396
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:00,380
something massive and round blocks out the sun that previously poured into the windows

397
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,380
of the Bishop house.

398
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
Holy shit.

399
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:12,380
If we were to like reach out and try to interact with this, what happens?

400
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,380
Your hand kind of moves through it and does the same like tracer thing where it's just

401
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,380
like multiple versions of your hand are seen moving through it and the color displaces

402
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,380
and replaces and it's next to you.

403
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,380
It's behind you.

404
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
It's through you.

405
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,380
You're inside of it.

406
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,380
If you looked over at him, you would see John weeping, but it does seem like big, warm,

407
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
happy tears.

408
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,380
What is the puzzle?

409
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,380
What is the puzzle?

410
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
Like what is the word?

411
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:44,380
Um, yeah, the, um, the puzzle is, um, meet me in St. Louis Armstrong.

412
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,380
That's a good one.

413
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,380
Nice way to pull that out.

414
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,380
This guy is like in there with you and he's like, whoa, is that you?

415
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,380
And he's like looking at both of you as, as this happens.

416
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
He's like, what the fuck?

417
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:05,380
John wipes the tear from his eyes and he's like, it was, it might be again.

418
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
I think it's a version of us.

419
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,380
I think it is an us that was, it's not now we're, we're here, right?

420
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,380
And I try and touch somebody, whoever's nearest.

421
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,380
Can I put, can I make contact with someone?

422
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,380
I also am reaching out to touch spud and see if he's real.

423
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,380
You both absolutely feel real physical contact and as well, your hand moves through them

424
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,380
completely, but it's also very real.

425
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,380
So fucking cool.

426
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,380
It is, but it's not.

427
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,380
And then at the same time is.

428
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,380
Does his pillowy touch bring bud to an ivory andlessness?

429
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,380
Spud.

430
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,380
Yeah.

431
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,380
And no.

432
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,380
In case you said velvety for Vanna White.

433
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,380
Here's a line reading of me saying velvety.

434
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Velvety?

435
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,380
I didn't, but that was good.

436
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,380
Punch that in.

437
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,380
What did you say?

438
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Experienced hand.

439
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,380
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

440
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,380
Shut the fuck up.

441
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,380
Does his experienced hand bring him to an ivory andlessness?

442
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:23,380
Dude, an experienced hand has brought me to an ivory andlessness so many times.

443
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Oh my God.

444
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,380
Oh man.

445
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,380
Oh fuck.

446
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,380
The shadows cast by the imminent.

447
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,380
Oh, sorry.

448
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,380
Keith pulls his phone out to see like on the Uber app, like where he is.

449
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
You're like 2.2 now?

450
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,380
No, I'm at like physically the location of where he is.

451
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,380
You can see it dropping.

452
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,380
Yeah, he's like rating you on his phone.

453
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,380
He's like, this is the craziest Uber ride.

454
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,380
Not the most charismatic partner through eternity.

455
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,380
So far.

456
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,380
Where does it say we are though?

457
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,380
Oh, your phone.

458
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,380
When you look at your phone, you see your reflection is Silas Cole.

459
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380
Oh shit.

460
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
Fuck yeah.

461
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,380
Guys, what do I look like?

462
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
I look at him.

463
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,380
He's wearing stupid shorts and a stupid shirt and he looks like his stupid fucking self.

464
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,380
You look like your stupid fucking self, Keith.

465
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,380
Look, and I show him my phone trying to show him my reflection.

466
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,380
You see an old grizzled version of yourself wearing a hood over the top as the overseer

467
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,380
that you've seen so many times and a light begins beaming out of your face.

468
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,380
What do I look like?

469
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,380
What do I look like?

470
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,380
And I start feeling my own head.

471
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,380
You look like you.

472
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,380
What do I look like in Keith's magic phone?

473
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,380
I show my magic phone to John Lee Pettymore.

474
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
You don't see anything.

475
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,380
He peers deeply, yeah.

476
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,380
His eyes are bulgy and he's trying so hard to see something in the phone screen.

477
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,380
It eventually zooms out to encapsulate all of Planet Juggernaut.

478
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,380
John Lee Pettymore experiences a high freehandlessness.

479
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,380
I want to show the phone to Spud and see what he sees.

480
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,380
What?

481
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,380
What do you see, man?

482
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Dude, it's me.

483
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,380
That's nuts.

484
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,380
You look about like you expected.

485
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,380
I mean, who are we really?

486
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,380
Sometimes I just like stand in the mirror and stare for as long as I can until my eyes

487
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,380
are the only thing I can really see and the rest just kind of fades away.

488
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,380
And then I slowly move my head back and forth from side to side but try to keep my eyes

489
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,380
in like the same spot.

490
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
It's fucking crazy, man.

491
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,380
Alright Spud, we'll check back in with you later.

492
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:03,380
The shadows cast by the imminent Planet Juggernaut form a thick metal blast door in a dank, dimly

493
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,380
lit subterranean laboratory.

494
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:12,380
Keith Vigna stands on the outside wearing clothes that fit in around 1880-something

495
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:18,380
and jots in a notebook as he looks through a porthole where you all see Tildy B. Mitchell's

496
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,380
body convulsing on the floor.

497
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:27,380
Her leg is stabbing into the cement ground rhythmically as it turns into a piece of machinery

498
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,380
on a beautiful sunny day at the Contention Mining Company.

499
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:38,380
As Keith Beans walks past his workers and into his office, he's met with hearty greetings.

500
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,380
Good day, boss.

501
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
How do you do, sir?

502
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
Take care, Mr. Cole.

503
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:49,380
You watch as the physique changes around the mouth making the greeting and see a rotund,

504
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,380
sweat-covered man finish the previous thought like a before and after on Wheel of Fortune

505
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,380
as he says,

506
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Mr. Cole needs to be taken care of.

507
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380
Fucking impeccable.

508
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,380
That's an artist right there.

509
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
That's a professional artist right there.

510
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,380
Oh, it's like, it feels bad.

511
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,380
It hurts.

512
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,380
Did you hear that?

513
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,380
Oh, my God.

514
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
Some of it came back out.

515
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,380
It was so gurgly.

516
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,380
I think you need to wipe.

517
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,380
I literally had spindrift in my mouth on that burp.

518
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,380
Oh, God.

519
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,380
I'm so glad you didn't just puke onto your microphone just now.

520
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,380
It sounds like you aspirated some spindrift.

521
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,380
Oh, my God.

522
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,380
I'm so glad you didn't just puke onto your microphone just now.

523
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,380
It sounds like you aspirated some spindrift.

524
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,380
Oh, my God.

525
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,380
I'm so glad you didn't just puke onto your microphone just now.

526
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,380
Did you go to jail for murdering some 41?

527
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,380
Some's 41.

528
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,380
Some 41 told me.

529
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,380
Okay, you guys want to keep going?

530
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,380
Yeah, I'm waiting for something to, you know,

531
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
I mean, not that stuff isn't happening,

532
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,380
but I'm waiting for, like, to be able to do something.

533
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,380
I'm waiting for you to wow me.

534
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,380
I want to, like, because I'm just,

535
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,380
we're just flailing and floating right now, you know?

536
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,380
Yeah, it's an audio podcast.

537
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,380
You can always talk to each other.

538
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,380
Nah.

539
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,380
This is crazy.

540
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,380
So, wait, is the Silas Cole flashback,

541
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,380
it ends with Ephraim saying that?

542
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
That's the end of that?

543
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,380
Nope, I'm in the middle of it.

544
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
That's what I thought.

545
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
Okay.

546
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,380
Finish out your phone.

547
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,380
I mean, we've all been, we've all been real silly,

548
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,380
but Judge Ephraim Courtland was anything but.

549
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,380
This meeting he had called was about to decide

550
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,380
if they, the elders of contention,

551
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,380
should hire this roaming cowboy, Cornelius Beans,

552
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,380
to dispose of their town's paranoid figurehead.

553
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,380
All in attendance were in favor and said aye.

554
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,380
The judge excused himself to fetch this mercenary for hire

555
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,380
who just happened to be in town for the day,

556
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,380
and Cornelius Beans later entered the secret meeting

557
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,380
to spit and shake on the deal.

558
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,380
The handshake transforms into a live hand grasping

559
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,380
the cold, limp grip of a body that drapes

560
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,380
like a frequently worn sweater in a closet.

561
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,380
This closet, however, is down in a crawl space

562
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,380
six feet deep with dirt floors.

563
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,380
It smells heavily like rich earth and cedar,

564
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,380
and there are rows of other long hanging cadavers

565
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,380
suspended from the supports.

566
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,380
A small metal ball with long metal tendrils

567
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,380
excuses itself from the beans-dubbed cowboy shell

568
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,380
it inhabited and enters its familiar host,

569
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,380
known to the town of contention as Mary Cole.

570
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,380
She walks up the dusty wooden stairs, enters the house,

571
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,380
and begins to chant an incantation she remembers

572
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,380
from her maker's lips.

573
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,380
A swirling hole opens in the ground,

574
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,380
and Keith Beans wakes up from a deep sleep,

575
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,380
eyes wide and horrified, as Mary Cole,

576
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,380
this woman standing in his bedroom

577
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,380
with old timey clothing on,

578
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,380
throws her creator into the eternal portal,

579
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,380
filling the bedroom floor.

580
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,380
And then, as you're falling upward,

581
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,380
your vision fades, and the light refocuses

582
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,380
on the three of you.

583
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,380
Holy shit.

584
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,380
Hey, Luke, you remember the first dream you had

585
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,380
as Keith Vigna?

586
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,380
You were still dreaming, but you woke up in your bed

587
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,380
and you saw a woman in your time in clothing.

588
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,380
Oh, yes, yes.

589
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
Threw me through the floor.

590
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,380
Oh.

591
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,380
Oh.

592
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,380
That's fucking incredible, dude.

593
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,380
That's wild.

594
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
Who was it?

595
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,380
Damn, dude, that was so long ago.

596
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,380
Holy shit.

597
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,380
Jesus, dude.

598
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,380
That's just really cool.

599
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,380
Did you all saw?

600
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,380
There was a ball.

601
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,380
It had tendrils.

602
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,380
It's one of the balls, right?

603
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,380
You guys saw that, right?

604
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,380
John just rolls his eyes like,

605
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,380
duh, it was a ball.

606
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,380
Keith is having just flashbacks to that dream

607
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,380
and trying to piece things together in his mind,

608
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,380
but also he still isn't fully convinced

609
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,380
that any of this is actually happening to him.

610
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,380
Keith, the stuff that I saw,

611
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,380
it wasn't something I remember, per se,

612
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,380
but it all kind of touched on things

613
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,380
that I could understand being a thing.

614
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,380
What you just saw, was that anything

615
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
that rings a bell for you?

616
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,380
Did you see anything that rings true?

617
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,380
I had a dream and she was there.

618
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,380
She was there.

619
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,380
I had a dream and she was there.

620
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,380
I think it's M-A-R-Y.

621
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,380
What does that stand for again, Keith?

622
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:25,380
Oh, that stands for...

623
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Marvin's Awesome Robots, y'all.

624
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,380
It was something like,

625
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:38,380
Y was the version of it, and it's M-A-R.

626
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,380
Manipulating Activator Robot.

627
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,380
Yeah, version Y.

628
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,380
Marvy.

629
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Marvy, Marx.

630
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,380
Marvy, Mars, Marx.

631
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:55,380
A lot of these were cooler than Mary.

632
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,380
Seemingly out of nowhere,

633
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,380
you're all sitting on the ground.

634
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,380
Above you is pure darkness,

635
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,380
the same darkness you've seen above you this whole time,

636
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,380
and beneath you, the ground is made of pure light.

637
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,380
But as your eyes adjust to your new surroundings,

638
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,380
the endlessness of it all begins to fade away,

639
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,380
and you see you're actually all sitting on the ground in a small room.

640
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,380
It feels smaller due to the amount of junk accumulated around you,

641
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,380
like a hoarder studio apartment.

642
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,380
And you hear a whiny moan,

643
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,380
pained from behind a jostling pile of clutter.

644
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Who's there? Who's there?

645
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,380
Leo?

646
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,380
Who knows me? Who is that?

647
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,380
Is it Leo?

648
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,380
It's Clark. Leo, it's Clark.

649
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,380
Clark Bishop, you motherfucker.

650
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:02,380
And this jostling amount of junk just falls over,

651
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,380
pours over onto the ground,

652
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,380
the real ground now below you that is still made of light,

653
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,380
and it falls over, and he falls toward you,

654
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,380
and you see as he falls on his face in front of you,

655
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,380
it is very clearly Leo Piston.

656
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,380
He looks exactly like he did the night that he stood atop the two-fanged plunge,

657
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,380
and a bullet was fired through his body by Julie Maxwell,

658
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
who then you shot in the eye.

659
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,380
And as he falls forward, you do see he's shirtless,

660
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,380
and the skin kind of like falls and hits the ground below,

661
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,380
and the fat on his sides kind of presses against all the junk

662
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,380
that is down there next to him,

663
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,380
and you see a very clear exit wound from where,

664
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,380
or an entrance wound from where the bullet went through him,

665
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,380
and he's like,

666
00:34:51,380 --> 00:35:00,380
Oh, I'm in so much pain, and this is all you felt.

667
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,380
Oh, dammit, it's sixth-cent style ghosts.

668
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,380
I'm no ghost.

669
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,380
I didn't hear what he said.

670
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,380
It kind of cut out.

671
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,380
I'm no ghost.

672
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,380
Oh.

673
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,380
You're not real.

674
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,380
You're not real.

675
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,380
It fucking hurts.

676
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
It still hurts.

677
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,380
I turned to the guys.

678
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,380
This can't be real.

679
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
He's dead.

680
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
He's dead.

681
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,380
He's dead.

682
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,380
We saw his body slide down the slide.

683
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,380
Well, yeah, and now we're probably dead, too,

684
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,380
because we suffocated news,

685
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,380
and we're up here in sixth-cent ghost hell with Leo.

686
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,380
His body got caught by the goo.

687
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,380
Yeah, just like us.

688
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,380
The goo got him.

689
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,380
It slammed him in the ground, didn't it?

690
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,380
Oh, yeah.

691
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,380
It fucking hurt, too.

692
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
It slammed me in the ground so many times.

693
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,380
I've been in your unconscious for a while,

694
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,380
and you'll have it in.

695
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Well, about five days, Leo, I think.

696
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
I was going to say, how long has it been?

697
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
Two and a half years?

698
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,380
It feels like forever since you've been gone.

699
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,380
Please come back home.

700
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,380
Has anybody ever told you you kind of sound like Adam Sandler

701
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,380
at his worst impulses?

702
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,380
Eh.

703
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
Heh.

704
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,380
Does Adam Sandler exist in this universe?

705
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,380
John Lee Pennymore doesn't want to exist in a universe

706
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,380
that Adam Sandler doesn't.

707
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:32,380
Ha ha ha!

708
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,380
Clark is going to have a look of dawning realization.

709
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,380
He starts looking around.

710
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,380
Does that mean, is she here?

711
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,380
Leo, is Julie here?

712
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,380
Eh.

713
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Julie was dead.

714
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
My body was here.

715
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,380
My body was here.

716
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,380
And he points to the ground nearby,

717
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
and there's no body.

718
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
And his eyes get huge.

719
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,380
And he's like, Jesus.

720
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,380
She was there.

721
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:06,380
And then, as fuck you not, this little metal ball

722
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,380
fell down the same way you guys just did.

723
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,380
And this little spider worm arms climbed up into her face.

724
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,380
And she stood up out of nowhere.

725
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:26,380
And this black ooze started pouring out of her eyeball.

726
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,380
Well, you shot her.

727
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,380
Meh.

728
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,380
Just darkness pouring out of her eye.

729
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
And then what, Leo?

730
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Where'd she go?

731
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,380
And he points at a large metal door.

732
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,380
Like a hatch.

733
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
Are there any windows in the room we're in?

734
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,380
No.

735
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:49,380
Is this the same room that I was in in the pond?

736
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
Nope.

737
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,380
And are we saying hatch because it's on the ground?

738
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,380
No, sorry.

739
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,380
It's on the wall like a door.

740
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,380
I don't know why I'm saying hatch.

741
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,380
I think it's just like the big rectangle.

742
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,380
It actually looks like a walk-in freezer, I guess.

743
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.

744
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
Gotcha, yeah.

745
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
That kind of thing.

746
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,380
Sorry, I'm just really bad with words.

747
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,380
Yeah, you're pretty much known for that.

748
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,380
Just control the story and the imagery.

749
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,380
That's fine.

750
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,380
I'm going to ship you a dictionary.

751
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,380
I'm glad you finished that last word.

752
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,380
I'm going to show you my dick.

753
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,380
Me too, yeah.

754
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,380
I'll show you a hard wire.

755
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,380
Oh my god.

756
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,380
Dude, fucking, okay, Harry Potter pornography Hagrid.

757
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,380
I'm going to show you my dictionary.

758
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,380
Nice.

759
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,380
And then he pronounces everything very, very well.

760
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,380
Yeah, it's not porn, it's just a lesson.

761
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,380
It's a public speaking lesson?

762
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,380
A sex lesson.

763
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,380
It is porn.

764
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,380
Hagrid porn.

765
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,380
So Leo here says that Julie was dead.

766
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:08,380
So I was under the assumption that we were in some sort of afterlife here, but maybe

767
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,380
that's not the case.

768
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,380
Maybe when she shot Leo, it was not a fatal wound.

769
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,380
It was the goo that got him.

770
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,380
It wasn't, not fatal.

771
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:26,380
Do you think the goo arrested his, would he have died from his wound if he was still in

772
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,380
the real world?

773
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,380
Maybe time passes differently here.

774
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
I don't know, I'm not a doctor.

775
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,380
That's surprising.

776
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,380
I've got thirty first aid, could I tell?

777
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,380
If it would have been a fatal wound five days ago.

778
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:44,380
Thinking back to five days ago, really though, a lot longer ago than five days ago, I'd

779
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,380
imagine, in your fucked up brain.

780
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,380
Oh, sure.

781
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,380
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

782
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
I fail.

783
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,380
Forty-one on a thirty.

784
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,380
Yeah, you're not, you're not sure.

785
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
Certainly not sure.

786
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,380
You're about as sure as Joe would be either way on whether or not that wound would be

787
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,380
fatal.

788
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Yep, yep, yep.

789
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,380
And then is, is freezer door hatch the only door in this room?

790
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,380
The only way we would be able to get in or out?

791
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,380
No, looking now, there's two of them.

792
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
One on either side of the room.

793
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:21,380
As you're talking, you saw like at Leo, Leo's literally just like crawling around knocking

794
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:27,380
shit over, and he knocks over enough clutter on the opposite side of the room to reveal

795
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,380
a second door that was unseen previous.

796
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,380
Cause he's literally, you're looking into the eyes of a man who is feeling a fatal wound

797
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,380
constantly, and he's just crying out in pain the whole time.

798
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:48,380
I, I'm not going to keep doing it, but his wheezing, his like moaning, his is literally

799
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
happening constantly.

800
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,380
It's honestly pretty relaxing.

801
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,380
So you're not like a dedicated enough actor to keep doing it?

802
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,380
Sorry.

803
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:10,380
Guys, now, see, now I believe that this fellow is in pain.

804
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,380
This is a man having a hard time and that, that comes across.

805
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:21,380
Should, should we put him out of his misery?

806
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,380
Uh, no, no.

807
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:29,380
He's, he's the only one that seems to have any knowledge about what's going on here.

808
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,380
However little it may be.

809
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,380
I don't think we should get rid of him at least, at least yet.

810
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,380
Yeah.

811
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,380
He's got a decent frame of reference for right now.

812
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,380
And also it's, he is being kept alive in here.

813
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:47,380
And even though he's been going through unspeakable pain for five whole days, we, we could probably

814
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,380
get him out of here.

815
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,380
Keith says nothing, but isn't so sure.

816
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,380
Well, God damn it, Keith.

817
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,380
I can tell that you're, you're not, you're not saying anything, but you're thinking something

818
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,380
that you're, you're afraid to say, well, I'm not afraid to say it.

819
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:07,380
You think we can't get out of here, but if you fucking believe that, then what is, what

820
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,380
is any of this for?

821
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:14,380
What's, why, why keep going if you don't think we can get out of this fucking ooze falling

822
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,380
upwards, goddamn Leo dying for five days bullshit?

823
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,380
Guys, we're all just in the Uber still.

824
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,380
I believe we can get out of here.

825
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,380
That's fine.

826
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,380
Spud, do you believe we're still in the Uber?

827
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,380
Spud is kind of walking towards one of the doors.

828
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,380
What the fuck, dude?

829
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,380
This is, he's just kind of pacing back and forth.

830
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,380
Now he was walking away and now he's walking toward you and now he's walking away.

831
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,380
Um, and he's just pacing back and forth and he's like, this is not diet.

832
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,380
The last thing that was sick though.

833
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,380
I was like, why?

834
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,380
And I was like, yo, and you guys are all different and stuff and it was crazy.

835
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:01,380
But this, this guy, I don't know, he's, um, my ears.

836
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,380
Do, do we still have the feeling of contentment that we had while we were on the road?

837
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,380
Oh yeah.

838
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,380
Oh yeah.

839
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,380
Super content.

840
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,380
I don't know what I was complaining about then.

841
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,380
I guess this ain't so bad.

842
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Leo, do you feel content even though you're dying in pain constantly?

843
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:27,380
I feel like I'm dying, but also like I'm not hungry if that's what you mean.

844
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:31,380
And I don't think I've slept the whole time I've been here except for being unconscious maybe.

845
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,380
Is that what I mean?

846
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,380
No.

847
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,380
That you're not hungry?

848
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,380
Is that what content is?

849
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,380
I guess it's a big ol' no.

850
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,380
I was just trying to describe my physical state to you.

851
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,380
He's not hungry.

852
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,380
He's not sleepy.

853
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,380
He is in pain, but he's managing.

854
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,380
Is this a riddle or is this meat?

855
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,380
We're detectives' greatest detectives, so we're just thinking out loud.

856
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,380
I don't, I don't know about you guys, but I don't think there's much more we can do here.

857
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,380
I think, I think if we're going to find a way out, we got to start trying to find a way out.

858
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Shh.

859
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,380
Do you, do you guys think we should go out the door that Julie went out or do you think we should go out that one?

860
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,380
Can I point to the other one?

861
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,380
I kind of like Spud's instincts.

862
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,380
I don't know.

863
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,380
Which one did he go to?

864
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:19,380
Spud throws open the latch on the hatch that was first visible in this unearthly piston junkyard of a room,

865
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:26,380
and he turns back to fully face you with double finger guns as the door behind him swings open.

866
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,380
Without turning back around to confirm his footing, he steps backward over the threshold.

867
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:42,380
Dudes, we got to find a way out of this place, and my instincts are on point!

868
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:52,380
Spud, with nothing for his feet to land on, falls back and disappears completely from your view as his voice trails off and turns to a shriek.

869
00:44:52,380 --> 00:45:00,380
And beyond the doorway, you all look out and see a technicolor sky your eyes cannot quite comprehend.

870
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,380
And it is, at the same time, completely dark.

871
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:14,380
The nothingness is endless, but below the horizon is a shimmering silver sea.

872
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,380
Holy shit! This is so cool!

873
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:23,380
Well, I thought we should just maybe follow him through that door, but now I'd like to peek through first.

874
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,380
I was gonna, like, weed like three stooges' heads.

875
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,380
Yeah, what's down below if we...

876
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:41,380
Looking down, you see this room you're all in is on stilts, and a ladder goes down about ten yards and disappears into this placid, shining ocean

877
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:47,380
that surrounds Leo's auxiliary piston junkyard for as far as you can see.

878
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:57,380
But just below, Spud is laying on top of this gleaming expanse, and his face is contorted into a twisted grimace.

879
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:20,380
A pained squeak is drowned out into a gargle as the patch-covered hippie slowly sinks backward in Han Solo pose, down into the shimmering silver sea.

880
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,380
Johnny Kevin Moore shuts the door.

881
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,380
Clarky yanks it back open.

882
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,380
Let's try that other one, guys.

883
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,380
I gotta see how this ends.

884
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,380
I help him open the door.

885
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,380
Say your piece and then I'll close this damn door.

886
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,380
As you look out the door a second time...

887
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,380
Oh, look who it is.

888
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,380
No, Justin.

889
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:50,380
You see a boat made of this familiar inky black, unnaturally colorful material that also makes up the sky.

890
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,380
And two men are standing on this craft.

891
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,380
One is a short stout man in his latter years.

892
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:02,380
A thick white beard makes his round face look even rounder.

893
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,380
The bags under his eyes are large and fluffy.

894
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:13,380
He's wearing a dark navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy overalls.

895
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:20,380
And the other man is John Lee Pettymore IV's uncle, Don D. Pettymore.

896
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,380
Justin, what does Uncle Don look like?

897
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:29,380
Ooh, Uncle Don is about 6'2", kind of sinewy.

898
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:37,380
He's got that leathery, been out in the sun too long, strong, dark hair that's very disheveled right now.

899
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:42,380
Does not look as though he has bathed in quite some time, let's say.

900
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,380
And he's wearing like a buttoned up shirt that's all like...

901
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,380
It's not looking super great in a thick ol' mustache.

902
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,380
Uh, hi, Uncle Don.

903
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,380
What, how...

904
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,380
Wait, do I see...

905
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,380
Is that John?

906
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,380
Oh, he sees me.

907
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,380
Hey, Uncle Don, uh...

908
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,380
I start going down the ladder.

909
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,380
Can't we check the other door first?

910
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,380
Don, you could climb up the ladder.

911
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:20,380
Keith goes down the ladder, but he does it like in a video game when you hit the sprint button when you go down and you just like hold the side and slide down it.

912
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,380
Yeah, like, he does that.

913
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,380
But again, like, we're still up here in this other plane, there's a whole other door.

914
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,380
Who knows who he might invite to the Discord chat if we open that door.

915
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,380
LAUGHTER

916
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,380
LAUGHTER

917
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,380
What kind of world are you living in?

918
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:48,380
What kind of world are you living in?
