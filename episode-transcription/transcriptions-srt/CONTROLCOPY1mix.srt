1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
Well, babies, I cannot believe I finally arrived at Ocean City, New Jersey, and it's 2016?

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,400
And it's March?

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,360
Well, fuck, this should be a fun detour, I guess.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,000
God damn it.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,760
I guess...

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,200
Guess I can do another radio show or something.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,880
We're live from 694.2 PTBP or whatever.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,640
Some nice person wrote us a thing.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,080
Maybe I'll read that.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,320
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dale Armont in Arkansas, who tweeted about the

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,120
show and tagged at Pretending Pod, which is always the third thing I do while sitting

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
on the toilet.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,840
Do you sit down to pee?

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,260
I sure do.

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,760
It's comfy.

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,360
Thanks for tweeting about the show and tagging at Pretending Pod Dale Armont from Arkansas.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
He writes,

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh wow, Dale.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A Wolfie never reveals their secrets, especially secrets about their incredibly moisturized

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
nipples.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Wink.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,960
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, send in your message as a five-star

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,680
review on Apple Podcasts, and I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,040
Ocean City, New Jersey's newest and only radio station, probably.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,200
And I'll be right back after a word from our only sponsor, Zach.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
What's up, what's up?

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
It's Zach.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,680
I am here to tell you four things.

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,460
First, I want to say thank you to this community.

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:12,440
After some last minute donations from you folks, we've raised $1,525 to help keep

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,840
Springfieldians warm this winter.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
That's absolutely incredible.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,200
Thank you to each and every one of you listening who's told a friend about the show or joined

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,980
the Patreon or tagged us on the internet.

35
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,280
This is all thanks to you.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,360
Second, I want to say thank you to all of you eager listeners for your patience.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,720
Here's a little life update.

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,600
Taylor and I have moved back to Springfield, Missouri, and we will be in Springfield, Missouri

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,380
until we eventually die in Springfield, Missouri.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
We love it here.

41
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,440
The food game is strong.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
It's cheap.

43
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,780
We just started a big boy job at a real company and we're about to move into a rental while

44
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,680
we house hunt in this super fun market.

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm hoping the transition won't affect our release schedule too much, but I'm an optimist

46
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
for real though.

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,160
We have some really cool shit planned and we're all super stoked about it.

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,320
Third, we just recently released our 27th Patreon bonus episode.

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,880
Luke GM'd a game of Uncanny Rally for Joe, Thomas, and me.

50
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,840
It's one of those one-page RPGs from Grant Hallett.

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,360
We played malfunctioning military androids on the run.

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,060
It was delightfully silly and Luke did a wonderful job leading us on our wacky way.

53
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:43,900
So for $5 a month you can hear that and 26 other bonus episodes which do include a 13

54
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:51,420
episode long mostly homebrew Delta Green campaign that winds through time by connecting surviving

55
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:59,620
agents from each mission to continued unnatural mysteries and military conspiracies.

56
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:06,060
And finally, if you're an esteemed naughty denizen of the den of sin, get ready for this

57
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:13,460
Thursday, the eve of New Year's Eve, January 30th at 7pm Central Time.

58
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,500
We're gonna hang out and celebrate the end of 2021, talk about our plans for 2022, and

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,040
we're also each in charge of bringing a segment to the episode, so we'll see what happens

60
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,660
with that.

61
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,420
If you have any suggestions, post them on the internet.

62
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:39,820
And come hang out this Thursday night, yeah, New Year's Eve, January 30th at 7pm Central

63
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,820
Time.

64
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,280
Okay, sorry that took so long, thanks for listening to our podcast, bye.

65
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,780
If that sad Zach character gave you the blues, and God knows he gives me the blues, you're

66
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,180
welcome to cheer up now, it's time for the news.

67
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:02,620
A former Delta Green agent named Arvon Chilton is missing and on the run today after a string

68
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,080
of brutal homicides have all pointed in his singular direction.

69
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,100
He is assumed to be armed and dangerous.

70
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,260
Again, this is a former Delta Green agent named Arvon Chilton.

71
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:24,200
Mr. Chilton parked his car in the driveway of his ex-wife, Eileen McCarty, and her new

72
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,920
husband, Marcus McCarty.

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:35,000
Then, this fucking dude, Arvon Chilton, walked inside, disabled and tied up the new husband,

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,320
and then slowly cut Eileen McCarty to pieces in front of the guy.

75
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,540
Later, Arvon Chilton carefully cut out the new husband's eyes, all before he disemboweled

76
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,040
and untied the blind, bleeding out broken man.

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,680
Marcus McCarty died sometime later, crawling towards the front door.

78
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,080
Welcome to 694.2.

79
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,640
If you aren't down with that level of awful, this show might not be good for you.

80
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:10,200
But for now, let's just groove on this melodic palate cleanser that's brand spanking new.

81
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,680
It's Brian Bolger with Bad in a Good Way.

82
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,480
The deep end, but the drowning's been just fine

83
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:33,800
And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind

84
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,960
I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:49,640
I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face

86
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,360
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

87
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,880
We're gonna play Control Copy, which is a Delta Green scenario written by Dennis Detwiller,

88
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,280
one of the creators of the game, Delta Green, the Role Playing Game.

89
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Yeah!

90
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Oh, too much.

91
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,720
We are playing Control Copy specifically because we put up a poll

92
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,560
on our Patreon.

93
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,800
And only those who pay us money could vote.

94
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,840
And only those who pay us money could vote, and they chose Control Copy.

95
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,800
Hey, let's introduce ourselves to anyone who is listening to this who hasn't listened to us before.

96
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,400
My name is Zach, and I'm gonna be your handler today,

97
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,720
as well as after you listen to this when you go back and listen to all of season one,

98
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,840
of Pretending to Be People, I'll be the handler for that as well.

99
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm Joe! I play. I'm one of the characters. I play in all the games.

100
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,720
Every single one of them.

101
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,880
What is your role, Joe? How do you see your role here at Pretending to Be People?

102
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,280
I think the most official role I have is note taker, and even that's tenuous at times,

103
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,640
because I get involved in what's happening and forget to write stuff down.

104
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,120
That happens to everybody, man. That's role playing, baby.

105
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,840
Yeah, that's what my problem is.

106
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,920
That's happened to Luke and I for the last 60 episodes.

107
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,120
I was so enthralled.

108
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,200
I'm Luke. I play, too. And my goal, my role...

109
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,080
What's your goal?

110
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,960
Goal? Have fun.

111
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,960
Role. Have fun.

112
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,840
I don't take notes.

113
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,760
They're all up here.

114
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,000
He points at his head.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,880
Yeah, audio.

116
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,600
He pointed at Joe's notebook.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,280
But yeah, you know, I just kind of go with the flow, and I try to get things rolling, you know?

118
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes, you certainly do that.

119
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,760
You can really feel the energy just, like, shooting off of him.

120
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,360
I'm Thomas, and sometimes I take notes, and...

121
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,040
I thought that this just became whether or not you take notes.

122
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,760
Notes or no notes.

123
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
I plan to take notes on this campaign.

124
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,480
Joe was like, I'm Joe, and I'm a character,

125
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,120
so I just want to make it clear that I'm Thomas, and I'm a person.

126
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,400
But I do play characters on the show.

127
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,120
All right, so that's us, and this is Delta Green,

128
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,760
and we're going to play Delta Green.

129
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,440
Are you guys ready to play Delta Green?

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm scared.

131
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,960
Normally, on season one of Pretending to Be People,

132
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,120
we played an amalgamation of Delta Green and Pulp Cthulhu.

133
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,440
And you guys had lots of hit points and luck to spend.

134
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,800
However, in this game today, you will have no special talents.

135
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,080
Your hit points will be your strength plus your con,

136
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,000
divided by two, as opposed to just strength plus con,

137
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,880
and you will have no luck.

138
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,120
So let's introduce your characters.

139
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,840
A young boy, far larger than average for his age,

140
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,360
sits crying in the hallway of an elementary school

141
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,440
as a group of children laugh and run away.

142
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,240
He's wearing a yellow long-sleeve t-shirt and blue overalls.

143
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,200
His glasses are thick, thick enough to give the illusion

144
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,000
that the wearer has cartoonishly giant eyes.

145
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,560
The tears are magnified behind the glass lenses

146
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,680
as he sniffles and laughs echo down the hallway.

147
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,560
A small boy approaches the weeping, hulking figure.

148
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
They're assholes, fuck them.

149
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,000
What's your name, Bigfoot?

150
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,280
Kevin.

151
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
The crying boy says as he wipes his face

152
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,560
and looks up at the acne-ridden face of Elwood Boyd.

153
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,400
Kevin wipes the sweat from his face

154
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,640
and looks up into the stadium lights.

155
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,720
The light glints off his athletic goggles,

156
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,560
which give his eyes a bulging look.

157
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen!

158
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,080
The crowd chants his nickname as he stands on the field,

159
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,320
towering above the other boys surrounding him.

160
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,520
Hike!

161
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,120
The sound of young men shouting

162
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,520
and football pads clashing fills the air.

163
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,960
Kevin throws the boy opposite him to the ground with a crunch.

164
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,040
His eyes focus on the opposing quarterback

165
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,800
and he launches himself forward.

166
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,120
The small, frail boy holding the football

167
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,280
is almost invisible under Kevin's shadow

168
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,680
as the monstrous high schooler leaps towards him.

169
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Ahh!

170
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,200
A piercing scream is heard as Kevin smashes into the child,

171
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,800
sending the boy flying backwards

172
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,560
and the football up into the air.

173
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,800
Kevin jumps up to grab the ball

174
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,560
and sprints towards the end zone.

175
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,640
The entire crowd is chanting his name

176
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,400
as he hulks toward the goal.

177
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,480
When the minion reaches the end of the field,

178
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
he spikes the football down.

179
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,320
Instead of bouncing back into the air,

180
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,040
the ball burrows itself into the earth.

181
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,240
What's your last name again?

182
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,280
Gelato.

183
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,960
That's another defensive touchdown

184
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,000
for Kevin Gelato and the Spiro Agnu High!

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,520
Nope, I already have this written out.

186
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:08,360
That's the end of the minions five undefeated years

187
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,120
here at Spiro Agnu High!

188
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,040
The announcer shouts as the crowd runs onto the field.

189
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,640
I'm so proud of you bro!

190
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,960
You're gonna do big things!

191
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,040
The voice of Stuart, Kevin's younger brother,

192
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,720
fades out as we see Kevin standing in an elegant hallway

193
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,320
with a dumb smile on his face.

194
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,520
The smile quickly fades into a stony expression

195
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,120
as Elwood's voice fades in,

196
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,440
asking questions not necessarily intended

197
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,720
to be answered by Kevin.

198
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Kevin gives Elwood a quick smile,

199
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,840
but the eyes behind his goggles are deeply sad.

200
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Okay Elwood, let's go.

201
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,580
Nice!

202
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,240
And Elwood.

203
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,740
Hey!

204
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,440
I'm playing Elwood.

205
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,800
Elwood Boyd.

206
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,400
And see Kevin, if I turn this here, click,

207
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,840
and I snip this here, we should get...

208
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,640
And a safe door slowly opens in front of them,

209
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,520
revealing a cartoonish horde of jewels and cash.

210
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,280
A smile spreads across Elwood Boyd's pale, pockmarked,

211
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,240
and pimpled face, revealing rows of yellowed teeth

212
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,320
that seem to have all collectively decided

213
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,920
no two would grow in the same angle.

214
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,080
He stands wearing an argyle sweater vest

215
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,920
over a yellow-brown colored button-up,

216
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,680
khaki pants, and golfing shoes,

217
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,840
but the whole ensemble looks like it was recently

218
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,040
retrieved from a dumpster, all wrinkled and lightly,

219
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,880
and in some places not so lightly,

220
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,040
stained and fitting poorly.

221
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,520
Kevin hands Elwood a fresh duffel bag,

222
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,240
and Elwood extends a thin, bony arm

223
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
to start scooping in the latest score.

224
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,760
See, there's nothing to it.

225
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,240
Well, at least for me, I don't know how you'd fare.

226
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,200
But it's like I can see the inner workings of these things.

227
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,960
I always have.

228
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,320
I don't know where this comes from.

229
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,640
Here, take this bag too.

230
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,760
And Elwood stands and hands another duffel bag

231
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,560
over to Kevin.

232
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,520
He now has three draped over his body.

233
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,440
All right, so we've gone through every room, right?

234
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,400
I started to lose track.

235
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,360
This place is so big.

236
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,560
You said this guy was some kind of money manager or something.

237
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,600
Hoo-wee!

238
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,960
Must be good in the manage-

239
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,680
money management.

240
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,000
Fuck.

241
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,200
Must be good in the money management.

242
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,240
Hoo-wee!

243
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,160
Must be good money managing that money.

244
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,160
Let's try it again.

245
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,480
Must be good money in managing that money.

246
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,840
Come on, let's get out of here.

247
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,520
We gotta go see Julian.

248
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,080
They make their way toward the garage at this point,

249
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,960
passing rooms that have obviously been picked over.

250
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,800
There's things kind of scattered here and there,

251
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,720
but it's mostly empty rooms at this point.

252
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,440
They walk by a kitchen and there's a guy sprawled on the floor

253
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,200
just in his boxers.

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,320
Man, you really whacked him good, big guy.

255
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,760
Yeah, he'll be out for hours.

256
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,080
Right before they get to the garage door,

257
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,480
they see a picture on the wall and it's of a family all-

258
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,680
I'm sorry, he jacked that guy off so good that he passed out for hours?

259
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,360
Really got him.

260
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,160
Whatever you say.

261
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,560
There's a family photo on the wall right by the garage door

262
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,720
of a family in like a fall setting.

263
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,440
Hey, you almost forgot one, dummy.

264
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,400
Even though it's just a picture, there's good money in frames.

265
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,280
We can sell the frame.

266
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,960
They get out to the garage.

267
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,200
They load up the SUV of the homeowner.

268
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Elwood waits in the passenger seat.

269
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,280
Come on, come on, we don't have all day.

270
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,040
Well, I guess we kind of do.

271
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,600
I already snipped the alarms and I took care of the cameras

272
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,960
and the security guy at the gate, you took care of him.

273
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,800
But anyway, I want to get out of here.

274
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,840
Come on, let's go.

275
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,680
Kevin walks out the door with a frame and three double bags.

276
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,360
Everything's just like packed on this dude like a mule.

277
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,880
That's how it was picture made for sure.

278
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,160
Is this happening in the present day or like shortly after that high school game?

279
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
No, this is present day.

280
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,240
Yeah, you were daydreaming about that when we were doing this.

281
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,040
That's actually perfect.

282
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,440
They pull up into an old camera shop and they pull around the back.

283
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,640
They've done it a million times before and they're greeted by Julian.

284
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,680
Oh, he's your fence.

285
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,400
He's my fence.

286
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,120
Got you.

287
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,360
Comes out and says, what'd you bring for me today?

288
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,480
Oh, just the usual.

289
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,720
Some vases, socks, books, candlesticks, jewelry, bedsheets.

290
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,720
Kevin, tell some of the keys.

291
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,840
You got your car?

292
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,240
All right.

293
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,800
Julian cuts them off and says, hey, smelly Ellie.

294
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,640
You know I only care about the jewels, right?

295
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,880
You don't have to make me sell people's socks.

296
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,840
They're used.

297
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,120
Elwood replies.

298
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,080
Hey, they still work, don't they?

299
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,040
That means they have value to somebody and that means they have value to me.

300
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,440
Socks.

301
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,720
Socks.

302
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,440
Usually there's even some cash in this frame, I'm sure.

303
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,040
Oh, Elwood, you took the family photos.

304
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,240
He, uh, he assures them that there's going to be, uh, some cash form in a week.

305
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,800
Okay.

306
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,000
After he sells all this stuff.

307
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,400
Yeah.

308
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,640
And, uh, Elwood turns to Kevin and says, all right, let's, uh, let's head back home.

309
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,920
Maybe Ma's made chili.

310
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,640
Oh yeah.

311
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,000
Chili.

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,960
So they get back to Elmira Boyd's basement apartment.

313
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,600
Okay.

314
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,560
And oh, they noticed the TV's on.

315
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,200
Oh shit.

316
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,920
She's still awake.

317
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,160
All right.

318
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,040
Come, come, come on.

319
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,240
Is this your mom?

320
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,040
Hey, hey, hey ma.

321
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,400
Um, we're, we're home.

322
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,600
Home.

323
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,680
Uh, Elmira Boyd is laying on the couch in her nightgown and she stirs awake.

324
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,480
Kind of startled.

325
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,320
Oh, did you boys have fun at the golf range?

326
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,800
Uh, Elwood says, yeah, I hit two holes in one.

327
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,440
Hole in one.

328
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,680
She said, well, you keep telling me you should go pro.

329
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,400
I see these guys on TV.

330
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,320
They aren't hitting holes in one every time they go out.

331
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,200
It seems like you do.

332
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:47,320
Uh, she tousles his greasy mop top and kind of wipes her hand off on her nightgown.

333
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,640
She's going up to bed.

334
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,600
I made some chili.

335
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,960
There's some chili in the fridge there.

336
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Oh, and uh, somebody left that for you.

337
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,720
It's something about an opera.

338
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,680
And uh, when Elwood hears this, his heart skips a beat.

339
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,080
Yeah.

340
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,000
And he turns to his mom.

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,360
He's walking up the stairs and says, oh, um, thanks mom.

342
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,400
Um, hey, uh, Kevin and I, we were thinking of taking a trip.

343
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,920
We were, uh, we're going to go to, um, uh, Colorado and hit the, hit the golf courses

344
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,240
out there.

345
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,360
I heard they're beautiful.

346
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,600
We might be, uh, might be gone for a few days.

347
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,040
You have a good night.

348
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,280
And, uh, Elmira says, oh, uh, okay.

349
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,560
You boys have fun out there.

350
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,600
Don't get into any trouble.

351
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,600
He picks up the envelope.

352
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,480
Perfect.

353
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,880
Perfect.

354
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,280
Perfect.

355
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,920
I love that.

356
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,160
Okay.

357
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,720
Can you give me a quick rundown of what your character looks like?

358
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,160
Yeah, he's a greasy and, uh, he's got pimpled and pockmarked face.

359
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,280
He's really, uh, super duper skinny.

360
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,400
He kind of walks around with his arms folded, but at the wrists.

361
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,840
Amazing.

362
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,280
And, uh, yeah, he's wearing a ratty sweater vest and a button up with the collar popping

363
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,720
at the top, but it all looks wrong.

364
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,400
It just looks like it doesn't fit right.

365
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,560
Maybe even the buttons are kind of mismatched.

366
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,800
One year for Christmas, my grandma got me a sweater vest and it was matching the shirt,

367
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,520
the long sleeve dress shirt that would go underneath it.

368
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:04,760
Right.

369
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,080
Size on these two.

370
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,000
Two items, extra, extra large on the shirt and small on the vest.

371
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,280
Perfect.

372
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,320
Huh?

373
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,120
Did it fit?

374
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,320
You know, neither one did.

375
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,920
It was wrong both directions.

376
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,680
Just mix them together and you'll get the right size.

377
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,760
Yeah, it was, it was an interesting look.

378
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,600
Very puffy in the arms.

379
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:28,920
All right.

380
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,120
Well, Kevin.

381
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,240
Yes, of course, please.

382
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,880
Kevin, uh, is very large, especially standing next to Elwood.

383
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,440
Certainly.

384
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,600
He's just shy of seven feet tall.

385
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,160
He is hundreds of pounds of, of just muscle.

386
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,400
Like it looks like he works out multiple times a day, but like his skin is kind of like yellowish.

387
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,000
He's got huge, instead of glasses, they're like, like athletic goggles.

388
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,880
Like, you know, they would play in wrapped around his head, makes his eyes look huge.

389
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,880
He just still most comfortable wearing those after wearing them for sports.

390
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,440
Right.

391
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,080
Well, cause he wore them and when he played football and in, in like junior high and high

392
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,280
school, pretty much all he did was play football and hang out with Elwood.

393
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,600
So it just kind of like became comfortable to him, but you can tell, like, just the way he looks,

394
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,000
there's, he's probably got something like genetically wrong with him.

395
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,960
Cause he just like never stopped growing and it's huge.

396
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,400
And his head is kind of like oddly square.

397
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,360
He's an Andre giant.

398
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,680
Or an Alton giant.

399
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,320
Wadler.

400
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,360
Yeah, dude, Robert Wadler guys huge.

401
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,920
And he, uh, he was from a town that was pretty near to where I grew up over by St. Louis.

402
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,420
Yeah.

403
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,840
Huge motherfucker.

404
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,480
That guy.

405
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,920
But yeah, this guy's huge, uh, yellow long sleeve t-shirt blue, like bib overalls.

406
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,520
Uh, those goggles, uh, he's like bald, except for like stealthy bald,

407
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,160
except for like three long stringy hairs that he kind of comes over on his head.

408
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,440
Oh, okay.

409
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,280
So you've been building Homer Simpson.

410
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,400
Yeah.

411
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,800
Yeah.

412
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,520
Homer Simpson.

413
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,640
He's large, but quiet.

414
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,120
All right.

415
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,680
Sick.

416
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,880
Uh, it seems to have kind of a soft voice that repeats.

417
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,440
Yeah.

418
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:14,920
Boyd's.

419
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:15,960
Yeah.

420
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,040
He can form full sentences, but doesn't like to a lot.

421
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,280
He likes Elwood speak for him.

422
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,600
Okay.

423
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,320
And even Elwood isn't that great at it.

424
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,440
Well, let's meet someone who should be speaking for the group.

425
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:30,920
Yeah.

426
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,800
So as Kevin is daydreaming about his football stardom, his, his five glorious

427
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:42,600
years of high school football of undefeated high school football way, way in the

428
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,920
background of that memory behind the throng of cheering fans, you see Clarissa

429
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:53,000
Sparrow, short, serious student body president she's managing a small hot dog

430
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,760
stand, the profits from which will benefit a local canine leukemia fund.

431
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,040
She gets visibly flustered at the sophomore work in the stand with her, who

432
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,200
is chatting with some friends instead of boiling dogs, Clarissa snaps to get his

433
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
attention and points sharply to station.

434
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,240
She glares at his friends and they sheepishly disperse.

435
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,840
Clarissa takes a deep sigh and massages her temples and then turns around with a

436
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,880
genuine smile.

437
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,760
And she asked for Mrs.

438
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,040
Elmira Boyd's order.

439
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,760
Is there a limit?

440
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,640
I just want to support those sick little doggies as much as I can.

441
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,680
I'm so sorry.

442
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,480
We only have 10 hot and ready at the moment, Mrs.

443
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,720
Boyd, we would have more if everyone was doing their duty, come back in a few

444
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,480
minutes and we'll have as many as you can carry.

445
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,120
I promise.

446
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,560
Oh, thank you, Clarissa.

447
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,760
You're, you're such a darling.

448
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,920
It's so sweet of you to help those pups like this.

449
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,400
Kevin's daydream is reaching its moment of climactic triumph over on the field.

450
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,320
He's, he's spiking the ball.

451
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,680
The crowd's going crazy.

452
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,880
And as, as they erupt cheering, his name,

453
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,480
Clarissa's head kind of darts over inadvertently towards the field.

454
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,480
And the sophomore working with her, it takes that moment to dip away from the

455
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,120
stand and disappear into the crowd with his friends.

456
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,680
She's more hurt than angry.

457
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,120
What makes it so hard for other people to do the right thing?

458
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,640
Work hard, follow the rules, do what is expected, stay true to your word, and

459
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,520
you'll have a good life.

460
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,120
She shakes that thought from her mind and gets back to work.

461
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,400
She shakes that thought from her mind and gets back to work.

462
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,320
There are hot dogs to move.

463
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,320
In the present day, Kevin is snapping out of his daydream as Elmira Boyd offers

464
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,720
him and Elwood the chili and mentions the envelope that came for them.

465
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,080
Elsewhere in the world that night, Agent Clarissa Sparrow, criminal profiler for

466
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,280
the FBI, is coming home to her small one bedroom apartment.

467
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,760
She opens the door and finds an identical envelope slipped under it.

468
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,640
She's currently dressed in a smart, sensible gray pantsuit, and she has the

469
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,040
same smart, sensible haircut she did in Kevin's daydream back in high school.

470
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,880
She's staring intensely at the envelope as a cat comes up and rubs her leg in

471
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,880
greeting, and she thinks about the way she's tried to live her life since then.

472
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,920
Work hard, follow the rules, do what's expected of you, stay true to your word.

473
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,240
She never questioned that that was the right path until her first night at the

474
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,040
opera.

475
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,400
She saw things on that mission that shook her to the core.

476
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,040
The minds of hardened veterans cracked apart under supernatural pressures, the

477
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,800
bodies of innocents torn apart by unnatural forces, and the lies, bribes, and

478
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,920
killings that had taken her and her other agents to conceal the truth that had

479
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,560
been unleashed.

480
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,040
Her composure, though, distinguished her on that first mission, where more

481
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,920
senior agents had lost their minds, she kept it together, and she was soon asked

482
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,400
to move from friendly to agent.

483
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,720
She draws on that composure now, massaging her temples, taking a deep sigh.

484
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,880
She leans down, scratches the cat's ear, and picks up the envelope.

485
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,360
Nice, so we've got our three characters.

486
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,240
Quick, give me a rundown of what Clarissa looks like, and also what is her last

487
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,800
name.

488
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,440
Sparrow.

489
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,840
Oh, Clarissa Sparrow.

490
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,800
I like it.

491
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,240
And what does she look like when we see Clarissa?

492
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,120
Is she still short, serious, and the student body president?

493
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,400
Yes, Clarissa Sparrow.

494
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,640
That's kind of a very subtle, very subtle little nod to Clarissa Starling in Silence

495
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,120
of the Lambs.

496
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,880
And she looks exactly like Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs.

497
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,800
Which was playing when I arrived here today.

498
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,280
Research.

499
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,800
I'd never seen Silence of the Lambs, and while we were setting up, I feel like I kind

500
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,400
of watched the whole thing.

501
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,440
You saw most of it.

502
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,320
Pretty much did, yeah.

503
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,800
I saw all the key scenes, I think, that I was like, oh, that's from this.

504
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,640
Yeah, it puts the lotion in the basket.

505
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,440
Would you fuck me?

506
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,360
I'd fuck me.

507
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,000
That was pretty cool.

508
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,640
That was cool, dude.

509
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,080
Yeah, I just want to have that mindset, you know?

510
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,160
Like, are you supposed to be jealous of that character?

511
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,440
That Wild Bill grindset?

512
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,880
Hashtag grindset.

513
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,240
These envelopes that have been left for you summon you to a nearby airport and give you

514
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,120
access to a private aircraft hangar.

515
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,680
And there, you are briefed on this mission by a lone member of the special access group

516
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,840
with identification from the National Reconnaissance Office.

517
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,800
And he introduces himself as John Smith.

518
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,400
You're given file work on the case.

519
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,720
And this case involves a former Delta Green agent named Arvin Chilton.

520
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,920
And Arvin Chilton was a Delta Green agent for a long time.

521
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,920
And then he retired in Ocean City, New Jersey.

522
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,960
Well, hmm.

523
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,520
Recently, it seems, Arvin Chilton has gone on a bit of a murder spree.

524
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,440
His ex-wife is dead.

525
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,560
His ex-wife's partner, new husband, is dead.

526
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,280
His old partner is dead.

527
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,640
There's also a gas station attendant who is dead.

528
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,640
Arvin Chilton was seen on camera stabbing this gas station employee in the back and

529
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:29,800
then disemboweling him as a car pulled up and filled their tank of gas not five feet

530
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,600
from where this disembowelment was taking place.

531
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,240
The person filling up their tank kind of looks around.

532
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,160
It looks like they're hearing something.

533
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,080
They almost look in the exact direction of Chilton and this dying man.

534
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,080
But then the driver just puts the gas pump back in and gets in their car and drives off.

535
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,160
That's probably what flagged Delta Green the most.

536
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:04,920
So your three agents are placed on a private aircraft and flown to Woodbine Municipal Airport

537
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:10,120
in Woodbine, New Jersey, which is approximately five miles from Ocean City, New Jersey,

538
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,040
as well as the apartment of Arvin Chilton.

539
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,400
Excuse me.

540
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,800
Is your name Kevin Gelato?

541
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,020
Yes.

542
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,060
Uh, I don't know if you remember me.

543
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,500
Clarissa Sparrow.

544
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,860
Agent Clarissa Sparrow, FBI.

545
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:35,820
Kevin kind of looks at her and it cuts to Kevin crying in the bathroom at school and

546
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,620
Clarissa like...

547
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,620
Clarissa, Clarissa, Clarissa is banging on the door and she's like,

548
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,540
I'm sorry, but you need a hall pass.

549
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,420
You didn't have a bathroom pass.

550
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,780
You need to come out immediately.

551
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,180
Kevin comes out and Clarissa like sees he's crying and comforts him.

552
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,260
But yeah, she's like patting him on the back while also writing up a little like,

553
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,820
writing him up with the other hand.

554
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,320
Yeah.

555
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,580
It's like, I understand that this is a tough time in our lives where everybody's got some

556
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,220
hidden battle they don't see, but it only really takes a couple seconds to get that

557
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,540
bathroom pass and the rules are there for a reason.

558
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:13,920
Thank you.

559
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,960
And he comes back into reality and...

560
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
Oh, yeah.

561
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,080
Hi.

562
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,640
Hey.

563
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,280
Hi.

564
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,720
What are you doing here?

565
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,320
I don't have a bathroom pass.

566
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,720
What?

567
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,160
You're the hall monitor.

568
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm with the FBI.

569
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,600
I was a hall monitor for all 12 years of my public schooling.

570
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,640
You were the football giant.

571
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,720
Weren't you going to go pro?

572
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,400
Those days are behind him.

573
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,280
Jesus Christ.

574
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,080
The Elwood turns sideways and you finally see him.

575
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,520
Yeah, he leers out from behind the giant.

576
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,000
Oh, look, it's a little birdie.

577
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,240
Elwood Boyd, smelly Ellie.

578
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,280
Good to see you, I guess.

579
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,280
How you been?

580
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,720
I never, I never wrote up anybody more than you.

581
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,400
You sure did seem to have a thing for me.

582
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,880
Yeah.

583
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080
I had a thing for justice.

584
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,520
I still do.

585
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,960
That's why I'm here.

586
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,520
What?

587
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
Why are you two here?

588
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,600
Elwood.

589
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,760
It's his reason.

590
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,880
We're here for a thing.

591
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,240
It's opera night.

592
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,040
Opera.

593
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,960
You two are here for the night at the opera.

594
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,440
You can reach in and find what was left for you in this envelope, which was FBI credentials

595
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,680
that will not hold up for more than, you know, two or three days.

596
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,440
But they'll hold up for a little bit.

597
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,800
Yeah, it looks like we're on the same playing field today.

598
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,000
Clarissa is now terrified because she has actual FBI credentials.

599
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,240
Right.

600
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,040
She knows she's going to have, like, if these two fuck up when she's trying to interact

601
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,480
with real FBI, it's going to mean everything she's worked for could go down the shitter.

602
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,520
Yeah, but hey, they seem on the up and up.

603
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,200
It looks like Kevin and I here possess a set of skills that are indispensable for today.

604
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,280
What do you make of that?

605
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,040
The Delta Green pair, you know, like a character sheet for you.

606
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,000
Any kind of overview.

607
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,160
What skills would those be?

608
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,280
I'm good at getting in the places and I can take things without people seeing that those

609
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,080
things got taken.

610
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,000
I smash.

611
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,120
Okay, so we got a Hulk and a thief.

612
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,560
As much as I'm loathe to admit it, those skills might come in handy.

613
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,120
I reckon you couldn't get by without us.

614
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,200
I reckon I could get by without just about anyone.

615
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,040
But here's the deal.

616
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:56,560
If you two have to pass as FBI with me, you're going to keep your mouth shut when we're talking

617
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,360
to real FBI.

618
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,200
You're not going to embarrass me.

619
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,200
You're not going to jeopardize what I do outside of this.

620
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,920
In order, I'd say sure, maybe, and we'll see.

621
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,680
Thomas doesn't remember what he just proposed to you, so yeah.

622
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,640
I was like, what is your...

623
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,720
If Elwood likes it, I'll do it.

624
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,800
Yeah, I mean, they summoned us.

625
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,720
They obviously see that we are needed here and we're going to do what we can.

626
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,440
Okay, so she's got your credentials, like the FBI credentials in her hands, and she's

627
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
like, consider these hall passes.

628
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,840
This is a privilege and not a right, and it can be revoked at any moment, and she passes

629
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,400
it out to you.

630
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,580
Thanks.

631
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:51,520
Once you've landed, the pilot actually pops out from the pirate's cabin, which it says

632
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:58,480
on the door, and he's got a peg leg and a fun three-point hat with the skull and crossbones

633
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,120
on it.

634
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,280
It's themed chartered airplanes.

635
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:09,520
It's March 25th, which is when this specific company celebrates Halloween, and he says,

636
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:21,120
argh, there's a car outside waiting for ye, and there's a key, a skeleton key that's on

637
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,600
the wheel.

638
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,440
Thanks for flying our American Airlines.

639
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,720
And so there's a car waiting for you guys.

640
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,760
What kind of car do you want?

641
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,720
A Jaguar.

642
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,160
Okay, there's a Jaguar.

643
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,440
Okay, there's an old shitty used Jaguar waiting for you guys to the point to where like the

644
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,720
mount, like the hood ornament is missing.

645
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,960
This is like a beat up old Jag.

646
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,040
Can I use my mechanic role too?

647
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,120
Which is what we call my uncle.

648
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,360
Kevin would know that on this old Jag, the hood ornament actually pops out.

649
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,520
So can I do a mechanic role to see if I can get it to pop out?

650
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,480
Absolutely you can.

651
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,440
It's broken.

652
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,640
So you guys see this enormous monstrosity in a yellow shirt and blue overalls and these

653
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,240
big thick goggles and three strands of hair walk over to this car and kind of.

654
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,040
Kind of touching where the hood ornament should be and he like pokes it, but his finger

655
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,720
just goes down into the metal.

656
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,880
He poked it way too hard and he like completely destroys where it would pop out.

657
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Just like pressing aluminum foil.

658
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,320
Yeah, like crushing a little tin little coke can.

659
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,040
Kevin gets in the passenger seat of the car and the car just like almost touches the ground

660
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,560
with him in it.

661
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:59,600
As you guys head off to the Ocean City Police Department, it's currently March 25th, 2016.

662
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,560
The first murder happened on March 21st, so that was four days ago.

663
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,240
It is strange that there's some reason that he looked right directly at it happening and

664
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,760
he didn't do anything about it.

665
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,260
Nothing.

666
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,000
You think maybe he was scared?

667
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,140
Yeah.

668
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,280
Do you think that?

669
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,480
Perhaps there was some sort of optical refraction in the way.

670
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,280
Some natural phenomenon we can't really see getting in the way.

671
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,040
Maybe some kind of glare on the window.

672
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,760
Elwood, you've been reading those magic books.

673
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
I don't like.

674
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,300
Maybe.

675
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,160
Is there something like that?

676
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,520
There is nothing in Penn and Teller's How to Do Magic to prepare me for this.

677
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,020
No.

678
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,400
Yeah, I never liked.

679
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,240
It's always made me scared.

680
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,280
I love Penn and Teller.

681
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,640
They are good, aren't they?

682
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,360
They're serious.

683
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,640
He pulled a card out of my ear.

684
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,000
I couldn't feel it in there.

685
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,960
Maybe he's a magician.

686
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
I guess maybe some kind of sleight of hand.

687
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,040
He distracted him.

688
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,800
He maybe waved his hand in the air and that's what the guy looked at and then.

689
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,120
And maybe we didn't see that happen because it worked on us too.

690
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,600
Is this your first night at the opera?

691
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,920
No, I've done a couple.

692
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,400
You ever see anything on either of those nights that might be explained by close-up magic?

693
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,600
You think you get one of those envelopes when Penn and Teller are loose?

694
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,560
Well, it says here he was a Delta Green agent.

695
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,560
I assume that they just want us to make sure that all the T's are dotted and the I's are crossed.

696
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,720
Cross your I's.

697
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,160
If he's a magician, he's bad.

698
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,320
He does seem to leave a trail of bodies everywhere he goes.

699
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,800
That's not something that Penn and Teller do as far as I know.

700
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,720
Agent Clarissa puts in some headphones and starts reviewing the files herself.

701
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,200
The Ocean City Police Station is buzzing.

702
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,480
It is an extremely busy day here.

703
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,080
People are running around.

704
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,640
It's around 11 30 a.m. on March 25, 2016.

705
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,480
Someone greets you at the counter as the three of you arrive.

706
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
Hell yes, hi.

707
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,040
Special Agent Clarissa Sparrow, FBI.

708
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,960
These are my partners on this particular task force.

709
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,840
She slaps.

710
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,120
Luke is waving.

711
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,920
Kevin starts waving really good.

712
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,680
And Clarissa without even looking just slaps his hand down behind her.

713
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,840
Elwitt's kind of in the back legs kind of cross looking at the floor.

714
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,000
Quinlan and Gambeson are still at lunch, but you can talk to Garza.

715
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,520
Agent Garza from the FBI.

716
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,480
Sorry, he's in the first conference room.

717
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,680
That's where we have him set up.

718
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,080
Thank you.

719
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,800
And she points.

720
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,800
And you see an extremely large man, massively obese in his mid 60s.

721
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,480
He has a graying comb over and a gray suit.

722
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,040
He's wearing a red tie and you see red suspenders are poking out from his suit jacket,

723
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,480
which will not even get close to closing,

724
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,520
like to the point to where you can see both suspenders in full visibility.

725
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,200
And he's just om-nomming a grinder.

726
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,960
He is just going to town.

727
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,960
He's just like, oh, come in, come in, come on in.

728
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,720
Sit down.

729
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,520
You're the FBI?

730
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,000
Sorry, I got to get through this lunch while we're going, if that's cool.

731
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,920
I'm just going to eat while I talk.

732
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,480
Is that good?

733
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,120
You like that?

734
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,200
Elwitt, do you want him to eat while we talk?

735
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,140
Sure.

736
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:41,760
Good.

737
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,260
Yeah.

738
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,920
He goes, stands up, goes to shake your hand and he's got mayo like all over his fingers.

739
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,880
And he's like, oh shit.

740
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,720
And he rubs it just immediately on his jacket and then reaches his hand back out and says,

741
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,680
Agent Garza, but everybody calls me Uncle Jimmy.

742
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,440
Clarissa nods curtly, does not extend her hand and says,

743
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,600
Agent Clarissa Sparrow, priest to meet you, Agent Garza.

744
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,100
Sparrow.

745
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,600
All right.

746
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,080
Sounds good.

747
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,720
Agent Boyd.

748
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,120
And I firmly grabbed his hand.

749
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,600
And when I pull it away, I do a quick lick of my hand.

750
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,100
Jesus.

751
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,360
Whoa, did you get some of my sandwich in there?

752
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,640
Some of the mayonnaise was on there.

753
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,280
It's fine.

754
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,160
Okay.

755
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,560
All right.

756
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,140
Hi.

757
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,000
Wow.

758
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,120
You're a big fella, aren't you?

759
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,480
Did you play a game?

760
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,880
Those days are behind him though.

761
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,040
I still like to think about it.

762
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,760
I mean, you look like you could go pro any second.

763
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,800
I could have.

764
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,840
What happened?

765
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,200
Elwitt told me not to.

766
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,800
He decided not to.

767
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,720
Yeah, I decided not to.

768
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,560
Well, let's get down to brass tacks here.

769
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,680
And he slams pictures down on the desk in front of you.

770
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,240
Also, quick shout out to Dylan B from Deadwood, South Dakota for the NPC

771
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,440
Uncle Jimmy.

772
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
That one is just the TV show.

773
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,760
And Dylan B is a patron at at least our $10 level.

774
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,160
So he gets to create an NPC and a location that might get used.

775
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,960
An empuk.

776
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,680
An empuk.

777
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
And this is an empuk.

778
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,640
And so we've got this jovial man who insists that everyone call him uncle,

779
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,080
who is out of breath and sweating with any movement.

780
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,580
Nice.

781
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,320
All right, let's get down.

782
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,960
And he slams these pictures down on the table.

783
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,880
And it is horribly disturbing crime scene photos.

784
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,560
So everyone roll sanity for me.

785
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,860
Pass.

786
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,760
I also pass a 29 on a 45.

787
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,600
I got a 14 on a 45.

788
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
72 on an 80.

789
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,160
Oh, wow.

790
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,760
Okay, so everyone 80.

791
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,160
Jesus.

792
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,760
So everyone passes.

793
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
You are going to lose no sanity.

794
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,200
You've all seen stuff like this.

795
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,680
And he looks up at your faces.

796
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,320
And then he looks back down at these bloody violent pictures

797
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,160
where this normal home has been completely torn up.

798
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,680
And the two victims are missing their eyes and tongues.

799
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,120
Blood is covering the faces and splattering the ground behind them.

800
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,160
And the woman, Eileen McCarty, the ex-wife of Arvin Chilton,

801
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,400
is basically it's impossible to tell who she is.

802
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,640
And even her husband, it's impossible to really make out their faces,

803
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,640
because without an eyes and with all this blood covering bruises,

804
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,520
without eyes, without eyes, it's going to be hard to recognize these folks.

805
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,640
And he slams down.

806
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,360
He goes down.

807
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,200
You see anything crazy out of the ordinary?

808
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,120
You looked at all this information.

809
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,160
You saw there's no sign of forced entry.

810
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,680
Clearly, a neighbor even saw the husband and wife

811
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,840
let this ex-husband into their house.

812
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
You saw the weapon.

813
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,560
It was this large hook knife, I guess.

814
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,200
But me personally, if you're asking me, which you are,

815
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,240
I don't think that that body...

816
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,600
And he points at this just destroyed face.

817
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,400
I don't think that that's Eileen McCarty.

818
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,800
What reason do you have to believe that that's not Eileen McCarty?

819
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:16,320
Eileen McCarty was seen by witnesses in New York state on March 23rd at a gas station.

820
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
When was this picture taken?

821
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,320
That was March 21st.

822
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,440
That was the day of the murder.

823
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,360
Medical examiner said, you know, torture, death.

824
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,320
The torture was prolonged, extremely violent, obviously.

825
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,840
And he taps really hard and gets mayonnaise all over the pictures

826
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,120
that he's put out on this desk.

827
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,920
But I'm not worried.

828
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,480
I'm not worried.

829
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,120
You guys are here.

830
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,800
You guys are here to take care of everything.

831
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,280
And I understand that we needed reinforcements on this thing.

832
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,560
It's already been three days.

833
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,920
Everything's up in the air right now.

834
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,320
Everyone's pretty fucking confused.

835
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,560
But I think one of three things is going to happen.

836
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,520
He's either going to use his credit card, which we've tagged.

837
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,280
He's going to get pulled over or ticketed in a known car.

838
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Or he's just going to overplay his hand in some other way.

839
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,680
He's going to make a mistake and then we'll get him.

840
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,640
He's a desperate man.

841
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,680
Desperate man make desperate moves.

842
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,080
And that allows for reasonable people to catch him.

843
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,520
Is the footage from the gas station,

844
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,400
is that his last known appearance for us?

845
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,200
Yeah.

846
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,440
Yeah.

847
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,520
It's the last time we saw him.

848
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,200
Also, that gas station, I think, and he like picks around at some of his notes.

849
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,760
He's like, yeah, actually that gas station is where?

850
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,480
Eileen.

851
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,400
Eileen McCarty was seen the same day of that murder.

852
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,240
She was seen there.

853
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,480
Eileen McCarty was seen at the same gas station

854
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,720
where that attendant was brutally murdered by.

855
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,040
Yeah.

856
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,120
And two days after she supposedly died.

857
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,400
According to what witnesses?

858
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,440
Multiple witnesses.

859
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,280
Who?

860
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,840
Multiple.

861
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,520
Is that all you, Zach Note?

862
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,960
Multiple witnesses.

863
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,200
What do you want to know?

864
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,240
What do you want to know if they're like smart, if they could see?

865
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,560
I want to know why people in not her state at a gas station could identify her.

866
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,320
We were showing photos.

867
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,720
Have we identified the person on that footage that pulled up to the gas station?

868
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,240
No, the one who left, no.

869
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,360
But we did identify the guy who died.

870
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
His name was Quentin Harris, who's 59.

871
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,920
Do you think the guy in the car that drove off did it?

872
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,680
Well, no.

873
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,240
No.

874
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,480
Cause it's on tape.

875
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,360
It's Arvin Chilton.

876
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,080
You saw it.

877
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,360
Yeah.

878
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,880
Okay.

879
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,200
Yeah.

880
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,000
You saw that, right?

881
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,280
Yeah.

882
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,240
Do you want to watch it again?

883
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,120
No, he's well aware.

884
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,080
He's testing you.

885
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,040
He's got an interesting investigative mind.

886
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,400
But why don't you save the mind games for Kevin is extremely confused, but just nods

887
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,520
his head and agrees.

888
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,960
Was Eileen McCarty seen at the gas station before or after the murder?

889
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,840
Before.

890
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,640
How long before?

891
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,200
He picks through a couple more notes.

892
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,960
Mayo is just spreading throughout, slowly getting on everything.

893
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,200
If any of those drops kind of come near Elwood, he's wiping a finger up and tasting it.

894
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh, uncle Jimmy looks over at Clarissa and is just like, how long have you three been

895
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,720
working together?

896
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,960
This partnership is very recent.

897
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,460
Hmm.

898
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,360
I'm sorry.

899
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,120
He's been my friend a long time.

900
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,400
Yeah, I get that.

901
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,760
I see that in the two of you.

902
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,400
All right.

903
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,520
So, yeah, if you want any phone records, there's really not much there.

904
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,400
We've got it tracked and an alert is set on it.

905
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,640
So if he makes any phone calls, we're going to know about it.

906
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,320
And I think that's how we're going to get him.

907
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,520
Nothing out of sorts.

908
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,680
He did call Eileen on the morning of March 16th.

909
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,480
So that's five days pre death.

910
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,760
Supposed death of Eileen McCarty.

911
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Did we try just calling him?

912
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,160
Yeah.

913
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:00,960
What happened?

914
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,920
He didn't pick up.

915
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,880
Can I try?

916
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,400
No, I mean, sure.

917
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,360
You can if you want.

918
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,080
I don't care.

919
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:06,400
Yes.

920
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,680
I dialed the phone number.

921
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,360
Okay.

922
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,400
Did you learn about that March 16th call from phone records?

923
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:12,880
Yeah.

924
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,520
How long did they indicate that that phone call lasted?

925
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,520
Two minutes, one second.

926
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,880
71 seconds.

927
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,560
Oh, 71 is wrong.

928
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,060
Huh.

929
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,960
121.

930
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,760
No, math was never my strong suit.

931
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,920
Uncle Jimmy's good at a lot of stuff.

932
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,720
Math ain't it?

933
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,220
Ha.

934
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,660
Did you have many nieces and nephews, Agent Garza?

935
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,620
Yeah, four.

936
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,660
What are their full names?

937
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,220
What do they do?

938
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,060
Where were they on March 23rd?

939
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,200
Why?

940
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,580
Anything that can help.

941
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,060
It's weird.

942
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:47,540
Didn't you say?

943
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,420
We've also got credit card tracking info.

944
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:55,380
It's completely normal until March 20th, day before the first murder.

945
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,020
Becomes irregular and then ceases.

946
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,940
What does that mean?

947
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,260
Yeah, it got weird and then stopped.

948
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,060
Like what?

949
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:08,180
Yeah, basically he was clearly using the card not in Ocean City.

950
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:14,020
The card was being used up toward New York and then it just stops.

951
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,420
So it's clear that he used it, then committed the murder, hasn't used it since.

952
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,860
And what was his last call?

953
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,020
Let's see.

954
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,940
Go to the last page.

955
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,300
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.

956
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,380
Yeah, it goes to Alexander Duchesne.

957
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,780
What do we know about him?

958
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,380
He's the landlord.

959
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,980
Of Chilton?

960
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,060
Yeah, he's Arvin Chilton's landlord.

961
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,980
Alexander Duchesne, old guy.

962
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,180
How long did that call last?

963
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:47,060
That call was 29 seconds or zero minutes and 29 seconds.

964
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,820
Have we talked to him?

965
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,860
Quick math.

966
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,140
Have we talked to Duchesne?

967
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,660
Yeah, we've talked to Duchesne.

968
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,620
What did he say?

969
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,980
Talked to him on the 23rd.

970
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,220
He said that Arvin's been living with him for five years.

971
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,740
Arvin lives upstairs.

972
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:06,420
It's like one of those houses where just the upstairs is an apartment.

973
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,660
It's got an external doorway, stairs on the outside.

974
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,060
Gone up there into Arvin's apartment, but downstairs is where the old man lives.

975
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,420
I don't know, man.

976
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,380
Seems like a shut-in.

977
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:22,580
When Eileen was at that gas station, was that the Quinlan on duty at that time?

978
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,500
Does she have contact with Quinlan?

979
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,340
Uh, yeah, let's look.

980
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,940
And he'll flip through some video and...

981
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:33,860
Oh, no.

982
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,660
Oh, wow.

983
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,140
Yeah, no.

984
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,580
All the inside tapes must have gotten taken.

985
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,020
Bye.

986
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,380
That's really weird.

987
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,100
Who took him?

988
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,740
No, I mean, like, we never got him and he's flipping through and he's looking.

989
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,940
Yeah, they were never checked in.

990
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,740
Clarissa gives a little cough and she says,

991
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,380
Can I speak with my associates in the hallway for one moment?

992
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,180
Yeah, actually, I'm really busy here as he, like, finishes this huge sandwich.

993
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,620
There's a third of it left and he just shoves the entire thing in his mouth.

994
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,180
And he's like, I'll wrap up here.

995
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,220
And so if you guys want to head over to Chilton's and just kind of get lay of the land,

996
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,860
I'm sure you can talk to, uh, when, uh, uh, what are their names?

997
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,980
Quinlan and Gambeson, the PDs around here.

998
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,740
They'll be back after lunch and you can talk to them.

999
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,260
But yeah, go ahead and just head on out and we'll talk.

1000
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,780
We'll catch up later if you want.

1001
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,380
But he has seen the video.

1002
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:31,780
He has.

1003
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,700
He's very confused by it.

1004
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,060
It doesn't make any sense to him.

1005
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,660
And so that's all.

1006
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,220
He passed his sanity check and he's like,

1007
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:40,980
Yeah, I don't know.

1008
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:41,780
People are strange.

1009
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,260
The guy probably didn't want to be caught up in anything.

1010
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,620
Just needed to get away.

1011
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,220
You know, the bystander effect.

1012
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,700
He honestly probably had a little pot on him.

1013
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,020
You know, a lot of them do.

1014
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,820
Yeah.

1015
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,940
Bystanders.

1016
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,580
Yeah.

1017
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,380
Bystanders typically more like high standards.

1018
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,180
Am I right?

1019
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,700
That's very funny, Agent Garza.

1020
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,180
Thank you.

1021
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,260
Uh, Uncle Jimmy, you can call me Uncle Jimmy.

1022
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,900
This was, um, thank you for your assistance, Agent Garza.

1023
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,860
Thanks for coming.

1024
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,260
All right.

1025
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:08,980
Uh, yeah.

1026
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,020
Holler if you need anything.

1027
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,140
Here's my phone number.

1028
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,420
Here's my card.

1029
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,340
I'll be here or I'll be elsewhere.

1030
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,580
Isn't that how it always goes?

1031
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,780
Where are you guys staying?

1032
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,820
You have a pleasant evening.

1033
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,140
Okay.

1034
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,380
When you guys pull up to Arvin Chilton's apartment,

1035
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,860
it is literally half a mile from the police station.

1036
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,620
This neighborhood is really nice.

1037
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,380
It's just this like March 20, what is it?

1038
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,180
March 25th.

1039
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:34,820
Shit.

1040
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,620
March 25th.

1041
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,780
It's a beautiful sunny day.

1042
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:43,540
Big fluffers are up in the clouds and blue skies.

1043
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:48,420
All of these buildings have like white trim on the columns

1044
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,980
and the stairwells and the, the, uh, what are these Thomas?

1045
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,860
Braillings.

1046
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,740
Like a railing.

1047
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,060
Yeah.

1048
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,380
Like railings are all, uh, white.

1049
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,860
You pull up to a cute little baby blue home.

1050
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,140
It's two stories.

1051
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:07,380
And like Uncle Jimmy said, there is a staircase on the left side of this house

1052
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:13,860
that leads up to a tiny little duplex up above this tiny little home.

1053
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:18,500
And you guys pull up at about 1230 PM.

1054
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,420
It's about 1230 PM.

1055
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,340
We've just arrived at the home of...

1056
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,300
Are you like talking into a voice recorder?

1057
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,180
Are you, uh, are you going to be taking notes this whole time?

1058
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,460
Does that make you uncomfortable, Mr. Boyd?

1059
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,900
I feel like we need to be careful about what kind of records we keep on

1060
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,780
a case like this.

1061
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,980
Yeah, we need to be careful.

1062
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,140
You're absolutely right.

1063
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:47,460
But I have to keep some official records since we are technically investigating this for the FBI.

1064
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,620
There has to be the official cover and then...

1065
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,180
And then every now and then it switches off.

1066
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,060
Wink, wink.

1067
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,580
You roughly get the idea.

1068
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,140
Yeah.

1069
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:00,260
Kevin walks up the stairs and knocks on the door and it like shakes the home.

1070
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,420
With every step of these shaky old stairs,

1071
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,940
this thing is like almost giving way under Kevin.

1072
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,060
And when you get up there, you see a sign on the door.

1073
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,860
Taped up.

1074
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,060
Police investigation ongoing.

1075
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,180
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1076
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:16,900
Nonsense.

1077
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,100
Agent Garza gave you keys to children's apartment.

1078
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,740
What's going on?

1079
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,500
And there is a light on in the downstairs apartment.

1080
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:30,100
Yeah, Kevin's hands are a little too big to really functionally use a key.

1081
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,380
So he steps back and...

1082
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:38,020
Sorry, I had you be a thief and then I gave you keys to get in.

1083
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:38,900
That's my bad, Joe.

1084
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,780
Yeah, that was the only time this was going to come in handy.

1085
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,260
He was pulling out the lockpick set from his back pocket and then saw

1086
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,060
Agent Sparrows put a key in the door and it just deflates even more.

1087
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,500
I guess we're still waiting for that skill set to come in use.

1088
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,180
There will be a time, I'm sure of it.

1089
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:03,940
Perhaps this whole mission will be the time that you learn that your criminal ways will not pay.

1090
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,940
I mean, they paid for most of the things in my life so far.

1091
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,260
They paid pretty good.

1092
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,340
She turns on you and is brandishing the key in your face and she's like,

1093
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,420
no, sir, you will receive your come up,

1094
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,340
but I'm willing to work with your kind against these unnatural forces.

1095
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,860
Don't do that to him.

1096
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:29,620
And Kevin's standing there like pushing away the threatening key from Elvit's face.

1097
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,060
All right then, as long as we understand each other and

1098
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:39,140
Clarissa is genuinely very intimidated by the Robert Wadlow man.

1099
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,020
Yeah, who wouldn't be?

1100
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:42,740
Are you okay?

1101
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,620
Thanks for having my back there, Kevin.

1102
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:46,900
I'm fine.

1103
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,700
Thank you.

1104
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,460
I was a little worried.

1105
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,620
It's a 640 square foot apartment.

1106
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,740
This looks like about a 640 square feet.

1107
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,740
Right here must be tens of dollars.

1108
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,180
So you walk into the bedroom.

1109
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,060
Like when you open up the door, you're walking into the studio.

1110
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,860
It's a bedroom and there's one door to the bathroom all around.

1111
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,220
There's a record collection.

1112
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,220
There's a bunch of Elvis Presley.

1113
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:17,940
There's a bookshelf filled with the works of the immortal bard himself, William Shakespeare,

1114
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:26,100
as well as a DVD collection that shows he did not shy away from the film adaptations.

1115
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,820
And there's really not much else around here.

1116
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,780
So he's got like these Shakespeares and some books

1117
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,300
and then also DVD copies of just those same plays and books.

1118
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,340
Is there a computer anywhere near here?

1119
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,100
There is not a computer, no.

1120
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,620
Well, it looks like there's nothing to see here.

1121
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,900
Let's move on to the next place.

1122
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,540
Everybody roll alertness for me.

1123
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,540
Critical success.

1124
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,740
55 on an 80.

1125
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,940
A regular success.

1126
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,380
A 30 on a 70.

1127
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,740
I got a 97.

1128
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,140
Okay.

1129
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,620
So Kevin is completely startled.

1130
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:04,820
Boyd, Elwood, Elwood Boyd is not startled.

1131
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:12,420
You see this coming, but before you even see anyone creeping up behind you

1132
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,260
and kind of like putting themselves around the doorway,

1133
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:24,740
Clarissa, you smell old bandages in the air.

1134
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:32,740
The odor is strong enough for you to immediately turn around.

1135
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,820
She turns around and expects to find a mummy.

1136
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,180
Expecting a mummy, you see Alexander Duchesne.

1137
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:43,220
He is 79 years of age.

1138
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,780
He is around five foot six, 210 pounds.

1139
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,740
An old man.

1140
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:54,340
He has carefully quaffed white hair and he has heavy black glasses.

1141
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:00,900
He is clothed in old often mended clothing and a pork pie hat.

1142
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:08,900
And he has a long winding scar up the right half of his face.

1143
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:15,940
It's clear that he drinks due to the large nose with burst capillaries,

1144
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:22,500
just filling this big, almost like pulsating thing on the tip of his nose.

1145
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,260
And he moves slowly, seemingly with great pain,

1146
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,380
as he kind of like pops his head around the side and is like,

1147
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,020
More officers.

1148
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,500
Hello, more officers.

1149
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,700
Hello, there.

1150
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:42,020
Before he can, he's like coming up the stairs into the doorway behind us.

1151
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:42,980
Yeah, he's right there.

1152
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:47,060
Before he can like get in, Clarissa is advancing like with her badge out and she says,

1153
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:52,020
Special Agent Clarissa Sparrow, sir, this is an act of crime scene investigation.

1154
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,020
You were compromising that crime scene.

1155
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,300
Are you Mr. Duchesne?

1156
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,100
Oh, I'm so sorry, yeah, yeah, I'm Mr. Duchesne.

1157
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,860
I'm going to have to ask you to go back downstairs.

1158
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:03,940
Slowly, he raises his hands in the air with a wry smile and he's like,

1159
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,340
Sorry, sorry.

1160
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,860
Sir, we're going to come speak to you in a moment, please.

1161
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,140
Okay, please do, come on.

1162
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,260
Please wait for us downstairs.

1163
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,060
Whenever you're ready.

1164
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:13,700
Yes, fine.

1165
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,180
That's fine.

1166
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:19,220
And he slowly creeps back around and like you can almost hear his bones creaking

1167
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:24,500
with the pain look on his face as he turns around and it's like, okay.

1168
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:30,900
And just kind of waves one hand up in the air as his other hand grabs the rail like intensely.

1169
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,340
Kevin waves back at him.

1170
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,780
And he heads back down the stairs.

1171
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:34,520
Really?

1172
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,980
That was a landlord.

1173
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,620
Elwood wants to, um, clock this apartment for things that, uh, might be valuable.

1174
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,020
Oh, okay.

1175
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:42,420
Yeah, yeah.

1176
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,380
Go ahead and roll search for criminology.

1177
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,900
Yeah, absolutely.

1178
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,500
This is what you guys do.

1179
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,180
Fuck.

1180
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,820
I critically fail either one.

1181
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:56,260
I've got a 60 criminology and I rolled a 77.

1182
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:02,900
There's a Shakespeare play inside the book has a pamphlet.

1183
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,260
Like you would receive when you went and actually saw a play.

1184
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,140
What are those called?

1185
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:07,860
A play bill.

1186
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,500
Play bill.

1187
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,620
A play bill.

1188
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:15,780
When you, when you flick through some of these, these books, this play bill pops out and you

1189
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:23,860
are dead fucking certain that a, this is from an early original, like one of the first American

1190
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,180
runs of this Shakespeare production.

1191
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,860
This is a globe theater play bill.

1192
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:36,660
And it's like signed by some important director who signed by John Wilkes Booth.

1193
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,980
It's signed by John Wilkes Booth.

1194
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,340
Wasn't his brother an actor?

1195
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,660
I think as was, he was a very famous actor.

1196
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:50,180
And so you are dead fucking positive that this is going to bring in at least like 10

1197
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:50,740
grand.

1198
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,020
I pocket it.

1199
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,100
I try to do it feefully.

1200
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:54,980
Oh, you don't.

1201
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,940
They both see you.

1202
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,340
Oh, I see you get that.

1203
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:03,540
And I just like grab a random book and put it in my back pocket.

1204
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:05,940
What the hell?

1205
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,420
What?

1206
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,660
What are you grabbing evidence for?

1207
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,420
It's signed by John Wilkes Booth.

1208
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,100
This gets a pretty penny.

1209
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,340
I grab it from her hands.

1210
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:20,580
All right, let's do a dexterity competition.

1211
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,300
No, you're not in this.

1212
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:23,940
Crit fail.

1213
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,140
Oh my God.

1214
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,340
Regular fail.

1215
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,620
All right, well, that still means that we rip the book in half.

1216
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,780
Yeah, you 100% rip the book in half.

1217
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,100
Oh, no, I thought at least it's all its value.

1218
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,020
Oh God, you did this.

1219
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,380
You did this.

1220
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,620
A little tear starts to form at the edge of Kevin's eye.

1221
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,980
Damn it, Kevin.

1222
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,020
It wasn't your fault.

1223
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:46,660
He did this.

1224
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,260
He start.

1225
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,580
You two, you keep your hands to yourself.

1226
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,740
Stand right in the middle of this room.

1227
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,340
Don't touch anything else.

1228
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,380
Elwood kind of rolls his eyes, but also looks at Kevin like,

1229
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,020
that sounds like she knows what she's doing.

1230
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:07,940
Now let me use my investigators eyes to search this room.

1231
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,660
Do it.

1232
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,180
35, success.

1233
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:10,740
Nice.

1234
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,500
You find there's a record collection with a bunch of Elvis Presley.

1235
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:20,340
There's a bookshelf filled with the works of the immortal bard himself, William Shakespeare,

1236
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,580
one of which is torn in half on the floor.

1237
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:28,980
And you also see a DVD collection that shows he did not shy away from the film adaptations.

1238
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,180
Everything appears to be as it seems in this room.

1239
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,940
Should we go rough up the landlord?

1240
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,860
If it comes to that, of course, Kevin, that just can't be our immediate.

1241
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,540
We're on official business here.

1242
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,900
And he says that kind of sarcastically with an eye toward Sparrow.

1243
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,620
Sparrow doesn't catch that and she like nods in approval.

1244
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:50,740
That's right.

1245
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:53,220
Okay.

1246
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,820
I'll put my mean face on.

1247
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:00,900
And his face turns mean, but it actually is like kind of scary.

1248
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:07,540
Like the happy, dumb smile goes to like a serious, like zoned in face and idea roll.

1249
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,100
Yeah.

1250
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,180
For some, for anything we might be missing here.

1251
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,060
Yeah, sure.

1252
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:15,300
What is that based off of intelligence pass 62 on a 70.

1253
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,060
You have cleaned this room.

1254
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,140
Like it is, it has been clocked.

1255
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:23,780
You have garnered all the information you are going to get from Arvin Chilton's apartment.

1256
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,780
I believe we've gathered everything we can here.

1257
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,540
Let's go at this time.

1258
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,060
Let's go talk with Mr. Dushane.

1259
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,620
That does seem like the next course of action.

1260
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,340
After you.

1261
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,100
No, no, I insist after you.

1262
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,940
I start clomping down the stairs.

1263
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,100
As you're clomping down the stairs, you actually hear coming out of the basement,

1264
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:46,980
not even basement, just the first floor apartment of this two story duplex.

1265
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,260
This, uh, this high wine.

1266
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,540
Is he making us tea?

1267
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,740
Yeah, he's making you tea.

1268
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:03,220
That's nice.

1269
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:12,740
Okay, the entire house shakes and you hear a coughing fit from inside.

1270
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:25,220
Just this coming, coming, coming, and the door opens and you see this man.

1271
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,580
It's the same man as before.

1272
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,460
And he's, he's wearing the same clothes.

1273
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,380
It's crazy.

1274
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,060
And this close to him, you're overwhelmed by his odor.

1275
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,660
He smells really bad.

1276
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:41,860
And for the two of you who didn't smell it earlier, it's like old bandages bad.

1277
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,380
And he seems to have a cold.

1278
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,420
He's like coughing and he's just like sniffling a bunch.

1279
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,820
He invites you inside really eagerly.

1280
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,580
He's just like, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1281
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:50,900
Okay.

1282
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,580
Um, I have tea.

1283
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,260
I have tea for you guys.

1284
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:57,140
If you want tea, um, I've put out some, some plates.

1285
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:57,940
I've got some more food.

1286
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,740
Here's some chairs.

1287
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,340
You can sit here and here.

1288
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,900
Um, your, your name was Sparrow, right?

1289
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:03,460
Agent Sparrow.

1290
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,660
I pass him my FBI card.

1291
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,060
Perfect.

1292
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,340
And do you guys have cards too?

1293
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,420
No, they're just getting theirs made up.

1294
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,060
Unfortunately.

1295
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,020
Oh, okay.

1296
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,140
Sorry.

1297
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:17,640
Sorry.

1298
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,020
I'll wash my hands real quick.

1299
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,100
He goes back and starts washing his hands.

1300
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:29,220
And you see, uh, looking around this place, you see a very sad home decorated by an old

1301
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,060
man with no relatives.

1302
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:35,860
There's an ashtray on the table and it hasn't been used.

1303
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:36,820
It's clean.

1304
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,460
There's a bunch of rolled up newspapers in a bucket.

1305
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,740
A few mops are in the corner of the room strangely.

1306
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:46,100
And there's an odd number of baseballs placed around.

1307
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:55,060
There's a copy of as you like it sitting on the coffee table and he brings out a spread.

1308
01:03:55,060 --> 01:04:01,460
I mean, just like a charcutte, but like the way a 79 year old shut in would, would bring

1309
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,580
you charcutte.

1310
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,620
And so it's just these like charcutte cold cuts.

1311
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,100
Oh, it's charcutte as hell.

1312
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,260
The charcutte is good.

1313
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,780
It's cold cuts and some cheeses.

1314
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:20,660
And then there's a bowl on the plate with some big olives on it, green and black olives.

1315
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:29,460
And he sits down and he's just like, I'm sorry, he screams as he eases into a chair that you

1316
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,860
think is like the only place where he sits.

1317
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:37,380
Elwood wants to put a grimy finger into the olive bowl and pick up a bunch.

1318
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,060
Like as he's setting it down.

1319
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:39,940
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1320
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:40,500
He's already.

1321
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:41,940
Oh yeah, yeah.

1322
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,020
Please, please eat up, eat up.

1323
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:48,260
Pretty sure I know what kind of maniac Joe took before this game started.

1324
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:48,500
Yeah.

1325
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:54,020
As soon as Kevin sees Elwood doing that, he's grabbing some stuff off the board, but it's

1326
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,380
like one handful is like half of the stuff on there.

1327
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,860
And he's just like, dig in, dig in.

1328
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,500
Agent Sparrow, dig in.

1329
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,420
I'm going to grab some tea for everyone.

1330
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,980
And he goes in and no tea for me, please.

1331
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,340
Chocolate milk.

1332
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,460
I do.

1333
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,460
I love chocolate milk.

1334
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,700
Who doesn't love chocolate milk?

1335
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:14,980
Just make that too.

1336
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:15,700
Thank you.

1337
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,060
Two chocolate milks.

1338
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:20,260
And you hear him rummaging in the fridge for a while.

1339
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,060
Can I do a search?

1340
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,060
Can someone else do a search of this room?

1341
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,260
I'd like to clock.

1342
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,700
I'd like to clock around the room.

1343
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,180
Yeah.

1344
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:29,700
Oh, crit success.

1345
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,380
Oh, 33 again.

1346
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:33,540
Regular pass with a 16.

1347
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,260
Okay.

1348
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:39,860
With a regular pass, you think that the baseballs are placed very strangely around this room.

1349
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:44,100
And why does an old man have a bunch of baseballs hanging around?

1350
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,460
They're like a distinct pattern.

1351
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:46,980
No, not really.

1352
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,500
What about to me?

1353
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,780
Roll SIGINT, I guess.

1354
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,860
No, it's a fail.

1355
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,220
It's an 89 on a 40.

1356
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,260
Yeah, that ain't going to do it.

1357
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:59,700
And then with the crit success, you note he has a copy of As You Like It.

1358
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,100
For me, what is that?

1359
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,620
Which is written by Shakespeare.

1360
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:01,860
Yeah.

1361
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:02,580
Okay.

1362
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:02,980
Okay.

1363
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,500
So that's what I wanted to ask about.

1364
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,780
Does this copy of As You Like It look like it came from one of the sets upstairs?

1365
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,580
Yeah, totally.

1366
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,900
Same printing, same publishing company.

1367
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,220
Yeah.

1368
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,900
Clarissa is picking it up and is holding it and waiting for him to get back in the room.

1369
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,300
Cool.

1370
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,300
Kevin's like, he likes Shakespeare too?

1371
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:23,700
So he comes back in with tea for himself and chocolate milk for Elwood and Kevin.

1372
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:29,620
And then he looks at Agent Sparrow and he's like, seriously, dig in.

1373
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:30,900
Hey, thanks.

1374
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,340
Are you a thief too?

1375
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,940
So she's holding the book, she says.

1376
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,860
Complete works of William Shakespeare.

1377
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,060
Huffington.

1378
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:38,660
Huffington.

1379
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,260
Fartington Publishers.

1380
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,780
Third edition, 1976.

1381
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,260
Yeah.

1382
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:49,300
That's the same one that Alvin Chilton had upstairs.

1383
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,820
Did you take this from his room?

1384
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:51,860
Oh, no.

1385
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,780
Arvin lent that to me.

1386
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,980
He lent it to me to read.

1387
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,620
When?

1388
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,660
Can I humint that?

1389
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,620
Yeah, you can humint that.

1390
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,420
Fuck.

1391
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,580
It's a 52 on a 50.

1392
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,940
I got a 16 on an 80.

1393
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,740
I got a 45 on a 20.

1394
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:15,140
With his success, you see that he seems to be telling the truth.

1395
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:18,180
He did get it from Arvin Chilton.

1396
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:20,740
Arvin gave it to me.

1397
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,860
He gave it to me.

1398
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:25,540
He's not feeling weird or wonky around by cops.

1399
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,700
He's like, I didn't take it.

1400
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,020
Is Arvin's crime spree public knowledge?

1401
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:31,140
Yes.

1402
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,900
And he's identified as a suspect.

1403
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:33,620
Arvin.

1404
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:33,860
Yeah.

1405
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:34,580
Yes.

1406
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:35,220
Okay.

1407
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,460
So, like, this guy knows that Arvin is...

1408
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,820
He didn't do it.

1409
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,540
I swear.

1410
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,420
Like, he wouldn't...

1411
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,260
He wouldn't have done it.

1412
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,220
He was a good guy.

1413
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,740
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.

1414
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,980
We're trying to figure out who did these horrible things.

1415
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,300
Now, when did Arvin lend you that book?

1416
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:54,340
My mind.

1417
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,140
You know, it's a...

1418
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,900
Try and think, please.

1419
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,300
It fails so much.

1420
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:06,660
The 20th, maybe the 19th.

1421
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:10,100
Maybe it was right before he disappeared on the 21st.

1422
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,620
It was very recent.

1423
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,500
Yeah, it was recent.

1424
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,100
Did you and Arvin talk often?

1425
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,620
Yeah, he was really nice.

1426
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:21,460
He would pick me up groceries if I needed something and I wasn't doing well.

1427
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,180
I had a fall.

1428
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:29,220
Two years ago and he took such good care of me.

1429
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:31,940
What's the last thing you guys talked about?

1430
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,460
He was getting ready to go to Starbucks.

1431
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,420
That's where he worked.

1432
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,020
That's where he worked.

1433
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:43,540
And I haven't seen him since that morning.

1434
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,100
He was getting ready to go in for a shift.

1435
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,180
Did he see another character that day?

1436
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,180
No, everything seems so normal.

1437
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:55,620
And honestly, people talk about him doing all these horrible things.

1438
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:56,420
He wouldn't have done it.

1439
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,700
Agent Asparrow, please.

1440
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,260
You have to try some of these cold cuts or these olives.

1441
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:00,820
Aren't they good?

1442
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,900
Did Arvin seem like a troubled man to you?

1443
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,660
He ignores your question completely and is waiting for an answer.

1444
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,460
Elwood is licking his fingers off.

1445
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,460
Yeah, the olives are great.

1446
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,460
They're like old, which Elwood loves.

1447
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,300
They taste old.

1448
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,300
That's the way I like them.

1449
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:20,760
Good.

1450
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:25,780
Kevin, ever since he played football, has been very in tune with his body.

1451
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:33,620
Does he feel sick or weird or anything from the half board of meat that he's eaten?

1452
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:35,060
Roll Constitution.

1453
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:38,900
Crit success.

1454
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:43,140
You are extremely worried about how long this meat has been left out.

1455
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:46,740
You are very worried about how long this meat has been left out.

1456
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:55,060
It is not reacting in your tum tum the way that a nice shock bowl would feel in your tummy.

1457
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:57,220
Um, I'm sick.

1458
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:00,260
And he gets up and goes and throws up in the kitchen sink.

1459
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,740
He's trying to make us sick.

1460
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,820
Are you trying to poison us, Mr. Deschenes?

1461
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,260
No, no, God, no.

1462
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:07,220
I'm sorry.

1463
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:10,500
I must have just forgotten when I bought it.

1464
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,540
I would never.

1465
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,820
You could go away for a long time if you tried to do harm to federal agents.

1466
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,940
Is that what you're trying to do?

1467
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,860
Oh my goodness.

1468
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,220
No, no.

1469
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:22,340
Kevin comes back over and sits down and grabs another hand.

1470
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,980
Like without thinking, just grabs another handful of meat.

1471
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,500
Elwood tries to grab his hand.

1472
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,780
It's already in his mouth.

1473
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:32,500
He like lifts you up off of your chair to take a bite.

1474
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,460
Kevin, he just said it didn't make you feel good.

1475
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,940
Oh, well.

1476
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:40,100
And he just kind of sits there chewing on it.

1477
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,260
He's holding, uh, Elwood's holding his hand out in front of Kevin.

1478
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,060
Spit it out.

1479
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:43,940
Spit it out.

1480
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,020
Kevin spits out his food into Elwood's hand.

1481
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,180
Clarissa is watching that just like wide-eyed.

1482
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,180
Elwood takes it and puts it back onto the charcuterie board.

1483
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,500
Now, where were we?

1484
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,220
Yeah, uh, where were we?

1485
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:05,540
Deschenes' face is twisted and contorted into this so grossed out and so happy.

1486
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:11,700
It's clear that he's like a little freak in this moment and he's just like super into it.

1487
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:15,780
He really gets along with Elwood like immediately.

1488
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,700
The vibes are there.

1489
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,420
The aura around both of them is similar.

1490
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:21,060
Similar, yeah.

1491
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,700
The reason Kevin didn't notice his stink is because he's used to Elwood's stink.

1492
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:34,180
Mr. Deschenes, did Arvin mention this particular play as one of his favorites?

1493
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,620
Is there a reason he lent it to you?

1494
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:39,060
Yeah, he thought it was fitting.

1495
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:46,580
Feels like I'm on the last bend of the deep end.

1496
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:49,780
But the drowning's been just fine.

1497
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:58,020
And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind.

1498
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,820
I'll be alright.

1499
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:04,900
I can go there now that I stare.

1500
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,900
Death in the face.

1501
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,980
I'll be alright.

1502
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:12,740
I can go there now that I stare.

1503
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,260
Death in the face.

1504
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:38,260
Doesn't it always seem like the parts that made us laugh now make us cry?

1505
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:46,740
Doesn't it always seem like the villain Paul in the strings is a regular guy?

1506
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:53,140
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

1507
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:01,380
Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.

1508
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,940
I'll be alright.

1509
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,940
I can go there now that I stare.

1510
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:12,020
Death in the face.

1511
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,100
I'll be alright.

1512
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,860
I can go there now that I stare.

1513
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,900
Death in the face.

1514
01:13:35,940 --> 01:14:00,900
There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.

1515
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:08,740
Whitewashed hymns and the deadliest sins push me to my limit.

1516
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:16,900
But when you deconstruct, you shit out of luck for a minute.

1517
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:22,900
After the last bend, you can break it all down to rebuild it.

1518
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:48,900
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

1519
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:56,900
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

1520
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,900
I'll be alright.

1521
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:02,900
I can go there now that I stare.

1522
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,900
Death in the face.

1523
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,900
I'll be alright.

1524
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:12,900
I can go there now that I stare.

1525
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:24,900
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.
