00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
Hello friends, strangers, bits of biological matter, and hitchhikers from all over the

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
galaxy.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,120
I am your guide Wolf the Dog, here to disseminate information and tips to help better your life

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,080
in the vast emptiness of space.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,600
Get your towels ready, cause it's gonna be a wet one here at 694.2 PTBP, the galaxy's

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,200
only holistic radio station.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,360
I hope y'all are ready to buy some of my supplements, cause we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
week.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,880
This one comes from Man's Best Friend's Best Friend on Twitter, and Zach's friend Jack

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,440
in real life.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,160
Note here says, your wedding reception this weekend made Zach real fuckin' happy.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,900
You two compliment each other so beautifully.

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,460
He has a personal request for Wolfie.

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,540
He writes, at some point in the show Zach was having a drink with 1800 and some type

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,100
of seltzer or soda water I think.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,700
Problem is, I'm too lazy to go back and find the episode slash recipe lol, so I'd like

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:19,500
to request a formalization of the drink recipe, with measurements included, read by Mr. Dog.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,100
Ooh baby, Mr. Dog, I love the ring of that.

19
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,540
Well best friend, I'm in the delightful position of being able to deliver exactly what you

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,540
request.

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,940
I have here the recipe for Zach's Roleplay and Juice.

22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:43,700
It is two ounces 1800 silver tequila and one ounce Grand Marnier in a rocks filled glass

23
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,340
with crushed ice, topped with grapefruit spindrift sparkling water, served with a lime wedge

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,380
that should be promptly squeezed and muddled into the drink with dirty fingers.

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,900
Enjoy the blessing and curse of being the Luis Mendoza of your roleplaying group.

26
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:07,020
He's the kid from D2, The Mighty Ducks, and D3, The Mighty Ducks, who could skate real

27
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,420
fast but could not stop.

28
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,620
You know, people call Wolf the Luis Mendoza of radio, I uh, I don't know what it means

29
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,620
but people keep saying it.

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,340
Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at Pretending Pod

31
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,860

32

and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

33
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,020
Also get up on the contest happening over on the subreddit, r slash pretending to be

34
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,660
people, all entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5e starter set.

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,060
If anything, go check out all the brilliant entries on the thread so far, including a

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,340
work of staggeringly beautiful non-fiction that depicts love between Joe Terry and his

37
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,220
character Clark Bishop.

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,660
Seriously y'all, it's there, and it's delicious.

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,980
Speaking of facts, it is the news.

40
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,620
Last time, Kathy Piston, Doug Jacobs, and the body of Agent Trent Chad, Keith Vigna,

41
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,820
Clark Bishop, and John Lee Kevinmore did their best to survive what seemed to be an

42
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
imminent demise.

43
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,580
After a lethal contest with a human man that is also somehow seemingly part fish and a

44
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,860
monstrous giant version of the same abomination, Keith Vigna fell asleep due to blood loss,

45
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,360
taking us now to the darkness inside his unconscious mind.

46
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,440
It is kudzu with no backbone.

47
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,520
Keith, yes.

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,120
In the darkness, you see a woman wearing old-timey clothing.

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,000
She looks very normal, except for the hole in the middle of her head.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,940
Regardless of how she turns to look either way, you can see right through the middle

51
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,600
of her head, and she is walking toward you.

52
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,680
As she walks, her clothes change multiple times, as if she's in an unnatural fashion

53
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,600
show that is moving forward in time, decade by decade.

54
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,920
She pulls out a Zippo lighter, and as it hits the ground, you see the House of Chief Maggie

55
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,760
Cook go up in flames.

56
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,600
You saw this happen in the front yard, but this time, right now, you see it from the

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,800
backyard.

58
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,740
The fire spreads and explodes toward you, over you, through you, and you turn around

59
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:06,240
to see these flames ignite the pond, Bean's Pond, and immediately, the water evaporates.

60
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,300
Looking down into a dry basin filled with fish flopping their final flops, you see your

61
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:21,080
brother Ferguson Beans, crouched over a hatch in the ground, wearing a cowboy hat and spurs,

62
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,960
and the watch your father, William, gave him.

63
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,480
You look down on your wrist, and the watch is there.

64
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:35,400
You look up, and the pond is filled with water and animals, and Tildy B. Mitchell comes walking

65
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,320
up out of the water toward you, and darkness fills your vision once more.

66
00:05:51,080 --> 00:06:02,160
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna is out cold, and it is your turn to act.

67
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Nice.

68
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:10,160
I'm going to move over there by Kathy, and I'm going to take a shot at that one nearest.

69
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,080
Go ahead and roll firearms for me.

70
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,440
This is just one of the regular old fish men.

71
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,960
Just a regular fish man.

72
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,080
I rolled 24 again.

73
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Wow.

74
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,360
On different dice also.

75
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
That's weird.

76
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
So strange.

77
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
This room absolutely loves you.

78
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Go ahead and roll damage for me.

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
1d10.

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,840
Oh, there we go.

81
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
That's a nine.

82
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Nine.

83
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
All right.

84
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Hell yeah.

85
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,900
And that one actually goes down as well.

86
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,280
You are dropping these things.

87
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Fuck yeah.

88
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Like flies.

89
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,100
Hook, line, and sinker.

90
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,860
And as it dies, it says, barely knew her.

91
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Oh, that one was so chill.

92
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,820
Super chill fish man.

93
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,820
John Lee Pettymore.

94
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,820
It's your turn.

95
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,660
I don't know what stat this would be, and I'm hoping you would agree with the American

96
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,420
government during World War II that every American boy can throw a baseball.

97
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,460
I want to roll a flashbang just right on top of Keith Vigna basically, like in the middle

98
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,260
of the monster and the other guy who's right on top of him.

99
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,060
And there was another guy that killed him because he's a bad ass.

100
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,060
So yeah, I want to do that.

101
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Okay.

102
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,220
That is going to be an athletics roll.

103
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,700
Who do I have that?

104
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,700
Kind of 50.

105
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,700
50%.

106
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,500
That's a pretty good chance.

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Yes.

108
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
41.

109
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Yeah.

110
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Describe what happens there.

111
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,920
So yeah, I just kind of like from my position on the catwalk, pull the pin on the splash

112
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,880
bang and I just chuck it underhanded and it sails in an arc and just lands right on

113
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,280
Keith Vigna's chest.

114
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,860
He's unconscious and it explodes.

115
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,360
Would that burn his skin?

116
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,440
A little, maybe.

117
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,920
Not like two hit points worth or anything.

118
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
You know what?

119
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,320
It might go down to the armor, the metal beneath his skin veneer, but it's not going to do

120
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
any real damage.

121
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,360
He's going to look so cool after this.

122
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Yeah.

123
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Oh yeah, he will.

124
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Oh my gosh.

125
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
You're welcome.

126
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,600
The scars on his shoulder and back and then it's like, kind of like a cartoonish like

127
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
soot.

128
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Yes.

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Explosions.

130
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Explosions.

131
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
No eyebrows.

132
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,440
Blown his shirt off.

133
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,960
And yeah, and so this like a ball of light and sound just like emerges in the face of

134
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,040
this giant fish monster and the other fish monster.

135
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,720
And hopefully disorients him for a turn or so.

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,640
They both immediately dive into the water.

137
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
That could be good or bad.

138
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
nearby.

139
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,520
Doug, go see if they're around.

140
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,960
So sorry, before they do that, Kathy Piston is up next and she moves past Clark on the

141
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
other side.

142
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,880
Oh, actually I'm in my mind, you kind of bend over and she does a roll over your back.

143
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Yeah, she does.

144
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,200
Rush hour two style.

145
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Super cool.

146
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,320
And on one knee gets in position and nobody understand the words that are coming out of

147
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,320
your mouth, Kathy Piston.

148
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,920
And she fucking rolls a success again.

149
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,680
She's a goddamn assassin.

150
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,800
Kathy Piston has not rolled over 40.

151
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,520
Fucking John Wick.

152
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,960
And she rolled a nine.

153
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Yeah, Kathy.

154
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,160
That a girl.

155
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:36,000
So she fires into the smaller of the two fishmen, the humanoid one, and it takes an absurd amount

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
of damage.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,280
You can see blood and acres just like leaking out of this thing.

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,240
It is now its turn as well as its fish friend in the very back of the room that you can

159
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,380
see on the other side of this giant beast thing.

160
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,380
And they both dive into the water nearest them.

161
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:05,080
It is the giant creatures turn and it looks down where it had just had its meal ready

162
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,560
and you could tell it smelled and it knew this, this would be a meal that I've already

163
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:19,400
had and it was taken away from me from the inside and I must feast once more.

164
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,080
But the flashbang confused it and it swipes down into the water near it thinking that

165
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,320
it's where the catwalk is and it falls face first directly into the water.

166
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
What an idiot.

167
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,680
It's a stupid thing.

168
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,320
Fucking fish dick.

169
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
I love fish dicks.

170
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
I love fish dicks.

171
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,760
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

172
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,720
And this is the, uh, who, who pressed the button?

173
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Was that John?

174
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
John Lee Pennymore?

175
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
All right.

176
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,920
So when it's your turn, it'll have been one round.

177
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Is that right?

178
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,680
I did that at the end of my first turn and I had the turn where I threw a flash grenade.

179
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,040
So that would have been one round.

180
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Absolutely.

181
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
So it'll be two rounds.

182
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Coming up on two full rounds.

183
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
Clark Bishop, it is your turn.

184
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,120
The elevator door is not moving.

185
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,240
What's the numbers above it say?

186
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Oh, that's an interesting question.

187
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
666.

188
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Why?

189
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,840
Uh, I'm going to, is that, is my distance to Keith two movements or one?

190
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Looks like two to me.

191
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
I will.

192
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I got to take it.

193
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
So I'm going to do it.

194
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,520
That's real scary, but I'm going to have to just be there with the plan of picking them

195
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,080
up next round.

196
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,000
You're right there.

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
John Lee Pennymore.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,040
It's been two rounds since you pressed the elevator button.

199
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,480
What do you want to do this round?

200
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
I want to run out as far as I can towards Clark.

201
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
All right.

202
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:47,040
You run to the end of the catwalk at the point where the room begins and it is now, it would

203
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,280
be Luke's terms.

204
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,120
Oh, rip.

205
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,840
It is now the Fishman is the turn of the Fishman gotcha.

206
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,560
And the Fishman turn of the Fishman, the turn of the Fishman.

207
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,840
One of them, the one you would assume maybe that was in the back of the room pops up quite

208
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,120
nearby.

209
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,720
And the one that was nearer Keith and it's giant compatriot busts up out of the water

210
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,160
and then it's going to roll a crit success.

211
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,400
So it jumped real good.

212
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,640
I mean, who cares?

213
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,640
So the other side of Doug is at the elevator door at the elevator door time to waste that

214
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,480
on the other side in between Doug Jacobs and the elevator door.

215
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,200
And it critically succeeded.

216
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:41,960
Basically what it did is it hopped up out and it is swinging its scythe at Doug Jacobs

217
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
in the air.

218
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Doug Jacobs.

219
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Oh, wow.

220
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:56,360
Doug Jacobs was not full of health as one might say.

221
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:04,880
And with this critical success, while the fish person is in the air, it swings its scythe

222
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,400
all the way through the neck of Doug Jacobs and the body of agent Trent Chad and lands

223
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:18,520
standing in between you all and the elevator as the body and head fall separately into

224
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:25,680
the two opposite sides of water on either side of the catwalk.

225
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
He was a good boy.

226
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Poor agent Doug Chad.

227
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:51,680
So at that exact moment that the song hits its climax, claws grab onto the catwalk just

228
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,280
on either side, just next to Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna.

229
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,720
And it starts pulling and pulling and trying to rip this catwalk down into the water.

230
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Oh no.

231
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
He rolls an op too.

232
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Of course he does.

233
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
It slows.

234
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
It's not very much.

235
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Yeah, it fits contested in any way.

236
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Oh yeah.

237
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,520
Clark gets pulling up against it.

238
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:31,560
He's like re-riveting it as it comes like popping out.

239
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,860
Clark Bishop needs to make an extremely important strength roll in order to, I assume, hold

240
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,880
on to Keith Vigna and keep the two of you on dry catwalk.

241
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:50,040
I'm going to have you roll that now against this ought to.

242
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Oh yeah.

243
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Hell yeah.

244
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,320
It's a 54 on a 65.

245
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Congratulations.

246
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,240
Clark, I love that roll.

247
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
Do you say anything to his unconscious body?

248
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
To Keith's unconscious body?

249
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,280
Yeah, as you're pulling him.

250
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,680
I got you my child.

251
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
My baby boy.

252
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,920
Go ahead and roll sanity.

253
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Fuck you too.

254
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
That's a fail.

255
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,920
That's a fail over my power.

256
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Oh, all right.

257
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Well go ahead and play that up and remember that you're God and lose one's sanity.

258
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,920
I forgot about that.

259
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Luke's dead ass could make himself useful and bring us some beers.

260
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,920
It's going to depend on how you want to do this mechanically, but what Clark would do

261
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,920
now is he would throw Keith down onto the catwalk, turn around, and he wants to walk

262
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,520
up to the giant fish thing and throw a grenade down its gullet, the frag grenade.

263
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,800
Okay, so you would have to put yourself into the water to do that.

264
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,420
This thing is pulled down successfully and it is in the water now with the catwalk as

265
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,320
you are up on the catwalk.

266
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,720
He's about five feet below you.

267
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
I can't.

268
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
He can't just toss it down.

269
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Oh, you want to toss a grenade?

270
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,020
I thought you wanted to place it gently inside of its mouth.

271
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,020
Do you assume we're idiots?

272
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,020
Yeah, baseline.

273
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,020
No, of course not.

274
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Come on.

275
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
I'm sorry.

276
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
I didn't mean it, baby.

277
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,020
Only many times.

278
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Joe, go ahead and roll an athletics check here.

279
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
We're going willy-nilly here.

280
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,020
Is there any kind of advantage for being right over it?

281
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
Yeah.

282
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,320
So you actually get, because you'll be rolling athletics, to drop it in.

283
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Maybe a nice beer pong shot this grenade into the mouth of this being.

284
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Because it's right there next to you, I'll give you a plus 20% on your athletics.

285
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,320
That's really handy because I don't have any, so I got the baseline 30.

286
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Alright.

287
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
And then you add 20.

288
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
I got a 50 on this.

289
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
50% chance here.

290
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Here we go.

291
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,320
I pass a 37 on a 50.

292
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Alright.

293
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,620
Roll 4d6.

294
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,620
Ooh, baby.

295
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,620
Baby, baby.

296
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,620
You got a couple of d6s over there?

297
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
Yes, sir.

298
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,620
Actually, I got some here.

299
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,620
Never mind.

300
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,620
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

301
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,620
11 points of damage with that grenade down inside of its belly.

302
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,620
The grenade explodes and you hear the same screeching roar that you heard when the flashbang

303
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
went off.

304
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
It's like...

305
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Sorry, I was yawning into the mic just then.

306
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
What was the sound it made?

307
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
It was actually really similar to what you just did.

308
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Could you just...

309
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm so sorry, I didn't get much sleep last night.

310
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
We can take a break if you need a Red Bull or something.

311
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Yeah, I'm gonna run down to the gas station.

312
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
And it is John Lee Pettymore's turn.

313
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
I want to move one space forward and do the same thing.

314
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Drop a grenade right on top of it.

315
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,220
Roll athletics for me with a plus 20%, putting your athletics at 70% if I'm not mistaken.

316
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,220
You are not mistaken.

317
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Oh, 70!

318
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,220
70 on a 70.

319
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Roll 4d6 for damage for me.

320
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,220
10.

321
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
10 total?

322
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Yeah.

323
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
Or did you roll 10 on 1d6?

324
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:28,220
This thing makes the same horrifying noise, but even louder this time.

325
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
And it starts to kind of gargle.

326
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
It's like...

327
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
As it moves into the water.

328
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Down below.

329
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
And it is Kathy Piston's turn.

330
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
That was the end of my turn.

331
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Any change in the elevator?

332
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Oh, go ahead and roll alertness for me.

333
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
7.

334
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
No.

335
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Damn.

336
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
You know my alertness is 60 and not 6, right?

337
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Yes and no.

338
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Kathy Piston moves up at the end of the catwalk leading to the elevator door

339
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:15,520
and lines up her shot on the fish man that just took down, decapitated,

340
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,520
and smiled at the death of Doug Jacobs.

341
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
And she rolls another success.

342
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Yes!

343
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Yes, my murder queen.

344
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
This girl!

345
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Joe, these dice you got me are great.

346
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Hell yeah!

347
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
But she only rolls a 4 on damage.

348
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,820
And it doesn't look like it took very much damage at all as she shoots it

349
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,820
in its kind of plate amphibious lining there.

350
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,820
And some of the sharper parts catch some of the bullets and make it so

351
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:51,820
I don't know why I'm explaining armor on a fish creature to you, but

352
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
that's what's going on there.

353
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,820
The fish man will retaliate.

354
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:03,120
And the fish man that is closest to Kathy Piston rolls a 10 and succeeds

355
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,120
and hits her for 7 damage with the scythe and just digs the scythe

356
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,120
into her leg and she starts screaming out and she's gonna try to like

357
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,120
grab on to the end of the scythe and kind of battle back and forth

358
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
but as she's battling it's just digging in further and further and

359
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,420
it finally hits a nerve in her leg and she just can't take it anymore

360
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,420
and falls backwards.

361
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,420
Kathy Piston is now bleeding into the water as well.

362
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,420
Isn't that good?

363
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,420
There's also a fish man that is right next to Clark Bishop and Keith

364
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,420
Vigna and he is going to try to pin Clark Bishop to the ground

365
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,420
so we are going to roll an opposed test of unarmed combat.

366
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,420
Okay.

367
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,720
I rolled a 30 succeeding.

368
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,720
I rolled a 15 succeeding but lower.

369
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,720
So this fish man uses its scythe to pin you to the ground and it

370
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,720
puts the long end of the stick up against your throat and it's knee

371
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,720
down on the thing and as it's bearing down on you its teeth are gritted

372
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:25,020
and you see this mucusy wet slime form and it's big thick lips and

373
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,020
it kind of drips down directly onto your face and just splats.

374
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:46,020
The giant creature jumps out of the water and you can see that it

375
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,320
has not taken enough damage to be considered what one might call

376
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,320
bloody in a game called D&D and it's coming for you John Lee

377
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Pettymore.

378
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,320
It's coming for you real fucking hard with one of its claws.

379
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,320
It reaches back all the way to get as much momentum as possible and

380
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,320
it claws at you and it misses.

381
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:17,620
Kevin Lee Pettymore ducks agilely and doesn't hit its

382
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,620
microphone and he flips two birds at the fish.

383
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,620
Oh very very very cool.

384
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,620
Very cool indeed Clark Bishop.

385
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,620
It is your turn.

386
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,620
You are pinned currently.

387
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,620
The only thing you can do unless you're more creative than I is an

388
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,620
unarmed contest to become unpinned.

389
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Or unarmed combat.

390
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

391
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Get creative.

392
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Try to persuade it.

393
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Those are the two options.

394
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Yeah, I kiss it on the lips.

395
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
I do things your wife would never do to you.

396
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Yeah, I'm going to use the unarmed combat to try and break free.

397
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
It rolls a 16 succeeding.

398
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,220
I failed.

399
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,220
74 on a 70.

400
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,220
It's actually going to take a shot at you here.

401
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
Can it do that?

402
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
It's my turn.

403
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,220
Oh, it is your turn.

404
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,220
I'll wait until it's its turn.

405
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
It keeps you pinned though.

406
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
That's for damn sure.

407
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,220
Thomas, it's John Lee Pettymore's turn.

408
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,220
Guys, if I don't move do I get two attacks?

409
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
No.

410
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,220
Okay, but you can move and attack?

411
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,220
Yeah.

412
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,220
Let me pitch you this.

413
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,220
I want to move one step backwards while tossing a grenade forward

414
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
and then shoot a shotgun.

415
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
I just got mad deja vu.

416
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Have you done that move before?

417
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
No.

418
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
I sure like it.

419
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,520
So I toss my last frag grenade at it while I'm right in front of it

420
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
and stepping backwards.

421
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Okay, I'll give you a plus 20%.

422
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Okay.

423
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Oh, wait.

424
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Oh, wait.

425
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Yes.

426
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Okay, 61 on a 70 modified.

427
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Nice.

428
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Nice.

429
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
It's going to be another 46 of damage.

430
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Listeners, we're not saying 46 like the number.

431
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,820
Four six-sided die.

432
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,820
Indeed.

433
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,820
Four D six.

434
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,820
Four dicks six.

435
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,820
Which is the alternative name of our podcast,

436
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,820
but the size is...

437
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
We found out the math didn't quite work out.

438
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,820
Joe throws things on.

439
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,820
The weight.

440
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Dropped one of my D six and crushed my balls

441
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
trying to catch it with my legs.

442
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
The dangers of real playing.

443
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
So I'm actually going to count that one

444
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
that's a four right now on the floor.

445
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Fucking good because I sacrificed for it.

446
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
You know what?

447
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
We've never made rules about squishing your balls

448
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
while you roll, so let's keep that four.

449
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Okay, so four, four, two, and three,

450
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
which is...

451
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Thirteen.

452
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
Thirteen.

453
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Thirteen.

454
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Thirteen.

455
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Thirteen.

456
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Thirteen.

457
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Thirteen.

458
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Thirteen.

459
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
Which is...

460
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Thirteen.

461
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
Thirteen.

462
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,420
Wow.

463
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
You do thirteen damage

464
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,420
and you actually hear a whimper

465
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,420
from this giant creature in front of you.

466
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,420
It swallowed a kid!

467
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,420
It's like...

468
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,420
I don't know if you quite agreed to my pitch

469
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,420
but I do want to shoot my shotgun as I...

470
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,420
Oh, I did not agree to that.

471
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
You didn't disagree.

472
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,420
I'll let you do what you did. How about that?

473
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,420
Well, you would take it away from me if I pressed the point.

474
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,420
John Lee Pennymore's dead.

475
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
John Lee Pennymore, go home, John Lee.

476
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,420
John Lee Pennymore falls over heart attack.

477
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,420
Dead. Get out of here.

478
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,420
You said you trusted me. Trust me now.

479
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
Good lord.

480
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,420
No, I think moving and throwing a grenade seems...

481
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,420
seems perfectly reasonable for a turn.

482
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,720
And it is going to be Kathy Piston's turn

483
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,720
and she just got mucked up in the leg by a scythe.

484
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
You can say fuck.

485
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
We've all been doing it.

486
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
For sure.

487
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
For real?

488
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Yeah.

489
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
You can even say crap.

490
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
No, with my mouth?

491
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Yeah.

492
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Alright.

493
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
But you can't say beep.

494
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Kathy Piston just got...

495
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
I can't do it.

496
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Mucked in the leg by a scythe

497
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
and she's bleeding all over the place

498
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,020
and she looks up with this determination in her eyes

499
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,020
and a barrel in her hand.

500
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,020
But the gun part, not just the barrel.

501
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,020
Yeah, I was like, where'd she get that barrel?

502
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,020
I don't know. I don't know. She's good with it.

503
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,020
And she is going to once again

504
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,020
fire at a fish man

505
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,020
succeeding once again on her roll.

506
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,020
MVP.

507
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,020
She cannot stop. She will not stop.

508
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
However, she just once again

509
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
does not roll enough damage

510
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
to actually damage the creature

511
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
and therefore, she's like

512
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
my leg, your leg

513
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
and she shoots it in the foot

514
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
and it starts bleeding out

515
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,320
and hopping up and down on one foot

516
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
while still chanting

517
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
photography, photography

518
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
photography, photography

519
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Very cool. Very cool fish.

520
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Very cool fish person.

521
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,320
However, it's now that fish person's turn.

522
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
And it doesn't like being shot in the foot.

523
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
And so, it's going to come

524
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
for Kathy Piston.

525
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
This fish creature takes its scythe out

526
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
raises it above its head

527
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
and slams down the scythe

528
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
into the top of Kathy Piston's skull.

529
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
No!

530
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
I need you both to roll sanity

531
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
for witnessing this horrible event.

532
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
For some reason that one hurts the most.

533
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
75

534
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
A fail above my power.

535
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,620
I fail 24 on a 17.

536
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,620
Alright. I need you both

537
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,620
to lose just one sanity.

538
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Kathy Piston was a human

539
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,620
trafficking asshole.

540
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,620
And just because her death was gruesome

541
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,620
does not mean

542
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,620
that it may not have been deserved.

543
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
I don't know if deserved was the right word there

544
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
but she dead now.

545
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,620
Her tank is down.

546
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,620
Or no, she was DPS.

547
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
She's the glass cannon.

548
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
You hear chants from underwater.

549
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,920
MVP! MVP!

550
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
It's pretty unsettling but also pretty cool.

551
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
I wonder how Luke's doing.

552
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
The other fishman

553
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
is standing on top

554
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
of Clark Bishop's throat

555
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
with its scythe pressed down

556
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
and according to the rules of Delta Green

557
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
it gets a free shot.

558
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
It contested me.

559
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
I can't contest it.

560
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Dad!

561
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,220
Dad!

562
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
With an automatic success.

563
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,220
Now we're worried

564
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,220
about the rules of Delta Green

565
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,220
and all of a sudden

566
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,220
all of a sudden

567
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,220
Zach's an expert.

568
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,220
I read the rules today finally.

569
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,220
You read a Chuckling Boy post?

570
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Quick shout out to user ChucklingBoy

571
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
on Reddit who is doing

572
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,220
incredible work on the subreddit

573
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
for r slash pretending to be people

574
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
and it is so cool.

575
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,520
He posts these posts

576
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
on Monday and Thursday called

577
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
Mythos Monday and Technique Thursday

578
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,520
and they are

579
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
just phenomenal.

580
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,520
Awesome reference guide for running

581
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
a Delta Green game.

582
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,520
They are so good you should go and check them out.

583
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
It's absurd.

584
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,520
He has been such a huge supporter

585
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
of us and we really

586
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
can't thank him enough for all he's doing.

587
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,820
Thanks man.

588
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,820
It's really fun to read all those posts.

589
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,820
I don't read all of your posts because I'm worried

590
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,820
that I'll learn too much and I like

591
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,820
being the one who doesn't know a lot about the game.

592
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,820
Also he can't read.

593
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,820
I just skim him for the stuff

594
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,820
that looks neat.

595
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,820
That's a pretty letter.

596
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
Clark this thing

597
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,820
just headbutts you for one

598
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,820
damage.

599
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,820
Breaking your nose just a little bit.

600
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,620
You feel an

601
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,620
intense rush of pain

602
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,620
throughout but it doesn't

603
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
kill you that's for sure.

604
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,620
That puts me at 15.

605
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
It is the massive

606
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,620
creature's turn and it is going

607
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
to rush

608
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
John Lee Pettymore who just threw

609
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,620
another grenade directly

610
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,620
at its face

611
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,620
and it rolls a success

612
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,620
with the claw.

613
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,620
The claw.

614
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,620
Oh actually what did you do with your turn?

615
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,620
Tossed a grenade at it and took a step backwards.

616
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,620
And he pulled out his shield.

617
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,620
That is going to be 7 damage

618
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,620
and it has a chance

619
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,620
to grab you.

620
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,620
It failed the grab attempt.

621
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,620
But its claw just like

622
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,620
swipes at you scratching the

623
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
shit out of your body

624
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
in the front part of it

625
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,620
ripping your cool clothes that Kevin had

626
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,620
all the black tactical gear

627
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,620
less tactical now

628
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,620
that it's been shredded up by a

629
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,620
big fucking claw.

630
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
It takes me down to 6 hit points.

631
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,620
Oh my god.

632
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
We are fucked.

633
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,620
With that I have to teach you.

634
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,620
How's that elevator?

635
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,620
Roll alertness for me.

636
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,620
It's not that turn yet. Never mind.

637
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,620
Oh we didn't do it though.

638
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
It's my last turn.

639
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,620
So Clark at the top of this round go ahead and roll

640
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,620
an alertness check for me.

641
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,620
I fail.

642
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,620
An 82 on a 70.

643
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,620
That would make sense. I'm on the ground being

644
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
strangled by a fish man.

645
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,620
I wouldn't know what's going on with the elevator.

646
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Yeah.

647
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,620
I first saw a thing where you just

648
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,620
lifted up enough.

649
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,620
Just to have something happen

650
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,620
maybe.

651
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
And it's your turn. What would you like to do?

652
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,620
You are still being pinned currently.

653
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,620
Would you allow

654
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,620
can I reach

655
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,620
into my boot to grab my other gun

656
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,620
and use it to fire up at the

657
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,620
creature? No.

658
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,620
Then I'm just going to unarmed back at him.

659
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
So that's the thing with being pinned.

660
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,620
It's supposed to completely

661
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,620
immobilize you.

662
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,620
So he just has to bust out of it with strength.

663
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Exactly.

664
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,620
Which I should be able to do and I'm having trouble.

665
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,620
He'll get it.

666
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,620
I succeeded with a 12.

667
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,620
I succeeded with a 29.

668
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,620
Fuck yeah.

669
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
He punched this fish bitch in the face.

670
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Fish fish.

671
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,620
I don't know how the unpinning rules

672
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
work but can I fling him so hard

673
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,620
that he gets away from me?

674
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,620
He'll be enough away from you to where you can

675
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,620
act naturally or however

676
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
you want on your next turn but so will he.

677
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
And or it or

678
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,620
whatever a fish person

679
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,620
that's you know. Does it do any damage

680
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
to him? It just unpicks me. No.

681
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,620
It just gets him off.

682
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,620
Crickets. Yeah it does.

683
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
Thomas. It's John Lee Pettymore's turn.

684
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
Okay. Low on health.

685
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Yeah. Low on grenades.

686
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
High in spirit.

687
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,620
I'm going to walk up to the big fish creature and

688
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
blast my shotgun at it.

689
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,620
Cool. Point blank.

690
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
Very cool.

691
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,620
Did I get any

692
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,620
modifiers for point blank?

693
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,620
Right at the fish eye.

694
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,620
It definitely seems like you should with a shotgun

695
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,620
at close range. Well there's a damage

696
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,620
modifier. Oh gotcha.

697
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,620
Yeah. I'll give you a plus 20.

698
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,620
It's going to be hard to miss. Doesn't matter

699
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,620
because I rolled a 53 on a 60.

700
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,620
Nice. So yeah. Point blank

701
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
range. That is

702
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,620
3d6. It is indeed.

703
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,620
It would be 4 if it was a crit.

704
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620
5, 3, and 2.

705
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,620
So 10 again. 10 again.

706
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,620
Just like give us a visual of what's

707
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,620
going on here. Well John Lee Pettymore

708
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
he looks like

709
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,620
Nick Cage at the end of Mandy.

710
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,620
He's just completely covered

711
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,620
in blood. You can see

712
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,620
this giant just like these

713
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,620
gashes down his chest

714
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,620
revealing bits of like bone and

715
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
metal and he kind of staggers

716
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,620
towards this thing one space

717
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,620
and then just brings his shotgun

718
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,620
up to his hip and just blast

719
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,620
it right into its fish face.

720
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
And doing so blows

721
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,620
a massive chunk

722
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,620
of the fish's teeth

723
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,620
these massive human

724
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,620
like teeth. This is like a mouth

725
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,620
that you could climb up into for

726
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
fun and it

727
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,620
like a quarter of this

728
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
fish's mouth just

729
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,620
dissipates into like blood

730
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
and dust and slime

731
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,620
as the creature

732
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,620
just moans and

733
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,620
spins away

734
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,620
from you as it takes this

735
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,620
massive amount of damage.

736
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,620
But it is still conscious and it is

737
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
still moving. I don't know if

738
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
I'll get a chance so I'd like to say something cool now

739
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,620
having heard it so much. So

740
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,620
John Lee Kevin Moore

741
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,620
he

742
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,620
kind of groans

743
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
looks like tonight McDonald's is serving

744
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,620
filet of you.

745
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,620
No but for real.

746
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,620
And it's so

747
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,620
offended and taken aback it dies.

748
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
MVP.

749
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
So good Kathy.

750
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,620
John one of the

751
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,620
other fishmen is the one that

752
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,620
just murdered the shit out of

753
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,620
Kathy Piston and really

754
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,620
fucked her up good comes up

755
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
behind you and is going

756
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,620
to swing at you

757
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,620
with its scythe.

758
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620
He rolled a 43

759
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
on

760
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,620
a 25 percent.

761
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,620
Nice.

762
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,620
And it swings right

763
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,620
above your head and you feel

764
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,620
the wind brush atop.

765
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,620
You see little wisps of hair

766
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,620
get shaved right off.

767
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,620
Exactly. And the camera

768
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,620
immediately whip pans over to

769
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,620
one fish man standing

770
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
near Clark and Keith

771
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,620
and it is going to attempt

772
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,620
the same thing at

773
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,620
Clark Bishop and fucking fails.

774
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,620
Oh thank God. Missing wildly

775
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,620
after being thrown off

776
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,620
of Clark Bishop it doesn't know

777
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,620
quite what to do.

778
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,620
However

779
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,620
what does know what to do

780
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,620
is this giant giant beast

781
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,620
that is just

782
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,620
reeling from the attack

783
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,620
sent to it by John Lee

784
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,620
Kevin Moore. I need you to

785
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,620
roll an unarmed combat

786
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,620
contest.

787
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,620
18 on a 40.

788
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
19.

789
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,620
Oh my God.

790
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,620
Fuck.

791
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,620
With

792
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,620
claws akimbo on either side

793
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,620
of you it grabs on

794
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
to the catwalk

795
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
below it and it uses

796
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
its giant arms to

797
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,620
launch itself toward

798
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
John Lee Pettymore with its mouth

799
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,620
wide open and it swallows

800
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,620
you whole.

801
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,620
Oh.

802
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,620
Well

803
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,620
Keith got out of this and he's an idiot so

804
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,620
this is arguably

805
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,620
the safest place I could be right now.

806
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,620
With that

807
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,620
you take six damage.

808
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
Oh. Well that's uh

809
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,620
that puts me at zero.

810
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,620
That puts you at zero zero? Yeah

811
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,620
I had six points.

812
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,620
Oh shit. John Lee Pettymore

813
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
the darkness closes in on you

814
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,620
as the light above

815
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
you leaves

816
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,620
as this giant creatures mouth

817
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,620
closes

818
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,620
but you can still feel

819
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,620
all of this wet

820
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
gunk

821
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,620
inside and you can feel

822
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,620
water

823
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,620
and just. I want to spend

824
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,620
ten like to avoid major damage.

825
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,620
You still

826
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,620
feel this water

827
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,620
rushing in.

828
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,620
Okay we'll put that on pause.

829
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,620
My super cool monologuing

830
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,620
about the water that you feel

831
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,620
as you fucking die. I was

832
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,620
I was frantically scanning

833
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,620
the little luck thing.

834
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,620
The sheep of how to spend luck.

835
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,620
Yeah for ten points I can

836
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,620
spend uh. You know the last couple

837
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,620
episodes could have used some luck spins maybe.

838
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,620
I don't know. Anyway where are we at here?

839
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,620
I'm at twenty luck.

840
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,620
Oh shit. So I can spend ten points to

841
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,620
roll a d6

842
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,620
to reduce damage on that last attack.

843
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Incredible.

844
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,620
Five. Fuck yeah. Holy shit.

845
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,620
Very well done.

846
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,620
So you're at five hit points and you feel

847
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,620
this water touching your skin

848
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,620
and all this fish guts

849
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,620
and blood and

850
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,620
viscera that is inside

851
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
of this fish and I need you to

852
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,620
roll an intelligence check for me.

853
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,620
Ooh.

854
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,620
He has a seventy five intelligence

855
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,620
and he rolls a thirty one. You remember

856
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,620
that the hole that Keith

857
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,620
blew into this giant

858
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,620
creature is on its

859
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
right side.

860
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,620
And you think by the way

861
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,620
that you were eaten

862
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
and then went down

863
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,620
Jude!

864
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,620
No!

865
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,620
That's gonna be on your

866
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,620
left side. That big hole

867
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,620
there. I pressed forward

868
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,620
into the fish.

869
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,620
And we will

870
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,620
make my way to that hole.

871
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,620
It's a badass scene in my head if you had known

872
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
that that's what was gonna happen

873
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,620
that you just go charging at its open mouth

874
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,620
and dive straight in.

875
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,620
That's exactly what happened listeners.

876
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,620
It was my plan all along.

877
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,620
It is the fishman's

878
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,620
turn. I feel like I haven't gone in a while.

879
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,620
Is that maybe the case?

880
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,620
You struggled with the uh...

881
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,620
By the fishman I meant Clark Bishop. It's Clark

882
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,620
Bishop's turn. Big Daddy just went

883
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,620
and swallowed John. Also his name is

884
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,620
Big Daddy. Big Dad!

885
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,620
You don't play video

886
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,620
games so. Oh I don't. What's that?

887
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,620
Bioshock. Oh cool.

888
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,620
You're in the aquatic realm though.

889
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,620
We're close. Sure.

890
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,620
He doesn't know it's a rip off.

891
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,620
I'll take it.

892
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,620
And so Clark Bishop

893
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,620
it is your turn indeed.

894
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,620
How does the action

895
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,620
economy work with picking up Keith?

896
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,620
Is it a whole action to do that?

897
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,620
We'll say yes.

898
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,620
But then you can still move with him.

899
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,620
But only one spot? Only one spot.

900
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,620
And the

901
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,620
fishman that's nearest me how's he looking

902
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,620
health wise? Have we touched him even?

903
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
A little bit but he looks pretty fresh.

904
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,620
Oh but you're free of him right? I'm free of him.

905
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,620
I can move now. I just worry about how fast

906
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,620
he can move. He can get all up

907
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,620
on us real quick. I'm gonna have to

908
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
I think look at the elevator.

909
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
How's it looking?

910
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
That's interesting because

911
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,620
the elevator

912
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,620
roll alertness.

913
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,620
I do not pass

914
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,620
a 72 on a 70.

915
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,620
You do not see anything or hear anything.

916
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,620
Alright I'm going to

917
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,620
pick up Keith and fire

918
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,620
the fishman. Alright. No movement.

919
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,620
If you're gonna pick up Keith on this one

920
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,620
I'm gonna give you a negative 20 on the firearms.

921
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,620
Okay. Alright go ahead and roll

922
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,620
firearms for me. So I

923
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,620
normally have 80 I'll be rolling on a 60.

924
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Fuck! It's a 76

925
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,620
I would have passed but I don't pass.

926
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,620
You could roll you could spend 16

927
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,620
luck. I'm not gonna. I think you mean

928
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,620
luck.

929
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,620
John Lee Pettymore.

930
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,620
Holding his breath

931
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,620
and swimming downward into the

932
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,620
beast he John Lee Pettymore

933
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,620
is going to

934
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,620
release his remaining flash bang

935
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,620
and one of the smoke grenades

936
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,620
down into these guts as he like

937
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,620
swims out the hole. I'm gonna need

938
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,620
an athletics check in order

939
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,620
to properly

940
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,620
do this whole maneuver.

941
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,620
41

942
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,620
on a 50. Nice. Which I think is

943
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,620
exactly what I rolled last time on my

944
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,620
athletics check. You gave me

945
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,620
haunted dice Jeff.

946
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,620
We're bumping rolling doubles. It's weird.

947
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,620
It's real creepy I don't like it at all. Yeah I rolled

948
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,620
two eights in a row before the game even started

949
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,620
because I was rolling like a dumb ass.

950
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,620
Those would have come in handy Thomas.

951
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620
Anyway

952
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,620
Anyway I passed.

953
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,620
Congratulations.

954
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
Thank you. You drop off

955
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,620
this flash and this

956
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,620
smoke and flash.

957
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,620
So the flash grenade is hopefully gonna

958
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,620
I mean it's a big concussive thing.

959
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,620
Hopefully that's gonna fuck up his

960
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
insides and while he's in

961
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,620
the water and then

962
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,620
if it doesn't

963
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
I hope the smoke grenade makes his tummy real

964
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,620
upset. Yeah no doubt.

965
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,620
Like if you swallowed a cherry bomb.

966
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,620
That would be so gross. I can't even

967
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,620
imagine what that would feel like.

968
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,620
Just like

969
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,620
like dry smoke

970
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,620
billowing through your soft insides.

971
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,620
What you have to do is implant

972
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,620
one into your guts and leave the fuse

973
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,620
sticking out of your belly button and then you can

974
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,620
light it. That's what the belly button is for.

975
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,620
That's what the pros do.

976
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,620
Yeah what do I do

977
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,620
to this fish man? Well I think you swim

978
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,620
out of it but you are now being

979
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,620
birthed out of the side

980
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,620
of this massive creature out of

981
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,620
the same hole

982
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,620
that Keith Vigna

983
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,620
came out of. Was once birthed from.

984
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,620
Previously and as you

985
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,620
as you

986
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,620
I think you're gonna have to get birthed from this fish thing.

987
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,620
To get on our

988
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,620
spiritual level. Otherwise

989
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,620
we're just gonna leave you in the dust.

990
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,620
Like on the astral plane.

991
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,620
As you

992
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,620
come out of it you feel this

993
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,620
other body follow you through

994
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,620
the hole and you begin to swim

995
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,620
out of the creature.

996
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,620
I hope it's just the corpse of that dude.

997
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,620
It doesn't sound like it's corpse. I guess it could have

998
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,620
just floated out.

999
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,620
Clark you got a fish man on you man.

1000
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,620
Right now in this room.

1001
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,620
There's one still

1002
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,620
standing guard at the elevator and

1003
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,620
the other one is standing right in front of

1004
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,620
Clark Bishop and he is going

1005
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,620
to attack you.

1006
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,620
And he fucking

1007
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,620
fails. Oh thank god. This is absurd.

1008
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,620
This is absurd.

1009
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,620
This is positively absurd. As soon as it

1010
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,620
like pulls the scythe into position

1011
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,620
to swing at you it kind of loses

1012
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,620
grip of the thing and just kind of grabs

1013
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,620
it on the end with one hand and then just

1014
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,620
kind of swings it down at you and

1015
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,620
the stick part just kind of hits you in the arm.

1016
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,620
Yep.

1017
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,620
That's it.

1018
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,620
That's all that happens.

1019
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,620
And the other one is going to

1020
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,620
move closer

1021
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,620
to the elevator door. With that it's

1022
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,620
Clark Bishop's turn. Really?

1023
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,620
Nope. I didn't

1024
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,620
make an initiative tracker for

1025
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,620
myself. I was like oh I can totally

1026
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,620
do this by memory.

1027
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,620
Nope. Thomas you

1028
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,620
you hear a noise

1029
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,620
as you come out of

1030
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,620
this creature.

1031
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,620
And as

1032
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,620
you're swimming away

1033
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,620
you feel something grip

1034
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,620
one of your legs.

1035
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,620
Nevermind Zach it was

1036
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,620
my turn.

1037
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,620
Thomas you're in this water

1038
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,620
you just swam away from this

1039
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,620
creature that you were birthed

1040
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,620
out of and you feel

1041
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,620
something grab your leg.

1042
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,620
You turn around. No I

1043
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,620
kick as hard as I can. You kick as hard

1044
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,620
as you can. Go ahead and roll

1045
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,620
unarmed combat.

1046
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,620
80 on

1047
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,620
a 40.

1048
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,620
You kick as hard as you can and you feel

1049
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,620
the restraint that your

1050
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,620
leg has as if you

1051
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,620
cannot move it at

1052
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,620
all. I didn't sign up for no

1053
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,620
water zombies.

1054
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,620
Do you try to continue swimming or do

1055
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,620
you turn and look? I turn

1056
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,620
and look. When you turn and look

1057
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,620
you can only see

1058
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,620
the murky water that is

1059
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,620
around you. You can't make out

1060
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,620
where your leg is

1061
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,620
in the water. The water

1062
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,620
is too opaque

1063
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,620
in its nastiness.

1064
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,620
Okay so I grab back on whatever's

1065
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,620
grabbing to me and try to pull myself

1066
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,620
it. Okay like if it's a hand or something

1067
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,620
I grab that wrist and yank myself

1068
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,620
to it so I can see. Awesome.

1069
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,620
Go ahead and roll unarmed combat again.

1070
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,620
94.

1071
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,620
Got another success.

1072
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,620
You actually can use

1073
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,620
your ankle as a steady point

1074
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,620
a held point in this

1075
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,620
water and you can move

1076
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,620
your like doing a crunch

1077
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,620
to grab at what is underneath

1078
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,620
and you feel

1079
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,620
nothing

1080
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,620
on your legs, on your

1081
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,620
feet but something unseen

1082
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,620
is holding you in

1083
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,620
place. I need you to roll a sanity

1084
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,620
check.

1085
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,620
90. Fail. You lose

1086
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,620
and failed over my power. You lose

1087
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,620
control of your

1088
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,620
body and

1089
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,620
you lose control

1090
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,620
of your mind. You're gonna

1091
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,620
lose one sanity and your

1092
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,620
mind is splitting itself

1093
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,620
away from your body. The John

1094
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,620
Lee Pettymore part of you

1095
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,620
and the physical Kevin

1096
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,620
that you embody are at

1097
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,620
odds. No this isn't right.

1098
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,620
Where am I? What's going on

1099
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,620
down here? That's happening in my mind.

1100
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,620
John is starting to

1101
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,620
wake up a little bit inside of Kevin

1102
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,620
and he's forgotten a little bit. Yeah.

1103
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,620
I need you to roll 4d6 for the

1104
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,620
damage that you left

1105
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,620
inside of this creature.

1106
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,620
Good thing we just played tiny d6 for the Patreon.

1107
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,620
Plenty of d6's to go around.

1108
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,620
4 he said? 4.

1109
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,620
3 6's

1110
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,620
and a 2. Holy shit.

1111
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,620
So you see this

1112
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,620
absolute explosion.

1113
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,620
It's like water shockwave

1114
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,620
like wooo. Exactly.

1115
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,620
And it actually it lights up

1116
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,620
the murky water that you're in.

1117
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,620
Looking down there is absolutely

1118
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,620
nothing holding on to you but

1119
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,620
swimming away

1120
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,620
you do see there is a

1121
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,620
little fish head about

1122
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,620
the size of a softball

1123
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,620
that is on a human

1124
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,620
body the size of a Barbie

1125
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,620
doll and it is

1126
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,620
awkwardly swimming. Don't like

1127
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,620
anything about that. I need you

1128
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,620
to make a constitution

1129
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,620
check because you've been in the

1130
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,620
water for some time

1131
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,620
and I looked up the rules

1132
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,620
for suffocation.

1133
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,620
Now you look up the rules.

1134
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,620
36 on a

1135
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,620
50. Alrighty.

1136
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,620
So you only take 1 hit point of damage.

1137
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,620
Okay that brings me down to 4. Oof.

1138
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,620
Now I need you to roll a power

1139
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,620
check.

1140
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,620
Fail.

1141
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,620
89 on a 60.

1142
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,620
That hand that you felt

1143
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,620
on your leg rips you

1144
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,620
downward.

1145
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,620
And you feel water just

1146
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,620
rushing up your nose.

1147
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,620
And I need you to roll another

1148
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,620
constitution check.

1149
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,620
36 pass.

1150
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,620
Lose 1 more hit point of

1151
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,620
damage. As we

1152
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,620
roll for power again this

1153
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,620
unseen force continues

1154
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,620
to try to drag you to the bottom

1155
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,620
of this tank. Maybe it wants to

1156
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,620
take me someplace safe. Maybe it should just go with it.

1157
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,620
It wants to take you someplace safe.

1158
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,620
12 I pass.

1159
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,620
21 I pass.

1160
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,620
I need you to roll another

1161
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,620
constitution check.

1162
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,620
52 on a 60 I pass.

1163
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,620
Lose another hit point of damage.

1164
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,620
2.

1165
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,620
2? Yeah that's what I meant.

1166
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,620
Because you're down at 2 hit points we need to roll

1167
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,620
constitution to see if you can stay

1168
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,620
conscious.

1169
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,620
No. 71 on

1170
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,620
a 50. This unseen

1171
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,620
force drags you and

1172
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,620
drags you down to the bottom

1173
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,620
and slams your body

1174
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,620
up against

1175
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,620
a hard surface.

1176
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,620
Your eyes

1177
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,620
open up

1178
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,620
and in front of you on the

1179
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,620
other side of this

1180
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,620
glass

1181
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,620
you see

1182
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,620
Marvin staring

1183
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,620
straight back at you.

1184
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,620
You've been in his office before

1185
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,620
and that is where he is standing.

1186
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,620
And he

1187
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,620
has his hand up

1188
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,620
and the orifice on his face

1189
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,620
tries its

1190
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,620
hardest to make a smile

1191
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,620
as your lungs

1192
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,620
fill with water.

1193
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,620
Glub.

1194
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,620
So ends

1195
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,620
John Lee Pettymore.

1196
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,620
The only one

1197
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,620
trying to

1198
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,620
pull over

1199
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,620
How can you

1200
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,620
have enough

1201
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,620
drowning out

1202
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,620
of the noise

1203
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,620
Cause nobody

1204
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,620
knows

1205
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,620
nobody

1206
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,620
knows

1207
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,620
nobody

1208
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,620
knows

1209
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,620
nobody

1210
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,620
dies
