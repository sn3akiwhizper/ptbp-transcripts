1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Garbage in the morning, garbage in the evening, garbage at suppertime.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,800
When garbage is on a bagel, you can eat garbage anytime.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,720
Welcome my trash bags, it's your dumpster diving daddy, Wolf the dog, and we are broadcasting

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,240
live from 694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,480
And I am here to eat y'all, because that's just what I do.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,920
Feast on dumpster meats.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,440
Heck, it ain't even gotta have meat in it for me to chow down.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,920
You ever had a waffle that's been soaking in that sinful syrup that collects in the

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,560
bottom of an industrial trash compactor?

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,040
Five star yelp review every time, baby.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,760
Speaking of hot syrupy trash, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Anissa, aka

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,240
ripsawunderdashunicorn, who tweeted about this show and tagged at Pretendin' Pod.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,400
They write, Dear Wolf,

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,760
The other day I drove by a steakhouse and saw a crow dipping the french fry in the dumpster

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
juices.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,080
I couldn't help but think of you, a true creature of culinary sophistication.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,640
Also, I'd like to give my best buddy Mandy a shoutout.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,280
Keep on kickin' ass.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,200
Ah, yes, the finest gourmands, my flyin' rat friends.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,440
Fried roots dipped in a dumpster au jus.

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,040
I'll have what he's havin'.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,880
I remember my first serving of that at the Outback Steakhouse, which was just a dumpster

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,160
outback of a steakhouse.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,680
I also love the bloomin' onion, which is just when an onion has been sittin' around for

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,160
way too long and gets real nasty.

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,520
Wolf the dog kinda nasty.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,440
You wanna send your old Wolfie or your best buddy Mandy a message here on 694.2?

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,720
Talk about pretending to be people on the internet.

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,680
At Pretendin' Pod on Instagram and Twitter, a 5-star review on iTunes also totally works.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,020
If you wanna support the show, but you can't stand the thought of other people finding

31
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,240
out you love this trash.

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,520
We'll keep your secret over at patreon.com slash pretendin' pod.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,040
When fake cops in city blues with a few screws loose choose to snooze on clues, I can both

34
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
amuse and accuse.

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
It's the news.

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,800
Leon's got the numbers in him, and he is dead set on tearin' up the dance floor.

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,840
This gave the gang plenty of time to look over everything on the laptop.

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,320
Instead, they read a few screenshots that were saved on the desktop and called it good.

39
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,360
The two videos also saved on the desktop, one of which showing a thumbnail of Harriet

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
Marks, the student who seemingly caused all this?

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,640
Nah, they good, no thanks, no need to watch those.

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Too busy textin' the same person from two different phones.

43
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,940
Now don't get me wrong, I love these fuckin' dumb-dumbs, but sometimes you just have to

44
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,820
take a deep breath and focus on kudzu with no backbone.

45
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,100
But, like, doesn't that depend on the family member?

46
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,300
Do you have no one in your family, no cousin, like, who's younger than you or something?

47
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,380
Or you could be like, yeah, bukkake, this is what I'm-

48
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,180
Thomas is always trying to get the younger generations hooked on bukkake.

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,100
No, no, I'm trying, I'm, uh, opposite, I'm steering them away from bukkake.

50
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,940
If they know what it is, they'll know how to not see it.

51
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,940
I've been burned in the past.

52
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,940
All of my younger cousins are, like, six years old.

53
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
Oh, fuck.

54
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,940
Jesus Christ.

55
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,940
So in fact, they grew up in a bad area, so yes.

56
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,940
Are you the youngest, like, youngest period?

57
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,940
That is how it happens, Justin.

58
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,940
Other than me, my sister is the youngest over-

59
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,940
What did you say when your sister said, Luke, what is bukkake?

60
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,940
Well, my sister knows what bukkake is.

61
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,940
Yeah, she does.

62
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,940
Literally, before the sentence even left my mouth, I'm like, oh, goddammit.

63
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,940
Do you care to elaborate on that sentence that came out of your mouth?

64
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,940
One time on this podcast, I said, call my mama bitch, so I understand.

65
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,940
And I kept it, just like I'm keeping all of this.

66
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,940
Well, good thing my sister doesn't listen to this shit.

67
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,940
But we can say hello to Luke's dad, who is up to episode 14 as of recording.

68
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,940
18, I think, right?

69
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Well, yeah, 18, because his theory was that the little girl that died in the fiery car crash was Contingent's savior.

70
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,940
Well said.

71
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,940
Which I thought should be canon.

72
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,940
Yeah, absolutely. But if you make it this far, welcome-

73
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
To the lab!

74
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,940
Before we start this episode, I think we should talk out of character.

75
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,940
Luke, say what you said again about bukkake.

76
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,940
I think that it's really helped my skin out.

77
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
It would, right?

78
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,940
I haven't had acne in a long time.

79
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,940
Also, I make some extra money on the side, so it's kind of win-win.

80
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Gotta buy a lot of towels.

81
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Because people cum on my face.

82
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,940
Okay, yeah, there it is.

83
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,940
And they pay you for that, seemingly.

84
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,940
Well, I mean, we make royalty money.

85
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Like, from the king and queen, or Prince Andrew specifically?

86
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,940
No, the king of queens.

87
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Hey, Kevin can wait. I just want to think that we should all-

88
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,940
Kevin can wait.

89
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,940
Leah Remini?

90
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,940
Alright, so if we could all go clear for a second here.

91
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
She was the real boss on that show.

92
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
I got the joke, it was good.

93
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
Thank you.

94
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Let's talk out of character about what's happening.

95
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,940
I don't really, honestly, know.

96
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Same.

97
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,940
I know, people, and it-

98
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,940
It feels like deliberately I know what's going on.

99
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,940
Let's take that again.

100
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,940
No, no, no, it feels deliberately humiliating when Zach was like,

101
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
yeah, listeners know what's going on.

102
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,940
That was a little deliberate.

103
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,940
And I feel bad, over the past week, obviously,

104
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940
I've felt pretty bad about doing that.

105
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
So this time, I'm just going to say-

106
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,940
That you made it all up and no one knows what's going on?

107
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,940
Not even you?

108
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
I know that you-

109
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
I know you just make it up.

110
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,940
No, those people who came into the studio last week,

111
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
they weren't real.

112
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
I know, I played one.

113
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,940
Wait, what?

114
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Afterwards, Joe totally conned one.

115
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,940
He was like, hey, if you give me $50,

116
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,940
I'll give you $200 in three weeks.

117
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,940
Oh, those people.

118
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,940
There was that one guy that talked like an old man,

119
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,940
but he didn't look that old?

120
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
There you go, you got me.

121
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,940
Yeah, that was the one that you played.

122
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,940
Right.

123
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,940
How did you play him after he left?

124
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
How did you play him?

125
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,940
What do you mean, how did I play him?

126
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Joe played his guy.

127
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,940
How did you play the one dude who walked out,

128
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
your dude?

129
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,940
Now I get the joke you're making.

130
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,940
How did you play the old man?

131
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Did you call him acting like his son and say,

132
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
hey, I'm in prison.

133
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,940
I need you to wire me money.

134
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,940
Oh, my God.

135
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,940
That's exactly what I did.

136
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,940
That happened to my grandma.

137
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
That happened to my grandma.

138
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,940
I was sitting in high school.

139
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
What?

140
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,940
This is not a joke.

141
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
This is actually a solid story.

142
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,940
I'm sitting in high school English class

143
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,940
and my cell phone is ringing incessantly

144
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
and I'm like, what the fuck?

145
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,940
I keep looking.

146
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
It's my dad.

147
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,940
The third phone call, I looked at my teacher

148
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,940
and I was like, hey, my dad's calling.

149
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,940
My grandma probably died.

150
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,940
And she was like, hell yeah.

151
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Yes.

152
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
Because you just sucked in high school.

153
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Yes, and still.

154
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,940
And so I go out in the hallway

155
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
and I answer the phone call

156
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
and my dad's like, where are you?

157
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
I'm like, I'm at school.

158
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
And he's like, don't lie to me, Zach.

159
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Where are you?

160
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
I'm in English class.

161
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
I can put you on the phone with my teacher

162
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,940
if you want.

163
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
And I'm like, I was a good kid.

164
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
My parents trusted me.

165
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,940
Where were you actually though?

166
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,940
I was in English class.

167
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,940
I was gone in my grandma in Philadelphia.

168
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,940
Skipping a candlelight vigil

169
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,940
and drinking with a homeless person.

170
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,940
Arrestees.

171
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,940
So he then proceeds to tell me

172
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
that my grandma got a phone call

173
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,940
from someone who sounded enough like me

174
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,940
to trick her into almost wiring

175
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,940
$1,000 as my bail.

176
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,940
And he called me thinking that I was in jail.

177
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,940
And I was like, dad, how old were you?

178
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Would they give me my cell phone?

179
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
I was a senior in high school.

180
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,940
The same thing happened to my grandma.

181
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
Tell the same story.

182
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,940
Well, it's a little different.

183
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,940
Different enough to be interesting.

184
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
That's what's important, baby.

185
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,940
I was traveling.

186
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,940
I was in Boston for two weeks

187
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,940
house-sitting for a relative.

188
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,940
My grandma vaguely knew that I was traveling.

189
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,940
But she got a call from somebody who was just like,

190
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,940
hello, grandma?

191
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,940
And she was like, yeah?

192
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,940
And he was like, I'm in Philadelphia

193
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,940
and I need $300 or whatever.

194
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
And she was like, oh, okay.

195
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,940
And anyway, she knew it was weird enough

196
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
to talk about it.

197
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
She called me.

198
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Weird enough to talk about.

199
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,940
Yeah, she knew it was weird enough to talk about.

200
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,940
She was like, if I saw something,

201
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,940
I'm going to say something.

202
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,940
And she did.

203
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Thankfully, my grandma wasn't scammed.

204
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,940
But now I know every time I talk to my grandma

205
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,940
on the phone now, I'm like, grandma, it's me.

206
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,940
You say your middle name?

207
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,940
I say my middle name, which is embarrassing.

208
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,940
And also vagina.

209
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
No relation.

210
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,940
No relation.

211
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
No what?

212
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,940
Thomas Vagina Cox.

213
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,940
No relation.

214
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Wait, don't dox me.

215
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
Fuck you.

216
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Have we said our last names?

217
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Probably.

218
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Yeah.

219
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,940
Okay, I'm Thomas Cox and I'm proud of you.

220
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,940
So outside of me saying that you guys are dumb.

221
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
No, no, no.

222
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Don't include my last name in that

223
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,940
in case somebody actually does then try to dox my grandma.

224
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
And her name is, what is her full name?

225
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,940
You will obviously bleep that one.

226
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Yeah, but that's it.

227
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,940
Also, if you give me her phone number,

228
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
I need to give her a call.

229
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Grandma, it's Luke.

230
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
I mean, Thomas.

231
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
Thomas Vagina Cox.

232
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Thomas Vagina Cox.

233
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
I'm in a lot of trouble.

234
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
A lot of relation.

235
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
You're my grandma.

236
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Do you know what bukkake is?

237
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
She said, she said,

238
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,940
yeah, it saved me a lot of money on facial care.

239
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,940
My grandma knows what bukkake is.

240
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Don't treat her like some kind of ignorant.

241
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
How do we recover from that?

242
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,940
Well, I'd just like to shout out my grandfather who

243
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,940
got your grandma into bukkake.

244
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
My God.

245
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,940
There's a place to cut in there somewhere.

246
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
There's gotta be, right?

247
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Yeah.

248
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,940
It's just gonna be like cut and paste it together words

249
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,940
like a serial killer.

250
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,940
Like, I think that show is good.

251
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,940
Well, I was gonna say I have theories of what is going on.

252
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,940
Oh, how many?

253
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,940
Like two.

254
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
Two.

255
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,940
And the more I think about both of them,

256
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,940
I start poking holes in my theories.

257
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
You floated one.

258
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,940
So I don't think, but yeah,

259
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,940
we talked about this last week.

260
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,940
We were driving home last week and you floated the idea

261
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,940
that maybe people killing themselves is their goal.

262
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Like us offing people is maybe-

263
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,940
Counter productive.

264
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
Counter productive.

265
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,940
That it's helping them achieve whatever goal

266
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,940
that they're trying to.

267
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,940
I think, I don't know if it was on the podcast

268
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,940
or just in conversation with you,

269
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,940
but talking about how when, because like when people chant

270
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,940
in most like Delta green things,

271
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,940
it's typically something bad.

272
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,940
Chant that for the listeners just to get the words out

273
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,940
as broadly as possible, Zach.

274
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Tawil Alakol.

275
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,940
Tawil Alakol.

276
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,940
I punch him.

277
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,940
Yeah, I'm gonna roll.

278
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
Yeah, Zach.

279
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
40 on a 70, I shoot you in the face.

280
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,940
We rolled unarmed combat against you

281
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,940
and we kicked your ass.

282
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,940
But no, I was saying like,

283
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,940
usually I hear a chant like that and I'm like,

284
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
okay, if something's about to be summoned,

285
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
it's gonna hurt us, it's gonna be bad.

286
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
Let's stop it.

287
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,940
But so far when the chanting has happened,

288
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,940
it's just been people killing themselves.

289
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
That's another thing,

290
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,940
is that we haven't actually killed either one.

291
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
We've heard two, right?

292
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
We've heard the guy in the mall, the Santa mall,

293
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,940
and then we've heard your brother's partner, Bruce Robin.

294
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
We killed Santa, right?

295
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
We shot him, but he impaled his own head.

296
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,940
I shot him, he didn't die and he killed himself

297
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,940
and then everybody else that we didn't kill

298
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,940
started killing themselves.

299
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,940
Enchanting.

300
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
Enchanting, yeah.

301
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,940
Everyone in that room was chanting.

302
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,940
Did they start chanting after he killed himself?

303
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
Enchantment, yes they did.

304
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,940
Right around the time that he killed himself.

305
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,940
And Bruce Robin started chanting that

306
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,940
and I think we shot him and beat him up

307
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,940
and then he killed himself.

308
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,940
We didn't get a shot in on him.

309
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
He punched him.

310
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
Somebody shot him in the gut.

311
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
I shot him in the gut.

312
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
Oh, did you really?

313
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,940
One of us did.

314
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
Somebody did.

315
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,940
Probably Keith.

316
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,940
But yeah, he shot himself.

317
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,940
He killed himself.

318
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,940
In the heat of the moment,

319
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,940
who knows who shot who in the gut.

320
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,940
But yeah, so my theory now is maybe next time

321
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
it starts happening,

322
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,940
could it be some sort of protection spell

323
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,940
or I don't know, I don't know if it's like something

324
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,940
that's like, I don't think it's a bad thing.

325
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,940
I think my initial thought is,

326
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,940
oh, it's gonna summon an elder god demon thing,

327
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,940
but I don't think that's the case anymore.

328
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,940
Well, okay, but what we were just saying,

329
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,940
the path we were kind of heading down just now

330
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
was that when you do the taui ala coal,

331
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,940
that if you kill yourself then, it then spreads, right?

332
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,940
In that kind of way we just stumbled on

333
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,940
as we were talking.

334
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
Or if you're killed maybe.

335
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,940
Well, after Bruce Robin killed himself,

336
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,940
we blacked out, woke up naked writing numbers in blood.

337
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,940
And who's to say that we weren't chanting that

338
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
while we did it?

339
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,940
Because we don't know.

340
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,940
I don't remember doing that.

341
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,940
When the audience, when they started chanting,

342
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,940
did they start then doing numbers also

343
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
or were they just chanting?

344
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,940
They were just chanting at the end,

345
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,940
but they were like all mumbling to themselves

346
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
throughout the process.

347
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,940
And you had the one guy mopping numbers

348
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,940
onto the ground with paint.

349
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,940
And he was naked.

350
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,940
Well, and then you also got to remember

351
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,940
throughout the entire campus of CSU,

352
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,940
numbers everywhere written all over everything.

353
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,940
And why is the fucker who's with us immune to it?

354
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
That's a good question.

355
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,940
As we all look at Justin.

356
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,940
I don't know.

357
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,940
He really doesn't.

358
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
I don't know.

359
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,940
That'd be fucked up if I was like,

360
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,940
well, Zach told me.

361
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
Here's why.

362
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,940
Zach told me not to tell you guys this, but.

363
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,940
It's because, what is your name?

364
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
Donovan West Haven.

365
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
Haven.

366
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,940
He uses Roman numerals, not Arabic numerals.

367
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,940
And so he's not affected.

368
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,940
That doesn't sound right.

369
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,940
Numerals?

370
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940
Donovan, yeah.

371
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
Numbers?

372
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Roman numerals, right?

373
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,940
Well, but people are.

374
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,940
Roman numbers?

375
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,940
Yeah.

376
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,940
They're Roman numbers?

377
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,940
Luke, they're called Roman numbers.

378
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
You idiot.

379
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,940
Did you think it was Roman numerals?

380
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,940
Roman numbers.

381
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,940
You guys can gaslight me way too easily.

382
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,940
Clearly not.

383
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
No, we can't.

384
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,940
Luke is like, oh yeah, right, right.

385
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Roman numbers.

386
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Roman numbers, yeah.

387
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,940
I was like, man, I must have made that word up.

388
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,940
I'm like, fuck you.

389
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
No, I didn't.

390
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,940
All right.

391
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,940
What else?

392
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
Any other theories of what the hell?

393
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,940
Because you guys are so stupid.

394
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
What else?

395
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,940
Any other theories of what the hell could be possibly going on?

396
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,940
The other theory that we've been kind of operating under is that it transfers like in a chain-like

397
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,940
fashion.

398
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,940
Right.

399
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,940
I think I said this last episode was my initial thought was, you know, Harriet Marks died

400
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:18,940
and then Bruce Robin is saying her name and then Bruce Robin dies and we're saying numbers

401
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,940
that translate to his name.

402
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,940
You know what we never looked into is his connection to her.

403
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,940
Do we know that?

404
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,940
I don't think we have, we haven't looked into it.

405
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,940
How did Bruce get infected, yeah?

406
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,940
I don't think we've looked into it, but I also, I couldn't tell you the first step in

407
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,940
doing that.

408
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
And the name Bruce Robin was writing was?

409
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,940
Harriet Marks.

410
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
But then Leon.

411
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
A powerful businessman.

412
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,940
But then Leon was reciting numbers that translate to Ben Smith, who was the muscular manny,

413
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
Santa guy, right?

414
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,940
No, well, he was just the one who was doing squats on Santa's throne.

415
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
He wasn't one of the like hot Santas.

416
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
He was the first person that I shot.

417
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,940
Yes.

418
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,940
That was, uh, started chanting tall will Alec Cole or whatever.

419
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,940
Yeah, there we go.

420
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Do you have a question for me, Zach?

421
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
Oh, right.

422
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,940
So you guys were just talking about what, what is the connection between Harriet Marks

423
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,940
and Bruce Robin?

424
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Right.

425
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Well, so in Harriet Marks's desk, um, I found a to do list with two, just only two items

426
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,940
on it.

427
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,940
Investigate the most corrupt.

428
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:30,940
The first is research research, most unethical corporation in the city in the city to was

429
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
who is the overseer?

430
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,940
So Harriet was looking into, was Harriet involved with any, like, uh, was she involved with

431
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
the student paper or was she a journalism student?

432
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,940
She was more of a pro union activist.

433
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,940
So she was looking into the overseer, which may, well, she might not have been looking

434
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
into it.

435
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,940
She, she stumbled upon something that the overseer.

436
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,940
So she was like, I got to research what this is.

437
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,940
First is research.

438
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,940
The most unethical corporation in the city, which is, I assume surprisingly not unethical.

439
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,940
What is it?

440
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,940
B and R or what was bar Corp bar Corp.

441
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,940
I was thinking beans and Robin, but you got it.

442
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
Bar Corp beans and Robin.

443
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,940
I was thinking not a, she might've been killed by Bruce Robin.

444
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,940
If she was poking into, into the corporation, it's definitely how she met Bruce Robin.

445
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,940
I think.

446
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
I don't know if she got killed.

447
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,940
She killed herself.

448
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,940
Right.

449
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,940
We knew that too.

450
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Yeah, she did.

451
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,940
Okay.

452
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
Which is a common theme of this whole thing.

453
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,940
So could she have, uh, she didn't, we found out she like fell out of a fell out of her

454
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,940
dorm window.

455
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
Was that it?

456
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,940
How'd she, how'd she kill herself from the pictures that you saw that were given to you

457
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,940
by Leon Simpson of the crime scene.

458
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
It seemed to be a gunshot wound.

459
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
Oh really?

460
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,940
There was a blood splatter behind on her a wall of her dorm.

461
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
So she, she killed herself by shooting herself.

462
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Well now that's, that's a baby.

463
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,940
Bruce Robin shot himself.

464
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,940
I mean, I don't know if that was, if there's a link there.

465
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,940
Like, I mean, obviously Bruce had a gun on him and was trying to kill himself at it.

466
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,940
I don't know if there's a link there or if it just is circumstantial that they both shot

467
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
themselves.

468
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Are we sure they're crime scene photos?

469
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,940
Of Harriet Marks?

470
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,940
We, we looked at, yeah, we, we looked at the crime scene photos.

471
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
What if Leon shot her and took photos?

472
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
Why would he have us investigated?

473
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,940
Bruce did, you mean?

474
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,940
What would that imply?

475
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,940
I don't know.

476
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,940
Figure it out.

477
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
I know.

478
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,940
Tell me.

479
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Let's get into the game.

480
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Yeah.

481
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,940
I think we've covered a lot here and we've got a lot of good things being brought to

482
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
the forefront.

483
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,940
I don't feel any more clear.

484
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,940
I'm only maybe a little bit more.

485
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,940
I feel like the listeners are only talking to us even more.

486
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,940
Yeah.

487
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,940
If you are one of the people that supposedly know what's going on, hit me up.

488
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Hit me up.

489
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Tell me what's going on.

490
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
Fuck you.

491
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
Fuck you.

492
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
Fuck you.

493
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
Okay.

494
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:06,940
As you guys come back to this place where you're all standing there, you were standing

495
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,940
around, Clark was looking at his phones and you would all know that the things that you

496
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,940
have not looked at that you've come across since this epidemic has ended are the two

497
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,940
videos on the laptop that Amelia Locke was throwing in the air.

498
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,940
Fuck you guys.

499
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
I got it right that time.

500
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
Did you?

501
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,940
There are two videos that I honestly don't know.

502
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
Did you?

503
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,940
I think you did for the first time.

504
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,940
Think about it.

505
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
Really get in your head about it.

506
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,940
What would you like to do?

507
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
I want to go to the lab.

508
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
I want to go to the lab too.

509
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Yeah.

510
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,940
Wanting that, John head stores the lab.

511
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Donovan, we're going to the lab.

512
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
We're going to see if those people are still in there.

513
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,940
Can you lead the way?

514
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,940
I look at John as he's turning down a hallway that is the incorrect direction and just walking

515
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,940
with a lot of confidence.

516
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,940
I'm like, hey, we're going this way.

517
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,940
Life is a garden of forking paths, but they all lead to our ultimate destination.

518
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
If you want to go to the lab, though, we got to go this way.

519
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,940
I know, but John picks a beautiful flower out of a little pot that was in the hallway

520
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,940
that he walked down and then he heads back towards you.

521
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Each petal has a different number written on it.

522
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,940
I was going to ask if it had a number on it.

523
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
He says, what does this mean?

524
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,940
And he hands it to you.

525
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,940
It's a plastic plant.

526
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,940
It's a fake indoor plant.

527
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
It's cheap.

528
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
Is it?

529
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,940
What are the numbers?

530
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,940
You have nothing.

531
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,940
It spells out flower.

532
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,940
You cheap.

533
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,940
You have nothing.

534
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,940
You're like, the flower has fucking numbers on it.

535
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Fuck you.

536
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,940
I said, I said my news resolution.

537
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
I look at the flower.

538
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,940
I'm like, it's just a flower.

539
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
I picked it because it was beautiful.

540
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,940
And because I look at flower and I look at John, I'm like, we're wasting time here.

541
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,940
We there's people that have been in there for days.

542
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,940
Let's go.

543
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,940
John puts the flower in your ear and walks.

544
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,940
I feel a little bit prettier.

545
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,940
Clark is still carrying the laptop and he's holding it up as he walks along.

546
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,940
How are you holding it up?

547
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
It's open.

548
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,940
It's open?

549
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,940
It's open.

551
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,940
Okay, cool.

553
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,940
When you guys go out into the campus, you hear these screams and noises that you've

554
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,940
heard previously all throughout the campus.

555
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
It's college, baby.

556
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:36,940
Are we cops or are we fucking experts on youth music?

557
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,940
Come on.

558
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,940
If I look over towards the bell tower, is Shamwell Chameleon still up there?

559
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,940
Shamwell Chameleon is on top of the minion.

560
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
Shamwell Chameleon is on top of the minion.

561
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,940
The minion was on top of the bell tower?

562
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,940
Uh-huh, yeah.

563
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
Yeah.

564
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,940
Dude, hey, good for Shamwell, first of all.

565
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,940
And she's just up there and you can hear her in the distance screaming, I gotta get higher.

566
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
Higher.

567
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Higher.

568
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,940
I look at these guys and I'm like, I think we did a good thing while I pointed her.

569
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,940
And you can see behind her in the distance, there are black unmarked helicopters coming

570
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
into the city.

571
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,940
Those are probably there for her because it went viral that she wanted to get higher.

572
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,940
I prod Donovan in the back and I'm like, hurry up, let's go.

573
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Okay.

574
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,940
Pick up the pace.

575
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Okay.

576
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
Donovan, there are two routes to get to the lab.

577
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,940
Mm-hmm.

578
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,940
One is more direct, but it is not lit and the other one is-

579
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Is totally fucking awesome.

580
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Honestly, this whole situation is not lit right now.

581
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,940
No, yeah.

582
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,940
None of this has been lit, Zach.

583
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
The other one is well lit.

584
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,940
The British person would say it's really cool.

585
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
It's well lit.

586
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
Which one do you want to, which one do you lead them down?

587
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,940
I think I'd lead them down whatever I feel is the safest because Donovan's feeling like

588
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,940
endangered now, especially after seeing the one person be like, turn the lights off.

589
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,940
He's like freaked out about that shit.

590
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Is it the well lit one?

591
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Oh, we're going to go down the proper lit one.

592
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,940
So you guys don't go down the proper lit one.

593
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
Well lit.

594
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,940
It's lit by street lights, the tall lights that light paths and he's going to stop under

595
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,940
one and just stare up at it for a minute or two.

596
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,940
How lit is a street light?

597
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
That's pretty pedestrian.

598
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,940
Keith comes up next to you and looks up and I'm like, remember Harry Potter?

599
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
That thing?

600
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
Anyway.

601
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
De-luminator?

602
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
De-luminator.

603
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
That thing's awful.

604
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,940
Good thing we don't have one because I would have clicked it a bunch of times.

605
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,940
Anyway.

606
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
That would have been terrible.

607
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,940
It would have been a terrible moment in a podcast for sure.

608
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
Got him.

609
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
Fucking Ben Dan.

610
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,940
And you hear down this path.

611
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,940
It's channel of the day guys.

612
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,940
And as you guys are walking in that direction, it's getting louder and louder and you can

613
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,940
kind of hear that it's coming from this bench that is just around a corner.

614
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
You can only see the edge of the bench.

615
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,940
You can't see the fullness of the bench.

616
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,940
It's like in an enclave of a building that's well lit but you just can't see around the

617
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,940
corner.

618
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
It's tight.

619
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
But you can't see it.

620
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,940
What do you mean we can't tell what kind of bench it is?

621
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,940
No, I mean the bench is like hidden.

622
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,940
You can see the corner of a bench but you can't see the full bench because you haven't

623
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,940
gotten that far yet.

624
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,940
The cleaning lady comes in on Monday.

625
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
Is it around?

626
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
How much more bench could there be?

627
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
She sweeps.

628
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,940
Is it around the building we're going to?

629
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,940
No, there's just a building on the way.

630
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,940
I prod Donovan in the back.

631
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,940
I'm like, okay, really hurry up.

632
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,940
Let's go.

633
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,940
Donovan starts kind of rearing back a little bit.

634
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,940
Are we like super close to this?

635
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,940
Yeah, you're probably like 20 feet away.

636
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,940
It's coming up hot.

637
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,940
Should someone go ahead and see what this is all about?

638
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,940
Donovan, you've seen, think about what we just left.

639
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,940
Do you really want to go check out that sound?

640
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:20,940
Okay, it's straight ahead, but you guys, I'll walk behind you guys and guide you.

641
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
That doesn't make any sense.

642
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Just go.

643
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
Just keep going straight.

644
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
I'll be behind you for sure.

645
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,940
I push Donovan along.

646
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,940
While your path may not be apparent.

647
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,940
Clark, I need you to help.

648
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
I'm pushing you through this.

649
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
Clark, you know me, please.

650
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
Don't make me go ahead.

651
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
Sure, sure, Donovan.

652
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Of course.

653
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,940
I guess if he nears the bench, he's going to say hello.

654
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,940
And as you near the bench and say hello, turning the corner, you see there's an old man who

655
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:56,940
is huddled into the corner of this enclave of this building and he's crouched over and

656
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,940
he's got his left hand out and he's holding a citrus peeler in his other hand.

657
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:08,940
And he's slowly dragging the peeler down each of his fingers and moaning as the skin comes

658
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,940
off like a lime zest.

659
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Fuck off, Zach.

660
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,940
Roll sanity, Joe.

661
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,940
Oh, fuck.

662
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
See you, boys.

663
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
I fail.

664
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Roll a D4.

665
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Oh my God.

666
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,940
So I had two sanity points and I rolled a one.

667
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
So I've got one sanity.

668
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
Okay.

669
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,940
You're clinging on.

670
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
You're fine.

671
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,940
I join him.

672
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,940
That sounds way more rational than anything.

673
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,940
There is actually a light coming down on him.

674
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,940
I get up real close to him.

675
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
He found a nice little spot here, it looks like.

676
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,940
And he's just turning his fingers into those of a skeleton.

677
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,940
I go up and I kick him in the shin.

678
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
Okay.

679
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,940
Roll sanity when you turn the corner and see what's happening here.

680
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
I pass 24 on 26.

681
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
Wow.

682
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,940
Oh no, I have 23.

683
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
I fail 24 on 23.

684
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
Oh, fuck.

685
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
I thought I had 23.

686
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
That sucked.

687
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
So yeah, I fail.

688
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,940
Okay.

689
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,940
Sounds good.

690
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,940
I need you to leave the room.

691
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,940
Get the fuck out of here.

692
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,940
You're not welcome to hear this next part.

693
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,940
Bye bye.

694
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:46,940
John Lee Pettymore and Donovan Westhaven, you see Keith Vigna turn the corner where

695
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:52,940
Clark has disappeared to and then Keith Vigna immediately turns around and comes walking

696
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,940
back and he is repeating the numbers for Bruce Robin.

697
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,940
I grab Donovan by the chest, or by his shoulders, and I'm like, let him go.

698
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,940
There's nothing you can do for him.

699
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
For who?

700
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Him.

701
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Okay, I wasn't going to do it.

702
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
Don't.

703
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
I wasn't going to do anything.

704
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,940
But don't.

705
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,940
What the fuck is happening right now?

706
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:18,940
Clark is going to yell from the alcove, hey, uh, you fellas, this is, uh, you know, Donovan

707
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
especially, you're not going to want to see what's going on over here.

708
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,940
I just, uh, just put up the blinders and keep walking.

709
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Okay.

710
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
Okay, Clark.

711
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Thank you.

712
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Do you join them to continue down this path?

713
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
No, I'm going to linger here for a second.

714
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,940
And I want to say to the man, why are you, why are you doing that?

715
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,940
Oh yeah, feels good.

716
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,940
Are there any numbers around him?

717
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
Oh yeah.

718
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Can I discern any words that I would know?

719
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,940
He's writing in blood.

720
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:55,940
Clark would see the numbers four, one, one, four, eight, five, one, one, eight, two, zero,

721
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,940
written all around him.

722
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,940
Oh, got to become bone.

723
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,940
Yeah.

724
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,940
Keith's always the one who's good at doing the numbers.

725
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,940
Uh, so if they're just single integers, it doesn't spell anything.

726
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,940
It's D A A D H E A A H B.

727
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,940
And then I don't know what zero is, but then if, hold on, let me see the numbers.

728
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,940
Four eleven, I could be, I guess it's 20.

729
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,940
So it might be four, one, 14, eight, five, 11, eight, 20.

730
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
It's my guess.

731
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
Let me write down the numbers.

732
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
Okay.

733
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
We're not recording.

734
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
Okay.

735
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
We are.

736
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
That's fun.

737
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
People like this.

738
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
Four, one, one, four.

739
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,940
You don't have to say that cause I edit the podcast.

740
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,940
Eight, five.

741
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
People like this.

742
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,940
Four, one, one, four, eight, five.

743
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,940
Eleven, eight, two, zero.

744
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Eight, two, zero.

745
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,940
Uh, I figured out the numbers.

746
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,940
Actually, I'm not talking to anybody.

747
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,940
I figured out the numbers.

748
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,940
Uh, it spells Dan Hart.

749
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,940
D A N H E A R T.

750
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
I want to say that name to him.

751
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Oh.

752
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,940
Does that mean anything to you, sir?

753
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,940
Co worker.

754
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,940
Oh yeah.

755
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,940
Do you work at a bar corp?

756
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
No.

757
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,940
And he's wearing like a CSU janitorial uniform.

758
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Dan Hart was a coworker.

759
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Oh yeah.

760
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
Oh yeah.

761
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,240
And he's just like peeling and just the thinnest layer of old man paper thin skin is coming

762
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,940
off each finger as he does it.

763
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
Is it dead skin?

764
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
No.

765
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
Damn it.

766
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,940
Did Dan die?

767
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
Yeah.

768
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,940
How'd he die?

769
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Oh God.

770
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
Yeah.

771
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:40,060
And he finishes and it just, the skin hits the ground and he looks up at you and looks

772
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,940
dead in your eyes and he says, hung himself in front of me.

773
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
Oh yeah.

774
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,940
How long ago?

775
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,940
Oh no time.

776
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
Well that's true.

777
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,940
Agreed.

778
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
Oh yeah.

779
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Oh there it is.

780
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
That's the good stuff.

781
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,300
Well you have a fun night.

782
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,260
Carry on citizen.

783
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:07,580
And as you guys move through, Keith Vigna is coming with you if you'd bring him essentially.

784
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:14,020
This is the first time I think that Clark has been, has witnessed one of the crew doing

785
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,060
this.

786
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,420
So he wants to turn around on Keith.

787
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Keith.

788
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
Keith.

789
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Nothing.

790
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,420
He's just mumbling these.

791
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
I'm going to smack him.

792
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
Doesn't even face him.

793
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
John.

794
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Yeah.

795
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,880
Like John moves to stop his hand as he goes to smack him.

796
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,420
He gets through because he already did it.

797
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:35,340
But John moves to stop it and he's like, do not disturb the traveler in his moment of

798
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,260
passage.

799
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
The traveler.

800
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,420
Is he the...

801
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
You are the traveler.

802
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
I thought he was.

803
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,420
I don't understand, John.

804
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,420
Keith.

805
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,420
Wake up, dammit.

806
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:52,140
I turned to Donovan, Donovan, is this, is this what we were like?

807
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,140
Leon was on the floor, but yeah, you guys were just mumbling, mumbling numbers.

808
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,140
You're unresponsive.

809
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
Do you remember?

810
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,820
Keith tried to shake you and nothing happened.

811
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,180
Do you remember how long we were like that?

812
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
Couple minutes maybe.

813
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,900
All right, then I'm just going to have to hope that Keith snaps out of it in a couple

814
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
minutes, I suppose.

815
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,900
Yeah.

816
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,300
All right, let's just continue on then if he's going to follow.

817
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,340
Keith, just, just hold onto my shirt.

818
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
Does he?

819
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,340
Sure.

820
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
Sure.

821
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:38,820
And as you guys are nearing the glass hall, Keith comes to.

822
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,900
You guys are approaching glass hall and Keith's eyes kind of stop glazing over.

823
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
Keith.

824
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
Are you, are you with us?

825
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
Can you hear me?

826
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
Yeah.

827
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
Why wouldn't I be?

828
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,900
It was those numbers again.

829
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
They got you.

830
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,900
What?

831
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,460
Well, what was I, which numbers?

832
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
Which numbers was he doing?

833
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,460
Bruce Robin.

834
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,880
You were doing Bruce Robin's numbers.

835
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,860
Did I, I mean, I've seen you guys do this before.

836
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,300
Was I just saying them or what kind of stuff was I doing?

837
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Like you're in a trance.

838
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,340
You're just saying the numbers and wouldn't respond to anything.

839
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,700
And I slapped Keith and it didn't work.

840
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:22,260
I rub my face and I think back to just minutes ago when I slapped his face, I'm like, I wouldn't

841
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
have done the same thing.

842
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,260
Clark.

843
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,260
I did do the same thing.

844
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,580
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

845
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:39,060
Is this the start of Tyler, the creator's, let the needle shine in the light of the moon

846
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,180
until I put them in your eyes.

847
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,580
It is the start of Tyler.

848
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,460
I look at Clark's, what did I miss?

849
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
That's new.

850
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:55,900
And you hear from the entrance to glass hall, seemingly standing like right in front of

851
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,900
the entrance.

852
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:05,940
There is a college student dude who's dressed in like athletic shorts and slides and a t-shirt

853
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,940
even in all this snow or slides, the slip on slides are like the slip on sandals.

854
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,840
That's such a cool thing to call them.

855
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:22,460
And that guy is standing completely still in this pose with like his right fist up to

856
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,260
his cheek and then his left hand like flat and up in the air.

857
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,780
What would that pose be called?

858
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,060
It's like the Mr. Alice pose, right?

859
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,940
You're flexing on one side and the other side is a dab.

860
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
Yep.

861
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Oh, Joe did it with the little mannequin in here.

862
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,220
We'll put that on Twitter.

863
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:50,740
He won't bend enough to do it, but dabbing with one arm.

864
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:59,780
And then, more importantly, there is a young boy in choir robes singing softly and methodically

865
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:05,420
sticking syringes into this dude who's just standing there.

866
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:13,180
And as he sings, he's putting a syringe directly into this guy's eye.

867
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,260
Come on, Zach.

868
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
You're off the podcast.

869
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,820
Get out of here.

870
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,820
Done.

871
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,820
It's our podcast now.

872
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,060
And it's fucking about just being friends and hanging out and being nice.

873
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,620
It's about being nice.

874
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,300
So get the fuck out of here, Zach.

875
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,580
Zach didn't make it happen.

876
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,900
He's just telling us what happened, guys.

877
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
No, no, Justin.

878
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,900
That's just a thing.

879
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,300
He's gaslighted you in the blue.

880
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,300
Zach propaganda.

881
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
Yes.

882
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,300
That's Zach-a-ganda.

883
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
Zach-a-ganda.

884
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,620
Wait, Zach, go home.

885
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
Quick question.

886
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,820
This is just in the lobby of Glass Hall?

887
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,540
This is right in front of the front door of Glass Hall?

888
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,540
Yes.

889
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,540
Outside.

890
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,540
Outside.

891
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,220
I'm imagining the look at me on the captain now, but instead of him pointing at his eyes,

892
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,540
it's just two syringes sticking out of his eyeballs.

893
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,940
You're welcome for that one.

894
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,140
Yeah, Luke should be the DM.

895
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,380
Look at me on the DM now.

896
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,380
I like playing.

897
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:17,100
I'm going to have everyone roll intelligence because you're all super fucked up right now,

898
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,820
but if you pass an intelligence check, you're going to have to roll sanity.

899
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,740
Hey, I failed.

900
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,740
Yay.

901
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,540
I crit pass with a 22.

902
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,540
Oh my God.

903
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,540
What does that mean?

904
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
I crit pass too.

905
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
No fucking way.

906
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,700
I got a 66 and yeah, my intelligence is 75.

907
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
Hell yeah.

908
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
What are the chances?

909
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
So you guys auto fail your sanity checks for sure.

910
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,300
My intelligence is not that high, but I...

911
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,020
Go ahead and roll that intelligence for Donovan there, Justin.

912
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,020
48.

913
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,020
I assume a failure.

914
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,020
That is a failure.

915
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,020
Oh really?

916
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,580
I'm dumb and I'm 55.

917
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,580
I'm dumb and I'm 50.

918
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
You're not.

919
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,580
You're even lower.

920
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,580
You guys aren't dumb.

921
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,580
Well, you are.

922
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,580
You played dumb.

923
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,580
He's a college student.

924
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,580
Come on.

925
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,580
He is a fifth year senior though.

926
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,580
The standards are higher.

927
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,340
He's a fifth year senior that has only online classes.

928
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:05,540
No, Donovan is like way too concerned with his own life to pay attention to it.

929
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,660
He like glanced up and was like, ah, it's probably fucked up and immediately went back

930
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,180
to his phone, which is what Justin just did.

931
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,740
Take a note.

932
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:21,340
So with Luke and Thomas crit succeeding on those intelligence checks, we'll call that

933
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:29,060
an automatic fail and I need an automatic fail on your sanity check that you would have

934
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
had to take.

935
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,340
But what knowledge do we claim?

936
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,740
Well, actually, no, I crit failed.

937
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,820
I'm just kidding.

938
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:56,220
So I'm going to have the two of you leave the room.

939
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,700
Clark Bishop, Donovan West Haven.

940
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Yes.

941
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,700
Nailed it.

942
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,700
First try.

943
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,700
So proud of you.

944
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,500
The two of you notice as soon as this awful vision is approached.

945
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,580
You see that Keith Vigna and John Lee Pattymore immediately go into themselves and begin chanting

946
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,500
the numbers of Bruce Robin.

947
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,180
God damn it, Donovan, they're gone again.

948
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,180
What's happening?

949
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,180
I don't understand.

950
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,460
Has this always been happening to them lately?

951
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,420
I think it's what's happening to everybody around here.

952
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,260
I mean, you've seen people chanting numbers.

953
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,300
I think I have some connection.

954
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,460
For some reason, we're able to snap out of it appear.

955
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,700
It appears and others aren't.

956
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
I don't, I don't know.

957
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,700
I don't either.

958
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,860
I do little snappy fingers in front of Keith and John.

959
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,860
Nothing.

960
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,860
Since I'm not there.

961
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,860
I can't see this building.

962
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,860
Is there, is there an entrance into this building that isn't with these freakos in front of it?

963
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,340
They are far enough away from the entrance that you could go around.

964
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,340
I can skirt around.

965
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
That's exactly what I want to do.

966
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,340
Donovan.

967
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,420
I mean, I think we got to keep our eye on the prize.

968
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,740
These guys are going to snap out of it soon.

969
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,940
I got, we just have to wrangle up your three other friends that are all in a trance right

970
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,940
now.

971
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
Oh yeah.

972
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,940
Leon's with us still too, isn't he?

973
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,940
No.

974
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,940
Oh yes.

975
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,940
Oh my God.

976
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:13,020
Why is, why do you think he's not snapping out of it?

977
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,860
That's a goddamn good question, Donovan.

978
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,420
I don't know why he's not snapping out of it.

979
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,420
I do.

980
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,060
I, I go back to Leon again, do a couple of snaps in front of his face.

981
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
Leon!

982
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,060
Leon, get back here!

983
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,540
He is just boogying on down.

984
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,540
Can't stop, won't stop.

985
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
I don't know, Donovan.

986
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
I don't know.

987
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
I don't know.

988
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,540
Why is this not happening to me?

989
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,540
I don't understand.

990
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,500
I'm starting to think that you're the key to all this.

991
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,900
I just don't understand what to do with that.

992
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,880
The lights inside glass hall are on.

993
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,820
If you want to go around the back, I know, I know a good way.

994
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,960
I took it because I was always running late.

995
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,460
Whatever it gives us to the lab sooner.

996
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,300
Donovan, I don't even know what we're going to find there, but it is the task we've set

997
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,020
before us and I think we need to just stay the course.

998
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,080
Whatever you say, Clark, I'll follow you.

999
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,740
So do you guys want to skirt around this site and get into these front doors or do you want

1000
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,940
to go around the side down an alleyway into the back?

1001
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,140
No, the lights are on, right?

1002
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,140
Yeah.

1003
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,780
I'm going, I'm beelining for the door with the lights on.

1004
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,780
I'll lead them to the side entrance.

1005
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,980
Okay, and you lead the other three in, wait, what?

1006
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,980
Donovan, over here.

1007
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,980
These, these here.

1008
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,980
These are the doors.

1009
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,580
I'm like, I'm slowly walking away.

1010
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,140
You were walking with the other three.

1011
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,580
Yeah, I have the other three like dog leashes with me.

1012
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,500
Clark's like, hey, hey, come back over here.

1013
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:27,060
And as soon as you guys walk into glass hall, you see it's a nice like big entry foyer into

1014
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,380
this and there are stairs immediately in front of you that lead down and there's a

1015
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,020
sign that says biology lab in the basement.

1016
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:41,260
As that happens, you hear, go ahead and roll alertness, both of you for me.

1017
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,880
I pass a 27 on a 70.

1018
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,140
I got a 44, so either a crit fail or a crit success.

1019
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:56,740
You guys both hear the slapping of feet coming around the corner and heading down a hallway

1020
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,140
toward you on your left side.

1021
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:05,980
And you hear a woman's voice saying two, five, one, four, one, oh, got to get the gifts.

1022
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,980
Got to get.

1023
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,980
Oh yeah.

1024
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,480
And then, uh, and then that's where he just got and just like running while just like

1025
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,620
slurring and saying these numbers as they're coming.

1026
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,560
Clark is basking in the light.

1027
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,100
He's uh, arms outstretched, looking up at the fluorescent lights above him.

1028
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,500
Donovan, didn't that just feel good?

1029
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,220
Clark, what are you, what's going on?

1030
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,220
What are you doing?

1031
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,220
Just doesn't it feel good?

1032
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,900
What feels good?

1033
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
The light.

1034
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,860
It feels like, it doesn't feel like anything.

1035
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,860
It's fluorescent lighting.

1036
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,860
It feels bad.

1037
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
Just stretch them out.

1038
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,860
To my eyes.

1039
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,860
Just stretch them out, Donnie.

1040
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Just stretch out those arms.

1041
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,900
Donovan like does like a weird, like very slight stretch.

1042
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,220
Clark stands a little straighter, pops his neck.

1043
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,880
All right, where's his lab?

1044
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,060
Is it back down that way where the voices are?

1045
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,900
You do, you see a sign that says biology lab in the basement.

1046
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,900
The footsteps and the words mumbling weren't coming from any direction near there.

1047
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,460
No, they were coming from a hallway.

1048
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,460
Yeah, okay.

1049
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,700
I think we should just go down and not engage with this other person.

1050
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,500
I'm with you Don, let's go.

1051
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:10,220
And as you guys head down the stairs, you hear the footsteps turn around and head back

1052
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,460
the opposite way.

1053
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,220
You notice John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna snap out of it.

1054
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,980
What's up everybody?

1055
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:35,020
Wolf the dog here.

1056
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,540
Don't use this.

1057
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,500
Every time you're on mic, what you're saying is being recorded.

1058
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,740
We know that's not true.

1059
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,740
You come to-

1060
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,220
Because you leave so much gold on the floor.

1061
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:51,500
You're standing on the stairs of a building that you don't remember walking into and you

1062
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:57,980
look over and you see Donovan Westhaven and Clark Bishop staring at you.

1063
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,420
And right behind you is Leon Simpson, still just grooving and grinding and bumping and

1064
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
dapping.

1065
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,380
Are we on the inside of this building or-

1066
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,980
You are on the inside of this building and as you all look down, you see that these stairs

1067
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:20,260
are covered in a trail of blood that is leading down into the basement and there are loose

1068
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,780
screwdrivers that have been spilled onto these stairs.

1069
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,580
So are we on the stairs that we're on are descending?

1070
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,580
Yes.

1071
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,700
Can we see where they might have been secured before they were strewn across these stairs?

1072
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,700
No.

1073
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,700
I know.

1074
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,700
That's a joke.

1075
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,700
Oh, it was good.

1076
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,700
It's not.

1077
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,700
I'm sorry.

1078
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,700
Welcome back, fellas.

1079
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,700
See the light in your eyes now.

1080
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
What?

1081
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,700
It happened again.

1082
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,700
I know.

1083
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:49,460
I feel every time I wake up from something like that, I don't feel like I've lost anything

1084
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,900
but when I look at you and you've got this weird look on your face, I realize that-

1085
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,820
You haven't lost anything nor have they gained anything while seemingly you were gone.

1086
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,240
Quick question for you, Zach.

1087
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,260
Did we gain anything from those intelligence rules?

1088
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,260
Nope.

1089
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,260
God damn it.

1090
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,880
Can we gain any unnatural for being knocked out all these times?

1091
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,700
You do lose a D4 of sanity.

1092
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,980
So if you want to each roll a D4-

1093
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
Oh, cool.

1094
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,620
I wanted to roll.

1095
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,620
I got a four.

1096
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,620
Tight.

1097
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,620
Me too.

1098
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,620
This is fucking crazy.

1099
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,620
All right.

1100
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,020
So you each lose four sanity.

1101
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,900
That brings me down to four sanity.

1102
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,060
Where are you at, Luke?

1103
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,180
I'm at 19.

1104
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,940
My breaking point is 18.

1105
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,540
You're the sane one here, man.

1106
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,300
I also didn't recalculate my breaking point.

1107
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,300
You hit your last breaking point exactly so it's minus your power.

1108
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,300
Yeah.

1109
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,300
There's no more breaking points for me.

1110
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,300
All right.

1111
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,940
I tried to write on this soft desk and instead of a nine, I just ripped the paper.

1112
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,460
So give me a sec.

1113
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,460
Character sheets, baby.

1114
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,020
You're insane.

1115
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,100
As you guys come to as you're walking down these stairs, you notice that there is a young

1116
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:08,940
small ugly child wearing a backpack that is cleaning the baseboards with the veracity

1117
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,820
of the veracity?

1118
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,820
What's veracity?

1119
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,140
Veracity is truthfulness.

1120
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,440
Veracity is speed.

1121
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,540
So somewhere in the middle there.

1122
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:25,460
I think veracity is like how- Veracity is how velociraptory you are.

1123
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,460
Oh yeah.

1124
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
No.

1125
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,440
The kid has his arms tucked in real tight and is just on his back haunches cleaning

1126
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,580
the shit out of these baseboards.

1127
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,220
Real velociraptory.

1128
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,860
I pull my gun out and shoot him.

1129
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,860
I do not do that.

1130
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,860
You're the one at 19.

1131
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,860
I don't do that.

1132
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,220
I'm at four.

1133
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:52,100
But the trail of blood moves past this child and into the floor below that you cannot see

1134
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,100
yet.

1135
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,100
I look at Clark.

1136
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,100
Do you know what this blood is from?

1137
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
I don't.

1138
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,820
There was a sign up at the top up there that the biology lab was down this way.

1139
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,900
So we just started moving down this way.

1140
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:08,280
It doesn't look good, but I think, I mean- The trail of blood is leading to the lab?

1141
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,280
To or from.

1142
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Can we tell?

1143
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,280
Yeah.

1144
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,280
Can we tell?

1145
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,280
He said it was going down there.

1146
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,280
It is moving toward.

1147
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,480
It's moving from the stairs the way that the blood is tripping and the way that the blood

1148
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,480
is like slid.

1149
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
Are there any footprints?

1150
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
It's being slid.

1151
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,720
No, it seems to have been like, actually, go ahead and roll forensics.

1152
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,080
I have a zero.

1153
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,720
Do I even need to roll?

1154
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,720
No.

1155
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,720
I failed.

1156
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,720
A 58 on a 50.

1157
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,720
I got an 88.

1158
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,720
Is that a 50?

1159
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,720
I got a 20.

1160
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,720
I got a 40.

1161
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,720
Okay.

1162
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,080
John Lee Pettymore would know that the blood is a person's body that was army crawling.

1163
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,840
Away from there or down the stairs?

1164
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,160
Someone in great pain crawled this way.

1165
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,240
I just look at Clark and Donovan and wait for their next move.

1166
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,840
I look at Donovan.

1167
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,280
Where's that lab?

1168
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,280
It's down here.

1169
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,280
It's just to the right.

1170
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,280
We're almost there.

1171
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,640
Clark, I'm scared.

1172
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:11,760
As I'm walking down the stairs, my pants have become uncuffed, and so they're draping around

1173
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,520
my shoes a little bit.

1174
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,720
And I slip, and I fall, and I just slide down the rest of the stairs.

1175
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:28,880
And then I need everyone to leave the room real quick, except for Luke.

1176
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:44,200
Luke, due to the sanity mechanics of this arc of the campaign, I need you to roll a

1177
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,920
D100 three times for me, and tell me the three numbers that you roll.

1178
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,760
A 6, a 52, and a 74.

1179
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,120
You are going to choose between three manias, and this mania that you choose is going to

1180
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:06,080
take over your entire personality, who you are, and everything goals-wise, what your

1181
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,840
character is oriented towards.

1182
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:14,480
Number 6 is agromania, the intense desire to be in open spaces.

1183
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:23,120
52 is habromania, an abnormal tendency to create pleasant delusions in spite of reality.

1184
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,800
So you would see something good, even when it's bad.

1185
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,800
Exactly.

1186
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:36,440
And 74 is onomamania, which is an obsession with names, people, places, things.

1187
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,080
I'm going to go with the second one.

1188
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:47,720
Yes, 52, which is habromania, which is an abnormal tendency to create pleasant delusions

1189
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,600
in spite of reality.

1190
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,600
As you're walking down the stairs, you slip and you fall to the bottom.

1191
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:01,160
You see that there is just a trail of money from where you fell further into the basement

1192
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:06,240
level, and there's just a pile of cash sitting there.

1193
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,880
As I'm following the trail of money, I'm picking up every dollar, stuffing it into my, as we

1194
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
know at this point, big britches.

1195
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,160
Yo, huge.

1196
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:21,960
Once I get up to the pile of money, I am standing there and I'm just handfuls of cash, shoving

1197
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,960
them into my pockets.

1198
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,960
Fantastic.

1199
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,160
I'm going to get the other boys.

1200
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:46,480
As Donovan Westhaven, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore, and a groovin' Leon Simpson make

1201
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:53,420
their way down the stairs, you see Keith Vigna slips, falls, and at the bottom of the stairs,

1202
00:50:53,420 --> 00:51:00,100
he lands in this pile of blood and loose screwdrivers, and he begins grabbing these screwdrivers

1203
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:05,420
and putting them in his pockets, and then he's like grabbing up some of the blood, putting

1204
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:12,860
it in his pockets, and as you guys continue down, I look at Clark, Clark, once this is

1205
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:21,380
all over, I'm going to buy you as many TV dinners as you want, as many as you want.

1206
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,660
You're going to buy me, I'll buy them all for you.

1207
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,980
And then I continue shoving.

1208
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:35,660
And well, see the thing is that as you continue shoving, they see you approach this flaccid,

1209
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:43,300
bloody pile of an elderly woman's body that has screwdrivers just jutting out of it all

1210
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:48,700
over the place, and Keith Vigna is grabbing these screwdrivers and pulling them out of

1211
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,420
this lady and putting them in his giant britches.

1212
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,420
Keith, what the fuck are you doing?

1213
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,420
Are you kidding?

1214
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,820
I mean, how are you guys not excited?

1215
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,820
Oh my god!

1216
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,820
Excited about...

1217
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,820
Keith, stop picking us up!

1218
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,820
We're rich!

1219
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,820
We're rich!

1220
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,820
Rich?

1221
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,820
Yeah!

1222
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,820
Oh my god!

1223
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,540
Don't, don't get excited.

1224
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,220
All material gain is merely temporary.

1225
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,220
It's impermanent.

1226
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,220
Keith, you're-

1227
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,740
I'm just a fool.

1228
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,660
These, these riches are merely illusory.

1229
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,780
I look back at you, I'm like, I don't know why I'm even, I don't need to be here anymore.

1230
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:31,300
I don't, this was my job, but I don't need one anymore.

1231
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:37,420
And I look at Clark and I put my finger in my nose.

1232
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,580
We're going to have a hell of a life.

1233
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,020
Is that a Kanye reference?

1234
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,900
It wasn't, but yeah, now it is, yes.

1235
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,660
I need Thomas, Joe, and Justin to roll Sanity for me.

1236
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,460
Did you hear me say it's a one?

1237
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,460
Oh shit.

1238
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,980
Uh, 26 on a one.

1239
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,860
70 on a four.

1240
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,860
I passed mine.

1241
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,860
Okay, cool.

1242
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,860
As is tradition.

1243
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,860
Good for you.

1244
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,860
Good for you, Justin.

1245
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:08,300
Okay, so Clark, you're gonna lose your last Sanity.

1246
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,620
Can I play it out, or do you have something else?

1247
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,180
Yes, but real quick, John Lee Pettymore, roll a D4 for me.

1248
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,180
Please roll a four.

1249
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,180
Actually, roll a D6.

1250
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,180
No, fuck you.

1251
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:22,380
I've got a D4 in my hands, and I rolled a two.

1252
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,420
You can, I'm not taking your shit this year, Zach.

1253
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,420
2020.

1254
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,420
2020.

1255
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:33,900
2020, lose two Sanity.

1256
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,060
I'm at two and I'm doing fine.

1257
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,340
Yeah, you are, baby.

1258
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,180
You do run the shit.

1259
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,020
You do immediately start chanting numbers, however.

1260
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,420
Those aren't numbers.

1261
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,100
They might as well represent numbers, right?

1262
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,700
Joe, if you would like to fully lose your Sanity.

1263
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,700
I didn't have a big thing.

1264
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:58,540
I was just gonna wide-eyed look at Keith and say, can I help you carry some of those?

1265
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:03,780
I remove my finger from my nose and I offer it to him.

1266
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:09,140
I don't know what it means, but- I shove it up his nose and I hold my thumb

1267
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:13,100
like I'm shooting a finger gun and I...

1268
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:20,140
And a fat bump of cocaine goes straight up into your dome.

1269
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,260
Of real cocaine?

1270
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,460
Real cocaine, out of Keith Vigna's finger.

1271
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,420
Which the Patreon subscribers paid for.

1272
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:33,620
And in that exact moment, Clark Bishop's eyes go blank and he begins chanting,

1273
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:38,900
Ta-way alico, ta-way alico, ta-way alico, ta-way alico.

1274
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,420
He's feeling it.

1275
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,420
He's feeling it.

1276
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,220
I look over at John and Donovan and I'm like, he's feeling it.

1277
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,900
John leans into your finger.

1278
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:52,040
I am the universe experiencing myself.

1279
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,140
And I finger gun up into him as well.

1280
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,220
What's Donovan doing?

1281
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,100
Freaking the fuck out.

1282
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,340
Donovan, this is college, baby.

1283
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,340
This is college, baby.

1284
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:41,340
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

1285
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:52,340
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

1286
00:55:52,340 --> 00:56:04,340
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
