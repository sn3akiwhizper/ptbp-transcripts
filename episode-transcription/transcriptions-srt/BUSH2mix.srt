1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
This is yet another introduction to a show

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,460
that you listen to called, well it's broadcast live

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,460
from 694.2 PTBP and I'm your benevolent host

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,860
with the gross wolf the dog.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,340
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Ash

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,520
out of North Carolina who tweeted about the show

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,740
and tagged that pretending pod,

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,540
which is a nice thing to do.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,700
She writes, hey there, I don't have anything to promote,

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,300
just wanna let you know how much this show means to me.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,500
I listen every day while I'm at work

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,760
and it passes the time so fast,

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,000
my job feels almost inconsequential.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,220
Almost as if the atrocities I've committed don't affect me.

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,760
As if I can't hear the violent snapping of tendons

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,000
and viscera emanating from my monitor.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,900
A mere taste of the despair that lies

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,160
within the nightmare network.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,400
Shout out to my friend Gwen for showing me PTBP

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,940
and keep up the great work.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,840
Hmm, nightmare network?

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,240
Did you just try to sneak in promotion

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,980
for another media channel that isn't my radio station

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,120
on my radio station?

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,440
Hmm, I shall be contacting my lawyers.

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,440
They are definitely real and definitely will do law things

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,560
at you, for sure.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,080
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,120
tag us on the internet or fuck the zuck,

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,760
but preferably write us a five star review

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,040
on your podcast listening application.

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,860
Whichever way you choose, it's time for the news.

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,520
Last time we met Dr. Rusty Hooch,

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,040
the never missed scientist.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,720
They insist that she enlist, create an ocean of blue mist.

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,320
Her ex was pissed, you get the gist.

37
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,760
Dr. Olivia Miller, the sad single mom surgeon.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,560
Her daughter saw her dissect some sort

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,920
of a extra dimensional creature

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,080
out of a screaming woman's neck

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,200
and it shot into a sir's snot socket

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,160
who was promptly shot in the skull

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,000
by his sorrowful sidekick, full stop.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,840
Next, Doreen Maureen.

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,600
Scroll Pinterest on that iPad, that's a good haiku.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,960
Finally, the step motherfucker himself, the Chuckster.

47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,360
Coming in at five foot seven,

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,120
213 pounds of round muscle that is.

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,420
It's ball buster 420, hell yeah.

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,720
And he survived the holy suffocating,

51
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,240
holy decapitating tongue from hell.

52
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,480
Well, it's time for the briefing.

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,640
Yep, you can hear that creeping.

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,640
If your ears aren't leaking, it's Molly Healy with circles.

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,700
See ring star, deafening heaps.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,840
You don't know where you found it.

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,680
In this state, as your eyes fall short,

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,680
you better learn how to keep it.

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,720
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,120
I am here with the same people who are here

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,040
on episode one, part one of this story.

62
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,840
It is now part two.

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
Let's go around the room as well as the TV.

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Eleanor is on a TV on our kitchen countertop here.

65
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,040
We'll take a group photo at the end of this

66
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,520
with us and the TV.

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,200
That way we can all have a picture together.

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
Oh, that's right.

69
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,920
Oh, sorry.

70
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,400
And you can put up a picture of yourself.

71
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
Let me know when you want to take the picture

72
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,240
and I'll put up like some glam shots.

73
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,960
Yeah, perfect.

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,200
You sell it.

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,160
Ellie on the kitchen counter, the nudes.

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
No, okay.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,680
You guys, that's how you make money in this industry.

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,720
I've been trying, Eleanor, but-

79
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,520
Dude, more feet, more feet.

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,480
Oh, okay, yeah.

81
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,200
More feet in this audio podcast.

82
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,960
Oh no, they want to see it, they want to see it.

83
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
All right, let's go around.

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,320
Everyone, if you could just like say your name,

85
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,080
your character's name,

86
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,080
and then the worst thought you've ever had about your mom.

87
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
So let's start with Allie.

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
Ooh, can't wait.

89
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
My name's Allie.

90
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,160
My character name is Rusty Hooch, Dr. Hooch.

91
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,000
The worst thought I've ever had about my mom

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,240
is that I'm exactly like her.

93
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,080
Way to sidestep the question.

94
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Also, you don't have to answer that, any of you.

95
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,520
Jen, if you're listening, I love you, and she will.

96
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,360
Really?

97
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
Probably.

98
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,040
Interesting.

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,880
Hi, Jen.

100
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
My mom won't listen.

101
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,760
Lindsay, you're up.

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm Lindsay.

103
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,800
I play Doreen, Maureen, or Chlorine, or Boreen,

104
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,160
or whatever you want to call me.

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
First name, Doreen.

106
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,120
And the worst thought I've had about my mom

107
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,680
is probably that I based this character off of her.

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,400
And she won't be listening.

109
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,400
She will not even know that this exists.

110
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,800
I'm going to, what, Facebook?

111
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
I have Facebook here.

112
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,840
It's like, I'll tweet at it.

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,400
No, I'm probably not.

114
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,200
Because she definitely has a Facebook.

115
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,720
Pinterest.

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,240
Pinterest.

117
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,720
You can just DM her on Pinterest.

118
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,800
Slide into her Pinterest DMs.

119
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,840
That's the most definite way to get a hold of her.

120
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
Eleanor, who are you playing?

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,600
What's up?

122
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,480
Hi, I'm Eleanor DiLorenzo, and I play Dr. Olivia Miller.

123
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,800
And do you want to know the best thoughts

124
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,560
I've had about your mom, Zach?

125
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,200
Yes.

126
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,040
Yes.

127
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,000
OK, actually, I don't know anything about your mom.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
But what's her, never mind.

129
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,280
We're not going to go down this road.

130
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,720
You're going to dox my mom?

131
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,080
I'm not going to dox your mom, no.

132
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm sure she's a lovely lady.

133
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,800
Most American ladies I've met are super kind and sweet.

134
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,840
So I'm sure she's great.

135
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,640
My mom, on the other hand, what a, no.

136
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,200
She's the worst thought I've had about my mom is,

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,520
oh, shit, yeah, I don't know.

138
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,480
I feel like you can't talk shit about your mom

139
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,320
if you have a good mom, because moms are the best.

140
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,760
So I feel bad about even considering

141
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,960
like the list of awful things.

142
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,440
But so I'm thinking, I'm trying like, hmm, one time

143
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,840
she made like a pretty nasty chicken tikka masala.

144
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,400
So that's.

145
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,880
It sounds like you went through a lot of early life trauma.

146
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,920
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

147
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,560
So, yeah, that's the worst mom thought I've had.

148
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,640
And Taylor?

149
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,400
Hi, my name is Taylor.

150
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,120
My character name is Chuck Cheese.

151
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,280
Oh, yeah?

152
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,120
Charles Cheese.

153
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,960
Charles Cheese.

154
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,880
You're going with Charles the Chuckster Cheese?

155
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,840
Charles the Chuckster Cheese.

156
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,440
You can call me Chuck or the Chuckster.

157
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,920
What's your middle name?

158
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,560
Chuckster, Charles Chuckster Cheese.

159
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,640
Charles Chuckster Cheese.

160
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,240
OK, anyway.

161
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,880
My mother-in-law rules, so.

162
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,360
I will say, though, I've had time

163
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,760
to think about this because I was the last one to go.

164
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,560
And when I was a kid, I would walk to and from school

165
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,800
and elementary school.

166
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,760
And if I was mad at my mom, I would intentionally

167
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,560
step on all the cracks to break my mother's back.

168
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,680
Wow, violence.

169
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,600
Did she have back problems?

170
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,320
Yeah, actually, yeah, she had to get a breast reduction

171
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,960
because her boobs are so big it hurt her back.

172
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,920
You're making your mom's boobs bigger

173
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,160
by stepping on the cracks?

174
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,840
Yeah, every time it's like a Pinocchio.

175
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,040
They just grew and grew.

176
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,760
Apparently, my grandma had to do that, the breast reduction.

177
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,400
And I was like, give me those titties.

178
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
Literally, it happened in middle school.

179
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,720
And I had a lot of sleepovers as a kid.

180
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,400
And after my mom got the surgery,

181
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
any time my friend came over, she was like, look.

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,520
And just lift up her shirt and show her smaller scarred boobs.

183
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,440
Do they shape them?

184
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,760
Do they shape them?

185
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,280
They do.

186
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,880
So they look like perky nice titties, huh?

187
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,800
Yeah, she went from double Fs to perky Cs.

188
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
So Zach, are you really happy we're

189
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
talking about your mother-in-law's boobs

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,320
on your podcast?

191
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,880
Yeah, good.

192
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,320
What are your thoughts, Zach, about your mother-in-law's

193
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,820
boobs?

194
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,300
I was really prepared to answer that question

195
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,020
until you finished.

196
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,380
So my thought about mom's boobs.

197
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,020
You can talk about your own mom's boobs if that's easier.

198
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,700
Tell us about your own mom's boobs.

199
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,340
When I was 17, my birthday landed on Easter Sunday.

200
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,500
And so the whole family came over on my birthday

201
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,180
after church.

202
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,340
I'd been going camping with my friends a lot.

203
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,660
And so my mom got me a camping chair, a really nice one,

204
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,620
because I used to borrow their camping chairs.

205
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,980
This was her really nice way of being like,

206
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,700
stop fucking taking my camping chairs.

207
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,500
So she bought me my own.

208
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,780
And I was so stoked, actually.

209
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
I was like, this is rad.

210
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,340
This is great.

211
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,700
It's huge.

212
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,220
It was like a big one.

213
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,140
And she's like, yeah, it's oversized.

214
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,420
So it can actually hold up to 250 pounds,

215
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,340
which was pretty cool of her to say

216
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,140
to her very chunky young boy.

217
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,420
So happy birthday to you.

218
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,820
Self-conscious son.

219
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,940
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,500
It's called a captain's chair, right?

221
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,180
It is a captain's chair, extra large, oversized.

222
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,420
For oversized boys.

223
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,460
For oversized boys who are addicted to Mountain Dew

224
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,580
and White Rum.

225
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,180
All right, so let's dive into it.

226
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,020
Dude, Mountain.

227
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,900
Oh, right, actually.

228
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,420
I was going to tangentally about the topic.

229
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,140
I don't even know how to say tangentally.

230
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,020
You know what I'm talking about.

231
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,540
Tangent.

232
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,380
Yeah.

233
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,900
OK.

234
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,380
One more.

235
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:38,980
One more.

236
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,100
I want to.

237
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,060
One more boob.

238
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,060
No, no, it's not about boobs, but it's about cool women.

239
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,700
I have a cool story about my aunt.

240
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,340
Men in her family would take off their shirts very often

241
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,140
when it was in the summer months in Sweden,

242
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,820
because that's socially acceptable for men

243
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,420
to wear their boobs out.

244
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,180
But even at the dinner table, she's like,

245
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,540
please put on a shirt.

246
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,860
And they're like, fuck off.

247
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,700
Maybe not.

248
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,740
They didn't say that, but maybe something similar to that.

249
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
And so one day, she was like, OK.

250
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,580
And she's a 65-year-old woman, and she took off her shirt

251
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,020
and sat down to eat at the table.

252
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,740
And I'm like, that's my goal in life.

253
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,500
I want to take off my shirt.

254
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,220
So we should all take our shirts off?

255
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,940
Yes.

256
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,780
OK, great.

257
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
No one will know.

258
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,940
No one will know, guys.

259
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,940
It's an audio drama.

260
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,580
I don't know.

261
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,380
I don't know.

262
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,580
Maybe it will be funnier, just more vulnerable.

263
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,700
Just do sounds with taking your turn off.

264
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Make for better audio.

265
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,540
Vroop.

266
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,420
Vroop.

267
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,820
Skier.

268
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,060
Ding-dong.

269
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,020
Ding-dong-dong-dong-dong.

270
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,900
I get it.

271
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,420
I get it.

272
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,020
I understand.

273
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,780
All right, let's dive into this episode.

274
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,300
Yeah.

275
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,540
Y'all ready to play some Delta Green?

276
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,020
I think we got a pretty good introduction to your characters

277
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,220
in episode one.

278
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,740
The way in which the game works is now going to change,

279
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,460
because we're going to put you all in the same place

280
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,820
and then send you on a little mission.

281
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,620
OK?

282
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,220
OK.

283
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,980
OK.

284
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,500
All right.

285
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,060
Oh, no.

286
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,660
At least a year has passed since each of you

287
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,340
had your unnatural encounters that brought you

288
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,660
into Delta Green.

289
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,740
And here you are again, going into the field

290
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,780
with three strangers sitting in the back of a Sprinter

291
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,900
van turned into a mobile lab in the parking lot of a public park

292
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:39,580
with no cameras in Shreveport, Mississippi at 2,200

293
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,940
on a cold January night.

294
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,500
Anything to stave off the end of the world, right?

295
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,780
Your handler on this one is a bit dramatic.

296
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,420
Three years ago, this guy's just like talking with his hands.

297
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,260
He's super intense.

298
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,420
He's leaning into all of you as he talks.

299
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:04,020
Three years ago, Jerome Dyer left his job in Dallas

300
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,580
as an intelligence analyst.

301
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,420
During his second night at the opera, he left.

302
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,860
He abandoned his post.

303
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,940
And he joined a group called Bigfoot Underground Search

304
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,380
and Hunt.

305
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,940
He's been radio silent for three years until tonight.

306
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,180
Dyer made contact with a YouTube account

307
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:35,860
I run posing as professor and Bigfoot enthusiast Dr. Ann

308
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,900
Falsom.

309
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,460
And this guy looks super proud of himself when he says this.

310
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,380
Agent Dyer is desperately seeking extraction,

311
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,380
but not for him.

312
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,660
For a body, a big body, from an isolated cabin

313
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,820
in the thick, verdant hills of southwest Arkansas

314
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,460
near a small town called Fook.

315
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,980
I've pinned the location on these clean phones.

316
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,540
And he hands you each an older model iPhone

317
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,260
with various used cases on them.

318
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,740
The cases are so that the phone doesn't get shattered, Ali.

319
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,420
Wow.

320
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,180
Called out.

321
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,340
OK, OK, so I've gotten super into Bigfoot Underground

322
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,260
Search and Hunt while portraying this Dr. Ann Falsom.

323
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,220
And the origin story of their ringleader, Carl Lambert,

324
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,780
is fucking tragic.

325
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,700
Check this out.

326
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,060
When he was 14 years old, he went out

327
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,300
camping with his dad and his younger brother Michael,

328
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,740
who was 12 at the time.

329
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,460
So this Bigfoot sneaks into their camp in the night

330
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,140
and abducts the younger brother.

331
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,620
Carl and his dad tried to explain what happened,

332
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,060
but who's going to believe them?

333
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,460
Everyone just assumed the dad killed the boy

334
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,700
and pressured Carl into telling the Bigfoot story.

335
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,420
So dad decides he can't handle being

336
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,060
tried for his son's murder.

337
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,340
So he offs himself, which leaves 14-year-old Carl

338
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,700
with a very singular mission.

339
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,100
Find Bigfoot and kill it.

340
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,780
It's been three decades, but it seems like he finally did it.

341
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,620
So the operation, go to that point, go to the cabin.

342
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,020
Again, GPS marked in those phones.

343
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,620
They have cases on them, don't worry.

344
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,140
Secure the body.

345
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,020
Destroy any evidence.

346
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,060
We can't have, obviously, we can't have this getting out.

347
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,620
Agent Dyer is sabotaging the Wi-Fi and the cell networks

348
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,260
up there.

349
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,140
So Carl and Janice won't be able to post anything

350
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,780
unless they figure out what he's up to.

351
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,860
Oh, Janice Ruth, their third musketeer,

352
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,500
she's a conservation agent, mostly hunts down poachers.

353
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,740
She keeps her identity hidden from most

354
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,060
of the Bigfoot underground search and hunt fan base.

355
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,540
They'd probably deem her untrustworthy, right,

356
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,860
because she works for the man.

357
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,540
Bless you.

358
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,900
He takes another huge rip off of La Croix.

359
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,140
Ruth considers her bachelor's degree in zoology

360
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,540
essentially worthless compared to her countless hours spent

361
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,260
learning everything there is to know about Bigfoot ecology,

362
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,700
behavior, migration on the YouTube channels

363
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,180
of her perceived peers.

364
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,980
Shit.

365
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,380
Sorry, that's so much information.

366
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,540
He looks at his watch and waggles his eyebrows.

367
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:42,380
Dr. Anne Falsom, with quotes, should be getting on her way.

368
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,220
But that's one of you, obviously.

369
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,500
One of you has to be Dr. Anne Falsom when you get there

370
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
to secure the body, right?

371
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,460
Because I've told you that's the whole deal, right?

372
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,900
Real quick, do you guys have any questions?

373
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,740
I have a question.

374
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,220
Yeah.

375
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,300
What the fuck is going on?

376
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,300
Yeah.

377
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,980
We are dealing with a conspiracy theorist, I'm assuming.

378
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,020
Someone who believes in Bigfoot, and we're

379
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,540
here to look into a body.

380
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,620
I don't know what this could possibly be, obviously,

381
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,780
based on this description I was given.

382
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,620
Yeah, it's a Bigfoot.

383
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,340
OK.

384
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,340
Well, how about I make that call when I see what we see?

385
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,700
That's why we hired you guys.

386
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,300
That's why we got two of the smallest.

387
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,740
Oh, yeah.

388
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,460
Are you still going by?

389
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,020
The juxtaposer.

390
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,500
Yeah.

391
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,380
So honored to be in the presence of such righteous ladies.

392
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,780
Fuck.

393
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,020
Very.

394
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,860
So what's your expertise, Chuckster?

395
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,820
Well, you see, I've seen a lot of battle in my day,

396
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,860
fought a lot of not-so-good guys,

397
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,060
and I'm here to keep you ladies safe.

398
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,740
Yikes.

399
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,980
All right.

400
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,860
Dr. Miller taps, absent mindingly,

401
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,060
her revolver she has in her pants,

402
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,860
stuck to the top of the way in her pants because she's like,

403
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,500
guess I will be protecting myself for the rest of the day.

404
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,540
Dope gun.

405
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
What's the range on that?

406
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,620
Can I hold it?

407
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,780
Isn't that like sharing a glass of water?

408
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,220
I mean, we just met.

409
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,300
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

410
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,020
I understand.

411
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,660
I understand.

412
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,900
We all got our weapons.

413
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,860
Dr. Miller has no idea what a range is.

414
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,620
Or is that Ellie, who has no idea what?

415
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,780
I know nothing about guns, but.

416
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,020
I don't either, literally.

417
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,620
OK, good.

418
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,020
All right, 22 miles.

419
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,220
For people who've listened to pretending to be people before,

420
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:36,060
normally when someone's like, I pull out my M6942K AK-47

421
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,540
silencer laser pointer, I'm like, all right, yeah,

422
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,740
that's a gun.

423
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,340
So roll for shooting a gun.

424
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,060
That's me.

425
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,460
Some Delta Green people are super

426
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,260
into that side of Delta Green.

427
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,980
I'm all for that, but I don't know any of it.

428
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,580
So therefore, I'm not super into it.

429
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,020
So gun, shoot, pew pew.

430
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,940
Doreen is like somewhere in between the Chuckster

431
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,140
and the intelligence of these two doctors.

432
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,860
So she's just kind of taking it all in.

433
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,580
She knows that she, as an agent, has more capability

434
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,340
than the Chuckster, but is not going to say anything.

435
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,500
It's just going to be, you know, she'll let the Chuckster think.

436
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,460
Chuckster is just raw confidence.

437
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,540
That's what he works on.

438
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,780
And that's fine.

439
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,820
That's fine with Doreen.

440
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,140
Doreen can be our audience stand-in for just looking

441
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,820
back and forth between these two groups,

442
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,380
these intelligent doctors.

443
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,020
She's also just constantly looking over her shoulder,

444
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,180
assuming she's going to see children somewhere.

445
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,540
So not that good.

446
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,460
Anyone want a brewski?

447
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,540
I keep them in my refrigerator pack pant pockets.

448
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,020
You see, I invented a mechanism you can put in pants

449
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,020
with their insulated pockets and ice packs

450
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,620
so I can always keep my beers cold.

451
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,780
What's your name again?

452
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,980
I think maybe you'll just want to call me Charles.

453
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,220
All right, Charles, it is 6.30 AM.

454
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,380
If you can please get that.

455
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,140
It's late at night.

456
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
It's 2,200.

457
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,820
It is literally 6.30 AM.

458
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,140
It's 10 PM.

459
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,940
Get that brewski away from me.

460
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,980
It is party time.

461
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,060
I understand, I understand.

462
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,900
Doreen takes him up on the offer.

463
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,220
Dr. Miller is very intrigued.

464
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,860
She's like, a wearable fridge.

465
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,460
That could be quite useful, actually, in terms of,

466
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,620
we will, in order to keep certain vaccines cold.

467
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,980
Happy to share my pants with you.

468
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,900
All right.

469
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,940
Well, for now, let's keep the pants on, Chucky.

470
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,260
And maybe I'll take you up on that offer later.

471
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,460
We'll see how tonight goes.

472
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,580
OK, I'm now uncomfortable.

473
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,220
So I'm going to get the fuck out of here.

474
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,100
You guys need to get going.

475
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,500
They expect Ann to be, Dr. Falsom, sorry,

476
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,900
to be up there soon.

477
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,940
So whoever wants it can have it.

478
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,860
And he throws down four IDs on this table.

479
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,820
And you're in a Sprinter van, right?

480
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,860
But it's been transformed into a lab in the back.

481
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,180
So there is almost like an ambulance.

482
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,540
There's going to be a stretcher in the middle.

483
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,500
So you guys are kind of sitting on either side

484
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
of this stretcher.

485
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,420
And he slams down four IDs.

486
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,460
They all say, Dr. Ann Falsom, they

487
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
have each of your pictures on.

488
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,780
So he's like, your choice.

489
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,260
Whoever wants to take lead on it can do it.

490
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,340
But I got to get out of here.

491
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,460
My number is in those clean cells, right?

492
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,220
So once you have the body, shoot me a call.

493
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,220
The second location that's in those phones,

494
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,380
GPS, is going to be the drop off point.

495
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,620
So I've got a warehouse.

496
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,700
I'll meet you there after the mission is up.

497
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,900
So I have all the faith in you that I should.

498
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,860
You're very intelligent.

499
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,940
You're very capable.

500
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,700
He looks at two different groups when he says those things.

501
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,100
And that'll be it for me.

502
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,380
I'm going to get going.

503
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,900
And he kind of opens up the back doors of this Sprinter van

504
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,820
and walks off into the parking lot, presumably

505
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,740
to be picked up.

506
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,700
He turns back around.

507
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,700
And he's like, oh, yeah, OK, bye, yep, all right.

508
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,740
Bye, bro.

509
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,620
OK, yep.

510
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,260
See you, man.

511
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,740
All right.

512
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,940
And he finally just turns back around.

513
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,740
You hear a truck start on the other side of the parking lot.

514
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,220
And it swings by and picks him up.

515
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,860
And the truck heads out.

516
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,060
You are now, the four of you, alone,

517
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,300
I mean, with three strangers, in the back

518
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,940
of this converted mobile lab slash mobile ambulance

519
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,700
kind of thing that just looks like a standard Sprinter

520
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,620
van on the outside.

521
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,740
So I'm a pretty dank actor.

522
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,260
But I don't know that I'm so much the doctor type.

523
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,020
So maybe someone wants to take lead on being that doctor.

524
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,380
I think, clearly, I need to be the one to do this.

525
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,660
None of y'all can handle it.

526
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,420
You do seem real right smart.

527
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,820
And I like them bangs, girl.

528
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,820
I am a lesbian.

529
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,980
Stay away from me.

530
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,540
All right.

531
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:17,700
Hey, Ellie, Eleanor, I'm going to ask

532
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,780
Allie to explain something real quick.

533
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,620
What do you even mean, Zach?

534
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,580
Well, I'm just curious about a couple of things.

535
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,780
Do you want to explain kind of your thought process

536
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,060
going into creating a character for being on the show again?

537
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,540
Yes, so this is my third time on the show.

538
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,140
First time I played a straight man.

539
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,740
The second time I played a closeted lesbian.

540
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,860
At the time, I was identifying as straight.

541
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,220
I am now playing an out lesbian and am an out lesbian.

542
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,380
But you're manifesting pilot this time, right?

543
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,380
So I'm going to be a pilot next.

544
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,820
But the funny thing is there was a time in the middle

545
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,620
where I was like, I cannot believe how problematic it is

546
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,540
that I, as a straight woman, played a lesbian on that show.

547
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,460
That's so terrible.

548
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,900
And now it's fine.

549
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,980
It's actually the only reason she became a lesbian.

550
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,420
There's a cover for that.

551
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,100
That's my testimony from being on pretending to be people.

552
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,940
I became gay.

553
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,140
I love it.

554
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,420
What have you guys done for the show?

555
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,620
Anyways.

556
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,660
OK, so back into the Sprinter van, the back of the van.

557
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,980
You guys have this information.

558
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,740
You know that it is called Bigfoot Underground Search

559
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
and Hunt.

560
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,660
The ringleader's name is Carl Lambert.

561
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,900
The other two people helping out

562
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,300
with Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt

563
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,740
are Janice Ruth, who is a conservation agent

564
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,860
and Bigfoot expert,

565
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,500
and an undercover Delta Green agent named Jerome Dyer,

566
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,820
who has been in the field now for three years

567
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,540
working with this group.

568
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,540
So clearly, he saw something early on with him

569
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,580
that showed him, I need to stick with these people

570
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,060
and make sure nothing crazy happens because they

571
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,540
seem to be onto something.

572
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:14,340
So Dr. Rusty Hooch picks up this ID

573
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,340
that's got her face on it, her bangs,

574
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,700
and the name Dr. Ann Falsom.

575
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,220
So hold on.

576
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Are the rest of us playing pretend characters?

577
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,180
You can be anyone you want.

578
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,860
You can present yourselves as whatever kind of team

579
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,580
you would like.

580
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,340
But this is just a way to get through the front gate,

581
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,140
if you will, a way to get in the door.

582
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,700
So Dr. Ann Falsom's credentials are she is a, sorry,

583
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,660
medical doctor?

584
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,780
And Bigfoot enthusiast, who has been posting she,

585
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,380
quote unquote, this hand letter as Dr. Ann Falsom has been

586
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,740
posting comments and DMing back and forth with the Bigfoot

587
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,220
Underground Search and Hunt YouTube page.

588
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,860
So they're going to trust her immediately.

589
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Yes, because she would be the obvious first choice

590
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,820
to call upon finding an actual body

591
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,900
so that they can have someone who

592
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,060
is respected, quote unquote, in the field

593
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,140
to present their discovery.

594
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,060
What are the skills they would expect from this Dr. Falsom,

595
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,980
whatever her name is?

596
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,300
They want her to come in and be like, yes, this is Bigfoot.

597
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,860
They want her to probably name it scientifically, right?

598
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,860
And then just be there standing, like a product that

599
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,380
is for sale, but no one wants to buy it.

600
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,180
So they have a doctor come on the screen and be like,

601
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,300
I'm a doctor.

602
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,900
So Dr. Miller agrees that a rusty hooch can take on the role

603
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,260
as this pretend doctor and say, I'll

604
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,780
be your second in command then.

605
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,060
I'll support you.

606
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,620
Are we like med students?

607
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,180
Yeah, we're part of the team.

608
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,740
I think to make it more believable,

609
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,380
maybe just say we're med students like first year,

610
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,260
like here to offer hands.

611
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,940
Yeah, that sounds good.

612
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,820
Dr. Hooch is pretty, she's having

613
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,220
a lot of mixed emotions right now

614
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,580
because she grabbed the ID because she's really

615
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,940
feeling like she's surrounded by idiots,

616
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,020
except for Dr. Miller, who she's extremely intimidated by.

617
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,860
And it's pretty clear that Dr. Miller is smarter than me.

618
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,980
So that's why she chose to grab that ID first.

619
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,540
But she is getting a little anxious about it

620
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,940
now because she actually doesn't believe in Bigfoot

621
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,980
and has no idea what she's about to get into.

622
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,580
I wonder if Dr. Miller senses that.

623
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,020
And she's just like, no, show us the way.

624
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,620
I'm sure it will be fine.

625
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,260
And then like, rinse.

626
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,140
She grins and can see like her teeth,

627
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,140
like in a very predatory way, like.

628
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,980
Who's driving?

629
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,820
I'll drive.

630
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,860
Damn straight.

631
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,740
Dr. Miller, may I call you Olivia or Liv

632
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,500
or the Livmeister?

633
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,220
Like what terms are we on here?

634
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,220
Dr. Miller is fine, thank you.

635
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,180
You guys are on a 50-minute drive from Shreveport,

636
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,540
Mississippi, all the way up into the fucking

637
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,660
boonies of Arkansas.

638
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,820
So when you guys are driving through Arkansas,

639
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,300
it is late at night.

640
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,300
You're coming up on, let's see, 2230, 2330.

641
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,140
So it's around 11.15 PM.

642
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,740
You're 15 minutes out from the destination.

643
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,740
And you're driving through the mountains

644
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,620
and you're driving through the mountains

645
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,100
You're 15 minutes out from the destination

646
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,860
and you start hitting windy turns deep into the woods.

647
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,340
You haven't seen a gas station or any business

648
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,140
in 10 minutes or so.

649
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,580
And you're not sure that there's anyone,

650
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,140
any business that is further into these woods.

651
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,100
Every once in a while, you'll see a small house

652
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,820
or a trailer deep kind of hidden in the woods

653
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,420
on either side of the road,

654
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,660
that is it's like a archway of trees and thick branches.

655
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,380
So you can barely even make out the night sky above you.

656
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,860
You're in a part of the country where you'd feel

657
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,220
fairly uncomfortable if this Sprinter van

658
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,980
were to break down.

659
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,380
Yeah, I've been in those parts of Arkansas.

660
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,140
Well, cool, I have not.

661
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,260
Your GPS is getting closer and closer.

662
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,500
And as you get toward it,

663
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,060
you're starting to lose cell signal.

664
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,740
And you remember that your handler mentioned Jerome Dyer,

665
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,940
Agent Dyer was sabotaging the cell signal up here

666
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,460
so that no photos or videos of this body

667
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,900
that they've taken can get out.

668
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,580
So as you're losing signal,

669
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,540
your dot begins to just kind of float

670
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,180
and there are no more roads on the screen,

671
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,500
but you can kind of make out where you are

672
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,500
in relation to where the dot that you're headed toward is.

673
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,660
And eventually you see a mailbox in the darkness,

674
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,820
your headlights lighting it up.

675
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,660
And there's a road that leads off to the left gravel road

676
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,460
with a gate, a red metal gate.

677
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,580
Y'all, I'm so sorry, but we got to go back.

678
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,820
I actually need cell service for another hour.

679
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,700
We got to go back, I'm sorry.

680
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,620
There's something I got to check on.

681
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,620
What do you got to check on?

682
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,340
It doesn't matter, it's my own personal business.

683
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,780
We just got to go back for,

684
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,140
can we just come back in an hour?

685
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,300
I mean, these people have been out here, what, three years?

686
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,740
They can wait another hour.

687
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,940
I think Rusty's keeping secrets from us.

688
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,820
Doreen who is driving does not say anything

689
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,980
and just keeps driving.

690
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,580
It's like solid as a rock.

691
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,780
Oh my God, Doreen is drunk from the beer she drank.

692
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,860
We're letting a drunk driver take us to this gate.

693
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,340
If you want me to drive, I could drive now.

694
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,280
That'd be fine.

695
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,940
Rusty, maybe you and I can have a side adventure.

696
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,780
You and I can walk back together, find that cell service.

697
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,620
If you look at me one more time.

698
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,660
Maybe become best friends.

699
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,220
I swear to God, I will break your neck.

700
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,140
Man, damn.

701
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,100
Fasty lady.

702
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,660
I don't know, I like that.

703
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,260
Dr. Miller is just staring out through our window,

704
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:33,300
listening to Chucky and Rusty going back and forth

705
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,700
and then she's like, we could be as quick as possible

706
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,740
so we can get back as soon as possible,

707
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,860
but I think we should head on.

708
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,140
I mean, we're here on a mission.

709
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,660
I know they've been out here for three years,

710
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,260
but I've seen some things to worry

711
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,380
that there might be more of an emergency.

712
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,900
I just want to take a look at it

713
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,220
and then I'll make sure that you get back in time

714
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,260
for whatever phone call it is that you have to make.

715
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,420
Dr. Hooch is extremely intimidated

716
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,140
by the doctor and concedes.

717
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,100
Oh, you know, by the end of this,

718
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,340
I think we're going to be best friends.

719
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,380
I sure hope so.

720
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,980
Chuckster, you noticed that there is a file

721
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,340
that is sitting on the counter space,

722
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,260
you know, next to one of the chairs here

723
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,500
in the back of this mobile lab.

724
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,980
And when you pop it open,

725
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,740
it's got a little bit more information about the mission,

726
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,380
including a code for the gate.

727
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,300
Hey, look, I found this file here

728
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,380
and it seems like it's got a bunch of information.

729
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,620
Maybe even has a code to the gate.

730
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,060
Has your voice changed?

731
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,220
It's very possible.

732
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,140
I think you went pretty hard Southern

733
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,500
after going pretty hard, like excited bro.

734
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,780
It's going to wander where it wants.

735
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,300
Don't expect consistency in any manner from me.

736
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,620
I love it so much.

737
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,780
When you got into Mississippi and Arkansas,

738
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,420
you started code switching super hard.

739
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,620
I just want everyone to be comfortable.

740
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,740
Yeah, you're just, you're basically conforming

741
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,860
to where we are a little bit, yeah.

742
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,900
It's also just where every accent goes

743
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,180
when I try to do an accent.

744
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,300
I just have the one.

745
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,260
I snatched the paper from Chuck

746
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
because I say, give me this.

747
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,220
You don't, you probably don't even know how to read.

748
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,060
Let me see this.

749
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,340
Yeah, you write after, I'm not very smart man.

750
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,140
I'm not very smart man.

751
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,220
This is the gamer guy who is like,

752
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,900
just stoked to be like, hey, what up, what up?

753
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,500
How you living like?

754
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,180
Just because I'm confident doesn't mean I'm combative.

755
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,180
I respect these ladies, these smart ladies.

756
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,940
Honored to be in their presence.

757
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,100
Dr. Miller is like, I'm going to die.

758
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,260
And so she starts writing down on her cell phone

759
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,380
without cell service.

760
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,780
She's starting to write down a note for her daughter.

761
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,860
So just like, if I don't survive,

762
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,100
you can take like, there's the money in this account.

763
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,500
And then your asshole father has the rest of the money

764
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,300
stashed away somewhere else.

765
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,100
She knows she's not going to survive this.

766
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,020
Doreen asks for the code.

767
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,460
She reaches back and grabs another beer.

768
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,900
She's just stressed.

769
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,180
She grabs another beer out of the pocket of Chuckie's pants

770
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,380
and just chucks the whole thing right there.

771
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,060
As you pull up to this gate,

772
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:30,260
you see it's an alpha numerical keyboard

773
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,100
that you're looking at.

774
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,740
It literally looks like an old,

775
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,300
like Macintosh keyboard from like 09

776
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,660
that is like the clear blue,

777
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,980
colorful keyboard that is like almost duct taped

778
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,460
to a stick that's been shoved into the ground

779
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,180
and there are wires coming out of it

780
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,340
and then going down toward the ground.

781
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,260
And then you kind of see the wires above ground

782
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,900
going toward this big rusty red gate.

783
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,860
The code is Bush.

784
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,060
Well, it's Bigfoot underground search and hunt.

785
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,660
They call themselves Bush.

786
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,660
Doreen takes a huge sigh

787
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,380
and then leans her whole upper body out of the window.

788
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,060
Do you want to do that?

789
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

790
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,300
Oh, it took a long time to hit that H, huh?

791
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,300
Doreen is, she might be a little bit above the-

792
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,140
A little faded.

793
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,540
Yeah, she's a little faded.

794
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,180
That's okay, she's capable.

795
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,340
As you type in the H, the gate slowly begins to-

796
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,180
Beeee!

797
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,020
Beeee!

798
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,100
It finally stops.

799
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,540
In an open position.

800
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,340
God damn it.

801
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,780
And then you-

802
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,620
Yeah.

803
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,460
The gate is open.

804
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,300
Let's do this.

805
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,300
Ahead of you is the same kind of thing

806
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,660
where there are trees climbing on either side

807
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,100
and then meeting above the driveway.

808
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,060
It's a long gravel driveway that goes uphill

809
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,700
and then seems to make a slight dogwood left

810
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,860
where you see that there's a clearing

811
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,860
and lights are coming from a small one room

812
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,340
corrugated sheet metal type just room

813
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,300
that has been laid on maybe not even a legit foundation.

814
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,900
So is this like a shack, like a big-

815
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,260
Yeah, it's a big shack.

816
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,220
Okay.

817
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,740
And then it's like shoddily put together

818
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,180
so there's like light coming through cracks.

819
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,620
Yes, that is exactly right.

820
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,460
Yes.

821
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,300
All right.

822
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,420
And there's one streetlight that like,

823
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,380
it looks like they might've literally stolen

824
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,380
a public streetlight and then moved it up by this shack

825
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,300
and the light is shining down on a truck

826
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,620
that is sitting up there.

827
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,100
Were we given anything in the van?

828
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
Oh, there's shitloads of stuff in the van.

829
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,940
Okay.

830
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,780
Weapons.

831
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,340
Not so much weapons as just like lab equipment,

832
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,020
anything you might find in an ambulance.

833
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,860
I like to, because you're up against

834
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,620
such insurmountable odds,

835
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:32,100
I wanna give you everything you need to try to fight back.

836
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,620
So anything that you think of that could be in there

837
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,900
is probably in there and that's just a nice way

838
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,460
to know that you're fucked.

839
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,940
Dr. Mill almost automatically starts scrubbing up

840
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,980
like if there's any protective gear, masks,

841
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,660
anything of just like assuming that they're gonna go

842
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,420
into a fucking shit show of, I don't know.

843
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,540
She's very paranoid at this point.

844
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,420
And she's assuming that all these dumb asses

845
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,620
will do the same but then she realizes maybe

846
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,020
that none of them are doing it

847
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,260
or I don't know what they are doing

848
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,580
but she's just like, oh, perhaps we should,

849
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,580
like she's trying to be polite but then like, oh no.

850
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,500
Yeah, you kind of point at the three other hazmat suits.

851
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,340
I'm just like opening drawers and not closing them

852
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,220
and like opening cabinets, like rifling through.

853
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,580
Like, what's this?

854
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,540
Oh, dope.

855
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,100
Doreen is just like rolling her eyes at Chucky

856
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,020
and like grabbing her weapons that she just of course

857
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,220
has on her as an agent and just putting them

858
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,180
in the back of the van,

859
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,740
getting ready to put the hazmat suit on

860
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,420
and Chucky is just staring with his mouth open

861
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,140
at all of the weapons she has.

862
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,460
And then she just is staring back at him

863
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,260
while she's slowly pulling up her hazmat suit.

864
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,500
Oh, dude, I think you and I are gonna be BFF-les.

865
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,820
We got some fortune comin'!

866
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,140
What's the L?

867
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,980
Liver.

868
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,180
Pretty sure.

869
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,860
It's best friends. Pretty sure.

870
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,900
I think it's liver.

871
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

872
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,900
You wanna see my weapons?

873
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,380
I can show you.

874
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,740
I got throwing stars.

875
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,580
I think it's time.

876
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,180
I pull them out and then they're engraved.

877
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,660
I have C.

878
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,500
C.

879
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,260
Oh my God.

880
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,100
Oh my God.

881
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,700
What's my last name?

882
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,820
Oh, C.

883
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,660
Cheese.

884
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,500
Cheese!

885
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,300
Okay, change my mind.

886
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,020
Engraved in each of them is just like-

887
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,860
Just cheese.

888
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,700
A cheddar.

889
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,300
It says CCC and then under it there's-

890
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,380
A block of cheddar.

891
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
Yeah, chunk of cheddar.

892
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,220
Yeah.

893
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,780
It's very good.

894
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,180
Please just keep those in your pants.

895
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,300
Don't pull those out, please.

896
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,580
All right, all right, I understand.

897
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,700
Dr. Hooch is very preoccupied with Dr. Miller at this point

898
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,980
and she's really fascinated by how professional she's being.

899
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,220
So she is sort of trying to imitate it,

900
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,980
immediately starts putting on a hazmat suit as well,

901
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,140
also starts putting on gloves and things.

902
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,220
And she's still in the backseat,

903
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,780
but she's like kinda leaning forward

904
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,060
so that Dr. Miller will see

905
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,220
that she's like taking it seriously now.

906
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,700
Ooh.

907
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,540
Dr. Miller smiles a little bit to herself

908
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,580
and then she turns around to the other two.

909
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,900
He's just like, whenever you're ready,

910
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,300
we shall have Dr. Hooch lead the way.

911
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,140
Dr.

912
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,420
Dr. Anne Hooch.

913
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,300
Actually- Dr. Anne.

914
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,140
What's your name? Falsom.

915
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,980
What's your name?

916
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,820
Falsom.

917
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,940
Anne Falsom. Falsom.

918
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,740
F-A-L-S-O-M.

919
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,940
Oh, right, no, Dr. Falsom, sorry.

920
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,820
Dr. Falsom, sorry, I forgot.

921
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,140
You're such a famed Nobel Prize winner,

922
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,540
so you did cure happiness, whatever.

923
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,740
I've cured- I've cured-

924
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,380
Mad pal disease.

925
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,740
Which is the cause of sadness.

926
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
Very true.

927
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,260
I start putting on my hazmat suit.

928
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,780
I don't know how well it can be one of these doctors,

929
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,660
these medical students,

930
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,940
so maybe you guys could teach me some terms.

931
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,500
I know the word scalpel, and-

932
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,140
Scalpel.

933
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,020
I know the word liver,

934
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,220
and what other doctor terms could I know?

935
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,660
Dorian's like, I think we should just both

936
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,860
keep our mouth shut.

937
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,500
Now that's exactly what I was gonna propose too.

938
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,060
How about Dr. Anne Falser, Falsom?

939
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,700
You do the talking. You look at the ID again.

940
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Dorian helps Chuck put on his hazmat suit

941
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,300
because he gets his hands-

942
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,540
He gets his arms tangled,

943
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,180
since somehow both arms are in one arm hole.

944
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,020
Dorian is starting to find Chuckie a little bit endearing.

945
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,900
She's kind of like, okay, I'll take care of you.

946
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,740
Pat, pat.

947
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,740
Does he remind you of your whippet?

948
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,860
He kind of reminds me of my whippet, yes.

949
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,580
This is pretty useless.

950
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,700
She's like, I don't want my dog on this trip.

951
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,860
I might as well just take care of this kid.

952
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,180
I start mimicking, she's Pavlov to me,

953
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,460
and I start like,

954
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,740
Good God.

955
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,780
Dr. Miller walks up to Chuck.

956
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,460
If there is any weapons, do we have weapons there?

957
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,620
You said you would give us anything, right?

958
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,460
Oh yeah, what do you find?

959
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,740
I would like to find an automatic rifle,

960
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,740
or something that deals a lot of damage

961
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,300
that Chuck would know how to use.

962
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,140
Yeah, absolutely.

963
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,260
I also have my go pack, so I'm ready.

964
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,180
I got my pistol, I got my knuckle busters,

965
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,940
my throwing stars, and my switchblade.

966
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,660
If you want to find something

967
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,580
that has a little bit more firepower,

968
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,140
then there is a rifle in the back.

969
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,780
I think Dr. Miller finds something,

970
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,900
but she is not able to herself use it,

971
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,700
and so she walks over to Chuck, and it's just like,

972
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,060
now listen to me carefully, boy.

973
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,540
If you see something, if you see something,

974
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,500
stop panting, it makes you look dumb.

975
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,180
Sorry, ma'am.

976
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,100
It's okay.

977
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,900
If you see something, I want you to not think,

978
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,780
I want you to shoot, okay?

979
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,020
The door opens.

980
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,340
Oh God.

981
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,740
Not that, don't shoot that.

982
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,260
I look confused.

983
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,740
If you see something that you might find strange,

984
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,700
and might attack, I don't know if the other two

985
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,740
will be able to do it,

986
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:30,380
but I guess with your quick reactions and presence,

987
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,220
I'm sure that you will be the quickest to act.

988
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,220
Whatever terrible thing we're gonna see in there,

989
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,860
I wanted to not leave this room.

990
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,620
Chuck harkens back to his short-lived military days,

991
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,380
and really likes having a leader tell him what to do,

992
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,140
so he stands in line, mission ready, and says, yes ma'am.

993
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,620
You better be ready, Dr. Miller.

994
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,340
He's gonna piss in your bed.

995
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,180
Yeah.

996
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,740
And she's like, oh God, what have I done?

997
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,060
I start to pull a beer out of my refrigerator pants,

998
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,820
and Dr. Miller slaps it out of my hand.

999
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,260
Maybe, if she wants to.

1000
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,300
Oh, hell yeah.

1001
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,220
Or she's like, perhaps later, perhaps later.

1002
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,620
Yes, yes ma'am, yes ma'am.

1003
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,500
Let's go, yes ma'am.

1004
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,660
And she taps his shoulder a little harder than necessary,

1005
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,020
but I'm thinking like maybe he likes the roughness.

1006
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,860
Yeah, and then he does a little burp.

1007
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,540
Okay.

1008
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,860
You truly are a child, like a young infant child.

1009
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,780
Y'all, I got a question real fast before we go inside.

1010
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,780
Oh my God, this could just keep happening forever.

1011
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,700
The getting ready stage.

1012
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,740
Do you think that Dr. Anne Falsom

1013
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,780
should have a British accent?

1014
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,500
I just wonder if they'll believe me more.

1015
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,540
The front door opens.

1016
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,500
It's a metal door of this metal corrugated shack,

1017
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:58,020
and walking out backwards is seemingly Carl Lambert.

1018
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,620
He is in his early 40s, and he is slightly overweight,

1019
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:06,740
severely balding, wears a dirty tank top,

1020
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,180
and as he's walking backwards,

1021
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,700
his love handles on either side

1022
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,060
are kind of jiggling with each step as he walks backwards,

1023
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,020
and as your eyes go up to the top of his head,

1024
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,100
he has a makeshift headband, like a t-shirt,

1025
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,660
like a ratty old t-shirt that's been ripped,

1026
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,620
and is now tied around his head.

1027
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,420
He is talking to the camera that is being run

1028
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,300
by seemingly Janice Ruth, and then behind her even,

1029
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,180
you see a man, you can assume this is Agent Dyer,

1030
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,660
and he is kind of a small, thin man

1031
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,820
wearing big, thin-rimmed glasses,

1032
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,340
and Carl Lambert is talking directly to the camera,

1033
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,260
and he's like,

1034
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,540
welcome to another Bush product.

1035
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,300
Hey, what up, Bushheads out there?

1036
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,620
Everybody wants to come on down,

1037
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,420
and we got something big for you.

1038
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,580
I know we say that a lot,

1039
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,500
and if we get a knock on the wood,

1040
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,380
or if we get, I mean, the other day,

1041
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,100
when we had that knock, I swear to God,

1042
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,780
that is what the, I'm getting ahead of myself.

1043
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,700
We are going to meet with the one,

1044
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:21,460
the only, Dr. Anne Falsom today.

1045
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,460
You've seen her comment on the messaging board,

1046
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,140
and you know what she's been up to,

1047
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,380
and you know that she is the only one

1048
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,060
we would call if we were to,

1049
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,060
and then he gets right up into the camera,

1050
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:37,060
and he's like, actually find and kill a big fight.

1051
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,940
It happened!

1052
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,380
Yes, I am so excited for you.

1053
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,940
Smash that like and subscribe,

1054
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,580
comment below when you see this thing.

1055
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,540
All right, now, let's talk Dr. Anne Falsom here,

1056
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,140
and let's get into the thing going.

1057
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,100
And he turns around,

1058
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,500
camera is still coming towards you guys,

1059
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,900
and you can kind of hear from behind his weird growl,

1060
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,660
you hear this camerawoman is just kind of like,

1061
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:08,460
hmm, hmm, hmm, just kind of like breathing heavy,

1062
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,260
you know, just your normal camera person

1063
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,300
who has something like wheezing in her throat constantly.

1064
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,540
So if you were to watch Bush videos,

1065
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,660
then you would be hearing that in the background

1066
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,300
pretty much the whole time.

1067
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,300
And she brought her team!

1068
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,980
He's looking, Carl is looking back and forth

1069
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,500
between all four of you to see kind of who steps forward.

1070
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,700
Very frazzled, Rusty quickly decides

1071
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,980
to go for a British accent, steps forward.

1072
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,980
Chuck steps forward with her, and then she pushes him back.

1073
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,980
I shove Chuck back in his place.

1074
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,660
Hello, my name is Dr. Anne Falsom.

1075
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,660
Aw, yeah, and you can even tell how smart she is

1076
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,940
because the way she says words nice.

1077
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,860
Hey, Dr. Falsom, it is an absolute pleasure

1078
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,260
to finally meet you on camera.

1079
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,220
That's correct, it is.

1080
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,700
Are you channeling Joe Rogan right now?

1081
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,660
I'm sorry, go on.

1082
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:12,980
No!

1083
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,740
I've never, I haven't seen him since Fear Factor.

1084
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,180
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1085
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,780
You're not a rogue head?

1086
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,580
I don't know, is that true?

1087
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,540
I'm a Bush boy.

1088
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,220
Doctor, doctor, doctor,

1089
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,300
I know that I said that I promised you a body,

1090
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,260
and what I have is, I guarantee you,

1091
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,940
and he looks again at the camera,

1092
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,980
the first taken and held and killed corpse

1093
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,380
of a Bigfoot that's ever been found, ever,

1094
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,220
and we've got it here.

1095
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,300
Dr. Falsom, what are your thoughts on the situation?

1096
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,460
First of all, I don't want to be on camera.

1097
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:00,060
His eyes turn to pure sadness,

1098
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,380
and he kind of pushes the camera away.

1099
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,140
But I thought you were a fan.

1100
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,220
I prefer to keep my identity private,

1101
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,780
and my team as well,

1102
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,460
and I will be the judge of whether or not this is a Bigfoot.

1103
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,540
Everybody roll alertness.

1104
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,220
I got a five.

1105
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,580
Oh, what is your alertness?

1106
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,420
20%.

1107
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,820
Oh, then that is a success.

1108
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,060
For rolling rules, if you're new to Delta Green,

1109
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,740
if you roll under your skill, then that is a success.

1110
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,300
So you want to roll as high as possible without going over.

1111
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,460
Price is right rules.

1112
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,420
If someone's trying to steal something from you,

1113
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,860
like in this instance,

1114
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,420
they would want to roll higher than you

1115
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,620
in order to succeed.

1116
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,100
So what did you roll, Taylor?

1117
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:43,940
A 43.

1118
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,780
On a?

1119
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,620
On an 80.

1120
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,100
Oh, so that is a success as well.

1121
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:47,940
Yeah.

1122
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,460
Eleanor, what did you roll?

1123
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,540
An 11, alertness 20, so.

1124
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,300
And your dice match.

1125
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,500
Yep.

1126
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,340
And it's under.

1127
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,140
All right, so that's our first critical success.

1128
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,980
So we have our first critical success.

1129
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,820
Yay!

1130
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,740
Ooh, all right, nice.

1131
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,740
Nice.

1132
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,900
Not that it matters, but Lindsay, what did you roll?

1133
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,700
Well, I did crit fail.

1134
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,540
Oh my God.

1135
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,420
Those beers hit her hard.

1136
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,500
The beers, yeah.

1137
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,900
And I'm also just so paranoid.

1138
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,700
I think I just like don't want to be here at all,

1139
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,500
but I also really, this is the only thing I'm living for.

1140
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,060
There's a lot inside of you.

1141
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,860
It's a mixture of me and my mom in real life.

1142
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,580
Okay, so with that being said,

1143
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:37,580
let's take a quick pause because Discord is messing up.

1144
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,020
You want me to whistle a song?

1145
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,180
Yeah, I'd love that.

1146
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:44,340
What was it called?

1147
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,420
It's called a little jig.

1148
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,860
A jig.

1149
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,860
That's beautiful.

1150
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,060
A little jig, yes.

1151
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,540
A wee little jig.

1152
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,740
I shush away, but ever jigging me.

1153
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,860
Oh God.

1154
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,500
I should have gone with that for my dog accent.

1155
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,340
I just want to say,

1156
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,700
if ever given the opportunity to have more than one accent,

1157
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,540
I will take it.

1158
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,260
The last time I got to play a fucking shit.

1159
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,780
Zach, you're doing a great job.

1160
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,420
I'm losing my mind.

1161
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,060
You're doing such a good job.

1162
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,820
Thanks guys, I appreciate that.

1163
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,660
Quiet on set.

1164
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,220
Hello.

1165
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,620
Hello.

1166
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,020
Lindsay, during Marine,

1167
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,220
because of the critical fail, roll sanity.

1168
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,060
Damn it.

1169
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,540
Yeah.

1170
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,740
Come on, you stupid ass.

1171
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,460
Jesus Christ, Doreen is down that ladder.

1172
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,220
We have a crazy person in our midst.

1173
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,340
Seven.

1174
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,580
Oh, success.

1175
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,380
While this whole conversation is happening

1176
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,140
about whether or not Dr. Anne Folsom

1177
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,980
is going to be on camera or not,

1178
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,940
you turn around and you see yourself

1179
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,180
in the reflection of the driver's side mirror

1180
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:06,540
of this sprinter van and a chill runs down your spine.

1181
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,660
And right when you think you're about to hear laughter,

1182
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,220
you're almost fucking expecting it at this point.

1183
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,900
Nothing happens.

1184
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,100
And you're just staring at yourself in this reflection.

1185
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,300
And it's honestly probably the first time in a minute

1186
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,820
you've been able to just hold eye contact with yourself.

1187
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,500
And it kind of feels good to see and be seen individually.

1188
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,340
With your critical success, Eleanor,

1189
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:34,740
Dr. Olivia Miller is the only one who notices

1190
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,620
that Janice Ruth, oh, she's still filming.

1191
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,340
She may have pointed the camera away from Dr. Anne Folsom,

1192
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,660
but she did not stop recording.

1193
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,060
All right, yeah, no, I understand, I understand.

1194
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,420
It's just that I really thought you were a fan.

1195
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:51,860
And I thought that the whole point of you coming out here

1196
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,420
was gonna be that you were going to be on camera

1197
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,060
talking about the body.

1198
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,420
Well, we're talking about science.

1199
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,460
So I need to step inside and take a look at the situation

1200
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,860
before I allow anyone to record anything.

1201
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,100
Okay, so can we try this again?

1202
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:10,340
But it's just me, but then I'll let you see the body.

1203
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,740
And then after that, then you'll be on camera.

1204
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,180
I don't know, I need to be let inside.

1205
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,980
You're wasting our time.

1206
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,620
Nice.

1207
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,580
Roll persuade.

1208
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,220
Please.

1209
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,260
I got a 94 on a 20.

1210
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,300
I mean, I suppose, can't Dr. Miller step in?

1211
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,180
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1212
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,500
Especially since Dr. Miller critically succeeded

1213
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,540
and notices that Janice Ruth is still recording.

1214
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,220
So you can use that kind of maybe as leverage here.

1215
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,460
Excuse me, Dr. Anne Folsom did say specifically

1216
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,980
that she did not wanna be on camera.

1217
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,780
And yet I see that you're still recording.

1218
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,060
Is that how we're going to work here?

1219
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,660
Is that what we do as friends?

1220
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1221
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,980
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't notice.

1222
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,380
And she's like fumbling her thumb for the record button.

1223
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,140
She's like, I really, I didn't know.

1224
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,660
Are you all right?

1225
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

1226
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,340
Can I roll like a first aid or something

1227
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,420
to see what the hell, like see what's going on with her?

1228
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,380
Yeah, absolutely.

1229
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,500
You can roll a first aid.

1230
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,300
First aid or is that, does that make sense?

1231
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,820
Maybe not first aid, but like medicine, medicine.

1232
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,180
Yeah, medicine works, yeah.

1233
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,780
Whichever one you have more of.

1234
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,260
52 on a 60, so who?

1235
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,340
Ooh, nice.

1236
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,700
So you would know that Janice Ruth has health issues,

1237
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,180
specifically maybe some untreated asthma.

1238
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,260
Okay, so this is not something to be that worried about.

1239
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,700
No, she's just very stressed out and excited.

1240
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,660
And she's also really worried seemingly

1241
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,920
that she did something bad.

1242
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,540
You're getting onto her, which she's not used to.

1243
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,700
And she's just like, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1244
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,660
It's okay.

1245
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,580
I was just trying, I was just trying.

1246
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,820
Calm down, just calm down.

1247
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:00,300
So you see her click it off and the camera's off.

1248
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,940
All right, all right, yeah, come on in, come on in.

1249
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:08,820
We've just been doing, you know, some photo shoots,

1250
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,420
I guess, with the body.

1251
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,100
It's actually laying on the pool table.

1252
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,580
So come on in.

1253
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,620
And you see, as you guys are turning back

1254
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,160
and looking at this one door shack,

1255
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,960
one room, one door, corrugated metal room.

1256
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,980
Jerome Dyer, this small thin man

1257
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:31,700
wearing these large glasses with thin frames

1258
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,540
is just kind of leaning up against the corrugated metal

1259
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,340
next to the door.

1260
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,220
Hello?

1261
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,120
Who are you?

1262
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,520
Jerome, you can just call me Jerome.

1263
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,960
You know me, Bush, Dr. Anfalsom.

1264
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,080
Yes, I do know you very well.

1265
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,780
You both fucking wink at each other,

1266
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,280
like enormous winks, like huge winks.

1267
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,840
Oh, I know who you are.

1268
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,680
And then I'm like, no, shut up, shut up.

1269
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,520
Oh, right, right, right, right.

1270
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,020
And then I just put a fist out.

1271
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,640
He like taps on it with one finger

1272
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,100
and is like testing one, two.

1273
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, nice to meet you.

1274
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,260
That was so dope.

1275
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,580
This guy's funny.

1276
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,700
I just walk inside, cause I'm over the bullshit.

1277
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:22,600
I'm coming with her.

1278
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,660
Everybody going inside?

1279
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,500
Yeah, I wanna see this thing.

1280
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,340
Chuckster.

1281
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,160
Chuckster.

1282
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,000
You going inside?

1283
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,540
Hell yeah, bro.

1284
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,380
There he is, there he is.

1285
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,820
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna waver between country boy and.

1286
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,180
It just depends on who's talking to you.

1287
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,340
Chuckster, the code switch king.

1288
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:48,140
All right, so you guys all need to roll sanity.

1289
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:48,980
Oh, fuck.

1290
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,820
I got a 41 on a 56.

1291
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,860
That is a success.

1292
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,020
I got a 54 on a 56.

1293
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,860
That is also, the doctors have succeeded.

1294
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,080
I got a 10 on a 60.

1295
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,620
Also a success.

1296
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:10,940
52 on a 40.

1297
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,780
Oh no.

1298
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,540
And there's the fail, there's the fail.

1299
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,540
This is not what you were expecting

1300
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,300
and it's also not good.

1301
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,740
So even though you passed,

1302
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,860
the three of you who rolled under your sanity

1303
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,420
still lose one sanity.

1304
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,380
Chuckster.

1305
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,200
Yep.

1306
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,300
No article for you this time.

1307
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,140
You.

1308
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:33,960
Serious.

1309
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,600
You are going to roll a D4,

1310
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,480
which is the pyramid.

1311
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,940
And then you are going to add one

1312
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,320
and you are going to lose that many sanity.

1313
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,200
Four.

1314
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,000
Rolled a, rolled a big old four.

1315
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,160
So I lose five sanity, I'm now at 35.

1316
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,000
Jesus.

1317
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,440
There's a thing that happens in this game

1318
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,320
when you lose five sanity.

1319
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,480
As you guys all know,

1320
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,160
and pretending to be people when you lose one sanity,

1321
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,960
you have to do a shot of hard liquor

1322
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,000
when you lose two to three sanity,

1323
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,360
you have to rip a bong,

1324
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,000
and then anything past that,

1325
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,360
you have to do a fat line.

1326
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,440
Ellie, if you'll open the package that we sent you.

1327
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,240
I was like, I'm trying to lose some sanity.

1328
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,080
Yeah, but also guys,

1329
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,220
you have so much money,

1330
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,120
like being able to send cocaine.

1331
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,920
It's what all the Patreon money.

1332
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,760
When you lose five sanity in Delta Green,

1333
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,800
what happens is that you have a temporary break from reality

1334
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,120
in which you react in an uncontrollable way.

1335
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,240
So you are either going to fight, fight.

1336
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,380
What did I say first?

1337
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,220
Fight.

1338
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,040
Fight.

1339
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,880
Fight.

1340
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,720
Or fight.

1341
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,720
What I was wanting to do was I'm frozen,

1342
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,680
but I'm just going cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

1343
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,760
Okay, normally you would roll,

1344
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,720
but I think that that's really funny.

1345
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,280
So we're going to go with that.

1346
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,120
You can kind of like look at the face.

1347
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,600
I think the camera is just hitting the face

1348
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,720
of Charles Chuck, the Chuck Steer Chuck,

1349
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,520
as he's doing cool, cool.

1350
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,200
And then the camera kind of slowly pans around

1351
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,360
until we can see what all of you are looking at,

1352
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,200
which is this corpse that is on the pool table laid out.

1353
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,200
This corpse is not the corpse of a Bigfoot, however.

1354
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,720
It's a child.

1355
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,880
It's a wrinkled corpse of a child,

1356
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,320
completely covered in dark purple bruises.

1357
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,980
Seems to be a preteen.

1358
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,300
This thing is riddled with holes

1359
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,580
from 12 gauge shotgun slugs.

1360
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:01,460
Blood has been pouring from these holes onto the pool table,

1361
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:06,460
which has a tarp down that the blood is pooling onto.

1362
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:10,140
And this bruised body just sits lifeless.

1363
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,200
For those of you who only lost one sanity,

1364
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,920
you see the eyes of Carl Lambert

1365
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,780
as they fill up with tears.

1366
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,220
Michael, what the fuck?

1367
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,380
For a moment.

1368
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,220
Oh, that's the end of the episode.

1369
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,060
What?

1370
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,880
I want to say, hooch is in deep.

1371
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,300
Amazing.

1372
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,380
Fine, I'll save that joke for later.

1373
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,020
Maybe for not this scene.

1374
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,380
Dear God.

1375
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,320
Wow.

1376
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,220
Shit.

1377
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,140
That was really cool.

1378
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:57,980
So that's the end of episode two.

1379
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,100
That was really cool, thank you.

1380
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,580
Thanks for playing.

1381
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:06,580
For, I was not sure if that was what they knew was there

1382
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,900
until the Carl Lambert moment.

1383
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,180
And then I was like, fuck.

1384
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,020
I have theories.

1385
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,740
Maybe I'll save it for air,

1386
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,100
but I have theories of what's going on.

1387
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,600
See rings of deafening people.

1388
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,020
You don't know where you found it.

1389
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,200
In this state as your eyes fall short,

1390
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:35,040
you better learn how to keep it.

1391
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:57,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1392
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,900
Clasp your fist over all the blood.

1393
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,620
Water leaks through your fingers.

1394
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,300
You're standing in a swirling flood.

1395
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,480
And only darkness leads you.

1396
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,860
Ooh.

1397
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,080
Falling fast into deep abyss.

1398
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,880
Till it tears you out again.

1399
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,960
Find your feet on your broken bones.

1400
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,160
Clear out the edge again.

1401
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

1402
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

1403
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

1404
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

1405
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

1406
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,120
You're standing in a swirling flood.

1407
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,960
You're standing in a swirling flood.
