1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Greetings.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,600
Introduction.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,760
Transition.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,320
694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,920
The good numbers.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,160
The radio station is... somewhere.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,840
Wolf the dog is... here.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,320
There is nothing to fear.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,440
Maybe.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,920
We have fans.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,760
They shouted us from the void.

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,520
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Bundad Elliot,

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,400
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,280
Which you should also do.

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,760
Bundad Elliot writes,

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,000
Wolf, I need your help.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,720
You travel through myriad realms and unknown plains

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,920
and maybe you know how I might escape.

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,880
The bunnies that were once my pets

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,120
now hold me within a liminal space.

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,960
Doors folding in upon themselves.

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,080
The eldritch forms of these furry fiends

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,200
have been revealed to me.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,640
They keep me fed and clothed,

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,520
but I am captive nonetheless.

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,200
All because I wouldn't give them banana chips.

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,240
I have slipped this message through a crack in the wall.

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,120
I hope you find it.

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,480
P.S. Please send banana chips.

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,520
Oh damn, you met those guys?

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,480
Tell those fun buns ol' Wolfie says hello.

32
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,560
Enjoy your stay.

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,520
I'm sure they won't be keeping you there for too long.

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,720
Humans live what, a couple hundred years or so?

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,400
Ah, you'll be fine.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
I will not be sending you banana chips

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,320
because I do not believe in them.

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,080
I will not conform and I shall not obey.

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,360
If you wanna write up something for your wolf

40
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,880
tag at pretending pod on Instagram fuck Mark Zuckerberg

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,240
at pretending pod on Twitter fuck Jack Dorsey

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,240
fuck Elon Musk or pretending to be people on Facebook.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,800
Another fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,320
And if you wanna be the very best,

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,120
like no one ever was,

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
go ahead and write up a five star review

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
on the podcast app of your choice

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,080
and let us know.

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,400
We love that shit.

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,120
But if you're keeping your love of 694.2 PTBP

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,640
a dirty little secret from your online friends and family,

52
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,200
you don't wanna post about how much you love this show.

53
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,200
You don't wanna wear our six shirts, hats, and fanny packs.

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,000
You don't wanna dry off with a towel from Splashylvania.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,880
Well, that's all fine.

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,240
You can confidentially support us

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,480
at patreon.com slash pretending pod

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,880
and for even $5 per month,

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,240
you'll get access to 33 bonus episodes.

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
And what's that?

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,560
I'm hearing there is more on the way.

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,760
What more can I say?

63
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,840
The links are in the show notes.

64
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,840
All right, I got through what I needed to.

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,320
And now it's time for me to read the news.

66
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Last time Beck Wilder was impaled by a DIY Jackalope

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,920
with a yellow ribbon tying the mundane antlers

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,920
to the standard rabbit to create the mythological beast.

69
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,080
While watching Stevie witness Fox God'll twitch

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,440
and convulse at the side of headphones,

71
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,280
Cal realized that she was very likely Faith Godell,

72
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,880
the oldest child of Fred Godell

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,960
disguised as the production assistant.

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,600
The medical staff at Grover's Gorge

75
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,040
showed up in a bullpen car

76
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,000
to pick up the Gord camera operator.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And on the way to the lab,

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,280
the group saw another makeshift Jackalope.

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,920
This one with a purple ribbon, Fox Godell,

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,640
who Stevie says went by Greg before,

81
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,520
quickly grabbed the ribbon, popped it in his pocket

82
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,240
and promptly fucked off back to his Godell innovation zone

83
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,640
or jizz, if you'd like, and I do.

84
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,720
In the lab, the medical staff says

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,520
they can treat Beck's wound here in the same room

86
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,640
as the interview with the mayor.

87
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,240
The mayor, an old beat up damp box turtle

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,200
called Sandro.

89
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Taking us now to this quirky and riveting news story.

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

91
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,600
My life is great and it's all my fault

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Cause my life is great and it's all mine

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault

94
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,600
On the tree subreddit right now it was like,

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
I joined thinking this was actually about trees.

96
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
Where's the real tree sub?

97
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
And I knew that the one about trees

98
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,040
is called marijuana enthusiasts,

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,920
but I didn't, there's some other ones that I didn't know.

100
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,400
World politics is anime titties

101
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,240
and anime titties is world politics.

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,080
And John Cena is about potato salad

103
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,840
and potato salad is about John Cena.

104
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,040
Oh my God, nice.

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,640
Oh, also I knew this one, but Super Bowl

106
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,440
is actually about superb owls.

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,320
So I didn't know this one.

108
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,040
There's an Amish subreddit.

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,560
It has 175,000 members and no posts.

110
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I fell on a jackalope.

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Oh, good call dude.

112
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Holy shit.

113
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,240
Whoa, look out.

114
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,880
Fell on a jackalope.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,600
Damn, I remember watching those videos for the first time

116
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,760
when I was like probably in the sixth grade.

117
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,360
I have no idea what you're referencing.

118
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,640
Guy on a buffalo.

119
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,480
Whoa, look out.

120
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
I still have no idea what you're referencing.

121
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,960
I haven't seen Guy on a Buffalo.

122
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,160
I guess I haven't seen Guy on a Buffalo.

123
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,960
Is it one of those like two girls, one cups kind of videos?

124
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,160
Cause I haven't seen any of those.

125
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,320
The guy fucks a buffalo.

126
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,160
Yeah.

127
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,720
Like donkey man.

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,640
Donkey man.

129
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,720
We've already done this.

130
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
Mr. Hands.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,840
Donkey man.

132
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,560
Let's not do this.

133
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,400
Okay.

134
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,240
Thanks.

135
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,560
We'll do it afterwards though, for sure.

136
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,400
No, we'll forget.

137
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,440
So yeah, we're talking to a turtle.

138
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,720
We were, yeah.

139
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,760
So what are we doing?

140
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
So we're talking to a turtle?

141
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,440
So we're talking to the turtle.

142
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,720
Can news get a big old scoop with the mayor of this town?

143
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
Turns out, turtle.

144
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,000
Sandro.

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,840
Sandro.

146
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,960
Sandro the turtle.

147
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,880
Sandro.

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,800
Sandro.

149
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I put a microphone on the turtle's shell and...

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,360
Cal, pat your back and he's like,

151
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,280
way to step up for a back buddy.

152
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,760
Mr. Mayor, could you spell your first and last name?

153
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,920
The makeup artist is kind of like laughing

154
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,760
and she looks up and is like, you got him?

155
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,080
And then she kind of walks away and heads out the door.

156
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,440
Says you got him to us?

157
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,880
To Julius, who's standing there.

158
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,560
Cal leans into Stevie again.

159
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,000
So does turtle, can it talk?

160
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,120
Exhales real big, looks you dead in the eyes.

161
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,640
Kinda.

162
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,320
What do you mean kinda?

163
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,040
Beck did not expect the word kinda.

164
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,400
It's a whole thing, okay.

165
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,640
Like two taps for yes, one for no.

166
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,880
And one of the medical people kinda,

167
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,920
we're gonna be right back with the equipment that we need

168
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
to take care of this.

169
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,280
Should only take a couple minutes.

170
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,920
And they head out to the front door.

171
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,640
Word, no hurry.

172
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,200
And as they head out the door,

173
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,280
you see a 58 year old man standing there.

174
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,760
He's got bright blue eyes and a face lined by the sun,

175
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,160
which is topped by a flat top of salt and pepper hair.

176
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,200
He's Uncle Strong.

177
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,520
Like he could bench 250 pounds,

178
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,360
but he gets winded.

179
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,200
Oh, that's not his name.

180
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,040
I thought.

181
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,280
He's Uncle Strong.

182
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,120
I was like, okay, is he a turtle's uncle?

183
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,680
He just looks like he could bench 250 pounds,

184
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,600
but he also looks like he gets winded

185
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,400
going up a flight of stairs.

186
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,920
This is Chuck Bidwell.

187
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,520
He says, as he introduces himself.

188
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,960
Hey, how's it going there?

189
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,080
It's Chuck Bidwell.

190
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,320
It's nice to meet each and every one of you.

191
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,160
I'm the mayor.

192
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, I'm not the mayor.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm kind of the mayor.

194
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Shout out to Anthony from Bristol, UK for Chuck Bidwell.

198
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Or up.

199
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,840
Yeah, Chuck Bidwell.

200
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,040
It's a pleasure to meet each and every one of you.

201
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,240
Oh, it looks like you've had a bit of a rough and tumble

202
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,360
goal of it so far, Mr. Camerman, sir.

203
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,640
Fell on a jackalope.

204
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,360
As he looks at you, guess what happens?

205
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,440
Oh, wait, wait, wait, Zach, Zach.

206
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
I think I can guess.

207
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,360
He's wearing a green dry fit polo

208
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,640
tucked in kind of over his belly.

209
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,600
Hog?

210
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
Yes.

211
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,960
And he kind of zones out for a moment

212
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,960
and you see into Chuck Bidwell's deepest, saddest soul

213
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,640
of a face and then with just a half a second,

214
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,920
he's right back to normal.

215
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Hey, how's it going?

216
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,040
Chuck Bidwell, yeah.

217
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,880
What's your name?

218
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,720
What's your name?

219
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,120
Julius Summers.

220
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,480
Julius, Mr. Summers.

221
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,320
Nice to meet you.

222
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,160
And you, sir?

223
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,200
Hey, Beck, it's Beck Wilder.

224
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
Beck Wilder, what happened to you, son?

225
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
I fell on a jackalope.

226
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,920
I fell on a jackalope and I don't think I survived.

227
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,240
Oh, oh, he pats you on the shoulder

228
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,680
and he's like, he looks at the other two.

229
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,840
Did he kill it?

230
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,960
No, no, I'm sure it's fine.

231
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,240
And what is your name, sir?

232
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Chuck Bidwell here.

233
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,560
Cal Colorado, City Action News.

234
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,080
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Bidwell.

235
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,160
Oh, right, you're the Cal Colorado

236
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,640
who has come to do all the wonderful interviews

237
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,200
and show off Grover's Gorge for the beautiful town

238
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,520
that it is, that's right, okay.

239
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,480
Well, we've got you set up over here, of course.

240
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
You know, with the mayor, Sandro, if you met Sandro,

241
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,160
I'm not the mayor, I happened to lose.

242
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,320
I lost the election there.

243
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Oh, so Sandro was able to participate in an election?

244
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,160
Well, yeah, but he does get elected every time.

245
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,960
How long has he been the mayor?

246
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,000
He's been the mayor since almost the beginning, yeah,

247
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,360
since the founding of Grover's Gorge.

248
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,920
And he'll always be the mayor?

249
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,600
Well, seemingly, seemingly for sure.

250
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,240
I mean, I lost by 836 votes.

251
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,600
What is the voting age here?

252
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,400
Voting age is 18, like everyone else.

253
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
We're in America, aren't we?

254
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,840
Well, that's an interesting question.

255
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,360
You were the mayor, perhaps?

256
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,880
Well, I'm not the mayor, I wish I was the mayor.

257
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,520
I mean, the only two votes I even got

258
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,000
were from me and my wife, Barbara,

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,280
kind of honestly, if I'm being completely honest,

260
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,200
she pushed me into running.

261
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,960
I'm being totally straight with you.

262
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,520
Yes, you're not the mayor in title,

263
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,200
and yet you have all the responsibilities of the mayor.

264
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,040
Is that correct?

265
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, speaking of those responsibilities,

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,600
them responsibilities is why I was so late.

267
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,280
I'm so sorry that I didn't greet you at the gate.

268
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,360
That is my deepest and searest apologies.

269
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,440
I'm so sorry.

270
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,280
Isn't it funny that a turtle is running for mayor?

271
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,680
Oh, I like this kid, you don't have him on camera yet.

272
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,720
Oh, you writing the jokes for this old man over here?

273
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,400
That is very funny, I'm going to say that.

274
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,000
It's all yours, Cal.

275
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,800
The turtle is a turtle.

276
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,640
Right.

277
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,400
At this point, you've walked away from the turtle.

278
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,240
No, I think we're standing right by it.

279
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,640
I've got my eye on it, it's not really going anywhere.

280
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,960
Okay, we're all kind of bunched up

281
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,120
in the same area then right up the front.

282
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,560
The medical staff comes in and starts treating Beck

283
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,800
while you guys are having this conversation.

284
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
Hey there, whoa, precious cargo now.

285
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,080
They have some sort of machinery

286
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,640
that you haven't seen in a hospital before,

287
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,040
and they begin attaching it to Beck's backside

288
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,960
and upper thigh.

289
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,560
I instinctively say, Beck, get a shot of that.

290
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,600
But then I realized.

291
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,920
But Beck is trying to,

292
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,400
whatever weird positions they put him in,

293
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,480
he's holding the camera,

294
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,200
trying to get footage of this new machine.

295
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
You still have the camera?

296
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Yeah.

297
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,560
When he does that, Julius, yeah, grabs the camera,

298
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,240
trying to still keep the shot.

299
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,340
You feel some resistance.

300
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,840
Everybody roll alertness for me real quick.

301
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,200
I'm going to burn my dice, if that's cool with you.

302
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,840
I got a 27, I pass.

303
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,280
And you're at a negative 20, Cal.

304
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,600
Yeah, doesn't matter, 73 fail.

305
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,200
Got an 87 fail.

306
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,920
Julius, as you've walked away,

307
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,760
you actually notice that similarly to the way

308
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,400
that the glass kind of rose from the grass below

309
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,640
on the first floor, letting you through the entrance

310
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,000
into this building, the glass on this room, the window,

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
opens in a similar fashion.

312
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,440
Chuck sees that you notice and you look down

313
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,120
and see that he's got a little clicker in his hand.

314
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,480
Oh, I thought it'd be nice that way

315
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,920
there's no glass behind the shot.

316
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,560
We get a beautiful, perfect view

317
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,140
of the city park right behind.

318
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,360
Oh, like a remote.

319
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,680
I thought you meant like he's clicking

320
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,320
to see how many times I noticed things.

321
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,160
I'm like, what the fuck, man?

322
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,440
I was like, I'm taking that away from him.

323
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,280
You're like, what's the count?

324
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,780
I see.

325
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,440
Chuck, that's, thank you, incredible.

326
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,920
I wouldn't have even thought to ask.

327
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,760
Yeah.

328
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,280
Can you do it to, I mean, you don't need to,

329
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,840
but can you do that to all the windows in this building?

330
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,360
Yeah, isn't that amazing?

331
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,840
It's an absolutely incredible laboratory that we have here.

332
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,680
It's beautiful.

333
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,640
And that controls all the doors as well.

334
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,480
Yeah, I mean, the door is the window,

335
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,280
the window is the door, am I right?

336
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,680
You'll see here, and he points behind him

337
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
that there aren't really any doors inside here.

338
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,960
There's just kind of open doorways.

339
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,440
Julius is going to bookmark that information

340
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,520
and definitely gonna try to steal that at some point.

341
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,480
How's the machine, what's it doing to me now?

342
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,620
They've got a machine that kind of wraps around.

343
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,980
It's almost like a heating pad, but on the inside of it,

344
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,340
there is some sort of technology

345
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,740
that you haven't seen before.

346
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,320
It kind of looks like a light almost,

347
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,080
but they can fold this piece of machinery around you.

348
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,640
It's easily foldable around the back of your leg.

349
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,320
And when it's on, you just kind of feel this sort of heat,

350
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,480
a nice vibration, you get hard.

351
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,960
You guys gotta try this.

352
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,800
Beckworth, you're at work.

353
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,400
Do you remember those old school machine things

354
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,520
that would do this for weight loss?

355
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,560
Oh yeah, just kind of like pulsate your muscles.

356
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,400
It was a band around.

357
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,380
No, it was like a band that just went like,

358
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,220
okay, it's wrapped around you.

359
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,800
Like just putting his hand at the side

360
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,480
and then waving them wildly.

361
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,880
I know, in my mind, this makes sense.

362
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,720
Anyway.

363
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,040
I'm kind of talking to a medic person near me.

364
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,280
I've never seen this before.

365
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Is this like some like new medical issue thing?

366
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,600
You tell me and they pull it off and you look behind you

367
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,040
and you basically don't have wounds anymore.

368
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,760
Beck is making wide,

369
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,800
like he's looking at where the wounds were

370
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,320
and then looking at Cal and then looking at Julius

371
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,640
and then looking down at the leg that is now healed.

372
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,420
Yeah, and you feel like there's some slight cuts, right?

373
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,300
Where the holes were not even sutured back together,

374
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,580
but where they came back together,

375
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,220
they're not completely healed.

376
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,500
One of them goes, oh, it didn't actually,

377
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,380
didn't work all the way, but that's okay.

378
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,920
It should heal up naturally from here

379
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,960
and you should be able to walk

380
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,680
and they kind of hold your hand and lift you up out

381
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,620
and you do, you feel much better

382
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,180
as you gain back two hit points.

383
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,320
You're only one away from full health

384
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,700
and you can walk on this leg pretty easily now.

385
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,060
Doctors, is that gaudal technology?

386
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,540
So with everyone paying attention

387
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,380
to the gaudal technology here.

388
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,980
Yeah, the turtle's dead or something, right?

389
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,860
Yeah, for sure.

390
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,680
They help Beck up out of the bed.

391
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,520
Oh no.

392
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,780
Well, it's okay, they can just put him in the thing.

393
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,860
Go ahead and roll alertness at a negative 40.

394
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,860
The turtle's gonna fall out the window.

395
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,580
Yeah, I've failed miserably.

396
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,420
I mean, I have 40 alertness, so I'd-

397
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,780
Oh yeah, ouchy, ouchy.

398
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,700
Cal is still looking at his in astonishment

399
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,540
at the healed wounds.

400
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,340
The camera looks behind this group

401
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,300
staring at this incredible technology

402
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,300
as this turtle is swaying back and forth on its stool.

403
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,260
I just wanna say right now,

404
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,940
we did not put that turtle on that fucking stool.

405
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,380
This is a gaudal company mistake.

406
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,140
Teeter, totter, teeter, whoop, teeter totter turtle die.

407
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,320
Chuck Bidwell looks up and goes, oh my God.

408
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,300
And you see the turtle going over the side

409
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,420
along with the stool, boom, off the side of this building.

410
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,380
The open window door thing.

411
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,580
Oh, fuck.

412
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,640
None of this is on us.

413
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,200
From the quick glimpse we got,

414
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,220
did it look like the turtle was doing that on purpose?

415
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,020
Because you weren't able to get a quick glimpse,

416
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,100
you're completely unable to roll.

417
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,340
Human, animal, turtle-ant?

418
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,180
Turd-ant.

419
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,800
Turd-ant.

420
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,900
Yeah, we just hear the cries of the onlookers.

421
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,860
Literally, suddenly you hear a squoosh.

422
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,620
From your second tier in the lab.

423
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,380
And then you just hear this, oh my God.

424
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,800
Oh no, holy shit, oh my God.

425
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,300
Sandro, no, Sandro.

426
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,220
Sandro, where's Sandro?

427
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,380
Our town is leaderless.

428
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,900
Why do animals keep dying around me?

429
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,980
Everyone roll.

430
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,100
Beck, you were much farther away from this turtle.

431
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,980
I'm not even joking, I'm not using these dice anymore.

432
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,800
That's an 88.

433
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,640
Again.

434
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,300
Oh my God, dude.

435
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,660
Have you rolled an 88 or did?

436
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,740
Yeah, I rolled an 88 earlier.

437
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,900
I don't think I've rolled under a 70 something all night.

438
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,300
Wow, that would be great

439
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,820
if we were playing some different game.

440
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,860
I got a 21.

441
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,840
Beck, you know what, it's a critical fail,

442
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,280
so you're gonna lose four grip, the full D4.

443
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,120
Oof-da.

444
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,440
What are you at and what's your breaking point?

445
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,840
I'm at 68 with a breaking point of 60.

446
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,400
Luckily, grip was what Beck was good at, so.

447
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,240
Nice.

448
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,360
He's taking a lot of hits though.

449
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,200
Yeah.

450
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,660
This is not a normal day for him.

451
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,640
You've said that a couple times now, I think.

452
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,480
This is not a normal day.

453
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
I don't know if it's a human roller

454
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,400
just looking at their faces,

455
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,640
but Howard's like, I assume Chuck has his own reasons

456
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,160
for whatever his reaction is,

457
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,340
but just a normal medical staff,

458
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,680
seeing the mayor throw themselves off the thing.

459
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,480
Why are you entertaining this?

460
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,480
They placed a turtle on a stool

461
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,920
in front of an open fucking window.

462
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,160
But I mean, are they like in tears

463
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,840
like their great leader has died

464
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,760
or are they just like, oh shit.

465
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,640
No, they're mostly super, super confused

466
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,320
and they are at a loss for what to do now.

467
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,540
I need you all to roll grip.

468
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,380
Failed.

469
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,200
Pass.

470
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
This might be why you said to do this,

471
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,920
but Julius for sure was still had that clicker in mind

472
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,960
and was like, oh fuck, he did this.

473
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,880
Interesting.

474
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,720
Joe.

475
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,040
97 baby with brand new dice, sir.

476
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,760
Joe's rolling bad tonight.

477
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,840
Thomas, go ahead and remove your headphones real quick.

478
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,360
I need you both to roll a D8 and add one.

479
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,440
An eight plus one is nine.

480
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,640
Holy shit, dude.

481
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,160
That's a four, so a five.

482
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,400
So you're gonna lose five.

483
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,620
Holy shit.

484
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,520
Beck wild there.

485
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,740
Julius Summers, you lose nine grip.

486
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,740
And that puts me past my breaking point.

487
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,740
As you both see a wet energy erupt from the spot

488
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,040
where the turtle just teeter tottered to its doom

489
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,160
and this wet energy flings itself

490
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,780
into the body of Chuck Bidwell,

491
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,520
throwing him back through the wall

492
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,720
on the far side of this room.

493
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,300
And it is a glass wall and it shatters.

494
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,880
Holy shit.

495
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,180
Holy shit, Zach.

496
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,520
Now, if you don't mind,

497
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,500
if I could talk to you each one at a time, Luke first.

498
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,500
This wet energy that you see just for a glimpse,

499
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,660
you just catch enough of it to get some semblance

500
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,760
of like what it looks like, what it moves like,

501
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,320
how it reacts to things around it.

502
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,520
Like very short split second as this thing flies past you.

503
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,560
So I'm gonna let you ask three yes or no questions

504
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,740
to kind of try to decipher what this thing is like.

505
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,720
Okay, everything has a shape,

506
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,440
but did it have like a, not like human shape,

507
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,680
but like what, there's a word I'm looking for here.

508
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,520
Humanoid?

509
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,840
Humanoid, sure.

510
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,520
Yes, it has a humanoid shape.

511
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,280
Did it make a sound?

512
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,920
Yes.

513
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,680
Question two, part A.

514
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,280
Like a buzzing sound or like what?

515
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,340
It was weird.

516
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,340
It's like you could hear a man's voice,

517
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,440
but it was not.

518
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
But like not actual words or anything?

519
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,440
Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.

520
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.

521
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,440
Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.

522
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,320
But it's just like whispering through,

523
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,720
almost like it's this enormous noise

524
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
that's billowing from out of this thing,

525
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,640
but almost distant with inside of it.

526
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,480
Gotcha.

527
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,280
Whoa.

528
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,560
Okay, third question.

529
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,720
Maybe you only get two.

530
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,880
What did it taste like?

531
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
We got away from yes, no questions,

532
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,000
and that's fine, because this is more fun.

533
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,440
And as it kind of went by you,

534
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,200
you get this like just saltiness in your nose

535
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,640
and on your tongue, like as it whips by you.

536
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,800
Okay.

537
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,840
Very scary.

538
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,340
Hey, thanks.

539
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,380
I rubbed my ear so much,

540
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,160
I think I gave myself dizziness.

541
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,660
I was kind of sick.

542
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,680
I'm sorry.

543
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,560
Let's make you sicker.

544
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,080
This wet energy, you kind of get a glimpse of it

545
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,680
as it just flies past you.

546
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,000
To the body of Chuck Bidwell, throwing him back.

547
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,400
So I'm going to let you ask three questions.

548
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,980
And I think the first two have to be yes or no questions.

549
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,620
And then the last one doesn't have to be a yes or no question

550
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,960
based on what I did with Luke,

551
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,360
in order to get an idea of like what it looks like,

552
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,800
what it seems like, what it's doing, like how it moves,

553
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,040
like anything you want to ask

554
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,760
about what you might be able to perceive.

555
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,680
Okay.

556
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,880
My first question is, you said wet.

557
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Did it splash against Chuck Bidwell

558
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,920
or did it get absorbed by Chuck Bidwell?

559
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes to the second one.

560
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,360
Okay. That's what I hoped.

561
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,800
Is there a reason that I saw it?

562
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,640
No, wait.

563
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Yes or no questions. Sorry.

564
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Is there a reason?

565
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,120
Is a yes or no?

566
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,540
Doesn't help me though.

567
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,540
I did elaborate when Luke asked his second

568
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,400
yes or no question, so we can do this.

569
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,920
Well, I just wanted to clarify,

570
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,600
was it just because I happened to be looking

571
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,000
in the right direction?

572
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Or did it seem, I don't know how to ask this.

573
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,200
Yeah, no, it's a good question.

574
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,100
You think that like,

575
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,360
no matter what was going through your head,

576
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,720
because you were looking in the right direction,

577
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,040
you fucking saw this thing.

578
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,400
Because I was looking in the right direction,

579
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,980
I saw this thing. Okay.

580
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,960
For my third question then, you've said wet energy.

581
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,400
How fast was it?

582
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,520
Fucking wildly fast.

583
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,780
Like lightning strike fast

584
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,380
or like somebody's shooting a super soaker out of the air.

585
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,020
Super soaker. Okay.

586
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,860
Good question.

587
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,780
Tommy, Tommy come play.

588
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,500
We're bringing Thomas back with the bird here.

589
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,740
Oh wow, what the fuck?

590
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,860
Thomas, that reaction comes from seeing all of a sudden,

591
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,420
Chuck Bidwell has exploded through the far side wall

592
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,780
on the opposite side from the open wall.

593
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,580
He slams backward through glass, exploding everywhere,

594
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,380
10 meters from where he just stood a second ago

595
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,720
when you saw him.

596
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,060
You lose one grip as you have no idea how the fuck

597
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,900
that just happened.

598
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,140
No, it's pretty obviously that the ghost of the turtle

599
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,340
that Charles Bidwell tried to assassinate

600
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,180
or successfully assassinated,

601
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,340
came back and like super scienced his ass through the window

602
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,680
into like a last act of spiritual vengeance.

603
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,340
You said explodes through the glass,

604
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,500
but his body didn't explode, did it?

605
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,900
No, his body did not explode.

606
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,740
It's the glass around him that exploded.

607
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,060
The glass around him explodes, yeah.

608
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,060
And you hear him just like, oh, fucking shit.

609
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,200
Oh my God.

610
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,640
You hear the blabered breathing of Chuck Bidwell.

611
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,300
Oh, oh my God.

612
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,660
And then you hear nothing coming from the room

613
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,820
that is now part of your room.

614
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,460
Partition gone, glass wall down,

615
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,420
shattered into a million little pieces.

616
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,700
The footage from Beck's camera maybe had seen the,

617
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,180
it's shown like an empty stool tipped over

618
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,540
and nothingness just, you know, there, there.

619
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,580
And then you heard a big crash off camera

620
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,940
and Beck was so shocked that he is now pointed

621
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,700
to the ground with the camera.

622
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,540
Yeah, that's perfect.

623
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,340
And then after the thing had settled,

624
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,580
yeah, so it goes from like your wound healed

625
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,420
to an empty stool across the room

626
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,980
to just like chaos having already erupted.

627
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,820
Yeah, exactly.

628
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,940
Okay, very cool.

629
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,760
Luke.

630
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,600
Yeah.

631
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,440
Let's talk.

632
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,980
How, what are we doing with breaking points this season?

633
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,060
What do you guys want to do?

634
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,700
Do we want to come up with like a phobia or mania together?

635
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,360
Do we want to do it just one-on-one

636
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,860
or do we want to roll on the table like we did last time?

637
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,260
I would do any of the above.

638
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,700
I don't think we should do it together

639
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,860
just cause it's fun to have that as a secret or not,

640
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,340
you know, rolling is fun,

641
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,580
but I think it makes more sense to have something related

642
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,580
to what happened to make you break.

643
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,360
Here's a pitch that's half your idea

644
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,140
and half the opposite of your idea.

645
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,420
Joe and I come up with your mania related to,

646
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,860
related to your current situation.

647
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,700
That's interesting.

648
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,540
I don't hate it.

649
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,360
That's kind of fun.

650
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,200
And you know, vice versa all the way around.

651
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,040
Yeah, I like that.

652
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,880
Okay.

653
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,700
All right, cool.

654
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,540
I'm in.

655
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,820
Okay, so let's talk about it.

656
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,820
Well, he's never going to see a turtle

657
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,740
without shit in his pants.

658
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,580
I'll tell you that.

659
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,460
I was going to say, I'll listen, but I'll just not talk.

660
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Hang on though, the bad thing about this is that

661
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,260
Thomas and his character don't know

662
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,380
what it actually was that made him lose his career.

663
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,420
It doesn't really work.

664
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,260
Yeah, okay.

665
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,080
That's fair.

666
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,920
I have no fucking clue.

667
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,260
Okay, Joe and Thomas,

668
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,100
take off your headphones real quick, please.

669
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,620
Do you have any ideas right off the top of your head?

670
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,200
So initially I was like, well, it's boring,

671
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,580
but like afraid of heights.

672
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,340
But the thing that fucked me up

673
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,380
wasn't the turtle falling out the window.

674
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,180
It was the fucking wet ghost energy thing.

675
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,480
Yeah, it was the wet energy.

676
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,980
So...

677
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,900
I would say let's go water.

678
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,140
Just hydrophobia?

679
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,980
Yeah, let's go.

680
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,820
Oh fuck, okay.

681
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,900
But let's say it's a specific kind where you can...

682
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,380
Like running water or like a stream or a faucet or a shower.

683
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,060
But still water is fine.

684
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,100
I'm not going to die.

685
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,160
And obviously we're not going to tell them

686
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,060
until it comes up.

687
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,880
Exactly.

688
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,720
Rock and roll.

689
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,940
Rock and roll.

690
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,620
Hell yeah, dude.

691
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,760
Welcome back, boys.

692
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,600
Hey.

693
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,220
I'm afraid of having a huge penis.

694
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,780
And so I start screaming.

695
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,060
Yeah, man.

696
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,120
And I look back and I remember that he has a huge penis

697
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,720
and it scares the shit out of me.

698
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,220
And I haven't seen cows yet, but I imagine it's big too.

699
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,300
We cannot get you around those statues.

700
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,660
Yeah, so Julius kind of, he comes to and...

701
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,860
I mean, you're in Fight, Flight or Freezer at this point.

702
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,900
Freeze.

703
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,260
Well, I'm going to go freeze.

704
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,740
Freeze will be four, five, six.

705
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,380
Fight, flight.

706
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,060
Okay, flight is one, fight is two or three.

707
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,460
Go ahead and roll a D six.

708
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,020
That's a three.

709
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,820
So you're going to fight.

710
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,940
Fight, yeah.

711
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,840
Fight.

712
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,980
Well, no, yeah, fight.

713
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,100
Fight is going to be your response here.

714
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,060
So I'm going to just...

715
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,180
Fucking attack a doctor.

716
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,020
Yep.

717
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,340
Go ahead and roll.

718
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,260
Are you using your hands or are you going to grab something

719
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,840
and utilize a weapon of some sort?

720
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,060
There's broken glass everywhere.

721
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,560
It's too far away from you to grab.

722
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,900
Yeah, it's 10 meters across the room.

723
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
What's close to me?

724
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,780
There's a whole like medical bay.

725
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,140
It just doesn't slide across grass floors

726
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,100
like it might on something.

727
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,380
Oh yeah.

728
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,420
Exactly.

729
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,220
There's a whole medical cart like right in front of you.

730
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,580
Yeah, I'm going to grab the blood pressure monitor.

731
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,640
Just start swinging.

732
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,840
Okay, awesome.

733
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,020
Go ahead and roll a melee weapons.

734
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,540
He's got a 90 in that.

735
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,460
I don't mind.

736
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,660
I got a 59 on a 50.

737
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,220
Oh shit, it's a higher skill than I would have guessed.

738
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,060
I'm athletic.

739
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,460
You fling your arms wildly at this medical professional

740
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,300
who just helped your friend and they're backing up

741
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,660
and they are really, really confused.

742
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,140
And they see the crazed look in your eye.

743
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,140
Okay, we're leaving.

744
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,500
And they grabbed the medical cart

745
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,860
and kind of wheel it backwards away from you.

746
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,020
Julius is screaming,

747
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,420
you fucking magicked my friend back and then the turtle,

748
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,860
you got the turtle energy.

749
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,980
The two look at each other and they look back at you

750
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,040
and then they look at each other and then they dip.

751
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,420
Probably the best solution.

752
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,700
Beck is looking at Julius and hearing him saying that

753
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,380
and he's nodding vigorously to whoever is in the room still.

754
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,500
It is literally just the three of you

755
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,340
and the body of Chuck in the other room at this point.

756
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,860
So Cal this whole time has been like watching everything.

757
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,140
He was furiously taking notes while

758
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,460
Julius was fighting with the doctors.

759
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,500
And as soon as he senses that like the audio is right,

760
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,220
he motions to Beck to roll and he says,

761
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,120
tonight, you're a little yeeted.

762
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,060
Turtle mayor of Godel Gulag assassinated

763
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,180
and the chief suspect,

764
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,980
his political rival is an unknown condition.

765
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,120
Tune in to Can Action News for more.

766
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,020
Stevie is standing there with eyes,

767
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,440
absolutely as wide as eyes can be.

768
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Yeah, I didn't think this would happen.

769
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,260
Did you get that?

770
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,780
And then Beck is pulling down the camera

771
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,820
and is looking at the viewfinder

772
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,940
and realizes he didn't really get much

773
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,580
and his face kind of slacks.

774
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,140
Fuck.

775
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,660
There's no proof.

776
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,300
Oh shit.

777
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,300
How's Julius feeling at this point?

778
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
I would say absolutely enraged

779
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,540
and about to like punch Beck.

780
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,380
You like wanna break glass.

781
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,260
Julius stomps over to Chuck's body and is yelling,

782
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,780
Sandro, Sandro.

783
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,100
Cal kind of like cautiously walks up behind you

784
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,680
and he puts out an arm on your shoulder

785
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,260
and he just says, Julius.

786
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,180
Julius whips around and his like teeth gritted

787
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,820
and like fucking spit coming out of his mouth

788
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,040
and fucking hit.

789
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,860
Cal puts both hands on your shoulders

790
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,740
and he says, you're Julius Summers, City Action News

791
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,860
and we're here to do a job.

792
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,420
Beck has the camera up and is catching this.

793
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,140
The turtle's in him.

794
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,980
The turtle?

795
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,940
I don't know.

796
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,860
Sent who?

797
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,060
The turtle's in him.

798
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,020
Oh, is in who?

799
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,940
You look down and you see the body of Chuck Bidwell

800
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,700
just absolutely covered in like cuts and blood

801
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,420
and is covered in sweat, just like drenched clothes

802
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,060
and not lifeless, he's breathing.

803
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,380
You can tell like his dry fit green polo

804
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,420
is kind of bobbing slowly up and down.

805
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,260
Is that medical wrap still lying on the ground?

806
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,620
Like, no, but sure.

807
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,260
We're gonna take this everywhere

808
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,100
and heal all our wounds all the time.

809
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,900
Yeah, no, the medical staff took that with them.

810
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,320
The only thing that you guys still have

811
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,860
is the blood pressure monitor.

812
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,220
Which I slap on him to see if he's got any.

813
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,340
No.

814
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,700
Yeah, you can tell that he's breathing.

815
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,020
Is he like bleeding really, really bad

816
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,740
or just like kind of minor cuts and stuff?

817
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,980
It's not good.

818
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,420
There's a pool of blood beneath him and you see-

819
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,020
Nobody's ever almost died

820
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,940
from falling through a glass window, have they?

821
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,340
You can't, yeah, you can't like lose blood, right?

822
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,820
Yeah, no, probably not.

823
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,340
You definitely can't have an 18 inch long piece of glass

824
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,100
stuck in your upper thigh, butt area

825
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,260
and then lose a third of your blood

826
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,580
and have two blood transfusions on the operating table and-

827
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,400
Yeah, not never have your penis work right again.

828
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,460
You know, just like-

829
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,460
It works, it just doesn't work right.

830
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,860
I was describing my shotgun blast to you the other day,

831
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,500
right?

832
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,340
Yeah.

833
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,160
Oh, wait, yeah.

834
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, you said-

835
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,840
Is that from that?

836
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,960
No.

837
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,920
No cilia in your pee hole.

838
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,960
That's right, there's no cilia in my pee hole.

839
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,560
No cilia in your pee hole,

840
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,960
which we all are helpful helpers.

841
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,960
I burnt it all out, vaping through my dick.

842
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,020
Oh, that sounds rad.

843
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,280
How is that the response?

844
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,520
I don't know.

845
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,680
Well, how did we get to this?

846
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,360
Oh yeah, he's cut up and you almost died.

847
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,680
Ding.

848
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,440
And you all actually see coming up

849
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,640
the synthetic bouncy walkway up to the second floor,

850
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,200
you see through the glass wall

851
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,400
on the east side of the room you're currently in,

852
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,960
this pencil-like woman with the spiky hair

853
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,560
you know as Barbara Bidwell, the wife of Chuck Bidwell,

854
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,480
is absolutely losing her mind

855
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,160
as she's running into this room going,

856
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,920
oh my God, oh my God, no, no, Chuck, Chuck,

857
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,480
what's this, what happened?

858
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,600
What happened here, what did you do?

859
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,000
Barbara, try to stay sharp.

860
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,120
No, I will not, I refuse to stay sharp.

861
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,960
Well done.

862
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,440
Your husband killed the turtle.

863
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,640
Wait, what?

864
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,460
Well-

865
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,600
The mayor's dead.

866
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,420
Yes.

867
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,260
And your husband might be too soon.

868
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,080
And for a brief moment,

869
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,980
I think your husband was the mayor, officially.

870
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,820
She's down on the ground now.

871
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,940
That's nice, that's if that's any consolation.

872
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,520
Hands and knees in glass shards.

873
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,420
Now her hands are bleeding, her knees are bleeding

874
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,540
and she's, you know, just, it's okay.

875
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,540
It's okay, Chucky, it'll be okay.

876
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,180
And she's kind of like slapping his face

877
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,300
and it's like, wake up, wake up, wake up.

878
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,460
Medical, medical!

879
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,340
Barbara, Barbara,

880
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,100
do you have one of those communicator devices?

881
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,420
They're on their way.

882
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:52,260
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

883
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,900
I don't know that they are on their way

884
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,540
because they were like on their not way a minute ago.

885
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,100
Yes, many of them were already here

886
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,260
and then they fled in terror.

887
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
You might want to try to call them again.

888
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
It's like they didn't want to help.

889
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,460
They didn't want to help?

890
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,060
No, that doesn't make any sense.

891
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,100
Okay, and she pulls out one of the same-

892
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,260
Full disclosure, Julius beat some of them away

893
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,400
with a monitor.

894
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,620
As she's pulling out her radio device,

895
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,380
she looks at you and she's like,

896
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,620
well, that's probably why they left.

897
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,620
Medical, medical, yeah.

898
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,740
We need a medical up to the second floor of the lab.

899
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,640
Yeah, right by the entrance.

900
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,140
Yes, boys, come immediately.

901
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,500
I mean, I know this is a crisis moment for her,

902
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,140
but she's got a very sultry voice.

903
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,220
As soon as Cal says my name

904
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,440
and describes what I did to the doctors,

905
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,460
I kind of like come do more.

906
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,460
And I'm like, that's fucking, that's ridiculous.

907
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,540
So he kind of like sets the blood pressure thing down

908
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,820
and he looks at Beck and does the rolling signal

909
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,780
and then like tries without asking permission

910
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,740
to mic up Barbara.

911
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,860
We constantly do this.

912
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,360
We're constantly looking back to see if Beck is rolling,

913
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,860
even though it's completely unnecessary.

914
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,200
It's always, he is always.

915
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,460
It's just Joe nodding.

916
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,100
He is, he is.

917
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,460
What are you doing?

918
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,500
No, I'm not being interviewed right now.

919
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,540
Medical, medical.

920
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,860
She swats your hand away

921
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,420
and the medical staff tentatively, oh.

922
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,420
Like kind of dip toe in.

923
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,720
Inches towards you

924
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,500
and they're keeping their distance away from Julius.

925
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Julius backs away and puts his hands up.

926
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,800
And they are just confusedly looking across at him

927
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,220
while moving to do their job,

928
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,220
which is to get Chuck Bidwell up onto this bulletin carriage.

929
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,100
Wow.

930
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,480
Bulletin carriage?

931
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,560
He means bull pin cart.

932
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,340
That was incredible.

933
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,180
Oh my God.

934
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,220
Okay, do you not know what bullpen means

935
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,420
or what bulletin means?

936
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,920
Because only one is Squamous.

937
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,940
Let's get him up on this bulletin carriage.

938
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,740
Let's get him on the bulletin carriage.

939
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,280
Holy shit, I didn't know that's what it looked like.

940
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,500
It's a big hat.

941
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,580
It's a big helmet.

942
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,680
It's a baseball wearing a hat.

943
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,520
Yeah.

944
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,380
They all look a little different, but the best ones.

945
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,700
Wow, that rips.

946
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,380
They were really popular in like the late 70s and 80s.

947
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,580
And now I'm gonna Google bulletin carriage.

948
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,020
Yeah, that's what I thought you were looking up.

949
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,380
No, that'll be the dolly image we posted.

950
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,700
I'll do it right now.

951
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,860
You guys still like that meme, right?

952
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,700
Yeah.

953
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,520
Of course you do.

954
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,360
Of course you do.

955
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,300
We're gonna do it enough that it's our meme.

956
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,040
Beck is kind of now saying like pass the camera

957
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,340
toward the belabored breathing body of Chuck.

958
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,060
Dude, you're gonna be fine.

959
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,300
Like I had holes in my legs and now I don't, dude.

960
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,260
You're gonna be okay.

961
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,860
You see a little lung come out.

962
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,340
Chuck, you're gonna be fine.

963
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,820
Or is it Sandro?

964
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,660
What are you doing?

965
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,940
He's not awake.

966
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,020
What are you?

967
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,820
And they're moving him into this cart

968
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,020
and they begin to kind of cart him out of this room.

969
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:31,020
The medical staff don't want to be around you three at all.

970
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,820
Specifically Julius.

971
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,860
Makes sense.

972
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,900
So they're trying to get him out.

973
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,660
And of course Barbara is just at the side

974
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,140
of her husband, Chuck.

975
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,860
As the group walks out.

976
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,460
So are we now being left in this room by ourselves?

977
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,300
Yep.

978
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,340
Interesting.

979
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,060
I want to look around for interesting things.

980
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,980
I would like to perhaps roll the search.

981
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,380
Yeah, so this is kind of the first time

982
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,500
you guys have looked around here.

983
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,900
Go ahead and roll that search.

984
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,980
You were previously in a conference room

985
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,780
that overlooked this area.

986
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,820
So there's a big table off to the side

987
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,980
where you guys kind of weren't.

988
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,700
Hey, I finally passed a roll.

989
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,540
Oh nice.

990
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,020
It's a 38 on a 40.

991
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,740
I got a 34 and a 60.

992
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,420
I got a 42 on a 70.

993
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,620
Okay, so success is all around.

994
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,060
Success is all around.

995
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,700
Wait, did you say 32?

996
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,540
42.

997
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,900
Oh, I thought you said 32

998
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,420
and then we all would have had 30s

999
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,180
and that would have been full out.

1000
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,540
That's crazy.

1001
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,420
So the room that Chuck busted into was an office.

1002
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,780
It was an empty office.

1003
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,260
No one was working in there today,

1004
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,500
but it just has kind of a spartan desk

1005
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,740
and anything cool on that desk.

1006
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,420
Like a key card or secret villain plan.

1007
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,900
Oh yeah, there's a secret villain plan for sure.

1008
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,060
As you've seen so far,

1009
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,860
that you might not need a key card in this whole place

1010
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,820
as doors don't seem to be too much of an issue.

1011
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,700
Walls might need a clicker.

1012
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,740
Yeah, which I see and grab.

1013
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,560
Yeah, sure.

1014
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,400
How about that?

1015
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,240
You grab a clicker,

1016
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,140
which will be able to open up any doors or walls

1017
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,220
that you come across while you were here in Grover's Gorge.

1018
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,020
Fuck yeah, dude.

1019
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,860
Excellent.

1020
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,680
Congratulations.

1021
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,820
Along with that.

1022
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,660
I'm the mayor now.

1023
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,500
You all hear murmuring

1024
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,500
and it's coming from out front of the lab

1025
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,460
kind of by the statues

1026
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,260
and it's almost like you can hear a crowd gathering.

1027
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,340
Is it like where the turtle is?

1028
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,900
It would be exactly where the turtle was.

1029
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,120
Maybe we should get out there amongst the mob

1030
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,720
instead of being directly opposite the mob.

1031
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,000
If we're inside it filming, getting interviews and stuff,

1032
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,540
they're less likely to turn on us for killing their mayor.

1033
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,380
Very true.

1034
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,040
Also, we don't tell them.

1035
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,640
Dude, but like, they're gonna pin it on me.

1036
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,720
I'm already an animal killer here.

1037
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,640
No, no, no, Beck, Beck.

1038
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,800
There's no proof of it anymore.

1039
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,920
He looks at his leg.

1040
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,840
Yeah, I mean, people saw it.

1041
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,860
If you guys don't think they're gonna turn on me,

1042
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,280
I'll go with you, of course.

1043
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,840
Now, Beck, I know this might seem harsh and even unpleasant,

1044
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,000
but if they start to turn on you,

1045
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,840
all you have to do is show them your headphones.

1046
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,780
Good, good point, dude.

1047
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,280
They all seem really freaked out by my headphones.

1048
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,920
That should buy us some time.

1049
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,920
The trauma of getting godled seems to pause the psyche.

1050
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,680
Yeah, yeah, man, I like it.

1051
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,520
I mean, I don't like it.

1052
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,780
It's awful and it sounds like these people

1053
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,780
are maybe being subjected to inhumane things,

1054
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,780
but I like it for our purposes now.

1055
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,900
Beck looks at Stevie at this point.

1056
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,860
Yeah.

1057
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,160
I mean, it seems like we could have been more prepared

1058
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,060
to enter this scenario.

1059
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,460
Well, I didn't want you guys to blow my cover,

1060
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,400
so I didn't want to really give too much away,

1061
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,260
if that makes sense.

1062
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,180
I guess now that that's done, it doesn't matter anymore,

1063
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,900
but I would say we're kind of all in the same

1064
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,460
fucked situation at this point.

1065
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,580
Stevie, I understand your reasoning,

1066
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,460
though if you had told us your identity,

1067
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,480
it would have allowed us to prepare

1068
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,220
a more comprehensive infiltration.

1069
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,520
You make a really good point,

1070
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,960
and then next time that I do this, I'll let you know.

1071
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,260
That's all I ask.

1072
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,100
Okay.

1073
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,900
When we infiltrate the secret company town

1074
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,660
on your mom's side of the family.

1075
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,260
Perhaps give us a couple of weeks to prepare.

1076
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,820
She laughs and then you see genuine laughter and joy

1077
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,940
come across her face for the first time.

1078
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,100
She's been really nervous this whole time.

1079
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,100
What do you think the chances of us going out there

1080
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,940
and being apprehended and sent to, I saw the judge,

1081
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,160
I assumed, god-old jail for killing an animal

1082
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,700
and maybe the mayor?

1083
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,380
Hang on, real fast, just so we're all on the same page.

1084
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,180
We had nothing to do with the turtle,

1085
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,020
and we're not even lying.

1086
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,020
Yes, true.

1087
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:53,020
I mean, it was quite old, and it needed a lot of makeup.

1088
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,720
None of us were anywhere near it, right?

1089
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,560
No.

1090
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,880
No. No.

1091
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,360
Can I human that?

1092
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,320
Yeah, sure.

1093
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,160
84.

1094
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,760
Yeah, seems.

1095
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,720
Let's get a shot of the crowd from above

1096
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,600
before we join, at least.

1097
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,620
Yeah, that kind of creeps to the edge.

1098
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,960
He doesn't want to pull focus up to himself up there,

1099
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,760
so he's maybe holding the camera out a little bit,

1100
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,400
using the viewfinder at an angle.

1101
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,720
Oh yeah, this has to be incognito and stealthy.

1102
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,480
Otherwise, it's just the three of us standing over

1103
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,280
at the fucking balcony where they're pointing down.

1104
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,120
Yeah.

1105
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,840
Can you guys do that for the shot, though?

1106
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,320
That one is sobbing.

1107
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,160
Film her.

1108
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,780
Yeah, I'm gonna need the videographer roll here.

1109
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,800
74 on an 80.

1110
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,360
Ooh.

1111
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,200
Very nice.

1112
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,160
You were able to slyly put this in a position

1113
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,080
where you know that in the ceiling above,

1114
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,320
there's a pattern to where if most people

1115
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,260
are looking up toward you, the camera kind of blends in

1116
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,720
with what would be behind it.

1117
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,320
Smart man.

1118
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,160
Nice.

1119
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,600
The ceiling is just a tesseract of a camera.

1120
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,480
Yeah, it sounds like a pretty cool ceiling.

1121
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,920
No, literally, there's just thousands of cameras

1122
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,580
filming your every move while you're in Donald Gorge.

1123
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,640
Hey, let me tell you something right now.

1124
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,840
There's definitely not.

1125
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,840
Also, to prove our innocence.

1126
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,840
If you can fucking kill a balrog

1127
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,120
and make a ravine in a magic town,

1128
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,400
you probably aren't scared of shit.

1129
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,240
Yeah, that's a good point.

1130
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,280
Why would I have a security camera?

1131
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,520
I killed a balrog.

1132
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,360
I can't remember, were you saying the stuff

1133
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,360
about blending into the crowd and character?

1134
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,600
An excellent idea.

1135
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,720
Yeah, I'll film interviews and we'll just look like

1136
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,280
we were doing what we were doing,

1137
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,520
which is just doing interviews for City Action News.

1138
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,360
That's what we do.

1139
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,840
Tell them the truth.

1140
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,920
That's what we do and that's what we did

1141
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,120
and that's all that we were doing.

1142
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,960
Yeah.

1143
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,800
All right.

1144
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,960
That's all we saw and that's all we saw.

1145
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,600
Can crew on three.

1146
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,720
And he puts his hand up.

1147
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,620
One, two, three, can crew.

1148
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,800
And then we reservoir dogs like out of the building

1149
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,640
all on a line, all very confidently like,

1150
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,560
I got a tripod over her shoulder.

1151
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,560
Cal just walks up right to the first crying person.

1152
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,200
Cal Colorado here on a sad day.

1153
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,320
Sir, where were you when you heard the mayor had died?

1154
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,160
The crowd is all staring at you as you come out.

1155
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,400
You walk past the dried up corpse of Sandra the turtle,

1156
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,920
put a microphone in the first person's face

1157
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,320
and the crowd immediately parts and standing there,

1158
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,160
you see a rail thin man with a balding,

1159
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,840
mostly already balded head.

1160
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,960
Is this another pencil person?

1161
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,520
He's wearing a tattered three piece double breasted suit.

1162
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,560
Turtle, turtle.

1163
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,360
But his skin that you can see is bruised and scratched

1164
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,260
and seems to cover his entire body.

1165
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,300
But the suit covers most of that.

1166
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,200
And he is rabid, almost foaming at the mouth.

1167
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,320
And he drags a long thin cane against the ground

1168
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,700
as he approaches you.

1169
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,560
Holy shit.

1170
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,880
Well now then boys,

1171
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,200
I do believe that you are under arrest

1172
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,560
for the murder of our mayor,

1173
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,960
Sandra the turtle.

1174
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,840
I believe in fact, no such thing will happen.

1175
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,040
We had no part in your mayor's death.

1176
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,120
He was placed carelessly.

1177
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,580
Roll dodge or fight back.

1178
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,740
Just Cal who's talking right to him

1179
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,260
cause he's walking right up to Cal as he drags that cane.

1180
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,620
Well, Cal rolls a 92

1181
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,780
and probably gets smacked in the face with it.

1182
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,200
In the middle of you talking, you're just slapped.

1183
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,660
Not even for damage.

1184
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,580
It literally does no hit points of damage to you.

1185
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,720
It is to shut you up and put you in your place.

1186
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,660
And he says, now then.

1187
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,020
Cal doesn't like that because he was telling the truth.

1188
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,600
Beck just saw Cal get hit with a cane

1189
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,540
and his reaction is not to stand out.

1190
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,380
His friend just got hit.

1191
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,180
Whoa, hey, bro.

1192
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,420
You can't just go around hitting people with canes.

1193
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,780
Immediately the tip of his cane is in your face.

1194
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,620
A guy comes running up.

1195
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,820
He can, he can, he can.

1196
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:40,820
He did, didn't you see it?

1197
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,720
When he sits back, it's like when Beck saw Cal get hit.

1198
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:54,460
Excuse me, but this man is an employee of City Action News.

1199
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,940
We were invited here to cover your community.

1200
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,580
He's going to punch you in the nose.

1201
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,400
If you want to try to dodge.

1202
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,300
I mean, I'm going to try to like, yeah, I want to actually,

1203
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,000
I guess if he's throwing punches, we're going to fight.

1204
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,060
I pass with a 14.

1205
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,820
Well, then I beat you with a 32.

1206
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,940
Oh, absolutely you do.

1207
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,740
So he goes to throw a punch and?

1208
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,740
Cal catches it and then knocks it aside.

1209
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,060
Sir, are you not interested in hearing the truth?

1210
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:20,940
While he's talking,

1211
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,620
Julius is going to try to pin a microphone on his.

1212
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,700
He's distracted.

1213
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,100
He was trying to fight Cal.

1214
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,780
You know, this is one of those let it happen moments.

1215
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,020
Cool.

1216
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,220
You're just going up and he's literally, he loves it.

1217
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,380
He looks down and he's like,

1218
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,520
yes, these words need to be heard, of course.

1219
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,040
You will know your place, good sir.

1220
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,440
Now I'm of course, Cal, Colorado city action news.

1221
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,600
First things first for the viewers

1222
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,360
who we are streaming live to at this moment.

1223
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,240
And he wants to like persuade or fluff that guy.

1224
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,440
Could you please state your name clearly?

1225
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,520
So go ahead and roll.

1226
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,720
He's going to roll a human against your persuade.

1227
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,440
He succeeds with a critical success.

1228
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,560
Oh shit.

1229
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,000
I also succeed.

1230
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,200
I thought you were going to say

1231
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,360
with a higher critical success,

1232
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,720
I quit with a 33 and he looks at the camera

1233
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,320
and he smirks and he looks back at you.

1234
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,480
Oh yes, of course.

1235
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,480
My name is the landlord Vernon Covington.

1236
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,940
And when he says the landlord,

1237
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,840
you can feel the chill run down the spine

1238
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,280
of all in attendance of this crowd.

1239
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,000
Sucks the air right out of this beautiful sunny day.

1240
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,320
How did you say he was dressed?

1241
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,640
In a tattered three piece double-breasted suit

1242
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,160
that mostly covers the bruises and scratches

1243
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,900
that are all over his body.

1244
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,700
Beck wants to twiddle his headphones just to try,

1245
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,640
like as though trying to tempt a dog with a treat.

1246
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,840
And as you do so,

1247
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,000
you see that nothing about his suit adds up.

1248
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,520
It's not nice, which everyone's clothes here are nice.

1249
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,680
And it's also all over the place color wise.

1250
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,640
I mean, it probably looks like it's out of the forties,

1251
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,480
right?

1252
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,320
Or fifties.

1253
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,080
Eh, it's just like old shit.

1254
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1255
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,120
It's not like...

1256
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,360
I mean, style wise.

1257
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,600
Oh, style wise, yeah.

1258
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,840
It's just kind of like a big boxy cut.

1259
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,040
It might even be like eighties or some shit.

1260
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,880
I love an eighties cut.

1261
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,040
David Byrne.

1262
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,280
Do I see the body of the turtle laying anywhere?

1263
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,520
Oh yeah, they left it out.

1264
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,780
I think Luke was on the same page as me.

1265
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,120
I thought this was the personification of the turtle.

1266
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:46,960
Yeah, for sure.

1267
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,240
So at least it's not the body thereof

1268
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,560
and his name isn't Sandro.

1269
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,800
So I don't know if this is the case or not.

1270
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,980
I just thought Luke was expressing his mania

1271
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,740
about seeing turtle bodies fly into other people.

1272
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,400
Is that the shit you fucking saw?

1273
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,360
You gonna talk about it in character

1274
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,960
or you gonna talk about it out of character?

1275
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,160
I'm asking my friend, Luke.

1276
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,560
Will you please let us have a conversation, Zach?

1277
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,000
No, Vernon Covington is making it very difficult

1278
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,360
for you all to have a conversation

1279
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,880
as he is doing his best to keep you quiet and in your place.

1280
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,560
Yeah, this guy sucks.

1281
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,680
Yeah.

1282
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,600
Cal pulls out a gun and shoots him.

1283
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,440
Yeah.

1284
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,800
By God, if I'm going to be found guilty of murder,

1285
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,780
I better damn well be guilty.

1286
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:37,780
What authority do you have to place us under arrest?

1287
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,340
He looks back and in the back of the crowd,

1288
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,060
you see the judge wearing the powdered wig

1289
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,780
and the judge's robes.

1290
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,980
And he looks back and he says,

1291
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:54,980
oh, I do believe that the authority is here with us now

1292
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,380
in order to make a decision.

1293
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,680
And then he's going to start prodding you

1294
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,360
like a farmer poking cattle

1295
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,960
to kind of get you guys to stand all together in one spot.

1296
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,660
Cal stands right where he is and he says,

1297
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,540
you're insinuating that the judge over there,

1298
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,360
that's your authority, but what is their authority?

1299
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,280
None of you are agents of the state

1300
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,800
or the federal government.

1301
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,600
You are vigilantes.

1302
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,400
You have no right to put us on trial

1303
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,060
for a crime we did not commit.

1304
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,980
And I feel, you know, we did not commit this.

1305
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,620
The judge walks up to the front

1306
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,580
as you've been making your plea

1307
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,060
and Vernon Covington looks down at you,

1308
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,400
smiles really big and starts laughing.

1309
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,740
Oh my.

1310
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,300
Where are your courts?

1311
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,980
Where are your police officers?

1312
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,660
Where is your law now?

1313
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,660
You perhaps misunderstand me.

1314
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,860
I do not dispute that you could do anything

1315
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:12,660
to us you might want, but you do not do it

1316
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,700
with the grace of the law that you spit on

1317
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,100
and they will come for you.

1318
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,380
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

1319
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:22,440
but the name Cal Colorado means something in this town

1320
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,720
and he will not be sacrificed for some fucking turtle.

1321
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,780
Vernon Covington has been smiling the entire time.

1322
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,180
He looks at Beck Wilder and Julius Summers

1323
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,000
and he says, any squawking from the other two?

1324
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,040
Looks over at Stevie.

1325
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,520
And you down there?

1326
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,880
Anything from you?

1327
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,320
When he looks at Julius, he pokes him with his cane

1328
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,860
and Julius wants to try to grab it

1329
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,800
and snap it over his huge fucking thighs.

1330
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,640
Awesome.

1331
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,480
Awesome.

1332
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,760
He's gotta get a bonus for the size of his thighs.

1333
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,520
I'm gonna use my luck and that's a nine.

1334
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,920
Wait, was that a contested roll?

1335
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,680
I'm gonna tell you to not use your luck.

1336
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,840
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

1337
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,480
I'm gonna be nice and tell you,

1338
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,760
no, I think that just seems super fair.

1339
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,280
I rolled a 77.

1340
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,440
Oh, so, fail I hope?

1341
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,280
Nope.

1342
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,400
That is a critical cane success.

1343
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,680
Okay, I got a 90.

1344
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,580
For Vernon Covington.

1345
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,160
What is it? Is it a nine?

1346
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,560
Yeah, that's a nine.

1347
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,720
What the fuck?

1348
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,800
How many hit points do you have right now?

1349
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,280
10.

1350
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,740
What?

1351
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,580
Why does a cane-

1352
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,340
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1353
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,440
Like six shots to the face all at the exact same time.

1354
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,460
Blood starts spurting everywhere

1355
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,620
and you hit the ground unconscious immediately.

1356
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,860
What the fuck?

1357
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,060
Roll constitution to see if you can actually

1358
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,700
stay conscious at this point in time.

1359
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,340
As Vernon Covington stands over your body.

1360
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,940
Cal screams, Julius, no!

1361
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,540
But then also looks back to see if Beck is filming.

1362
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,460
He is.

1363
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,260
Yeah, Julius, I pass my con check.

1364
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,120
So Julius is on the ground, face bloodied,

1365
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,940
and also looking blood.

1366
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,500
And also looking back to make sure he's filming.

1367
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,780
He's like on the ground, reaching out,

1368
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,780
and making the like little roll motion.

1369
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,740
Oh my god.

1370
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,420
Holy shit.

1371
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,680
Fuck, dude.

1372
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,860
What the fuck?

1373
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,460
I'm almost dead.

1374
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,540
I don't like this guy.

1375
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,780
Vernon Covington stands over the body of Julius Summers

1376
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,020
and looks out to the crowd and says,

1377
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,540
are there any witnesses?

1378
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,260
The two medical workers in the crowd

1379
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,380
kind of raise their hand and one of them speaks up

1380
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:56,580
and says, uh, yeah, that one?

1381
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,500
And points at Julius.

1382
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,100
That one chased us and tried to hurt us.

1383
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,260
Vernon Covington puts his hands in the air.

1384
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:10,260
Do you not see what kind of men these men are, judge?

1385
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,620
Men are, judge.

1386
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,340
So Cal is looking over at Stevie.

1387
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,620
Do you really think she'll protect you?

1388
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:23,620
And there's a glimmer of hope in Stevie's eyes.

1389
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:27,360
But as you're staring into those hope-filled eyes,

1390
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,600
you hear from behind.

1391
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:35,540
These men deserve the proper punishment.

1392
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:40,540
They should be stoned to death.

1393
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,780
Fuck.

1394
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,260
I'll say that one more time.

1395
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,060
They should be stoned to death.

1396
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,460
Hell yeah.

1397
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,460
As soon as I said fuck, I was like, wait, no.

1398
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,460
As soon as I said fuck, I was like, wait, no.

1399
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,960
It's all my fault.

1400
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,820
The sun's reflection off the ocean water amplifies

1401
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,820
the heat and steam rises, crawling up the wooden boards

1402
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,060
of a small ship.

1403
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,940
And as the flag unfurls from the top of the highest mast,

1404
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:59,940
the fog dissipates and reveals text that reads,

1405
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:04,460
North Atlantic Ocean, Northeast of the Greater Antilles,

1406
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,340
20th of August, 1694.

1407
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,700
And then the credits start to come up on the screen

1408
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,360
for like, you know, before the movie actually starts,

1409
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,140
but the names of everyone are coming up.

1410
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,460
And it says, Luke Gensman,

1411
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,220
Joe Terry,

1412
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,020
Thomas Cox,

1413
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,620
Zach Reeves,

1414
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,240
and Beth May.

1415
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:58,020
Teeter totter turtle die.
