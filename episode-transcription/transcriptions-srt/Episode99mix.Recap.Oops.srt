1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Slap a can of beans and throw it at your mama.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,280
It's Wolf the Dog here to give you bad advice

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,400
regarding your parental figures.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
And I'm coming at you dead.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,200
From 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,640
that utilizes a bean-based biofuel

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,520
to make the electricity absolutely electric, my babies.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,200
We also use coal, apparently.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,600
People still use coal?

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,120
That shit is nasty.

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,680
What is not nasty is that this edition

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,040
of Howlin' with Wolf is from Jack.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,160
Jack tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,720
which is one of the greatest feats a tweet can achieve.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,720
They write, my dearest wolf, in times like this,

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,380
it is such a comfort to listen to your news

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,040
from contention, murderous ooze, orphan experiments,

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,920
inscrutable aliens, blood magic feds,

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,800
spine-rippin' robot balls,

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,760
the unspeakable whore come to eat the world.

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,680
These terrors keep the even larger daily ones at bay

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,160
for an hour or so, and for that, I am grateful.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,180
Even when the world's a dumpster fire,

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,360
you still find us all the scrumptious,

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,220
unscorched, slop to slurp.

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,260
Love to my contention folks, Jack.

27
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,340
Hey there, Jack.

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,740
I always love when a fan of mine

29
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,460
talks about slurpin' that slop.

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,540
It makes my orifices tingle with anticipation.

31
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,540
My pores ooze with, ooze.

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,180
If you want me to read your words

33
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,420
on a segment similar to this one,

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,140
similar because it would be on this exact same segment,

35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,700
go on and tag at Pretendin' Pod

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,860
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,300
and report that review

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,500
to your Wolfie at pretendinpod at gmail.com.

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,220
I promise I definitely read all of them

40
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,900
and it's not forced on my producer.

41
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm fuckin' hungry, y'all.

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,120
And speaking of the rich,

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,140
we're rich with theme songs in this final recap

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,580
of season one of Pretending to be People

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,740
here at 694.2 PTBB,

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,540
Contingent's newest and only radio station.

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,720
But all arouse the menage a trois with a banger.

48
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,560
Banger?

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,660
Barely knew her.

50
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,580
It's Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual.

51
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,420
Mmm.

52
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,000
["Pretty People"]

53
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,340
Don't make me pretty, baby.

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,260
This is real love dream.

55
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,440
I knew I'd make you be pretty.

56
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,100
I knew I'd make you be pretty.

57
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,580
The tops of trees,

58
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,620
thick enough to obscure any view of what was below,

59
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,580
covered in a layer of kudzu,

60
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,720
seemed to go on endlessly.

61
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,820
Up and down, over hills and valleys,

62
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,580
mountains and gorges,

63
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,900
there was nothing but dense, verdant forest.

64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,500
A circular, calm lake found itself

65
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,720
somewhere in the midst of this lush wilderness

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,220
and in the middle of that lake,

67
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,420
a small island with less than a quarter mile

68
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,100
from shore to shore.

69
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,580
A long wooden dock on the north side of the island

70
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,580
led to a charming two-story boathouse

71
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,860
with six well-kept cedar canoes

72
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,500
tied up below the second-story apartment.

73
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,820
If the island was the face of a clock,

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,240
that dock was at high noon.

75
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,360
There were six cute, cozy little cottages

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,460
evenly dispersed along the shore of the island

77
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,380
at one o'clock, three o'clock, five o'clock,

78
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,800
seven o'clock, nine o'clock, and 11 o'clock.

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,660
Five of the six cottages were in pristine condition.

80
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,060
The 11 o'clock place might have been two,

81
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,640
but it was impossible to tell from the outside

82
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,500
since the entire building was covered

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,060
by a massive blue tarp.

84
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,220
Truly master craft landscaping

85
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,800
surrounded each of these cottages.

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,860
Stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape

87
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,580
filled varied gardens and planters

88
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,260
that somehow both overran the terrain

89
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,940
and complemented it perfectly.

90
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,660
Each cottage had a cobblestone walkway

91
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,740
lined on either side by these lovely flower beds

92
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,940
and the walkways all made their way

93
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,980
to the center of the island

94
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,460
where a large, equally cute and cozy

95
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,980
hexagonal building sat.

96
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,700
There was a small welcome sign

97
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,620
on the south side of this building right at six o'clock

98
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,620
and it read, welcome to calm, comfy campground.

99
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,500
The circle of knowledge used this land

100
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
isolated by both geography

101
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,840
and some sort of unnatural perimeter

102
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,060
to execute a brainchild of Jim Cook

103
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,180
called Operation Hole Puncher.

104
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,740
This operation utilized the potent pheromone

105
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,980
from their newly developed experimental family of flowers

106
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,380
named Sanferra Blom.

107
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,780
This pheromone made the uninoculated

108
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,980
unnaturally suggestible.

109
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,680
The targets of this mission were so malleable

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,700
entire backstories could be prescribed

111
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,860
in order to extract specific information.

112
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,200
Roger Fairfield, an archeologist

113
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,140
with access to a new excavation site

114
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,820
designated The Nameless City,

115
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,460
was made to believe he was married to a woman named Angela,

116
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,460
actually played by Anne Love.

117
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,940
Alan Grimes, a child trafficker with government contracts,

118
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,020
was convinced a boy from one of his warehouses

119
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,860
was an artificial intelligence.

120
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,740
Each mark had something the circle of knowledge wanted.

121
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,320
Charles Digby had enough compromising evidence

122
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
to blackmail every important person in the city.

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,280
Martin Cupertino was in the midst of creating Cube,

124
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,520
the future of personal technology.

125
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,480
Pliable guests were duped

126
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,420
into signing extensive contracts.

127
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,140
The aim of Operation Hole Puncher

128
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,140
was to acquire as much information and access as possible,

129
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,040
but the system didn't always work smoothly.

130
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,520
Groups would sometimes trigger reality for each other.

131
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,640
They would need to be reset.

132
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,800
With Fairfield, the Grimes, Digby, and Cupertino,

133
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,160
even the fifth reset didn't quite stick,

134
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,100
and Cupertino somehow escaped before the sixth reset.

135
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,380
He was an anomaly.

136
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,960
And of course, there were some folks

137
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,680
who refused to share their secrets

138
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,700
regardless of their altered state.

139
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,960
A completely random example would be

140
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,720
Eunice and Jerry Bishop,

141
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,120
who at the time possessed a rare

142
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,200
and specifically sought-after book.

143
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,240
No matter what Jim Cook, Leon Simpson, or Ann Love tried,

144
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,240
friendship, torture, worse,

145
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,480
the bishops never surrendered their knowledge

146
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,600
of where the book was hidden.

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,160
This is the kind of environment

148
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,880
in which young Maggie Cook was raised.

149
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
She quickly found her life much more interesting

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,760
when the victim suspected or saw reality

151
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,560
through their flower-induced haze.

152
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,080
So she began to play her own games

153
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
with the temporary tenants.

154
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,520
It started innocently enough

155
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,480
she would talk to Circle of Knowledge members

156
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,680
when they were undercover with a mark.

157
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,940
Then she planted walkie-talkies in the cottages

158
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,840
to taunt the visitors.

159
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,120
But little Maggie eventually took it upon herself

160
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,400
to actually inoculate guests while they slept.

161
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,760
She was bored.

162
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,280
And some kids just like to watch the chaos they've created.

163
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,320
She watched from the roof of a cottage

164
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,520
the night she first saw the thing

165
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,120
that lived in the brackish waters of Lake Calm.

166
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,520
The six of them paddled the three canoes

167
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,000
like their lives depended on it.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,560
Jack Russell always says,

169
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,440
"'To do a canoe.'"

170
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,560
She wondered if it was the last thing he said.

171
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,880
An unspeakable worm-like abomination

172
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,140
erupted above the surface of the water.

173
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,040
The thing rose 10 feet out of the ichor.

174
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,680
It was tube-like, covered in a squamous,

175
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,880
black, partially translucent membrane.

176
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,840
Its body was segmented,

177
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,000
and toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,760
were visible through its thin-looking exterior.

179
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,080
It had no identifiable eyes or nose,

180
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,280
and its cavernous, circular mouths,

181
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,640
one sat just inside the other,

182
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,080
were lined with hooked teeth,

183
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,820
and it spit out a saliva

184
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,200
that was somehow darker than black.

185
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,660
From its maw, a sharp stylet protruded,

186
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,960
like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.

187
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,680
It plunged down, attached to the top of Jack Russell's head,

188
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,060
and ripped him up and out of the back of the canoe.

189
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,800
The thing sucked the short, portly man

190
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,680
into its round, teeth-encircled mouth

191
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,000
before it slipped quickly and quietly

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
back into the pitch-black water of Lake Calm.

193
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,640
She half-expected Jack Russell

194
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,560
to be standing at six o'clock the next day

195
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,740
with that dumb, blank expression on his face

196
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,800
like all the others would after a reset.

197
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,880
She liked watching their faces change.

198
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,560
It was impossible to tell, even for her,

199
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,580
if it was their last time being greeted by that sign.

200
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,460
Welcome to Calm, Comfy Campground.

201
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:28,580
Hip-hop music

202
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:54,740
John Lee Pettymore IV, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna felt eyes on them, all over them,

203
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,660
outside of their own bodies, floating in this vast nothingness.

204
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,740
They saw Keith Vigna open a door until D.B. Mitchell was there on the other side, curled

205
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:12,120
up in the fetal position, and her body began deteriorating hastily, like she had leprosy

206
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
in time-lapse.

207
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,560
However, she grew larger with each passing moment.

208
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,920
Clark Bishop handed an old piece of parchment to a young boy with a balloon-shaped head,

209
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,280
an eye so dark that the irises looked black.

210
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,880
And immediately, the boy's feet caught fire, and the fire grew and grew to consume the

211
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,100
young black-eyed boy in three voices, cried out in pain.

212
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,480
John Lee Pettymore IV crouched down, stared at a television, a blank white screen.

213
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,760
He reached out and touched the screen like Vanna White, but instead of a letter popping

214
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,800
up, Clark Bishop's parents, Eunice and Jerry, the size of action figures, jumped out of

215
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,100
the screen and ran up John Lee Pettymore IV's arm, climbed his shoulder, and flinged their

216
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,400
tiny selves into John's head.

217
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,780
It looked like the Bishops were going to disappear right into Pettymore's brain, but they both

218
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,640
got stuck halfway in.

219
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,440
Their legs writhed about and flailed in this never-ending dreamscape.

220
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,360
Oily, viscous sludge began dripping, and then sprayed out of John Lee Pettymore IV's head

221
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,840
where the Bishops had lodged themselves, and the ooze began collecting on a ground below,

222
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,440
then made of light.

223
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,180
And the ooze dripped, dripped, dripped, and then poured, until a laminar flow connected

224
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,460
the head of John Lee Pettymore IV to a pool of this inky substance that began shaping

225
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,060
itself into a large saucer.

226
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:50,820
But as the pool grew, the walls began rising outward, creating an imposingly colossal bowl,

227
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,300
and our view was forced to back up leagues as this shape continued to form, a mirror

228
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,220
of what was then below.

229
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,580
The miniscule body of John Lee Pettymore in the far distance continued to fill this thing's

230
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:14,360
final form, an incomprehensibly massive sphere, and it continued to grow, and grow, and then...

231
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,260
The three contention boys woke up in the mausoleum for the third time, in shock, cursed with

232
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,100
the memories of their recent trip to City State University.

233
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,300
Their stomachs were strangely full, their ears rang, and their eyes adjusted to the

234
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,820
dark, cold tomb.

235
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,060
A turned over coffin sat next to a pool of blood on the ground.

236
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,820
John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd in black tactical gear, Keith Vigna in his bright polo and boat

237
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:49,040
shoes, and Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform, all felt the searing pain where

238
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,560
names had been burned into their skin.

239
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,060
Marvin on each chest was still crossed out.

240
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,020
Maggie on the sole of each left foot was now crossed out as well.

241
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,700
The other two names on their backs and inside their dominant hands read respectively Drew

242
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,700
and Tildy.

243
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,900
It was 3pm on December 6th.

244
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,300
Two hours had passed since their last experience waking up next to Ari Manstein's corpse.

245
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,380
They walked out into the light past the three downed androids near the crawfish boil and

246
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,900
decided to return to contention, determined to cross Drew off their list.

247
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:34,700
As they departed from the funeral setting, the massive, gaunt creature reappeared, screaming,

248
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,980
and they took off running.

249
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,260
At the entrance, they ran into the old woman in the wheelchair.

250
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:45,580
With massive, deranged eyes, she sobbed at the sight of the repeating men.

251
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,620
John Lee Kevinmore pushed her wheelchair toward the parking lot.

252
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:56,100
The creature had no hair, big red pupils, eye slits that opened from the bottom, and

253
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,740
it wore a familiar black suit, cried out into the sky as it pursued the group from

254
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,900
behind.

255
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,300
John gave the old woman his gun as they approached the empty parking lot.

256
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:17,700
Empty that was, until a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse drifted across the lot toward them,

257
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:25,380
and all could see behind the wheel sat Drew Andrews, the Baby Drewver.

258
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,820
Behind them, the creature spoke, and it somehow forced everyone to freeze in place.

259
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,780
Their bodies locked, and they turned to face the creature.

260
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,620
It didn't speak aloud, but they heard it inside their heads.

261
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,580
It apologized and spoke of a glitch.

262
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,180
There could not be two Clark Bishops.

263
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,740
The creature addressed each former officer by name and revealed Keith's full name,

264
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,540
Ashley Keith Beans.

265
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,260
He became flustered and pulled his gun, but he couldn't fire.

266
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,380
Clark's face turned red with rage, unable to move, and Kevinmore twitched helplessly.

267
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,620
The creature thought inside their heads, implored them not to be afraid, and a calming wave

268
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,420
overtook each upset man.

269
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:22,020
The old woman, finally at peace, closed her eyes and exhaled for the last time.

270
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:27,540
Drew whipped the car around, saw the creature, and screeched to a stop a few feet away.

271
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,380
The creature repeated itself in their minds.

272
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:36,140
It sought information on the Clark glitch, and was willing to trade knowledge.

273
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:45,340
It introduced itself as 43629 DC FBI, and it confirmed it was alien, better than human,

274
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,820
from Myriad.

275
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,700
Keith pulled out the ring they retrieved from Jim Cook's house and claimed to be Jim trapped

276
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,500
in Keith's body.

277
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,100
The creature from Myriad was ecstatic to hear this news, and was quick to communicate something

278
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,220
in its strange manner to seemingly no one in sight.

279
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,260
When Clark asked how Jim and the creature knew each other, it confirmed they worked

280
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,580
together at Myriad.

281
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:16,300
John convinced 43629 to reveal more information about its discreet co-worker so they could

282
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,940
do something nice for him on his birthday.

283
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,620
The creature obliged.

284
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:29,020
Jim's birthday was on December 1st, and he always visited Prairie Pie in the city.

285
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:35,420
The creature asked if Jim was in Keith's body to repair the relationship between Myriad

286
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,740
and just James in regards to Operation San Ferra Blum.

287
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,860
He said yes.

288
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,140
Clark told the creature what they knew about Clark Old, and the alien reached out its long

289
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,540
arm toward the group to wipe their memories of this conversation.

290
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:58,620
It didn't work, but believing it had, 43629 just turned and left.

291
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,300
As Drew pulled around in front of the group, he leaned out the window, a bit too cool for

292
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Drew.

293
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,180
Hello, contention police officers, please get in the car and come with me.

294
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,820
The gang, excited to see Drew, hopped in and took off.

295
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,100
Drew let them know he'd been unable to receive any calls or texts due to having gotten wet,

296
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,940
which destroyed his phone.

297
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,180
The contention boys explained John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirst's whole situation, that they've

298
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:33,140
killed or soon will kill Marvin Glass, and that Keith killed the Duke, which was actually

299
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,140
Keith's brother, Ferguson Beans.

300
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,140
Drew ran down the current state of contention.

301
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,940
Pastor Adam Cain, aka Daddy, took control of the town.

302
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,380
The First Creek Family of Contingent created a network of puddles for the survivors to

303
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:58,180
hop into if they saw the residue, which only animals, kids, and insane people can see.

304
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:05,280
They captured the ooze using fish, and Daddy Pastor Cain collected it in a central location.

305
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,200
They hatched a plan to grab the watch from Keith's room at Hotel Motel, but after extensive

306
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,440
questioning, the boys smelled something fishy in Drew's attitude and speech.

307
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,160
John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirst's eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he thought

308
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,840
real hard about whether or not they should trust Drew.

309
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:34,440
Deep in the void of John's memories, where they reached out and met the collective unconscious,

310
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:40,360
John saw a reflection of his father, John Lee Pettymore the Third, in a blank television

311
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,400
screen, but he was much younger than the body John currently inhabited back in reality.

312
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,280
The TV turned on, and the screen showed the contention police station as it was last seen,

313
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,680
an absolute wreck with water pooled everywhere.

314
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,920
The channel changed.

315
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:03,020
Jim Cook briefed three people, and John recognized the faces from the file in Marvin Glass's

316
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:08,700
compound labeled K-Cel, Kyle, Karen, and Kevin.

317
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:16,860
Kyle, the unknown who died at Kevin's forced hand, Karen, also known as Ann Love, the woman

318
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:24,540
who killed Clark Bishop's parents, and Kevin, John's daddy, John Lee Pettymore the Third.

319
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:31,620
On the television screen, Jim called Karen over to speak privately, and the channel changed.

320
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,120
Back in the mess of a police department, Drew leaned on a plastic service cart and

321
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,560
headed to the evidence locker.

322
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:46,020
He loaded up the radio, the helmet, and a briefcase that contained $5 million, his cut

323
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,280
from the deal with the Duke.

324
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,980
The channel changed again.

325
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:57,560
Drew pushed the loaded cart up through the now emptied sanctuary of the First Church

326
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,980
of Contention.

327
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,940
The TV turned off with a click.

328
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,940
The charcoal glass of the screen rolled down like a car window as Karen screamed,

329
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,580
WHERE IS IT?

330
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,920
Clark's parents, Eustace and Jerry Bishop, at gunpoint, refused to tell Ann Love what

331
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,700
she wanted to know.

332
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,500
Behind the lowered screen of the television sat a book made of strange, uncured leather

333
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,900
with hair and maybe a few freckles.

334
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
John blinked.

335
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,740
The television screen suddenly looked completely normal again.

336
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,620
He stared at his father's reflection.

337
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,000
Karen laughed maniacally as she shoved the gun into Jerry's mouth.

338
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,740
She forced Eustace to watch.

339
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:50,340
John felt a decision being made inside himself.

340
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,780
Kevin turned to Karen.

341
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,580
THE BOOK ISN'T HERE!

342
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:02,820
Karen's eyes lit up as she began chanting in an alien, ancient tongue, and Clark's parents

343
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,220
began to rise off the thick carpet on the floor of their living room.

344
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,380
John's vision again changed perspective completely.

345
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:19,860
A man's left hand was outstretched, a trickle of red flowed across the soft skin.

346
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:28,700
Suddenly Drew leaned in and kissed a ring on a finger that dripped with blood.

347
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:35,000
John came to in the car and asked Drew to pull over as convincingly as he could without

348
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,620
arousing suspicion, which amounted to pleading and saying he was about to shit his pants.

349
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,260
After some resistance, Drew pulled off down a quiet road next to an empty cornfield, and

350
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,620
as soon as the car stopped, John pulled out his gun and aimed it at Drew.

351
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,980
John demanded the keys, and Clark put him in handcuffs.

352
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,920
John explained his vision as they gave him a pat down.

353
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,700
Drew confessed he was tortured and forced to give the items to the church.

354
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,980
In their search, they discovered a small, cheap piece of carpet in Drew's pocket.

355
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:15,580
Apparently, he would intentionally choke himself with it in order to see things he shouldn't

356
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,060
be able to.

357
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:23,020
Apparently, that's how he was able to find the boys at the city cemetery.

358
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,380
Keith shoved the carpet in Drew's mouth and said, Tildy B. Mitchell.

359
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,640
Drew choked for a few minutes.

360
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,620
When he caught his breath, he told them she was still alive, but she was trapped somewhere

361
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,740
she can't escape.

362
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,780
In the distance, Drew noticed a black lab bounding up to them, and with reckless joy,

363
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,100
he screamed out, Tyler!

364
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:54,300
Well, Tyler, a black lab that belonged to Councilwoman Carrie Pages, had gone missing

365
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:00,140
on December 2nd, and Drew's face brimmed with affection as he gushed that Tyler was the

366
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,340
bestest dog that had ever existed, and he was afraid Tyler had been eaten by homeless

367
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,840
people.

368
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,800
Clark noticed the slip-up.

369
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,920
Drew repeated verbatim what Councilwoman Carrie Pages had said several days before.

370
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:21,000
Keith tricked Drew into admitting she was, in fact, Carrie Pages.

371
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,480
Exposed, Drew Carrie spilled the details about how they switched bodies at the church with

372
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,800
the radio under Daddy Kane's direction.

373
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,060
The contingent boys struck a deal with Drew Carrie.

374
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,440
She would be a double agent for them.

375
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,480
They threw the handcuff Drew Carrie into the trunk and took off.

376
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,160
Tyler the black lab sat comfortably in the passenger seat.

377
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Their destination?

378
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,020
Hotel Motel.

379
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,020
Their goal?

380
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,080
Acquire the watch in Keith's room safe that he took off his dead brother's wrist, the

381
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,600
same watch their father, William Beanes, had given Ferguson so many years before.

382
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,040
As they approached contention, they reached a blockade made of church pews with a sign

383
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,920
that pointed off to the side and indicated the path of a detour.

384
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:17,120
The group pulled over, continued on foot, and left Drew Carrie in the trunk.

385
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,960
Uncereptitiously, the boys traveled along the highway.

386
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,220
In the distant skyline, a massive wall of water surrounded the property of the First

387
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,600
Church of Contention.

388
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,640
Clark stared.

389
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,040
He couldn't contain his obsession with the fish flopping around inside this enormous

390
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,680
unnatural water wall.

391
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,800
At Hotel Motel, all of the doors were open.

392
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,640
A dunking booth sat in the middle of the parking lot, and a young, larger boy with round cheeks

393
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,160
sat precariously atop the trapdoor-style chair.

394
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,000
He stuffed his face with cheesy ziti and surveyed the area.

395
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,960
This omnomny lookout was easily fooled by Keith's quick disguise.

396
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,720
Mud spread across his face like a beard.

397
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,360
The inside of Keith's room at Hotel Motel was ransacked, but luckily his safe and the

398
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,040
watch inside it had remained hidden.

399
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,680
He stuffed the watch in his pocket and left, but when Keith rejoined the group, he handed

400
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,140
the watch to John, who promptly put it on.

401
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:31,660
As the watch slid on, John's consciousness phased out of reality, like a TV changed channels.

402
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,380
He found himself in contention, as it was in the 1880-somethings.

403
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:45,660
All the wet grass suddenly dried, the dirt turned to dust, and he saw a man face down,

404
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,280
unmoving.

405
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,760
Suddenly he saw a mostly buried metal door with an inscription that read,

406
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,440
Pettymore Forevermore.

407
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,120
The watch slid off.

408
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,640
John shared his experience with the others and slapped the watch on Clark, who saw the

409
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,620
same foreboding vision, but instead of John's door, Clark saw Chief Maggie Cook's house

410
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:12,120
floating in the air, his door buried within, and the inscription read,

411
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:19,680
1522518195518, the numbers for The Overseer.

412
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,620
Another watch swap, Keith saw the same scene in the Old West, just outside the new town

413
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,140
of contention.

414
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,840
He saw a man face down in the dust, unmoving.

415
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,460
He saw his hands tremble, and he rolled the body over, the man was dead.

416
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,980
A tri-folded piece of parchment fell out of the man's pocket, it was a job advertisement

417
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:53,540
that read, we is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight, plenty of work, hesitate not.

418
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:58,880
The watch slid off Keith's arm and he let out a small scream.

419
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,260
Clark tripped over the edge of sanity and pinned Keith to the ground.

420
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,740
He ripped off the watch and threw it away, but John grabbed it and slapped it back on

421
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,720
his own wrist.

422
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,340
The watch traded hands several more times back and forth before they found out that

423
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,400
by joining hands, they could all share the foreboding sights.

424
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:26,700
They saw Tildy B. Mitchell walk slowly backwards into Bean's pond, steadily, until the water

425
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,540
rose above her head and she disappeared from sight.

426
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:37,280
The channel changed, they sat in a tavern, their own face reflected in the mirror behind

427
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,240
the bar, but they wore the thick hand-stitched clothes of the dead man from out on that old

428
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,060
dusty road.

429
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:49,960
The barmaid refilled their glass and attempted some friendly small talk, so you're the new

430
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,080
miner in town, who rode ahead looking for a room?

431
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:01,240
Three men, each in their own vision, affirmed her query with a nod, well, welcome to contention,

432
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,400
Silas Cole.

433
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,720
Another channel change, a hooded figure lurked in the shadows.

434
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,740
Suddenly, light flooded in and illuminated a decrepit and haggard Clark Bishop.

435
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:20,600
Inside this tomb, he read a strange book made from uncured leather.

436
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:28,200
Blood dripped from the spine, a tall, gaunt creature entered and croaked out in its unnatural

437
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
speech.

438
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:45,760
The two figures charged each other and a blinding light cleansed the interior of the tomb.

439
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,400
Just then, the three contention officers entered the empty mausoleum.

440
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:57,760
They carried the casket of Ari Manstein, they sat it down gently and closed the door behind

441
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,820
them as they left.

442
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,280
After a bright flash of light, the scene changed.

443
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,120
Three individuals, two humans and one towering translucent creature in a black suit, stood

444
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
in an old abandoned warehouse.

445
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,440
Moonlight streamed in from the cracks and holes in the roof and reflected in puddles

446
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,240
of stagnant water on the ground.

447
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:27,120
The creature from Myriad handed a manila envelope to the two humans, a man and a woman.

448
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,080
Inside, there was a drawing on a small piece of paper.

449
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,200
It was a circle encircled by six circles.

450
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,640
Another bright flash of light, James the mill worker dragged these two now lifeless bodies.

451
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,040
From above, they saw the two corpses at the bottom of a man-made pit and then there was

452
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,560
a time lapse of the bodies as they bloated and changed color.

453
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,320
A real Clark Bishop fell into the pit.

454
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,320
A final flash of light revealed Chief Maggie Cook.

455
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:06,680
She gave orders to a looming overweight man in an all-black combat uniform.

456
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,440
He had a large scar over his right eye.

457
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:18,600
Charged with his mission, the android created by Myriad headed off to James the mill worker's

458
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,880
house.

459
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,880
After the visions from William Beanes' watch, they returned to the real world and stepped

460
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,280
back from each other.

461
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:31,160
Clark saw the black ooze pouring out of John Lee Kevinmore the third.

462
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:36,400
It dripped from his eyes, ears, and mouth all the way down to his hands.

463
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,640
It was on Clark and Keith's too and a string of ooze bridged all six of their hands, drizzled

464
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,120
down and collected on the ground.

465
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,680
It moved toward Clark but he blinked and it was gone.

466
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,800
A truck nearby idled and a man's voice hollered,

467
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,960
All right, come on out of there, Randy.

468
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,320
We can do this the easy way or you can disappear.

469
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,640
How much worse can you possibly get?

470
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,840
You don't want to give daddy a shot, he can go back and fix everything back to normal.

471
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,680
We need more bodies, Randy.

472
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:18,780
Keith recognized the voice of Terrence Elizabeth Licker from Lickers Lickers as he shouted

473
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,660
at Randy Angst.

474
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:27,220
Keith Vigna angry relayed that Licker had shorted him three dollars and shook up his

475
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,300
beer.

476
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,460
They headed toward the voice, guns out with Vigna in front.

477
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,720
Keith made his way to the side of the house and peeked at the idle truck.

478
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,520
The truck bed layered with tarps was filled with water and fish as well as Jimmy Sanders,

479
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,020
the manager of Subtropolis and John Lee Pettymore's cousin, who called in the oil spill several

480
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,220
days earlier.

481
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:57,580
His eyes were wide and wild and he muttered something about a number four with no tomato.

482
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,320
Keith ran for the keys of the truck and turned it off.

483
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,560
John popped out to get Jimmy's attention and the hippie's eyes widened.

484
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,460
Terrified at the sight of John, he dipped down into the water.

485
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,740
John looked into the living room and watched T. Licker and another man, Luca Fade Fudgevitz,

486
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,280
shove Randy Angst down onto the carpet.

487
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,440
When the truck shut off, the two men turned their attention outside.

488
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,520
Inside the truck, Keith opened the glove box and found a mag light and a folded up picture

489
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:35,080
of himself, Keith Vigna, with an inscription that read, Collect Alive.

490
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,780
John attempted to pull Jimmy Sanders out of the water, but Jimmy dove right back in.

491
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,680
Fade and Luca saw John and Keith as they exited the house.

492
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,900
Fade approached Keith, crowbar drawn, and Luca reached into his back pocket.

493
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,860
Clark crept inside and told Randy Angst to find cover.

494
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:58,180
Keith drew his gun, pointed it at his own head, and threatened to fire if they moved.

495
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:04,660
John, with no grace whatsoever, shot Fade in the shoulder, yelled to drop their weapons,

496
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,980
and used the truck as cover.

497
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:12,360
Luca dropped the crowbar and left a trail of blood along the white paint as he slumped

498
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:18,040
back into the garage door and then down onto the driveway.

499
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,280
Terrence Licker pressed his gun against his own head.

500
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,620
Think you can play games with me?

501
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:29,440
Clark sprang from behind, grabbed the gun of T. Licker, and wrestled him to the ground.

502
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,580
Keith smashed Terrence in the mouth with his own mag light and sent teeth flying out into

503
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,580
Randy Angst's front yard.

504
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,620
John zip-tied Luca's hands together, and Clark retrieved the loose gun on the driveway.

505
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:51,580
Keith rolled Licker over, grabbed his wallet, removed three one-dollar bills, and smiled.

506
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:57,940
Beat and shaken, Terrence explained they gathered bodies for Daddy Pastor Kane to sacrifice

507
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,660
so he could go back in time to fix everything.

508
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,140
Daddy said Keith Vigna was especially important.

509
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:11,100
John shoved a piece of carpet from Drew Carey into Terrence's mouth and demanded, Daddy.

510
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,140
A few seconds of choking later, he coughed it up, looked at John Lee Kevin Moore the

511
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:21,300
3rd, and freaked out, you're one of them, it's in you.

512
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,220
John caught a brief reflection of himself in the rearview mirror.

513
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,180
Black ooze ran out of his eyes, nose, and ears.

514
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,620
He dove into the truck bed pool, the teeming puddle with Jimmy Sanders.

515
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,460
John felt the strangest sensation.

516
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,540
His head vibrated and heated up, and then a sudden feeling of comfort washed through

517
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,140
his cranial cavities.

518
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,460
He resurfaced.

519
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:54,780
There was an overpowering smell of rancid fish, and John vomited back in the water in

520
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,700
which he and Jimmy stood.

521
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:03,340
Jimmy looked over calmly, unafraid of John for the first time, and in the lull, Randy

522
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,900
stumbled out of his house, but something was off.

523
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:12,460
Randy didn't remember the encounter with the robot man at James the millworker's house,

524
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,820
but he did say Pastor Kane had been a real dick since he lost his family in that car

525
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,980
accident a few days ago.

526
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:25,500
Terrence blamed the crash on the three contentioned police officers, and Clark, Keith, and John

527
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:32,660
noticed Randy's cane was topped with a Rubik's cube instead of a tooth.

528
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,020
It was clear that this somehow wasn't the same Randy Angst.

529
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:43,460
Similar, sure, but their Angst was a dentist and a realtor, and the head of the contentioned

530
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,660
historical society, and a lover.

531
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,380
This Randy Angst was the director of the Children's Museum?

532
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,460
The trio, disassociated with their current reality, acted a bit rashly.

533
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,160
Clark barged into the house, knocked Randy to the ground, and screamed into his face

534
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,740
about who he was and who he was not.

535
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:11,900
Keith pulled his gun, fired wildly, and put a stray bullet directly through Fade's head.

536
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,820
Pushed further past the brink, he noticed the ooze that dripped down John's face.

537
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:23,180
Keith aimed the gun at John, and ordered him to get back in the water.

538
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:28,780
Clark smashed Angst's head into the linoleum floor, then realized what he was doing and

539
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,220
meekly apologized as he backed out of the house.

540
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:38,060
John resurfaced, momentarily rid of the ooze that consistently dripped from his orifices,

541
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,060
if one was in a certain frame of mind.

542
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,820
And off in the distance, they heard the rumble of vehicles.

543
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,320
The contention police posse piled into the truck and drove off, intent to grab their

544
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,540
original car, Drew Carey, and head to Bean's Pond.

545
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,500
John took the driver's seat, Keith called shotgun, and Clark jumped in the truck bed

546
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,700
to play with the fish.

547
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,180
Suddenly, two vehicles approached, one from either end of the street, a truck with a hot

548
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,860
tub in tow, and an Impala with a refrigerator on its side strapped to the top.

549
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,100
In the Impala, John could see Asher and Avery Little, the parents of the two children that

550
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,700
were absorbed by the goo in front of James the millworker's house.

551
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,700
John punched it into reverse, cut through a field, and the two cars attempted to tail.

552
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:34,180
One sweet handbrake 180 later, John hit the road unaccompanied, foot all the way down

553
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,860
on the gas.

554
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,940
They pulled along agent Trent Chad's red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse, where they left Drew

555
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,900
Carey, and Clark hopped out of the truck bed, sprinted to the trunk, and threw Drew

556
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,320
Carey and Tyler, the black lab, into the fish-filled tarp-tub truck bed.

557
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,500
The two vehicles in pursuit were able to catch up while the unlikely protagonists collected

558
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,480
their co-worker's body and their double agent's dog.

559
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:06,220
But a gruesome scream came from the Impala refrigerator as the Littles pulled up.

560
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
Glass shattered.

561
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:12,020
A body was snatched up and slammed into the side of the nearby truck.

562
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,220
That truck's driver climbed out the window and attempted to jump into the hot tub, but

563
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,580
something nabbed his foot and dangled him mid-air.

564
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:25,060
A blink revealed the thickest wave of ooze yet.

565
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,740
The driver, being slowly consumed by the inky substance, desperately grabbed onto the man

566
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,420
already in the hot tub, only to seal his fate as well.

567
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,180
The ooze ripped the two men up into the sky and slammed them down into the concrete below,

568
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:47,480
repeatedly leaving bright red smears across the cold ground.

569
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,060
With the whole group somehow intact, John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd peeled away.

570
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:59,260
In his rear-view mirror, John saw the incomprehensibly massive wave of ooze crashing forward slowly

571
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,740
but relentlessly toward their vehicle.

572
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,660
They soon reached a roadblock.

573
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:10,980
A crane, loaded heavily with construction tube pipes, intentionally blocked the highway.

574
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,060
John went to whip the truck around the obstruction, but a tire caught an edge.

575
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:21,260
The truck turned over, smashed into the ground, and all five occupants were thrown clear of

576
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,300
the vehicle.

577
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,220
The truck continued to roll, tumbled into a billboard for owls, tires, and tigers, and

578
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,720
exploded.

579
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:35,200
The discombobulated set of sitting ducks saw Gary Daley emerge from a storm drain.

580
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,360
He shrieked and hollered for them to join him in the sewers.

581
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:45,440
As they looked back, the officers saw a massive surge of ooze, bigger than any they had seen

582
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,600
before, and it steadily flowed toward them.

583
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:54,360
Clark picked up Drew's unconscious body and carried it toward Gary, who had popped his

584
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,920
head out of the storm drain.

585
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,920
A disoriented Keith got up from on top of Jimmy Sanders, and he and John helped him

586
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,080
toward the sewer with Tyler on their heels.

587
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,760
After they confirmed Gary's identity with a fact only he would know, the wrecked crew

588
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,920
dove down into the drain.

589
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,920
Gary, eyes covered by his hands, explained that the goo only chased you if you looked

590
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
at it.

591
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,760
Gary led the group through the tunnels while they discussed John's body swap situation.

592
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,360
Also, Gary was tripping a bit, apparently so he could see the goo when he needed to.

593
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,680
He was especially perturbed by the goo that dripped from John's orifices.

594
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,720
Gary expressed how much he'd been hoping to see them since the events of the last couple

595
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
days.

596
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,740
He described how the pastor put up a wall of water around his church, developed a strong

597
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,280
following in the town, got everyone to start calling him daddy, and said he would be able

598
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,800
to go back in time to fix everything as long as they got a hold of Keith Vigna.

599
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Gary then pointed them toward a blog post from Harold Dorsey that had been wiped from

600
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,120
the internet.

601
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:10,520
The post was entitled Operation Samfara Blom and a Rogue Police Chief in Contention.

602
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:17,160
It described Dorsey's experiences in The Scrap Pit and The Den of Sin, as well as his new

603
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,120
investigation in Contention.

604
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:27,480
Maggie had been in touch to, quote, open people's eyes and talk to him about Samfara Blom, the

605
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,040
flowers in the city, Jim Cook, the Circle of Knowledge, Bar Corps, and the mill on the

606
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,920
other side of the city.

607
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Maggie appeared spooked by the murder of her father and called off the arranged meeting,

608
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,280
so Harold was going to find her.

609
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,200
The boys confirmed this was all true.

610
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,120
Gary said he could get them wherever they needed to go through the tunnels, so they

611
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,200
set off for Maggie's house and Bean's Pond.

612
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,960
On the way, they entered an underground chamber where Gary Daley, Harry Klinker, and others

613
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,920
had set up a makeshift campsite.

614
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,040
As they approached, Mildred Mitchell ran into a tent away from a woman who was questioning

615
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,040
her.

616
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:14,040
Casey Kristoff, a janitor at the First Church of Contention, leaned against a column and

617
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,880
read a book.

618
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,600
Harry was relieved to see them all safe.

619
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,600
Gary introduced Clara Blankenship, a woman from the city.

620
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,800
She was here visiting friends whose cat had disappeared and who recently joined the First

621
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,760
Creek family of contention to find the kitty.

622
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,680
The FCFC collected all the animals in contention behind the fish wall.

623
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,980
They discussed Clara's tattoo, which portrayed a robed figure that carried a ball of light.

624
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:47,380
It was inspired by a crazy dream she'd had a couple years ago of this figure pulling

625
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,160
a ball of light out of a television.

626
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,020
Not really paying attention to the important conversation, Keith noticed that Casey seemed

627
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,680
to be listening in rather than reading his book.

628
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:07,700
Harry and Clark used smelling salts to rouse Drew Carey, who was over the moon to see Tyler

629
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,700
again.

630
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:14,820
She confirmed her assigned task was to bring the trio back to the FCFC so daddy could hold

631
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:20,400
them accountable for the death of his family and also use Keith to time travel.

632
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,860
The officers explained the body swap situation to the others in camp to everyone's astonishment.

633
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:32,400
Then they asked Gary about his experiences with magic, the spell he cast on them as children,

634
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,920
and the book they found.

635
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,560
They asked Gary what he did with his spell book and he began to weep.

636
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,960
He'd given it to Clark's parents.

637
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,780
He was scared that's why Eunice and Jerry were killed.

638
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:52,180
Gary's grandfather received the book from a figure that looked like the one on Clara's

639
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,800
tattoo.

640
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,540
John reported a similar figure had given him a note in binary that confessed he had killed

641
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,020
the chief's father, Jim Cook.

642
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,080
The figure also asked John to say hi to him for him.

643
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,020
Clark remembered an incident in the library when he was young.

644
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,920
Gary confirmed Clark's memory.

645
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,220
That figure from the tattoo had locked them in the library and was chased away by the

646
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,760
tall gaunt creatures in suits.

647
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,400
Claire then showed them a video from John Peters that had been scrubbed from the internet.

648
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:31,360
He spoke about a strange vision he had during his coma in which he was led to a parallel

649
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:38,440
dimension by a man with a black Nike bag who could burn folks with his hands.

650
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,580
Clara queried what a black Nike bag had to do with another world or a person who could

651
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,060
burn folks with his hands.

652
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:51,980
John explained his uncle, Don D. Pettymore, had the ability to burn things with his hands.

653
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:57,780
Don called it devil hands and it was mostly used as a party trick so John didn't think

654
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,780
much of it.

655
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,360
But when Clark asked Clara if she'd seen anyone with hot hands in their dreams of the

656
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,580
robed figure, it jogged John's mind.

657
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:12,480
The last time he'd seen his uncle, they were being pursued by those translucent gaunt

658
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,260
alien things in black suits.

659
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:20,560
John needed to know more so when Keith pulled out the watch he'd stolen from Ferguson,

660
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,120
John snatched the timepiece and slapped it on himself.

661
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,080
The channel on John's reality began to change as expected and then it stopped and he saw

662
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,140
the kitchen of his childhood home.

663
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:37,800
His daddy, John Lee Pettymore III, younger than John ever remembered seeing him, paced

664
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,880
back and forth anxiously.

665
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:46,800
His face turned hopeful as John's mother entered the room but she slowly shook her head no

666
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,640
and tears poured down her face.

667
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,040
Her husband rushed to embrace his shaking wife.

668
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,880
Her body convulsed rhythmically to the sobs as a negative pregnancy test fell from her

669
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,000
grasp onto the cold tile floor.

670
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,400
The channel changed.

671
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,860
John saw his daddy again, eyes completely wide and bloodshot, knuckles white as he gripped

672
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:17,460
the steering wheel of his black 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.

673
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:23,660
Backlit by a home completely engulfed in flames, he looked into the rearview mirror to make

674
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,220
sure he wasn't being followed.

675
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,860
He spoke into a large car phone.

676
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,380
The vector adopted by the Cain family has been eliminated.

677
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,280
Casualties unfortunately include the rest of the family.

678
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:44,840
A Fincher-esque aerial shot of this entire scene slowly zoomed in on the fire and a young

679
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:49,640
boy crawled out from this completely consumed building.

680
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:55,400
He had a balloon-shaped head and eyes so dark the irises looked black.

681
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,240
Back to John's black muscle car as he drove off into the night.

682
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,500
The camera did that cool thing where it moved through the license plate into the trunk and

683
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:11,360
there a baby swaddled in a black suit jacket laid on top of adoption papers.

684
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:16,180
Back in the contention sewer tunnels, the watch fell off John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth's

685
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,180
hand.

686
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:24,380
He slumped to the ground wide-eyed, dazed, and he repeated three words over and over

687
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,980
to himself.

688
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,140
The vector.

689
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:37,280
As John dry heaved, Keith confessed he'd seen tall gaunt things in black suits when he was

690
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,280
a kid.

691
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,840
They'd invaded his family's estate from the sky.

692
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:49,360
Alarms blared, he and Ferguson ran, security was able to take care of the translucent intruders.

693
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:54,280
That night Keith watched their father give Ferguson the watch.

694
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,540
William said Ferguson was going to be, quote, the savior.

695
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,700
And when the time came, the watch would fit.

696
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:08,660
Now that Ferguson was dead, Keith wondered if maybe he was the savior.

697
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,620
After all, the watch did fit him.

698
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,820
He proved it, and reality changed channels like before.

699
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,420
Suddenly Keith saw Bean's pond.

700
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,380
Three figures stepped over his vision toward the pond.

701
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,080
As Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and John Lee Pettymore the Thirth approached the bank of

702
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,000
Bean's pond, John trailed the other two by a few yards.

703
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,200
Focused on searching for something in the water, Clark and Keith failed to see their

704
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,600
partner betray them.

705
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:46,320
John raised his gun, took a deep breath, and fired two shots, one for each of them.

706
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:52,560
He quickly finished the task with four more bullets, crouched down, and pulled the watch

707
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,420
off Keith's inert wrist.

708
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:04,300
John stood, slipped the watch over his bloody hand, and walked slowly into the frigid water

709
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,100
of Bean's pond.

710
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,420
Clark and John saw Keith's eyes readjust to their underground reality.

711
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:19,660
However, unlike the other times when one of them came out of a vision, the watch remained

712
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,180
on his wrist.

713
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,680
Keith and John's eyes met, and John saw a great fear.

714
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,920
All Keith could see was the black ooze that poured from every orifice on Pettymore's face.

715
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,920
He stammered.

716
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,400
He'd just seen them all die at the pond.

717
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,920
Keith turned back to the goo-covered face of his partner, John Lee Kevinmore, and weirdly

718
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,160
asked him to please hand over his gun.

719
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:52,020
John moved a hand to his holster, and everyone else in the room nervously sought cover.

720
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,840
Keith whispered what his vision revealed into Clark's ear.

721
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:01,220
The paranoia was growing, so the trio decided to share what they had seen in order to grow

722
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,220
some trust.

723
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:07,880
John said he'd seen confirmation that he was a child of destiny.

724
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:13,200
His daddy, Kevin Lee Pettymore, was sent to kill the Cain family.

725
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,420
He set fire to the house, but Adam managed to escape undetected.

726
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:23,600
More importantly to Kevin, the Cains had recently adopted a little baby.

727
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,280
Pettymore stole the baby, adoption papers and all.

728
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,060
That baby was John Lee Pettymore IV.

729
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,480
He was meant to be Adam Cain's brother.

730
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,480
But he was so much more than that.

731
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:45,060
In the vision, Kevin radioed over to K cell that he had quote, eliminated the vector adopted

732
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,320
by the Cains.

733
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,260
He, John Lee Pettymore IV, was the vector.

734
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:58,720
Clark told John that Keith's vision was of Kevinmore III executing them so that he could

735
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,780
have the watch.

736
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,040
The three argued which of them was most likely to be the savior.

737
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,280
Keith, whose family possessed the watch that recently stayed put on his wrist.

738
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,360
John, the original vector, the ball.

739
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:19,760
Or Clark, the overseer and future founder of the circle of knowledge in the past.

740
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,160
The tension grew and grew until Keith silenced them with the thought that maybe the real

741
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,340
deal here was the three of them needed to come together.

742
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,360
Maybe they needed each other, like pieces of a puzzle.

743
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,280
John agreed, they could all potentially be vectors.

744
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,880
And Clark reminded them the spell Gary put on them as children was meant for all three.

745
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,120
If there was only to be one quote, chosen one, why would the spell work on three?

746
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:52,480
To make Keith feel better, John handed over his pistol but immediately regretted his decision

747
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,560
and pleaded for its return.

748
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,760
As the disagreement continued, the tent at the far end of the underground chamber rustled

749
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,160
and out popped a haggard Mildred Mitchell.

750
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,760
She held out a piece of paper in one hand but promptly put it in her back pocket and

751
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,600
held up a picture with her other hand.

752
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,120
Flustered, she sputtered that the picture had changed just then in the tent.

753
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,720
She said it was John and then boom, it was Keith.

754
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:24,520
Mildred shoved a picture of the founders of contention into their faces.

755
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,200
In the picture was Silas Cole, but she was onto something.

756
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,080
It wasn't the Silas Cole the officers remembered learning about in school.

757
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,760
That Silas Cole was an extremely handsome man.

758
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,740
This Silas Cole had a familiar face.

759
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,800
It was Keith Vigna.

760
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,640
Clark was the first to put it together.

761
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,920
Whoever wore the watch would become Silas Cole.

762
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,000
Mildred Mitchell shoved the picture in Keith's face and pointed to a faint reflection of

763
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,100
a figure that resembled her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell.

764
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,600
Mildred blamed Clark for Tildy's presence in the picture.

765
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,860
Clark replied he wasn't the one who loaded and pulled the trigger on the strange gun

766
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,560
that sent folks to the past.

767
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,640
Tildy had done that herself.

768
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:16,960
During this brouhaha, Keith tried to take the watch off to see how it affected the picture

769
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,520
of himself as Silas Cole, but it didn't budge.

770
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,440
The thing wouldn't move.

771
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:29,300
Frantic, his panic grew and grew until he snapped and lunged at Mildred Mitchell.

772
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:36,360
Keith tackled her to the ground and viciously slammed his fist down onto the frail old woman.

773
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:42,000
Clark and John were able to pull Keith off of her, but not before he had beaten Mildred

774
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,520
unconscious.

775
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,960
Keith looked down at his bloody hands and puked.

776
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:53,520
The sick hit a piece of paper that had fallen out of Mildred's pocket in the scuffle.

777
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,600
On it, she had written,

778
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,920
I'naha for Sa Saia.

779
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,680
Harry and Gary approached with guns drawn on Keith.

780
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,760
John put himself between them and Keith as he tried to calm tensions.

781
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:13,280
Keith, frightened and embarrassed, fled down the sewer tunnel that led to Bean's Pond.

782
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,620
Harry had a dream that if things got too heated, everyone would die.

783
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:23,920
He swiftly and forcefully told the contention officers they needed to leave.

784
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:30,840
Clark asked if Harry and Gary would still be willing to keep an eye on Drew Andrews.

785
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,840
And they agreed.

786
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:37,680
The air in the underground chamber was so thick with regret and loss, it was hard to

787
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,880
breathe properly.

788
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:45,840
And after turning their backs on the only citizens of contention who had trusted them,

789
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:51,800
John and Clark followed Keith down the sewer tunnel toward Bean's Pond.

790
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:57,600
As they walked through the underground cylinder, Keith continued his attempt to rip the watch

791
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,040
away from the skin on his wrist.

792
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:05,720
Tears streamed down his face, and Clark and John attempted to console their partner as

793
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:11,760
they all avoided stepping in the shit sludge that slowly flowed between the walkways that

794
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,600
ran along the sewers underneath contention.

795
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,260
The trio discussed the probability of each one of them being the savior of contention

796
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,300
and perhaps the world.

797
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:28,680
John made things interesting by insisting they take bets on who was actually the chosen

798
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,680
one.

799
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,760
When they arrived beneath the street across from Bean's Pond, they looked out the drain

800
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,040
and saw there was no water in the pond.

801
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,280
It had been completely emptied.

802
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,700
All that was left was a muddy concavity and a mostly buried metal door.

803
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,560
But the three contention police officers saw three different additional objects at the

804
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,200
bottom of this barren basin.

805
00:56:54,200 --> 00:57:00,320
Clark saw a large aquarium filled with an absurd amount of fish as well as one gaunt

806
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,600
little boy.

807
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,640
But there were so many fish that the boy couldn't make it up past them to break the surface.

808
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,340
He was stuck, drowning.

809
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:16,480
John saw Adam Kane wearing an odd motorcycle helmet with glass tubes and a red light lit.

810
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,920
He drew his gun and ordered the pastor to remove his helmet.

811
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:26,880
Keith saw that same helmet sitting in the mud next to the half buried door, green light lit.

812
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,440
A gunfight broke out while the contention police officers were still very much unaware

813
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,920
of what was real and what was not.

814
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,680
Their grip on reality took a toll, but they were able to eliminate their opposition, which

815
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:46,400
turned out to be Asher and Avery Little, the parents of the twins, Aiden and Alice Little,

816
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,320
that unknowingly sacrificed themselves to an ooze-filled vacuum bag in an attempt to

817
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:58,640
save James the mill worker, who still died just two or three episodes later.

818
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,920
Suddenly, the trio felt their perception shift back to what they considered standard.

819
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:12,080
However, that reality included a six-story-tall wall of water encircling Bean's Pond.

820
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:17,160
Ice formed on the water as fish broke the surface and then broke the theory of gravity

821
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,240
as they fell sideways back into the vertical pool.

822
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,640
And across the empty pond on the opposite bank, just inside this water wall, Casey Kristoff

823
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:34,380
held a pistol to the back of Kerry Page's body's head.

824
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:40,720
Next to them, Adam Kane gripped the handlebars of the four-wheeler and donned the strange

825
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,800
motorcycle helmet, red light lit.

826
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,480
Strapped to the back of this four-wheeler was the unnatural radio, green light lit.

827
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:57,320
And atop that bizarre electronic airwave communicator, an extremely determined black cat utilized

828
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,440
his claws and held on tight.

829
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,420
Surrounded by the water wall, this standoff on either side of the muddy basin stayed still

830
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:11,420
for slightly a second before Keith Vigna rushed down toward the metal door buried equally

831
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,480
in between the two groups.

832
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:20,400
However, he ate shit on his drop-in and slid face-first down into the empty bowl.

833
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,760
Pastor Adam Kane took the four-wheeler tips down directly toward Keith Vigna.

834
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,080
Guns were drawn and aimed, but Casey Kristoff threatened to execute Drew Andrews in the

835
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:36,360
body of Councilwoman Kerry Page's if Clark or John fired at Adam Kane, the former pastor

836
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:42,600
of the First Church of Contention with unsettlingly black eyes and a balloon-shaped head.

837
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:47,260
The current daddy of the First Creek family of contention whipped the back end of his

838
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:53,580
four-wheeler around and sprayed Keith Vigna, already face-down in the stuff, with even

839
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,960
more mud.

840
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,900
And Agent Trent Chad in the body of Salem, Dr. Marie Jacobs' cat, turned on the strange

841
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,460
radio and prepared for a body swap.

842
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:08,480
But Keith wasn't going to let his consciousness get ripped out and stuffed into the body of

843
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,140
a cat without a fight.

844
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:15,360
He shoved his mechanical cocaine finger deep into his nasal cavity and sniffed like his

845
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,280
life depended on it.

846
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,200
With the glass family special powder coursing through his veins, Keith pulled himself up

847
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:28,760
from the mud and smashed one of the odd glass tubes on the radio, just before Agent Cat

848
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,680
Chad could initiate the switch.

849
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:39,760
Pastor Daddy Adam Kane, furious, grabbed a fish from his saddlebag, lifted it above his

850
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:46,380
head and crushed the creature over the odd motorcycle helmet, which activated the green

851
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,380
light.

852
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:52,540
And suddenly, the former contention police officers were forced to face very real visions

853
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,940
of their biggest regrets.

854
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,820
Clark saw the Kane family burning up in their minivan.

855
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:04,400
John watched Aidan and Alice Little become enveloped in the ooze.

856
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:10,340
Keith relived the murder of his only brother, Ferguson.

857
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:16,740
When the party snapped back to their current existence, they realized time had passed.

858
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:23,040
Agent Trent Cat had disarmed John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd, and Adam Kane was in the process

859
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:32,860
of dragging Keith Beans toward the half-buried metal door, which began to slowly slide open.

860
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:39,200
The next six seconds were an absolute whirlwind.

861
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,400
Daddy Kane dragged Keith toward the open hatch that, for some reason, existed at the bottom

862
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,080
of Beans Pond.

863
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:52,240
The sound of a fired gun matched up perfectly, with Casey Kristoff's trigger hand exploding

864
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:57,440
and spraying blood everywhere like a water balloon popped in slow motion.

865
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,800
Drew Andrews took advantage and grabbed the fallen gun that had just been pointed at the

866
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,540
head of the body he occupied.

867
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:10,900
John looked down and saw that Agent Trent Cat had filled his pistol, named Seth, coincidentally

868
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:15,880
the same name the Kane family originally gave to John, with mud.

869
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:21,760
And as Keith failed in his attempt to fight off Adam Kane, the two of them crashed down

870
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,980
into the hole in the ground, and the metal plate closed back over the top of them.

871
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:34,240
In that underground room, Keith saw that Kane had been knocked unconscious by the fall,

872
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:40,440
which broke the glass tubes fixed to the strange helmet on Adam's head.

873
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:46,720
Above ground, in the muddy basin that was once Beans Pond, John Lee Kevinmore slammed

874
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,260
his fist down on the closed, half-buried metal door.

875
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:56,760
With advice from John, Keith fired his pistol into both of Kane's feet, and then continued

876
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:02,980
into an elevator, his only forward path in this new and underground space.

877
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:09,440
After he descended even further into the earth, Keith arrived at a blast door, which he opened

878
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:16,460
by spinning a heavy metal wheel and lifting a thick metal hatch.

879
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:24,680
Beans entered an unfamiliar underground laboratory in a cave furnished with file-covered workstations,

880
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:31,260
busy shelving, and massive copper vats housed under a giant rock ceiling.

881
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:37,740
And across the enormous lab, there was another blast door with a round window, a porthole,

882
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:44,980
where the viewer could potentially see whatever it was that was being kept on the other side.

883
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:51,580
In the files and paperwork, Keith found blueprints for three familiar-looking objects, a gun,

884
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,960
a radio, and a camera.

885
01:03:53,960 --> 01:04:00,740
There were also a bevy of phrases listed, written in a seemingly ancient and alien language.

886
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:07,220
The goal of one specific incantation seemed to be eternal life, but there were myriad

887
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,820
side effects listed.

888
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:15,540
Finally, Beans found the project called Manipulating Activator Robot.

889
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:23,900
Versions A through X were a bust, but Manipulating Activator Robot Y had been a success.

890
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:34,480
That project created silver balls, one inch in diameter, and the acronym spelled M-A-R-Y.

891
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,780
Mary.

892
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:41,420
Back above ground, John and Clark yelled to the now-safe Drew Andrews that his body was

893
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,600
secured down in the sewers.

894
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,140
But suddenly, Anne Love appeared.

895
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:52,200
She revealed herself to be Casey Kristoff's Hands Executioner, and greeted her old cellmate

896
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:57,900
Kevin as Clark aimed his weapon at this woman who murdered his parents.

897
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:04,420
She calmly explained that had been done on orders from Jim Cook.

898
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:11,220
After Casell fucked over Marvin Glass by stealing all of his cocaine, Jim initiated what was

899
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:17,300
left of his team, literally just her, into the Circle of Knowledge.

900
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:24,100
Down in the previously undiscovered laboratory below Beans Pond, Keith Beans recited the

901
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:29,180
words of the spell the document suggested imparted eternal life.

902
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:36,540
His words, however, encouraged his bones to vibrate unnaturally, and his nails began to

903
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:43,960
pop off like keratin popcorn, and then BOOM, a hearty thud came.

904
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:52,460
From something on the other side of the closed, thick metal blast door.

905
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:57,560
Clark Bishop, John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth, Drew Andrews and the body of Councilwoman

906
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:04,160
Carrie Pages, and Anne Love stood in the empty Beans Pond and traded information as Clark

907
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:09,760
and John attempted, unsuccessfully, to open the impassable metal plate.

908
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,800
Clark lied when Anne asked about Leon Simpson's whereabouts, but she was practically congenial

909
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:21,300
as she answered questions about Maggie Cook's brutal takeover of the Circle of Knowledge,

910
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:28,100
and the necessary death of Maggie's own father, her and Kevin's handler and Casell, Jim Cook,

911
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:31,620
due to the revelations of the overseer.

912
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:38,160
She went on about San Ferra Blum and its ability to pacify entire populations, though it didn't

913
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,640
work well enough on Clark's parents.

914
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:48,120
As for Myriad, Anne believed it was a shadow organization that actually ran the government.

915
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:53,260
Drew explained that Adam Kane performed the body switch between him and the Councilwoman

916
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,240
after Drew was kidnapped by Fade.

917
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,720
Clark and John explained how to find Harry and Gary, who were babysitting Drew's body,

918
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:07,680
down in the sewers, and sent him off on the four-wheeler with the broken radio and Agent

919
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,320
Trent Catt.

920
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:14,880
Clark Bishop and two-thirds of the bodies from Casell stared down at the impassable

921
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,600
metal plate when suddenly the water wall came crashing down.

922
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:27,160
The pond, no longer held back unnaturally, roared back into the muddy basin it had previously

923
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,640
called home.

924
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:33,800
Clark was able to swim through the rushing swell, but John's new body, with the modifications

925
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:40,080
the Glass family had implanted in Kevin, sank, unable to rise up to breach the quickly

926
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,960
ascending surface.

927
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,460
But Anne Love wasn't going to let her old Casell colleagues stay down.

928
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:52,480
She chanted in an unfamiliar tongue, Kevin Moore's heavy metal body unnaturally moved

929
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:58,520
up and after a moment emerged with a gasp for air from the bionic man.

930
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:04,840
Anne continued her incantation and Clark watched in awe from the shore as she and John stood

931
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:10,800
on the surface of Bean's pond as if it were solid ground.

932
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:18,080
Back down below the impassable metal door in the underground laboratory, a nail-free,

933
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:25,380
impossibly curious Keith Beans peered through the porthole on the thick metal blast door.

934
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:31,940
On the other side, he saw a skeletal creature with skin so thin bones protruded into the

935
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,380
dank air.

936
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:40,460
Her nail beds matched Keith's and bruises and lesions covered the body of this teenage

937
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,460
girl.

938
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:48,520
But even through her hideous transformation, Keith recognized Tildy B. Mitchell.

939
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:55,440
With pure hatred in her eyes, she shrieked and slammed her fragile frame into the door

940
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:00,000
of her seemingly eternal prison cell.

941
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,020
Keith startled and shaken fell backwards onto the ground.

942
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:09,720
The watch on his wrist seemed to activate a small compartment in the ground next to

943
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,240
where he landed.

944
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:18,760
In this hidden chamber, there sat an odd revolver adorned with glass tubes and a green

945
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,400
light lit.

946
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:25,780
He searched the rest of the floor and found one more clandestine cubby which contained

947
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:30,660
a silver metal sphere about one inch in diameter.

948
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:36,200
Keith pulled out the crumpled picture of himself as Silas Cole turned it over and recited the

949
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,440
words written by Mildred Mitchell.

950
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,040
Again, Keith's bones vibrated.

951
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:50,400
But then, the metal that formed his upgraded glass family body heated up and his skin,

952
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:56,160
starting with the coke finger, unzipped and bisected the back half from the front half

953
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:01,760
as all the metal detached and fell off of his skeleton.

954
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:08,800
His alloy septum hit the ground with a clank and cocaine poured endlessly from the skinless

955
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,800
face.

956
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:16,400
Empty skin just draped over a partial skeleton and then, with nerve endings still popping

957
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:23,300
off like the finale of a fireworks show, the pain indescribable, his bones reformed and

958
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:30,240
his skin sealed itself back around his natural, original physique.

959
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:35,920
Ironically though, being biologically made whole again demanded the little that was left

960
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,240
of Keith's mental stability.

961
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:45,840
Unhinged, Keith walked over to the workstation, stuffed his pockets with blueprints and notes,

962
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:53,060
grabbed the strange gun, already loaded with an old, oddly large single bullet, smiled

963
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,360
and pulled the trigger.

964
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:04,400
A blinding flash of light dissipated and Keith Bean stood on the dirty, sandy road to contention

965
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,880
in the year 1880-something.

966
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,540
He immediately stripped nude, ran toward a man in the near distance and called Silas

967
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:21,640
Cole by name as he sucker punched this stranger whose life and name he was about to take.

968
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:27,320
Keith snapped Cole's neck before the man could speak, rolled him over and a tri-folded piece

969
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,220
of parchment fell out of the jacket pocket.

970
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:35,700
It was a job advertisement for the contention mining company and it read,

971
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:45,980
We is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight, plenty of work, hesitate not.

972
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:52,100
Anne's miraculous rescue of John Lee Pettymore from the Bean's pond deluge left John Lee

973
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,780
Kevinmore III and Clark Bishop shook.

974
01:11:55,780 --> 01:12:00,700
Anne cackled at their shookethness and after they expressed desire to learn, she agreed

975
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,360
to teach them the spell.

976
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:09,940
It allowed her to do many things, even walking through doors or leaving folks inside walls.

977
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,620
Clark's heart sank.

978
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:17,340
He announced he no longer wanted to learn the incantation.

979
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,720
Anne turned the conversation toward the book.

980
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,720
She needed it.

981
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:25,360
The overseer was coming and if the circle of knowledge didn't have the book, Maggie

982
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,080
said that would be the end of everything.

983
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:34,200
John and Clark played it cool and didn't let on that the overseer was likely standing

984
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,440
right in front of her.

985
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:40,960
They asked what this overseer was supposed to do when he came.

986
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,480
According to the revelation of the overseer, Jim would die.

987
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:52,680
Maggie believed it was, as the phrase went, only through death that he may rise again.

988
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,120
The overseer founded the circle of knowledge.

989
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:59,280
It was only fitting he would come back at the end of everything to save it.

990
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:05,080
Considering the door at the bottom of Bean's pond said Keith was the savior of the world

991
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:12,640
and he believed Clark to be this all-important overseer, John asked Anne if hypothetically

992
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:18,380
there was a third cool thing for a third special person.

993
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:25,040
He was given the answer when his shattered sense of self betrayed the ruse that he was

994
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:31,960
indeed Karen's K-cell partner, Kevin, and he revealed that he was ball.

995
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,200
Anne was curious about its mindset.

996
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,000
Did it think it was human?

997
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,280
John was all too familiar with balls, or vectors as she called them.

998
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:48,120
K-cell's mission had been to eliminate the vectors that were implanted in babies at Cole's

999
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:56,080
orphanage, New School under modern etiquette, and to wipe all records of its existence.

1000
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,140
John fumed.

1001
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,380
Clark asked Anne to define her goals.

1002
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:06,480
The best case scenario, based on what Maggie told her, was to acquire the book in order

1003
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,200
to summon the overseer to save the world.

1004
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,400
Anne made an offer.

1005
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:16,480
If they showed her the book, she would get them through the impassable metal door at

1006
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,680
the bottom of Bean's pond.

1007
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:24,040
Clark and John turned their backs in a huddle to confer and decide the best course of action.

1008
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:31,120
A decision was not reached before a chanting Anne surprised them both by driving a large

1009
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:35,480
knife down through John's skull.

1010
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:40,720
Clark speared her back down to the ground and wrapped his arms around her windpipe.

1011
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:48,320
John shot her in the knee, and Clark dug his fingers into the squirting, fresh wound.

1012
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:55,040
Anne clenched her jaw so fucking tight, her teeth shattered, and she spit the shards into

1013
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,600
Clark's face as she broke his grapple and resumed chanting.

1014
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:08,560
This new incantation telekinetically pushed her blade deeper into John's skull, and blood

1015
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,040
gushed down his face like a chocolate fountain.

1016
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:17,680
As John screamed and fell to his knees, Clark saw the knife move further down through the

1017
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,040
back of his throat.

1018
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:26,880
Anne jumped up and kicked down onto the butt of her knife, and John fell face first, unmoving

1019
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,600
into the sloshing mud.

1020
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,800
She turned to Clark and demanded the book.

1021
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,240
He was stunned.

1022
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,480
Why did she kill John?

1023
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,040
Her answer was simple.

1024
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,480
The vector was her mission.

1025
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:48,820
John Lee Kevinmore the Thirth, face down in the mud, felt his ball reach out to the collective

1026
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:54,280
unconscious of the entire universe to pick out specific memories.

1027
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:01,040
His vision showed Gary Daley pass a book made of uncured leather with acne and stretch

1028
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:05,560
marks along the binding over to Eunice and Jerry Bishop.

1029
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:11,520
Reality turned and changed, and inside the Bishop home, Clark's parents hid the book

1030
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:20,000
in a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry below their television inside a hidden compartment

1031
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,080
within the entertainment center.

1032
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:30,960
Barely clinging to life, John lifted his knife-clogged head from the muck in the mire

1033
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:36,280
and told Anne he knew where the book was.

1034
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:43,520
Anne chanted swiftly withdrew her blade, made a bloodletting cut on her own hand, and a

1035
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,620
stream of her blood coagulated to fill the vacant wound.

1036
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,100
Clark's mind snapped.

1037
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:55,140
He ripped the knife away from Anne and mirrored her actions step by step.

1038
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:03,900
He chanted, made a cut on his thumb, and similarly, the blood flowed over and into John's orifices,

1039
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,220
healing him.

1040
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:09,040
This new power confirmed Clark's suspicions.

1041
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,720
He was the overseer.

1042
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:17,620
He screamed as he executed the woman who killed his parents.

1043
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:21,880
They didn't need her anymore.

1044
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:29,860
Clark Bishop plunged Anne Love's own knife into her skull, and she died.

1045
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:35,060
As they walked to the Bishop house, the pair heard screams from the direction of the First

1046
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,120
Church of Contention.

1047
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:44,720
Clark assured John that when they found the book, the return of the overseer, his return,

1048
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:48,300
would fix everything.

1049
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:53,560
When they arrived, John revealed a false compartment beneath the television.

1050
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:59,840
Inside his entertainment center, Clark found a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry.

1051
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,180
He remembered the words of his mother.

1052
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,260
Life is like the bonus round.

1053
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:07,040
We were already given the best letters.

1054
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:14,700
He typed in R-S-T-L-N-E and the door unlocked.

1055
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:21,840
Inside was a book bound in uncured leather with some acne scarring and stretch marks

1056
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,460
on the spine.

1057
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:28,620
Clark grabbed the book, and his vision turned blank.

1058
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:33,300
Suddenly he stood in the abandoned water park Splashylvania.

1059
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:39,500
He looked up at the two-fanged plunge, and Julie Maxwell fired a bullet through Leo Piston.

1060
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:45,560
Clark raised his firearm and shot Julie Maxwell, whose body joined Leo's as they slumped and

1061
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,220
slid down the pair of intertwining waterslides.

1062
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,660
Then he was in the street outside of Dr. Marie Jacobs' house.

1063
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:59,220
He saw James the mill worker float off the ground as Aiden and Alice Little bravely held

1064
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,460
a vacuum up to the man's feet.

1065
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:08,820
The vacuum bag burst open, and a squeamish black ooze covered the twin children.

1066
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:13,020
Clark saw the children fight violently against the muck that encompassed them.

1067
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,380
He looked over to John.

1068
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:19,100
The residue dripped from every orifice in his face.

1069
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:24,740
With another blink, Clark sat in a cage with a gaunt young boy above a debaucherous crowd.

1070
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:31,840
Electric shocks racked their bodies, and the ceiling slowly descended.

1071
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:37,700
Clark didn't want to do it, but it was either one of them died, or they both died.

1072
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:43,660
Clark pushed the boy back into the juice box just as the ceiling came down, and squeezed

1073
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:47,380
the boy pulp all over the crowd below.

1074
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:53,620
Another blink, and Clark saw himself all over CSU campus in a grotesque montage, murder

1075
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:55,540
after murder after murder.

1076
01:19:55,540 --> 01:20:02,880
It culminated in the moment when Clark jammed a sharpened screwdriver into his own eye until

1077
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,700
the handle was flush with his socket.

1078
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:12,980
Blood dripped down his face, and Clark Bishop crumpled to the ground, limp and lifeless.

1079
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:13,980
Blink.

1080
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:17,140
Clark stood in the muddy water of Bean's pond.

1081
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:20,860
He knew what he was capable of, what he was.

1082
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:26,660
He buried the knife into Anne Love, the woman who murdered his parents.

1083
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,260
A final blink.

1084
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:31,060
He was back in the living room of his parents' house.

1085
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:36,500
His hands were covered in blood, and the blood moved between the covers of the book

1086
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:41,460
and formed new pages, a record of his actions.

1087
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:47,020
The book flung open, and these new pages flitted indecisively before they settled on a page

1088
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:53,000
on which Clark's blood formed the letters of a new incantation over a picture of a hooded

1089
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,900
figure that was clearly a young Clark Bishop.

1090
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:02,100
Compelled, Clark chanted the spell again and again.

1091
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:08,140
John saw a blinding flash of light, and then Clark disappeared as if he had never been

1092
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,500
there.

1093
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,660
Clark was gone.

1094
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,560
The book was gone.

1095
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:19,420
John pressed play on the VCR, laid down on the couch, and watched some Wheel of Fortune.

1096
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,720
But Clark?

1097
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:28,000
Clark stood in a dark alley on the night of December 1st, across from a man he recognized

1098
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,620
as Jim Cook, the man who gave the orders to murder his parents.

1099
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:38,920
The handler of Kacelle, a member of Myriad, the former leader of the Circle of Knowledge,

1100
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,480
Maggie Cook's father, Jim Cook.

1101
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,720
Clark remembered what happened next, he'd seen it in a dream.

1102
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:50,360
Before he could think, Clark pounced on him, his hands wrapped around Jim's neck as he

1103
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,360
growled.

1104
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:55,320
They didn't have to die, they didn't have to die, you couldn't find it, they didn't

1105
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,320
have to die.

1106
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:04,000
His grip tightened, and Clark Bishop felt the passing as Jim Cook's life was extinguished.

1107
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:43,280
Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor

1108
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,280
little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.

1109
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,680
Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor

1110
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,200
little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.

1111
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:58,600
Can't you hear the wolves howlin' all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor

1112
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:04,200
little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.

1113
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:17,520
Back in 1880-something, when this land was stolen and pioneer towns began to form, Keith

1114
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:24,760
Beans pretended to be Silas Cole as a miner in the mine that employed the town of Contingent.

1115
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:31,200
While down in the mines, Keith Bean came upon a familiar odd black substance, and he became

1116
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,900
obsessed with studying it.

1117
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:38,960
The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.

1118
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:45,480
He utilized blueprints he had stolen from the hidden laboratory underneath Beans' pond,

1119
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:50,200
and exploited the residue's unnatural qualities.

1120
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:54,040
Silas Cole became an inventor.

1121
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:59,160
He made so much money off of his inventions that he bought the mine.

1122
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:04,440
He built an office on the top floor of the tall, skinny mining company building that

1123
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,700
sat right above the mine itself.

1124
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:14,080
He harvested the substance and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.

1125
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:21,480
Keith Beans invented wild, magical things like ceiling fans.

1126
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:28,320
Each new invention brought him wealth and power, but also released more of this inky

1127
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,520
residue into his town.

1128
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:38,860
To satisfy his newfound hubris, he began working on the creation of a manipulating activator

1129
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:43,980
robot, or ball as they had been called in his past life.

1130
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:49,720
Versions A through X were a bust, but Y was successful.

1131
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:57,760
The project formed a silver ball, one inch in diameter, and Mary Cole was spawned.

1132
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:02,180
Sometime thereafter, Keith Beans got a blast from the future, his past.

1133
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:07,500
Tildy B. Mitchell appeared on his property in a blinding flash of light.

1134
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:13,660
He became paranoid that townsfolk would see her and realize he was also from the future.

1135
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:18,900
Consumed, he decided this town wasn't big enough for the two of them, and since Tildy

1136
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:23,580
B. couldn't exist, she made for an excellent test subject.

1137
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:30,620
But some of those tests turned her real rambunctious like he went to work on building a secret,

1138
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:37,020
subterranean workshop where he could hide her away and continue working on his inventions

1139
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:43,900
some of which he was scared to share with his newly minted confidant, Mary Cole.

1140
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:49,100
But before it was finished, the mutated Tildy B. Mitchell got out and caused some real trouble.

1141
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:55,560
She'd gotten loose before and took out basically the whole saloon staff, but this?

1142
01:25:55,560 --> 01:26:01,220
This was trouble with a capital T, which rhymed with C, and that stood for covered up barely.

1143
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:05,900
Shoot, there were suddenly four good people missing.

1144
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:14,820
Everett Pace, a homesteader, Professor Horace Green, a professor, Jack Perlman, a rancher,

1145
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:21,420
and finally Preacher Sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard all disappeared.

1146
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:24,580
The heat was on.

1147
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:32,420
We'll end here with the supposed words of Roy Bean, a horrible man and judge from Texas

1148
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:38,580
known for hanging folks who actually didn't really hang many folks.

1149
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:47,580
He allegedly said, you can't tell how good a man or a watermelon is till they get dumped.

1150
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,580
Hmm.

1151
01:26:48,580 --> 01:27:10,580
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.

1152
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:24,420
I have to hop in here to give the shoutest of outs to Haiku Jason.

1153
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:29,480
This fucker right here helped me out Peter Gabriel style big time.

1154
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:34,060
They wrote six episode recaps and they were good too.

1155
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,200
Jason earned themselves a shirt.

1156
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:43,420
So one final thank you to Jason, I Shot Marvin, Here Be Tigers, Crush 36, Stingray, and Dylan

1157
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:48,440
B. Y'all made this process so much easier to bear.

1158
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,320
Shirts all around!

1159
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:55,120
As for the rest of you, I sought advice from Taylor on what to say here and she said to

1160
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,360
just be honest.

1161
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:02,680
Well, the truth is I still really love playing Delta Green with my best friends and I still

1162
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:11,380
really love making this show, but I was completely unprepared for how much work this job over

1163
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:13,040
here in Korea was going to be.

1164
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:19,520
I signed up for like a hundred hours a month, easy peasy I thought, but I'm basically working

1165
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:25,600
full time with a commute on top and working with six to twelve year olds is fucking exhausting

1166
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,140
and it has clearly gotten the better of me.

1167
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:36,040
My contract ends in a little over two months and I am looking forward to having more time

1168
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:42,740
to deliver the quality content I believe in at the release rate I think you deserve.

1169
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:46,300
Even more than that, I'm just fucking stoked to keep role playing with my friends on a

1170
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,300
regular basis.

1171
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,480
I've missed it so much.

1172
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:54,600
So while I'd love to give you an exact date for our next episode and say that we'll be

1173
01:28:54,600 --> 01:29:01,100
back to the weekly format, I'm really afraid, like I'm really afraid I won't be able to

1174
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:04,300
deliver and that will destroy me.

1175
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,180
So as Taylor suggested, I'll just tell you the truth.

1176
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:10,320
Episode a hundred will be out as soon as I can get it finished.

1177
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,220
I'm shooting for like two weeks from now.

1178
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:18,680
From there, I do believe we'll be able to release on a more consistent schedule, but

1179
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:23,980
we do have some super fun irons in the fire, merch, bonus episodes, guests, it's all happening.

1180
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:29,420
Thank you all so much who have stuck by us and continued to re-listen to all the episodes

1181
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:33,460
and care about this story we've spent so much time creating together.

1182
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:39,380
I promise this is not even close to the end of pretending to be people.

1183
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:43,180
We have so much more smoke in the tank.

1184
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:48,460
Honestly, the thing I'm most scared of is trying to find a jam for season two that's

1185
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:55,640
even close to as bangin' as this new track I just heard like 85, 86 minutes ago.

1186
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:01,700
It was Kudzu with no backbone.

1187
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:06,220
Kudzu with no backbone.

1188
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:10,140
Kudzu with no backbone.

1189
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:15,260
Kudzu with no backbone.

1190
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:25,100
Kudzu with no backbone.

1191
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:28,300
Hot dog.

1192
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:51,340
The only one trying to pull over.

1193
01:30:51,340 --> 01:31:00,140
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

1194
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:06,140
With no backbone.

1195
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:10,140
No backbone.

1196
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:14,140
No backbone.

1197
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:18,140
No backbone.
