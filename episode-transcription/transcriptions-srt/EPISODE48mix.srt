1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
What's up my babies, it's your grease daddy Wolf the Dog, and I'm here absorbing all

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,220
the oil from all the deep fryers here in contention.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,200
The grease used here in the past is much better than the grease used in the present and the

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,280
future.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:26,620
So light a match and watch me explode baby, it's 694.2 PTBP and I'm here to ignite

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,900
your passion for local news and other happenings from the past.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,620
Speaking of happenings, we got ourselves a new Howlin' with Wolf.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,780
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from At Crafty Under Dash Creep, who tagged at

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,500
Pretending Pod in an Instagram post.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,940
They write, I would love to howl at my love bug Alec.

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,860
Thanks for turning me on to the best podcast and being the best partner ever.

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,620
Well crafty creep, I don't got much intimidating to say to you and your loved one.

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,860
It brings some joy to my small grease filled heart to hear about y'all.

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,380
I wish someone would howl at me in a loving manner.

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,300
Maybe one day, maybe someday, maybe someday.

16

24
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,880
You might not know, but Wolf has kids to feed.

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,100
How else am I going to fatten them up before I feast upon them?

26
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,700
The news is meant to be a time to remind our listeners of the past.

27
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,740
So you might not have to send your minds on such a difficult journey when remembering

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,640
all the nonsense that has gone on so far.

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,600
Now, if I pick and pull what I remember from my time in current day contention, it might

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,720
spoil some of the sweet niblets that are being served up in this story.

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,360
This fresh, fresh story.

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,160
We may be in the past, but I've seen the future and I know the best possible present

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,000
is Moondance by Blue False Indigo.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,940
She runs, she runs, she runs, ooh.

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:02,720
The sun, the sun, the sun is leaving soon.

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:20,920
She knows, she knows, she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,920
beneath the shadow of the moon.

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:36,760
So Joe, I'm going to game four of the, uh, was it NLDS?

39
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,560
Uh, yeah, uh, shit.

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Is it DS and NCS?

41
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,040
Yeah, I think it is.

42
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,260
Uh, going to game four, uh, which is in St. Louis.

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,260
Fuck yeah, dude.

44
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,260
Holy shit.

45
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,920
Yeah, I'm super, super stoked.

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,240
My dad is turning 60 on that day and so my brother and I are taking him to that game

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
for his birthday.

48
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Lucky.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Yeah, it's going to be dope.

50
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
That's super dope.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,800
Somebody I know was doing one of the Atlanta games.

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,080
Oh, I'd love to go back to Atlanta.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:12,120
I've only been once and it was when I was like 17, 18 years old and I was there with

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:20,900
my brother and my dad and a bunch of church people for a Christian conference and we,

55
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:29,440
this was at the end of my tenure in the church and during the candlelight vigil, the silent

56
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,140
candlelight thing, my brother and I skipped out on it to get extremely drunk at the hotel.

57
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,140
Like you do.

58
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,820
We, uh, there was a college basketball game on and we bought a really cheap bottle of

59
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:48,140
bourbon and we played a game where we each chose a team and then every time the team

60
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,740
scored, you had to do a shot.

61
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
A score?

62
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,740
Yeah.

63
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
What?

64
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,740
I was 17.

65
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,300
He was 21 and we were children in monsters and we got so drunk.

66
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,380
That was the night he died of alcohol poisoning.

67
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,380
Oh yeah.

68
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,380
Yeah.

69
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,380
Rip.

70
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,820
Um, we're taking his corpse to game four.

71
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
Pretty cool.

72
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,220
My ghost brother to buy us tickets.

73
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,140
Uh, so we, we get really drunk and then we change into our swimming trunks.

74
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,060
You got into like four shots in and then it was like, oh, nevermind.

75
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Uh, yeah.

76
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,100
We even made a thing where it was like, and on turnovers and dunks you take two shots

77
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,260
cause we're idiots and thankfully I don't drink like that anymore, but we're very drunk

78
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,740
in our swimsuits in downtown Atlanta and the pool was closed.

79
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,460
So we went to the weight room and maxed out on bench.

80
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,460
This is standard stuff.

81
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
Yeah.

82
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,420
And then we went outside for me to go smoke a cigarette right after doing that because

83
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:57,100
again, I was a monster and uh, and so we're outside and this dude comes up to us and he's

84
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,580
like, Hey, Hey, you guys have any money?

85
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,700
And we were like, no, no, not at all.

86
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,780
But uh, and like we pull out this bourbon from our bag, we brought it with us outside

87
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,740
and we're like, you want to get drunk with us?

88
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,300
His name was Orestes.

89
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Orestes.

90
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,780
Yeah, he's, he's, he was so funny.

91
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,660
And then we, uh, we talked with him for a long time before we decided we'd walk around

92
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,340
downtown, but we walked directly into the candlelight vigil that was happening from.

93
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
Oh my God.

94
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,340
The thing you were supposed to be at.

95
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,340
The thing we were supposed to be at.

96
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,980
That's great.

97
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Just drunkenly in our swimsuits, just like drunkenly wandering through this crowd of

98
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,460
and hoping desperately not to run into our dad who's hopefully not listening to this

99
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
podcast.

100
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,460
All right.

101
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
Ken Krinklehoff.

102
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,460
That's me.

103
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,460
How do you spell Krinklehoff, Joe?

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,460
Oh boy.

105
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,460
It's a C R I N K L E H O F F.

106
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,460
Cool.

107
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,460
That works for me.

108
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Yeah.

109
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
The professor's name is, he, he spells it a little different.

110
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,460
P H.

111
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
Sure.

112
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,140
You are heading to the woods in your mom's minivan.

113
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,820
She's driving you there because Ken, I just don't understand why you have to, why you

114
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,660
have to continue to do this, this yearly trip out into the woods.

115
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,380
Ken is in the front seat with his feet up on the dashboard and he's, he's very bored

116
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:31,620
looking out the window, maybe fiddling with a finger, mom, I mean, it's just hanging out

117
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,620
with some friends.

118
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,100
That's, that's all it is.

119
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
That's all it's ever been.

120
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
It's just hanging out.

121
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
Don't you think you're too old for this?

122
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,340
Going out and looking for ghosts or whatever the heck it is you all do?

123
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,140
To be honest with you, mom, kinda, I'm, I'm, there's a chance this is the last time you're

124
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
driving me.

125
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
That's all I'm saying.

126
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,260
Well, I'm certainly not going to let you drive to one of these little excursions.

127
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,220
Mom, Ash has a car.

128
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,340
I can, I can ride with him.

129
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,020
It'd be easier for all of us.

130
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:02,340
Well, you know, I do like Ash, but I just, I just don't trust that Pettymore boy.

131
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,220
Well, maybe you just haven't gotten to know him.

132
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,900
I think I've known him over the many years that he's been coming over to our house and

133
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,340
just causing all sorts of wreck and havoc all over the place.

134
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,900
I mean, it's just, it's just not who you're going to be.

135
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
All right.

136
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Yeah, you're right.

137
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,900
You're right.

138
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,180
You were born for more than this.

139
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,060
That's, that's true.

140
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,540
I, I'm not, I'm not like them these days.

141
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,180
That's, that's, yeah.

142
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,940
She reluctantly turns onto the little gravel road that says, has got a sign next to it

143
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,780
that says the contention woods.

144
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:41,420
And as she pulls onto the gravel, she's going to roll a drive check.

145
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,100
Nice.

146
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:52,260
And as she pulls onto the gravel, a little baby Fox jumps right out into the road.

147
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
It's trying to sprint.

148
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,540
It seems like its leg might be broken and it tries to cross the road in front of you.

149
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,980
And her reaction time is Nada.

150
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
She doesn't even see it.

151
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Mom, mom, mom, mom.

152
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,520
And she just crushes.

153
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:13,700
You feel this, mom, you just hit that wildlife ain't, ain't for nothing but game and sorrow.

154
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
That's cold shit.

155
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,980
Mom, you're going to have to learn one day that the world is cold shit.

156
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,060
I don't like you using that word.

157
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,740
And you guys pull into the parking lot, it's a gravel parking lot, and there are a few

158
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
cars there.

159
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:32,720
You do see two cars that one of which has a boot on it and the other has a piece of

160
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,100
paper taped up to the driver's side window.

161
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,820
You also see the 91 Firebird that Ash drives and then near the little shack, the little

162
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,740
Rangers shack right at the trailhead entrance.

163
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,940
Right next to that is an old Ford Bronco with a lift kit on it.

164
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Sure.

165
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,940
Does it have signage?

166
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
No, it's unmarked.

167
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
Gotcha.

168
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,940
But the plates are state level.

169
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,940
Gotcha.

170
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,200
Immediately your mom is like, well, at least, you know, there's some sort of authority presence

171
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
here.

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
They'll be watching over y'all.

173
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,700
Are you scared of stuff that could happen to me or are you scared of me doing stuff?

174
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Both.

175
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
You don't have to worry, mom.

176
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,620
Didn't you read that op-ed in the newspaper?

177
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,820
The Contention Chronicle says that we've got multiple people that are out here in the woods

178
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
they're missing.

179
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,820
You know?

180
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,340
So I just don't, I know that, you know, Officer Cox is working hard trying to keep everything

181
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,340
in line.

182
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,500
I trust our town's authority figures, just as everyone should, can.

183
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,500
You should trust your authority figures, currently me, but I do trust you.

184
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,780
It's just, I don't trust the influence that these boys are having on you.

185
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,740
Mom, you know me, you know, you know what you and dad have instilled in me.

186
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,260
There's no way that anything's going to happen tonight that you wouldn't be proud of.

187
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,860
Chris is a great man and I just want you, Ken, to grow up and be even better than he

188
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
is.

189
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,580
I mean, he is the number one used car salesman in contention.

190
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,500
He tells me all the time, I know.

191
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,540
If he wouldn't have snapped his knee, you know, he would have gone pro, but that's what

192
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,580
we're hoping for you, not the snap knee part, the going pro part, all right?

193
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,580
I know, I know.

194
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,220
You're going to lift this family up out of here.

195
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,420
Look, mom, we're going to roast some marshmallows, tell some ghost stories, and sleep in tents.

196
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
I did bring marshmallows.

197
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
Thanks, mom.

198
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
I love you.

199
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
I love you too.

200
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,240
She goes in for a kiss.

201
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,780
Just a little baby peck on the cheek for her little 14 year old boy, for her little baby

202
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
boy.

203
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,980
I go around the back of the car and I pull out those marshmallows.

204
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
Can I pull out a tent?

205
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,980
Yeah.

206
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,420
I got my tent and a sleeping bag.

207
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
I got my rucksack.

208
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,420
I'm prepared.

209
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I've done this a few years in a row now.

210
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,420
Exactly.

211
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
I know what I need.

212
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,100
So you get everything about the car and she's like, I'm going to park right here and I'm

213
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,500
not going to leave until I see you go up in there, all right?

214
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Okay.

215
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
That's fine.

216
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
That's fine.

217
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I love you.

218
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I love you.

219
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,900
I'm going to take whatever route I need to take that I can walk past that car that had

220
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
a note on its window.

221
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,100
I just want to read what that note says as I go.

222
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Yeah, for sure.

223
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,300
So it's just a notice that says if this car is still here on a certain date, like maybe

224
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,900
a week or two from now, that it'll get booted.

225
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Gotcha.

226
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,660
So I walk down the trailhead and every little while I check back and see if she's still

227
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:23,700
there and every time she is, I wave again, kind of exasperatedly each time.

228
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,720
And you make it up to the little shack, the little ranger's shack, and you hear a voice

229
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,660
come from inside of it.

230
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,980
Oh, hello there, weary traveler.

231
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,980
Hey.

232
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
Oh, hey.

233
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
Turtle me.

234
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,060
Hey there.

235
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
All right.

236
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,700
I know Jeb's not here, but my name is Woodrow.

237
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:48,500
It says right here, and he points to his badge, and he's like, but you can call me Buzz, as

238
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,860
that is my nickname.

239
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
Hey.

240
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,860
Hey, Buzz.

241
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
How are you tonight?

242
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,100
I'm doing quite well.

243
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,820
Just here to take a little inventory of those folks heading on into the woods this evening.

244
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,700
So if you wouldn't mind, step right up, and he grabs this Polaroid camera off the desk

245
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,420
in front of him, and he holds it up to you, and he snaps a picture.

246
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Oh, hey.

247
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,420
Oh, hey there.

248
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,420
Okay.

249
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
Fine.

250
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,420
What is your name, young sir?

251
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,420
I'm Ken.

252
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,420
I'm Ken Krinklehoff.

253
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,420
Oh.

254
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,420
I hold out a hand for a handshake.

255
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,380
Yeah, and he goes out and he grabs it, and he is like extremely frail.

256
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,980
You see that he actually has a cane at his side, and his hands are like shaking as he

257
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,860
goes out to shake your hand.

258
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,860
Good to meet you, Buzz.

259
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,100
I'm glad to know that somebody's out here keeping an eye on everything.

260
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,020
I know somebody's got to with all these people missing in these woods, you know?

261
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,640
And he kind of points back at this board, this bulletin board behind him, and you see

262
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,140
that there are approximately 20 pictures up on the board, and there are all these Polaroids

263
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,540
that have been taken in this exact spot with a piece of paper behind them.

264
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,080
And when he asked you your name, he wrote down Ken Krinklehoff on this sheet that looks

265
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
similar to those.

266
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,420
And he's like, I got a couple more questions for you.

267
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,980
What are you up to tonight in these here woods?

268
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,940
Oh, me and some friends.

269
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,460
We're going to be camping out here.

270
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,020
We've done it many years in a row.

271
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,060
Oh, you look to be about the same age as these boys.

272
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,820
And he points back, and you see there's pictures of Ash and of Jeremy.

273
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,300
Yeah, that's them.

274
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,980
I'm actually heading in there to meet them now.

275
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,420
Okay.

276
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,380
Bring anything with you that's not traditional camping gear?

277
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,380
Nope.

278
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,620
My sleeping bag here, and the tent, and, you know, the essentials.

279
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,620
Hmm.

280
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Yep.

281
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
All right, man.

282
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,620
One final question.

283
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:40,020
If you were to get startled and have to escape in any situation, maybe go run and hide somewhere,

284
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,940
where might it be that we could find you if we're out looking for you?

285
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,860
Hopefully that doesn't come to this, but where might we find you?

286
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,860
I'd definitely run back out here to the parking lot.

287
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,260
Yeah, that's a smart answer.

288
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,180
Your other friend said the caves over on the northwest.

289
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,340
Is it part of the woods, seemingly?

290
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,620
All right, well.

291
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,540
And you look behind him, and you see there are a couple of clipboards, and like a fire

292
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:12,460
extinguisher, and an ax, and a machete, and a flashlight, and that's about it in here.

293
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,520
Hey, Buzz, those missing people I've been hearing about that, have you guys got any

294
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,020
leads on that?

295
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,460
That's kind of weird that it's all happening all of a sudden.

296
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,020
It is very, very strange, and he points up to the picture of Jeb, who you might know

297
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,580
is the normal ranger who's out here, and he's like, they brought me down from the state

298
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:37,260
to try to clear all this up and keep these woods safe, and I'm a decorated veteran of

299
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,500
the ranger service, and I am here to make sure everything gets taken care of, sweeping

300
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,820
up the issues and whatnots.

301
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,900
But no leads?

302
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,300
Is that where them people going?

303
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,940
I have absolutely no idea.

304
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
Do you know?

305
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,940
I don't.

306
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,460
All right, Ken.

307
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,460
You checked around?

308
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,460
For what?

309
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
Missing people.

310
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Who?

311
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,460
The people that have been missing.

312
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
Have you looked for them?

313
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
Yeah.

314
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,460
What'd you say?

315
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Nothing.

316
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
It's okay, Buzz.

317
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,100
And as he's saying that, he's like rubbing his hands together.

318
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,140
He's like, all right, well, take care, I guess.

319
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Thanks.

320
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
Thanks, Buzz.

321
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
Hope we don't need to see you again.

322
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Well, on the way out, hopefully.

323
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,060
That would be a good time to see you again.

324
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,060
That's true.

325
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
Thanks.

326
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
See you in the morning.

327
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Bye.

328
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,980
Bye, Ken.

329
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,260
Is he watching me as I go?

330
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Yeah.

331
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,140
And your mom from the minivan waves and-

332
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,580
I give another wave.

333
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,900
You wave, Buzz waves, we all wave.

334
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,380
For Ken's mom, Krista Krinkelhoff.

335
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,980
Oh, Krista.

336
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:57,500
And who likes that?

337
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
What's up, guys?

338
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Hello.

339
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Hi.

340
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Hello.

341
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,340
For our listeners, you're hearing three voices that are not Thomas, Joe, and Luke.

342
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:11,100
And that is because I am a dumb, dumb idiot boy, and I decided to do something I've wanted

343
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:19,740
to do for a long time, which is run two different groups inside the same sandbox and see what

344
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
happens.

345
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,740
So first off, we have a brand new voice on the podcast, and that is our good friend,

346
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,740
Lindsay.

347
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,740
Hello.

348
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
My name is Lindsay.

349
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,740
What?

350
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,740
Whoa.

351
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,740
Welcome.

352
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,660
Welcome to the podcast.

353
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,260
I'm so sorry.

354
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,260
For yourself?

355
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
As for the way I've acted.

356
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
I'm sorry for the sins.

357
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
Yes.

358
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:49,700
You're going to need to do three Bloody Marys and four shots of gin.

359
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,660
So Lindsay, right off the bat, do you have any RPG experience?

360
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,660
Yeah.

361
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
Well, yes.

362
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,180
I am on a D&D campaign currently.

363
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
My first one.

364
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
Nice.

365
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,460
And are you enjoying it thus far?

366
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Yes.

367
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,460
And it's your first time role playing?

368
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Sort of.

369
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,900
I was in Thespians growing up.

370
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
That's sort of the same thing.

371
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
The Thespian Society?

372
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
The Thespians.

373
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Yeah.

374
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,220
I was in The Thespian Society too.

375
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,260
I don't know if our listeners would believe that or a bunch of drama nerds.

376
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,260
Yeah.

377
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,260
Shocker.

378
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,700
Lindsay, what's something fascinating about you?

379
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
About me in real life?

380
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Yeah.

381
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Okay.

382
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
This is the one I always use.

383
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,420
My great uncle by blood is Phil Jackson, the ex-coach of the Lakers in the bowl school.

384
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
What?

385
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,420
Yeah.

386
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
I don't talk to him.

387
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
I don't know him.

388
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
Sure.

389
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
Yeah.

390
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,940
My brother used to write him letters and stuff.

391
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
Oh my God.

392
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
Did he get a response?

393
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,940
Yeah.

394
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,940
He actually got some free tickets.

395
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
Wow.

396
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,940
I can't wait to know that.

397
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Can we offer that to our listeners?

398
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
Absolutely.

399
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
What's his address?

400
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,940
Oh my God.

401
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,820
Let's get that phone number, Asaac.

402
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
She's like the zen master.

403
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
I know.

404
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
He wears a crystal around his neck.

405
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,820
Oh my God.

406
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
Yep.

407
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Oh my God.

408
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
And so does Lindsay for the listeners at home.

409
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Oh yes.

410
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,820
Every day.

411
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,300
What is the crystal that you have around your neck right now?

412
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:11,060
The crystal that I have around my neck right now is this very special invisible, which

413
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,260
makes it more special, magic crystal.

414
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,240
And I'm not going to tell you what it does, so you're just going to have to watch out.

415
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,820
If you tell us what it does, will it not work anymore?

416
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Truly.

417
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
Yes.

418
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,180
I'm more of a fan of Bonam Veeve, but that's just me.

419
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Ali.

420
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,140
Ali Jepsen is also- That's a joke.

421
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,740
My husband makes jokes.

422
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,920
Oh, Taylor.

423
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,340
Thank you for pointing out my jokes.

424
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,380
I really hope that you do that throughout your entire tenure on this podcast.

425
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Can I just say joke every time you say a joke?

426
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,380
Yeah.

427
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,380
As long as you say it exactly like that.

428
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,380
Joke.

429
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,380
That was already different.

430
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,380
Ali, I don't appreciate you and I wish you would leave.

431
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Oh.

432
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
Got it.

433
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,380
Speaking of Ali.

434
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,380
Ali Jepsen.

435
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,380
Oh, can we say your last name?

436
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,380
Did I dox you?

437
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
No, you're fine.

438
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,380
All right.

439
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
Ali, welcome back.

440
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
Thank you for playing Brett.

441
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
Ah, yes.

442
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Of course.

443
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
On the podcast for our listeners.

444
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,380
Long live Brett.

445
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,420
Long live Brett.

446
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
Did Brett die?

447
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Brett died.

448
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
But he's a robot, you know?

449
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
Long die Brett.

450
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Robots come back.

451
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,420
Spoilers for the podcast.

452
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,300
Please, if this is your first episode, go back and listen to our back catalog.

453
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,660
You might just be here to listen to Ali and Taylor and Lindsay and that's fine, but the

454
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,220
story will be better if you- If you chose to start 50 something episodes

455
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
in.

456
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
True.

457
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
47.

458
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
You made a mistake.

459
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
This is Lindsay speaking and I have to say, I have listened to every single episode.

460
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
They're going to ignore our voices.

461
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,060
Cool.

462
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,060
Well, all right.

463
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,340
Um, I- No, every single- Sorry.

464
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,340
This is Zach.

465
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,860
Every single time that you speak, you should joke.

466
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,980
Taylor said that was Taylor.

467
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
She said that.

468
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,980
Joke.

469
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,660
No one takes my jokes.

470
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Hey, real quick.

471
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,880
Ali, what's your favorite joke?

472
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,220
My favorite joke?

473
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,220
What's the favorite joke that I've said?

474
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,800
Of all the jokes I've said.

475
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,740
When I was in fourth grade, I had no friends and I thought this joke will help me.

476
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,700
It was from my joke book and it said, what did the needle say to the thread?

477
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
I don't know.

478
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
What did the needle say to the thread?

479
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,300
The needle said, need a little help there?

480
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Ooh.

481
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
And?

482
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
And I still didn't have friends.

483
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Because friends of myself.

484
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,300
To this day.

485
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
To this day.

486
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,620
I don't know who any of these people are.

487
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,060
Well, thank you for being here.

488
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,100
I'm excited to have you both on and you are both part of-

489
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Basement cast.

490
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Yeah, a comedy group.

491
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
A comedy show.

492
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Me too.

493
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Can I be on it?

494
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
No, Taylor, you're not in the group.

495
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,380
We told you, you can only be in the one show.

496
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,580
And then never come back because you talked about anal beads.

497
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,420
I sort of thought that on the podcast was the appropriate time for me to ask to be on

498
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,900
the show because you can't say no to my jokes.

499
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Joke.

500
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,340
Taylor, you're basically a vet on the podcast.

501
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,340
Thank you.

502
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,860
Is that an appropriate time to say thank you?

503
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,860
Thank you.

504
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
Thank you.

505
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,620
It's a husband and it's a PDM.

506
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,620
PDM.

507
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,620
DM.

508
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,620
What?

509
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,620
The DM.

510
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,620
What's PDM?

511
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,620
The Game Master DM.

512
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,620
Yeah, welcome.

513
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,620
The Dungeon Master.

514
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,980
And if you had one extra hour of free time a day, how would you use it?

515
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,500
I would pet my cats.

516
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,700
Which one more than the other one?

517
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,220
You're not supposed to say which cat you like more than the other.

518
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,220
I like Ramona and Northern Ropo.

519
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
They can understand.

520
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,220
I know you feel that way.

521
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,220
Which makes me want to choose Ropo because she's lonely.

522
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,860
But I also kind of really like Ramona.

523
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,860
It's hard to say.

524
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,100
They're both such dynamic personalities.

525
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
They're so different from each other.

526
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,700
And that's enough cat talk for the podcast.

527
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Thanks for listening this far.

528
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
I'm just trying to get on the percast.

529
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Oh my god.

530
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Why didn't you say joke after that?

531
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,700
It's not a joke, it's the percast.

532
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
It's a podcast.

533
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,460
All right, we don't talk about other podcasts on this podcast.

534
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
That is disgusting.

535
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,700
And I'm going to tell Luke that you did that into his mic.

536
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Okay, Taylor told me that whatever his name is farts into this mic.

537
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,700
Thomas did fart directly into that microphone.

538
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,700
And I didn't change the screen for it.

539
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Oh, she's right up in it.

540
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,700
Wow.

541
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,700
I don't smell anything.

542
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,700
That was an appropriate time to inhale into the microphone.

543
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,700
But like I just said, if we could not do that during the recording session, that would be

544
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
phenomenal.

545
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
Inhale?

546
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
You are disgusting.

547
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
No inhaling.

548
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
On this show, otherwise I have to edit out.

549
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,940
Hold your breath and then talk.

550
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,940
Yeah, like a swimmer.

551
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,940
Can you hear this?

552
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Microphone etiquette is so easy to learn, so hard to master.

553
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,940
Why did you say it like that?

554
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
Ellie, stop laughing.

555
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
This is not a time for comedy.

556
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
You are being very inappropriate.

557
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
Let's talk about the characters you guys have made.

558
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:02,180
So like I said, we're going to be running two side by side stories, but it's only going

559
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
to start that way.

560
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,180
And these characters all go to the same high school, which is the Silas Cole K through

561
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,180
12 in contention.

562
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:14,180
A lot of different kids at this school and still not that many children there.

563
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
And some of them have gone missing recently.

564
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
We'll get into more of that later.

565
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
Allie, tell us about your character.

566
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,180
Judy Kringlehoff is my character.

567
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,180
She's great.

568
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,420
Judy goes to Silas Cole.

569
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,420
She's a senior.

570
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,420
She's a total outcast.

571
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:38,420
She is still wearing the same clothes she bought for freshman year, which are too ill-fitting.

572
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,420
They're like all tight and short, but in the wrong ways.

573
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Does she have like one of those Kringle shirts that when you buy it, it looks like it could

574
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
fit a doll and then it expands?

575
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,420
Yes.

576
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,420
Oh, she for sure has those, but they're like uncomfortably tight on her where you're like

577
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
This is not one size fits all.

578
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,660
She never says the right thing.

579
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,660
She's very anxious.

580
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,660
She's always nervous about stuff.

581
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
She just wants to be popular.

582
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,660
She wants to be popular and she wants to be in a relationship with the coolest gal at

583
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,660
school, but the odds are not in her favor.

584
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,660
And you have parents who have already been mentioned on this podcast because your younger

585
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,660
brother is Ken Kringlehoff, who's being played by Joe.

586
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
Ken.

587
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Ken is what I was never able to be.

588
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Ken's the star child and I'm not a disappointment to my parents, but they're not super proud

589
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:38,900
of where I am, which is like 17th row in band.

590
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,900
So I'm just like, they give me a tuba, but they're like, don't put your mouth on it.

591
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,900
Like just sit there with the tuba and pet it.

592
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
And that's what you'll do.

593
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
And that's what I do.

594
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,140
So Ken's like, you know, he's a, uh, he's a star athlete star athlete.

595
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,140
Like you said earlier, he's the star child.

596
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,140
So Alistair Huxley, Alistair Crowley, who's Alistair Huxley?

597
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:10,140
He wrote Brave New World and Alistair Crowley tried to bring about the star child.

598
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
Sorry, no big deal.

599
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,140
Just the spawn of Satan and not Ken Kringlehoff.

600
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,140
You were speaking of having a little crush on the coolest girl in school.

601
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,380
I have a crush on the coolest girl in school.

602
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,380
Well, she's not the coolest, but she's like the rebel of school.

603
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,380
And I'm so attracted to that, but she's kind of a bully to me.

604
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,380
And who is this monster that you're speaking of?

605
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,380
Her name is Liz.

606
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,380
Say your own name, Lindsay.

607
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,380
It's really hard to remember.

608
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
My name is Liz.

609
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:46,380
She only calls her Elizabeth cause she thinks it's more romantic, but that drives Liz crazy.

610
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,620
Liz goes by Liz and that's fucking it.

611
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,620
But Judy calls her Elizabeth because she thinks it's sexy and maybe one day Liz will realize.

612
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,620
That she's been in Elizabeth all this time.

613
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,620
That she's been in Elizabeth all this time and she's meant to be with Judy.

614
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,620
Judy and Elizabeth, man.

615
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,620
Juzabeth.

616
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
I ship that herd.

617
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
You ship it?

618
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,620
It's a teen term, guys.

619
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,620
All right, Liz, let's hear it.

620
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,620
What you got?

621
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,860
So Liz, you've already heard is like the rebel of school slash coolest in school.

622
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,860
But I mean, not really.

623
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,860
I'm not popular or I try not to be.

624
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
I don't know.

625
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,860
Picture like Rizzo.

626
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
Is that her name?

627
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
From Greece?

628
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Yeah, I thought you were mispronouncing Lizzo.

629
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
No, no, no.

630
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,860
That's what he said earlier.

631
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,860
That's why I second guessed it.

632
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,860
Rizzo from Greece, yeah?

633
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,860
Yes.

634
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,860
Yes.

635
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,860
The original Lizzo.

636
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,860
No, definitely not.

637
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,860
I'm sorry.

638
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
I take it back.

639
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,100
Lizzo doesn't deserve that.

640
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
No.

641
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
But yeah, picture me.

642
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
Picture me.

643
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
I'm Sandra Dee.

644
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Oh.

645
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,100
Get out of this room.

646
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
Don't picture that.

647
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
Look at me.

648
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
It's actually, fuck.

649
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
God damn it.

650
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Greece knowledge.

651
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Shit.

652
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,100
In high school, Zach played Danny DeVito.

653
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
I did.

654
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
I played Danny DeVito.

655
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
Danny DeVito in Greece.

656
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Oh my God, Zach.

657
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
As a sophomore in high school.

658
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,100
That's real.

659
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
That's real.

660
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
He did that.

661
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,100
I didn't know him back then.

662
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,340
It's okay, because I didn't know him.

663
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,340
That's our bedroom floor play.

664
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
Jesus Christ.

665
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
We didn't need to know.

666
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Look at me.

667
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,340
I'm just here.

668
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,340
I just love her voice so much.

669
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,340
All right.

670
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,340
Lindsay, let's talk more about Lizz and less about my high school musical career.

671
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Lizz Lonklin.

672
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
Okay, yeah.

673
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
So you're picturing Rizzo.

674
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,340
I'm picturing Rizzo.

675
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
I'm picturing Lizzo with an R.

676
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
The little rat from Muppets.

677
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
Oh, no.

678
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Like a lamb, not the rat.

679
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
Like a lamb, not the rat.

680
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Oh, shoot.

681
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
No.

682
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
That's not it.

683
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
That's not the right one.

684
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,580
So leather jacket, cigarette, Doc Martens, and bitch.

685
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,580
She's wearing a bitch.

686
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,580
She's wearing a bitch.

687
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
She also is a bitch.

688
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,580
Well, I'll try to find a way to love Lizz in our own way.

689
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,820
I'm sure by the end you will love Lizz.

690
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
I love Lizz.

691
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,820
Right?

692
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,820
Right.

693
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
You already love Lizz.

694
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,820
I love her so much.

695
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,820
Try to make a likable character that way when I kill it, it'll be better.

696
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,820
It'll be likable in some way.

697
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,820
All right.

698
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
Perfect.

699
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,820
Taylor, you're also here.

700
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:29,820
My name is Sharon Berryman, but I prefer to go by Shadow, and if anyone in this room doesn't

701
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,820
call me Shadow, I'm going to fucking lose my mind.

702
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,820
Oh, shit.

703
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
Just kidding.

704
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,820
Okay, Sharon.

705
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,060
My dad is listening to this, and I didn't say the F word.

706
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,060
I have never said it in my entire life.

707
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,060
I don't even know what it is.

708
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
Farts?

709
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,060
Farts.

710
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,060
I'm going to fart and lose my mind.

711
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:53,060
Okay, so Sharon Berryman used to be a cheerleader, like used to be popular, very bendy, come

712
00:29:53,060 --> 00:30:01,060
from money, and then a particular event happened in my life that led me in a different direction,

713
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,300
and now I'm obsessed with death in all forms.

714
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Wait, what are the different forms of death, please?

715
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,300
Well, like-

716
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
And first, how many are there?

717
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,300
New death, mid-death, old death.

718
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
Great.

719
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,300
Your classic deaths.

720
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:20,300
You know, like I hang out in cemeteries to get my old death.

721
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
I-

722
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Past death.

723
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Yeah.

724
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:30,300
I also, I like to spend time in funeral homes and attend funerals for like-

725
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
Current death.

726
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
My mid-death, yeah.

727
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,540
Oh, mid-death, right.

728
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,540
Yeah, but then I go to hospitals for like that new, new.

729
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
Oh, shit.

730
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
Jesus.

731
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Oh my God.

732
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,540
You're like 16 years old.

733
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
17.

734
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,540
The nurses at the contention clinic all know Shadow.

735
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,540
They're like, will someone get Shadow out of here again?

736
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
Shadow, get out.

737
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,540
How'd she get in here?

738
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,540
I used to be a candy striper, but then they kept finding me in the-

739
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,540
She's leering at the close to deads again.

740
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,780
Yeah.

741
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,780
She's like, but don't you want to die?

742
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,780
Well, the whole thing is like, I really want to speak to the other side.

743
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:11,780
So I sort of, it's like prudent for me to be there for all processes of death.

744
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
Yeah.

745
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,780
That absolutely makes sense.

746
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,780
So we are going to kick off actually role playing in three, let's get the music.

747
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Later Zach, put in the music right now.

748
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:48,020
So the story starts inside the public library of contention, a place that we have seen before.

749
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:53,260
It is a rarely used building because as one might suspect,

750
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,260
the population of contention owns all their books.

751
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,260
That one was just for me.

752
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Standing behind the entry desk, there are two individuals.

753
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:14,260
One is either an extremely young or an extremely old man with a sweater vest and sleeve tattoos

754
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,260
on both arms, I believe.

755
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,500
The other one's a young man who is wearing a sweater with another sweater wrapped around

756
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
over his shoulders.

757
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:31,500
And on top of that one, he has a second sweater that is wrapped around his waist as well.

758
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,500
And he is wearing gold rings on all of his fingers.

759
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,500
And the young man in all the sweaters looks up at the three of you as you walk into the

760
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,500
contention public library and he says, oh, hello.

761
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,740
Thank you so much for coming to the contention public library, whatever it is that we could

762
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,740
do for you today on a day such as this.

763
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,740
Is there anything in particular that you might be here of any interest?

764
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,740
Is there many lands within these pages that we can, I don't know if you know me.

765
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:07,740
My name is Steven pages, cousin of the esteemed Carrie pages, valedictorian of Silas Cole.

766
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,740
Yeah, I don't care about any of that.

767
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,740
I just want you to point us in the direction of the occult books.

768
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,980
Your gentleman's ears perk up.

769
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,980
Oh, my sweet little patty cakes, please follow me and I'll lead you there.

770
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,980
I do wish you would tell me what it is you're looking for.

771
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Shadow, he's like really scaring me right now.

772
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,980
Could you just go back, take us to what we want to look at without him coming with us?

773
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Look, sir, we just want you to point us in the direction of the occult books and that

774
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,980
would be just fine.

775
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,980
Oh, yes, of course.

776
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,980
I'm so sorry for intruding on your girly time.

777
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,980
Can you just explain what kind of book it is we're looking for?

778
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,980
Yeah, we're looking for any kind of book that has to do with voodoo.

779
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,980
Oh, voodoo you say?

780
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
Yes, of course.

781
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:05,980
I have at least one book that is about voodoo and it is right in the occult section and

782
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Steven pages begins walking you to the back of the library and there is a small room in

783
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:18,580
the back with a curtain over it and there's a sign that is hanging off of one nail and

784
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:27,540
it says occult but the OC in front has been like crossed out and inside you find a bookshelf

785
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:35,280
with six shelves and each shelf has one book on it and there is a shelf marked voodoo on

786
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:43,980
which there is a single book and it is entitled voodoo.

787
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,380
Do you want to voodoo?

788
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,480
I do want to voodoo.

789
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,280
If you want to voodoo, this would be the place to do voodoo.

790
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,880
I would like to voodoo.

791
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,280
Okay, perfect.

792
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,680
This is exactly the book that I was hoping would be here.

793
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,480
Okay, if we just flip to page 419, we're gonna find exactly how to get rid of your

794
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
dude.

795
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,080
We're not looking to get rid of a dude.

796
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,480
I want to torture Britney.

797
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
She slept with my boyfriend.

798
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Oh my god, that's like so mean of Britney to do.

799
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Right?

800
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,480
He was so lucky to have you.

801
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
You're beautiful.

802
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
You're like so beautiful.

803
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,480
He was so lucky to have you and you're so beautiful and pretty.

804
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
And also smart.

805
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
He was so lucky.

806
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Okay, go swallow a dime, Judy.

807
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Calm down.

808
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,480
Okay, let's just check this out and go back to your house list.

809
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,880
Sounds like a plan, but real quick, looking at page 419, you see there are a few ingredients

810
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,080
necessary to performing this ritual.

811
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,080
There's also a bit of fine print at the bottom of each page that states this book voodoo

812
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:57,280
is merely a collection of rituals put together by a woman named Lulu Fufu Voodoo and is in

813
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,080
no way associated with any religious ideologies or practices with a similar name.

814
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,080
Also, page 419 notes this ritual must be performed surrounded by trees.

815
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,680
Okay guys, that sounds like pretty scary.

816
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
We should just shut up.

817
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,080
And it needs to be done at night.

818
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,080
There's a woods right by my house that would be perfect.

819
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,880
I go there in the middle of the night naked all the time.

820
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
That sounds perfect.

821
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,080
Okay, but like we have to be there in the dark because...

822
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Judy!

823
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,880
Judy, don't worry.

824
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,880
We'll hold hands and bask in the moonlight the entire time.

825
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
It'll be beautiful.

826
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, but in the dark...

827
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Judy!

828
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
My god!

829
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,480
So real quick, let's make up a list of ingredients for performing this spell.

830
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,780
I will start.

831
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:54,880
You need the left pinky toe of a dead squirrel.

832
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
Oh, okay.

833
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,480
Allie, what is the second thing that you might need for this voodoo spell?

834
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,680
This spell says that we need dirt scraped from the earth after it's been stepped on

835
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,680
by a calf that's menstruating.

836
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,680
How the fuck are we gonna find that?

837
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,680
Third thing is the blood from a former cheerleader gone goth that goes to...

838
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Silas Cole K through 12.

839
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Yep, Silas Cole K through 12.

840
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
I think I know where I can get that.

841
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
It says that in the book.

842
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Yep.

843
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Called voodoo.

844
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Yep, voodoo do you.

845
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Do you voodoo.

846
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
Do you voodoo.

847
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
Do you voodoo.

848
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
Do you voodoo.

849
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
To do voodoo.

850
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Lindsay, what is the fourth thing?

851
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Okay, final?

852
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
The fourth and final?

853
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Fourth and final thing.

854
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
The fourth and final thing.

855
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,480
I'm gonna say, because I have to pee so bad right now.

856
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Urine?

857
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Which we all know is also bird poop.

858
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
What?

859
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Wait, we all know that?

860
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
We all know that?

861
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
When a bird pees, it also poops.

862
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Is that why it's so runny?

863
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
It's mixed.

864
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Yes.

865
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Oh my god.

866
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Actually, that's what mine does too.

867
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
What, your bird?

868
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Yeah, it's mixed.

869
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Oh, hell.

870
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
And if you're a bird, I'm a bird.

871
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,680
Smash cut to you guys slamming the book closed and then realizing that nobody has a library

872
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
card.

873
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Dear, dear, dear, what will you do?

874
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,180
Look, we need this book.

875
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,180
We need it now.

876
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:33,040
Oh, my dear, sweet little baby, there is a process and there is a three day processing

877
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
fee.

878
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
Fuck this.

879
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
How do libraries work?

880
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,880
Okay, I don't know if this will help, but my parents' names are Chris and Krista Krinklehoff.

881
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Oh, your parents?

882
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Oh my goodness.

883
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,100
Are the Krinklehoff's?

884
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,580
We play bridge with them every Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.

885
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
That's right.

886
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Me and my old friend, Gerald Fingersen, and your parents-

887
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,460
Thank you for saying my name right, my dear boy.

888
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,780
We'll just put it on their account.

889
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,660
Thank you so much.

890
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,100
Would you like a poppy seed muffin for your walk home?

891
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
I'm allergic to poppies and peas.

892
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,700
Oh my god, me too, twinsies.

893
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,780
Smash cut to you guys leaving the library with the book.

894
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,160
Smash cut to you guys on the side of the road, all bent over a dead squirrel, cutting

895
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,960
off the pinky toe of the roadkill.

896
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,860
Smash cut to you guys all in a field where there is a cow that is bleeding out of its

897
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:35,820
lady butt, and then you guys scoop the dirt into a bucket or something.

898
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,880
Smash cut to you guys just standing in a parking lot, looking up, and there's a bunch of birds

899
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
in the sky.

900
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,480
They're all just waiting.

901
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,120
Bird shits on the ground, and you guys collect the not shit, not piss, but both.

902
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Both.

903
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
The mixture of both.

904
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:59,520
And then you guys get a cocktail strainer and strain out the piss, because it says urine.

905
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,800
Smash cut to you guys all standing outside of one of your cars, and you're talking about

906
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,160
how to get the blood part.

907
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,320
Liz, do you have that squirrel toe?

908
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,640
Yeah, I do, but my question is, how the hell are we gonna get this goth cheerleader blood?

909
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,520
I just had this idea, and my idea is that it's me.

910
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
What?

911
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Yeah.

912
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Does you not know that I used to be a cheerleader?

913
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
Gross.

914
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,600
I can do seven back bends in a row.

915
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,680
And then Shadow does seven back bends in a row.

916
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Whatever the fuck that is.

917
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
And also, do you do them in a row?

918
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,600
No, back bend and then back handspring to another back bend, but they're slow.

919
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,080
It's a gymnastics thing.

920
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,240
Okay, so do you wanna get your blood out now, or do you wanna let it out later?

921
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,800
No, I wanna let it out now if Liz will just give me the frickin' squirrel toe.

922
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,320
Why do I need to give you the squirrel toe for you to let out the blood?

923
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
It's easy, Liz.

924
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
It's easy.

925
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,400
You just take the nail of the squirrel toe and I scratch it on my finger and blood comes

926
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
out.

927
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,880
Well, where are you gonna put the blood?

928
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,080
Into my hand.

929
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
And then put it-

930
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Really gross.

931
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Judy.

932
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,080
Judy.

933
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I'm really sorry, Elizabeth.

934
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Please.

935
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
I'm sorry.

936
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,360
I've done just this kind of ritual before and it always goes fine, okay?

937
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,000
You're gonna just hold the blood until we get into the deep woods?

938
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,280
Well, I just figured that maybe you would be okay.

939
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,040
I do have a vial of- Well, then what the hell?

940
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,000
Well, it's already- Get the vial.

941
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,040
It's already holding someone else's blood, but I guess I can pour that out.

942
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,400
Um, I hate to be, like, a bitch right now, but, like, who's blood is in it?

943
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,720
I don't want to talk about it.

944
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,080
It's my ex.

945
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:50,760
It was just a mutual agreement to not date anymore and then I just got a little bit of

946
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
his blood after.

947
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Yeah, I don't care even.

948
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,720
If Elizabeth doesn't care, I don't care either.

949
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,960
Okay, let's just gather all of our things up.

950
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,160
We'll go have a sleepover at my house.

951
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,260
My parents are, like, totally chill and they don't care about anything, even me.

952
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:13,600
They don't, like, even care if I love, live, or die, and then we can go into the forest

953
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
tonight.

954
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,680
They don't care if you love, live, or die.

955
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
Love was part of it.

956
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,240
But they really want you to laugh.

957
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:30,760
All right, so let us, Tomato, go back in time to, like, two days ago when I believe it was

958
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:40,760
Shadow who told Liz that her boyfriend, Derek, was seen cheating on her with Brittany.

959
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,680
Let's cut back to that scene.

960
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,360
The bell rings and you guys are all standing outside of one of your lockers.

961
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,360
Hey, Liz.

962
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
What?

963
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
How are you doing today?

964
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
Sorry, I'm just trying to be nice.

965
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I'm just trying to start a nice conversation with you.

966
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,720
Could you just, like, not be a bitch for one second?

967
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
Could you just, like, get to the point?

968
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,720
Yeah, that's a really good point.

969
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,480
Hey, if you guys are friends, you shouldn't talk to each other like that.

970
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,760
Who the hell are you?

971
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,840
I forgot my name, but I was in the last episode.

972
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,720
Well, we're not friends yet.

973
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,160
It's just a budding friendship that's gonna happen, probably.

974
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,040
Oh, then this seems like a nice start.

975
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:23,020
Anyway, Liz, I just wanted to check in on you because you know your boyfriend's been

976
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,320
cheating on you.

977
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
What?

978
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,960
Oh, you didn't know?

979
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,440
With fucking who?

980
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,280
I don't know, some girl named, like, Britney.

981
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:38,000
I think she goes to, like, Spinkbonk High, which is, like, 15 miles down the road.

982
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Fucking Spinkbonk?

983
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,440
I know, it's, like, most of them are total trash, but, like, I think she's kind of cute.

984
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,120
I don't want to, like, put salt in the wound, but...

985
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,240
Listen, Elizabeth, there's no way that that girl is cuter than you.

986
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,240
There's literally no way.

987
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,880
I mean, there's a way, but...

988
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,000
No, like, she couldn't be cuter than you.

989
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,120
What a- what a be-on.

990
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,600
Anyway, I just thought you should know that, like, Derek is not available, like, emotionally

991
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,760
anymore and I just, like, really want to be there for you right now.

992
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,120
Elizabeth, like, what can we do for you?

993
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,000
Can we, like, touch you or help you in any way?

994
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,080
Can we touch you?

995
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,080
What's your love language?

996
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
Excuse me, what's your name?

997
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,480
Can we buy you any gifts?

998
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,480
Do you want to be, like, quality time?

999
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Excuse me, who the hell are you?

1000
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Um, my name's Judy.

1001
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Um, I sit behind you in English lint, and I sit behind you and I smell your perfume

1002
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,480
a lot, even though I think it's not really perfume, I think it's just the cigarettes

1003
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,480
that you chew up after you smoke them.

1004
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,880
Get your shit together, Judy.

1005
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,880
Is that the same type of cigarette you've been hoarding in your purse and ziplock bags?

1006
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,880
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1007
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,880
I collect trash off the side of the road because I'm a good person.

1008
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,880
It's not just the trash.

1009
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,880
You make a person?

1010
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
Because I'm a good person.

1011
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,880
What, you make a person out of the cigarette butts?

1012
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,880
That's really cool.

1013
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,880
That's, like, art, man.

1014
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,880
No, I said I'm a good person.

1015
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,280
Are you gay Arnold style?

1016
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Like, in your closet?

1017
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,280
I don't, I'm not allowed to watch Arnold.

1018
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,280
It's not Arnold.

1019
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,280
Anyway, Liz, I'm really sorry that this has happened to you, so, like...

1020
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,280
Yeah, whatever, I'm already over it, but here's the deal.

1021
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,280
I'm gonna need your help.

1022
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,280
I mean, I'm kind of busy on...

1023
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,280
No, no, no, we can, no, we can help her, Shadow.

1024
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
You can totally reschedule that.

1025
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
Yeah, you can help me.

1026
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
You have time.

1027
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,280
I know your schedule.

1028
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
I have orchestra rehearsal.

1029
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,680
Shadow, Shadow, listen, we can help her.

1030
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,680
I'll help you.

1031
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,680
I'll do your orchestra for you.

1032
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,680
Okay, only if it's something I'm actually interested in will I help you.

1033
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
So, like, what is it you even want to do?

1034
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,180
Smash cut to you guys in the car on the way to the woods that night after you've spent

1035
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:08,760
some time at Shadow's house and Shadow is, like, holding up the vial, like, flicking

1036
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,280
it and it's got her blood already inside of it and you guys have all of the ingredients

1037
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,080
necessary to do voodoo and who is driving?

1038
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,280
And three, two, one point at the person who's driving.

1039
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,280
Three, two, one.

1040
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,280
That is two points at Shadow, one point at Judy.

1041
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
So, Shadow is driving.

1042
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,280
Shadow, what kind of car do you have?

1043
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,280
Oh, I have...

1044
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,280
So, my parents have a ton of money, so I have a Lamborghini.

1045
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
Shit.

1046
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,280
Weird.

1047
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,280
Super weird.

1048
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,280
It's what I always chose in the...

1049
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
Weird flex, but all right.

1050
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,280
It's what I always chose in the game Mash for my car.

1051
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,280
Mash.

1052
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
Mash.

1053
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Me and my brother always had a VW Beetle on there.

1054
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,280
We were very into beetles.

1055
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,280
Yeah, is that going to happen?

1056
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,280
I just had this conversation over the weekend.

1057
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Lamborghini 2017, even though it was 2013 when this all went down.

1058
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,280
Nope, not even close.

1059
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
Yeah, times don't matter.

1060
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
Nope.

1061
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,280
Oh, it's the 90s.

1062
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,280
Times don't matter.

1063
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,280
Oh, it's the 90s.

1064
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:15,280
It is a 2017 Lamborghini, and you guys are flying down the road to the contention woods.

1065
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,280
When you turn right onto the gravel road that takes you into the parking lot of the contention

1066
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,280
woods, I need you to roll a drive check for me.

1067
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,280
I have a 4D drive.

1068
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
All right.

1069
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
Excuse me.

1070
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,280
I'm so sorry.

1071
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,280
I'm sorry.

1072
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,280
I'm sorry.

1073
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,280
I'm sorry.

1074
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,280
I'm sorry.

1075
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,280
I'm sorry.

1076
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,280
And I got a 4.

1077
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,280
There is a possum that walks directly in front of you, and you dodge.

1078
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,280
No, I don't want to, because-

1079
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,280
You drive however best you see fit.

1080
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,280
There's a possum staring you directly in the eyes.

1081
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,280
You can see that there is fear in its ears.

1082
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,280
Confront your death, little possum.

1083
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,280
Today's your day to go.

1084
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,280
And then I go straight for it.

1085
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,280
It looks, and then it turns, and it sits on its back legs and just freezes right in the

1086
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,280
headlights, and your front bumper just crushes its face.

1087
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,280
I immediately pull over to go examine.

1088
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,280
Feel free to chip in with your thoughts on what I'm doing at any time.

1089
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,280
Judy's really freaking out, if that's any.

1090
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,280
You guys, come look.

1091
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,280
He's super, super dead.

1092
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:34,280
He's definitely in a better, or different, or maybe non-existent place, but I'm so happy for him.

1093
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,280
I'm smoking a cigarette, and I'm like, ugh, shut up.

1094
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,280
No, but really, what do you think the last thoughts this possum had before he died?

1095
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Oh.

1096
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,280
Shadow.

1097
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,280
I have a question.

1098
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,280
Do possi-

1099
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,280
What is that?

1100
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,280
Do they could happen when they die?

1101
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:03,280
I'm not actually sure I prescribe to any particular religion that has a heaven and hell, but if

1102
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,280
that's what you want to tell yourself, Judy, then that's fine.

1103
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:19,280
Okay, this possum was maybe named Stacy, and he went to heaven.

1104
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,280
Okay, Judy, should we bury Stacy?

1105
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,280
Yeah, can we bury Stacy?

1106
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,280
Okay, does anyone ... Oh, wait, it's my car.

1107
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,280
Let me go grab my cemetery shovel, and we'll scrape him off the pavement.

1108
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,280
My God.

1109
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,280
I love role-playing.

1110
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,280
Okay, so you guys bury Stacey?

1111
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,280
Stacy.

1112
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,280
Davey.

1113
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,280
Davey Stacey?

1114
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,280
During the eulogy, I call him Davey.

1115
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,280
Just to piss Judy off.

1116
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,280
Just to remind that you don't care.

1117
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,280
You look up, and you see that you are already in the parking lot of the Contingent Woods,

1118
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,280
and looking around, you see five cars.

1119
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,280
One car has a notice on the driver's side window taped to it.

1120
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,280
Another car has a boot on one of the wheels.

1121
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:19,280
There is also an old Bronco, like an SUV, got a lift kit on it, and it is right up next

1122
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,280
to this little shack at the entrance, like the Park Ranger shack.

1123
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:33,280
You would also notice a 91 Firebird that belongs to the older brother of Ash Hornbeam,

1124
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,280
and you would know the older brother of Ash Hornbeam is like a party animal.

1125
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,280
And then also, Judy, your mom's minivan.

1126
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:52,280
Guys, I don't want to freak you out right now, but I'm pretty sure that's my mom's minivan

1127
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,280
that's parked here.

1128
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,280
Judy, why would that freak us out?

1129
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,280
What if I get in trouble for being here?

1130
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,280
You're 17 years old, Judy.

1131
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,280
I know, but it's after 6.30 PM, which is my curfew.

1132
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,280
My God.

1133
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,280
You already told your mom you were staying the night at my house, so if I see Krista,

1134
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,280
I'll shove you down into a ditch.

1135
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,280
That would be really good.

1136
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,280
Do you promise to shove me in the ditch?

1137
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,280
Promise me.

1138
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,280
I promise.

1139
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,280
Pinky promise with my whole life and death and afterlife maybe.

1140
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,280
I would love to shove you into a ditch right now.

1141
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,280
Oh my God, Elizabeth, thank you for saying that.

1142
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,280
Okay, if you promise, I'm totally fine, but then it's fine.

1143
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,280
Okay, let's go.

1144
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,280
Boo!

1145
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,280
An old man jumps up toward you.

1146
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,280
And says boo?

1147
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,280
And says boo.

1148
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,280
That's odd.

1149
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,280
Okay.

1150
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,280
Yeah.

1151
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,280
Is it Halloween?

1152
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,280
Nope, it is fall, but.

1153
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,280
It's so spooky season, though.

1154
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,280
It is spooky times.

1155
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,280
Spooky times.

1156
00:51:53,280 --> 00:52:00,280
She is wearing a forest ranger uniform that is a state forest ranger uniform.

1157
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:07,280
I believe Shadow, since she comes out here often and bathes in the moonlight nude.

1158
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,280
Naked.

1159
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Typical.

1160
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,280
Power giving.

1161
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,280
Very cool.

1162
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,280
Moonbeam, etc.

1163
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,280
So, you would know that this is not the normal ranger.

1164
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,280
Normally, there's a guy named Jeb who's a contention park ranger, but this is a different

1165
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,280
guy.

1166
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,280
And he says, hello there!

1167
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:31,280
Ah, you can see here, the name is Woodrow and I am a forest ranger and I need you guys

1168
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,280
to fill out some forms over here for me in the shack.

1169
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,280
Did you decide to be a ranger because your name has wood in it?

1170
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,280
That is 100% why I decided to become a ranger.

1171
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,280
Interesting.

1172
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
Anyway.

1173
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,280
It was either that or a boat driver.

1174
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,280
This is public property, so I think we're just going to be on our way.

1175
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,280
So, she comes out here naked and dances.

1176
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,280
This is Lindsey.

1177
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:02,280
So, she comes out here and dances naked and Jeb is usually here for that?

1178
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:08,280
Yeah, this is Zach and I think she probably goes deep into the woods before.

1179
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,280
Yeah, I don't take my clothes off in the parking lot.

1180
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,280
So, she sees Jeb before she gets naked.

1181
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,280
That is what I assumed.

1182
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,280
Pre and post nakedness.

1183
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,280
I was a little disturbed.

1184
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,280
Oh, okay.

1185
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,280
Alright.

1186
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,280
Pre and post, but not mid.

1187
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
Not dirt.

1188
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,280
Okay.

1189
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Yeah.

1190
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
Alright.

1191
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
Just making sure.

1192
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,280
Only the squirrels and the trees.

1193
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,280
My psyche was bothered.

1194
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,280
I'm okay now.

1195
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,280
So, if you wouldn't mind getting your camping gear and coming on up to fill out these forms

1196
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,880
instead of barking at the knot, that would make me, you know, happy because it's my job

1197
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,280
to get these forms filled out.

1198
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,280
Don't put your real names, okay, girl?

1199
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,280
Okay.

1200
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,280
Right.

1201
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,280
I'll just put, my name is Jude.

1202
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,280
That's really good, Jude.

1203
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,280
Right, but it's still with the Y, but it's pronounced different.

1204
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,280
She runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs.

1205
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,280
Ooh.

1206
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:17,280
The sun, the sun, the sun is sleeping soon.

1207
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:35,280
She knows, she knows, she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance

1208
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,280
beneath the shadow of the moon.

1209
00:54:39,280 --> 00:55:07,280
She moves, she moves, she moves with the howling wind.

1210
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:21,280
The sun, the sun, the sun has come again, come again.

1211
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:31,280
Her eyes, her eyes have seen it all.

1212
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:42,280
The wonders of, the wonders of the shadow of the moon.

1213
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,280
Moon.
