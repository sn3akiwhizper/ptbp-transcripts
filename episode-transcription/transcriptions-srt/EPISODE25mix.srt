1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello my hungry babies, it's your chef Wolf the dog, and I'm here to serve you up some real tasty news grub cooked up right here in contention.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now don't let the local health inspector know that I cook all my grub with a microwave here at 694.2 PTBP.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A microwave is the only way to get that real good flavor from the rats I catch down here in the basement.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This week Wolf is here to reiterate to y'all that we are going to have a special presentation in a few weeks here on 694.2 PTBP, contention's newest and only radio station.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're going to broadcast a recap episode with listener Q&A from a podcast called Pretending to be People.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If you have questions for any of the fine people on that show, act quickly, deadline is May 7th at noon Central Time y'all.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And send them to at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram, or post them on our Facebook page or the subreddit, or email them to pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Or go all out, record that audio of you asking your question and send that so they can use it in the episode my babies.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But enough with that which is fictional, it is time for the news.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The officers met back at the contention police station early in the morning of December 5th along with Drew and their new partner in crime Rosemary, an actual member of the Glass crime family.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In the station, an FBI agent named Trent Chad was sorting through contention's paperwork, Clark shot him with a dart and agent Trent Chad became very very impressionable.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:08,000
With agent Trent Chad's newfound pliability, the officers worked out ways in order to convince the public as well as the feds that the local authorities have everything under control in contention.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But of course y'all, nothing could be further from the truth.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The officers found the cells holding Dr. Marie Jacobs and her cat man to be empty.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Upon checking the security footage, they confirmed the black ooze slammed the two jailbirds into the ground of their cells before disappearing entirely.

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Keith blurted out that the camera will be ready to use at 1pm.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They checked the evidence room and saw a single green light beaming from the old glass tube covered radio.

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Seems like a pretty shitty radio to me.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Wolf the dog always has the green light and it's always go go go with kudzu's no backbone.

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Luke, do you remember the time that me you and Thomas were at **** and he told our server?

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There was a logic behind it.

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What did you say? I don't remember.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I said you're fat.

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, because she was pregnant.

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Because she was pregnant. It was an attempted twist on the thing and it didn't work.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, I immediately felt very weird.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You looked like you wanted to be anywhere else in the world.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I still remember the look of just like as your face fell and her face fell.

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And I was just like, oh, fuck.

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, God, that was horrible.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
In your defense, I can see the train of thought.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can hear it coming out also.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It was so funny because I used to bet it didn't work.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, right.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It didn't work because I used to **** with her.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's her name?

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't know her name. Thank God.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I would come in there all the time and then I was just like, I just wanted to be like, I am so sorry.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What?

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Anyway, just remembering one of my favorite moments.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I just don't speak in public anymore.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That was hilarious, dude.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, let's play this game.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's play this game.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, so what we're going to do is because it is, I wrote December 4th.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's December 5th.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Baby shark.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So because it's a new day, I have personally forgotten many of the rules set up for this campaign when it comes to hit points and willpower.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So what we're going to do is we're going to roll constitution for more hit points.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Cool.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So you guys all get to roll con right now.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, yeah, I'm way low on hit points.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You guys have been fucked up by a lot of different stuff, but mostly that fight with a big robot man.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, so I've failed.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I passed.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Do I have to do it for my max or for my current?

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Current con.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, sorry.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I did not do current.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, I got a nine, so yeah.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why is your constitution different now than-

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's not.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Your con should never-

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, yeah, it doesn't change.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was looking at current hit points.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It doesn't change.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right, right.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But no, I got a nine on a 70, so.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And Thomas failed.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Can I go to the doctor or something?

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So John gets one hit point back.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Keith gets one D4.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So you want to roll a D4 if you pass.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Clark, pass or fail?

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He passed.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All right.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So you guys both get a D4 hit points.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Fuck.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I just got one.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And I rolled a D4.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Clark gets one.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And Keith gets-

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Two.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What's your max, Joe?

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Max hit points is 26.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
My current is 12.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, word.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You were worse than me.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm at eight.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Shit.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I thought I was doing that at 12.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now I'm at 13.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, because somebody fell on my face.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm the tank now.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Someone fell on my face.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, some idiot hadn't been lying in the road.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's true.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You guys also all had a really rough night.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And when you don't get a full night's sleep, you automatically get reduced to two willpower

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
points.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you kidding me?

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Two, two or by two?

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
To two.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So all of you are now at two willpower.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's actually not that big a deal for me.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I was at five.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What if my current is one?

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Do I go up to two?

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So with you-

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What the fuck?

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We've been playing fast and loose with these willpower points because you're all fucking

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
addicted to cocaine now.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh, yeah.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mostly, Keith.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But after this morning, me too.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So you're all at two willpower.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Keith, I'm going to go ahead and give you two willpower.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So I'm at two total.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So how this works is you are all-

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Sleepy.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sleepy and completely having basically an emotional breakdown, physical as well.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So you're all going to take a negative 20% to all roles until you either fix your willpower

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
or do an upper.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How long do we have to sleep to fix our willpower?

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Full night's rest.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Not even a cat nap or whatever won't bump it up a few points.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That does make sense because when I'm feeling down and I get even an hour, I do feel better.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You get two or three more hours after that.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Cool.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's take a nap.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Would we still be rolling minus 20%?

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't understand.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So basically you roll at minus 20% on all roles when you either have one or two willpower.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, cool.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So if you gain any willpower, you won't be at that negative anymore.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Cool.

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay.

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
How's that sound?

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Are you sleeping in drugs to gain willpower back?

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Different drugs?

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Different drugs?

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't think so.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, okay.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So I'm going to do some cocaine.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah.

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So it is 6 a.m. on December 5th and all three of you are reeling from the events of last night.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The dreams you cannot quite understand and the revelations of the morning.

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You all stand in the evidence locker looking at the camera, gun, radio, and helmet all

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,520
with strange glass tubes making them look like they came from a weird old-timey steampunk

159
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
laboratory.

160
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,120
The camera, gun, and helmet each has a glowing red light giving this small room an eerie

161
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,300
tent.

162
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,800
The radio's green light is lit.

163
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,560
Keith, you feel something press against the back of your leg and then the back of your

164
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:42,160
thigh climbing and then you hear a meow and notice Doug, the cat previously called Salem,

165
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,800
has walked into the room and is pawing at you.

166
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Oh my God.

167
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,440
This poor dude is fucking trapped in a cat's body.

168
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
What was it?

169
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
How did we communicate with him?

170
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
One meow for yes.

171
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Two for no.

172
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Yeah.

173
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
What should we ask him?

174
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,820
It looks like he wants to talk to Clark.

175
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Was it me?

176
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
That was me.

177
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,820
Oh.

178
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
It looks like he wants to talk to Keith.

179
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Hey.

180
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Meow?

181
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
Meow.

182
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,820
I am there.

183
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Hey, what?

184
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Shit.

185
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,820
It's yes or no questions.

186
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,820
How you doing?

187
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Meow.

188
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,820
Meow.

189
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
Help me out here, guys.

190
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,820
The cat jumps up onto-

191
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
Wait.

192
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,820
I've got to.

193
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
Okay.

194
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Wait.

195
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
Not wait.

196
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
I mean, wait.

197
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Me.

198
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Stop talking, Thomas.

199
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,820
You go.

200
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Shut up, Thomas.

201
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Shut up, Thomas.

202
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Stupid piece of shit.

203
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,820
The cat jumps up onto the shelf and immediately starts rubbing against the radio.

204
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
Oh, dude.

205
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,820
I'm running out of the room.

206
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Clark is running out of the room.

207
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Get out of there, boys.

208
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,820
You're going to switch a body.

209
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Clark, when you run out, you see Agent Tramp.

210
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
He's like, what?

211
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,820
What's going on?

212
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,820
What's going on?

213
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
What's going on?

214
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
What's going on?

215
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,820
What's going on?

216
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
What's going on?

217
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
What's going on?

218
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,820
What's going on?

219
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
What's going on?

220
00:09:51,820 --> 00:10:00,220
You see Agent Trent Chad still mopping up his Red Bull spill and Drew is sorting through

221
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,660
all these different files and Rosemary, whose name you now know, the Fonzie lady, she is

222
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,980
just standing in the middle with her arms crossed and tapping her foot.

223
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,940
I want to grab the cat by the scruff and get it away from the radio.

224
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,940
You do so.

225
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,100
Doug, are you trying to body swap with us?

226
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:26,700
When the cat looks at you and you're holding it, I need you to roll a dexterity real quick

227
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,300
because Doug freaks the fuck out when you grab him.

228
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Oh, I pass.

229
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Eight.

230
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,580
Okay, then you can describe as he is looking at you and meowing and losing it.

231
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,640
Yeah, there's just an intricate cat juggle as he tries to get away and then an arm reaches

232
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,420
out blind and just grabs him and brings him out and then the same thing happens again

233
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,660
and then finally I just press him tight to my chest and I look him dead in his little cat eyes.

234
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
He looks horrified.

235
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
What do you say?

236
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,780
I say, Doug, we're going to do everything we can to get you back to your body, but you

237
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,620
can't be trying to steal ours.

238
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,520
Maybe Chad's later, but not right now.

239
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,900
We kind of need you to just, well, actually maybe right now.

240
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
I don't know.

241
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,940
We could get a lot out of you, but hey guys, let's, let's do you want to swap with, yes,

242
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,940
with Chad and Doug?

243
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
Yeah, yeah.

244
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,460
I was thinking Rosemary, but she has knowledge that we need.

245
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
We need Rosemary, yeah.

246
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
Yeah.

247
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Let's do it with FBI guy.

248
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
Okay.

249
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,460
All right.

250
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,460
Do you want to be in a presumably hunky FBI agent's body, Doug?

251
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,580
How are we going to do this though?

252
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,940
I don't want to be in that room when that radio goes off.

253
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,500
Doug, if we put a incapacitated Chad in that room with you, could you swap bodies using

254
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
that radio?

255
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Meow.

256
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,060
Let's do it, boys.

257
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,060
All in favor, say aye.

258
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,060
Clark is out of the evidence.

259
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,780
Clark is out of the evidence room right now.

260
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,780
That's true.

261
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
Okay.

262
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,780
Let's just do it.

263
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,780
Let's just do it.

264
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,780
I'll go grab Chad.

265
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
Okay.

266
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,780
I walk out into...

267
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,700
Keith, is it, is it you?

268
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,700
It's me.

269
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,180
I'm not, I am me.

270
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
We've got a plan though.

271
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
Bubblegum tree.

272
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,180
I'm going to walk out too.

273
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,180
Bubblegum tree.

274
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
Wait.

275
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Yeah.

276
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
So you didn't switch bodies with him?

277
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,300
No, but we got a plan.

278
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Is John?

279
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
No, John is still John.

280
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
He's Bubblegum tree.

281
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
But here, come here.

282
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
I got to whisper something to you.

283
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Okay.

284
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,540
We're going to switch Chad's body with Doug's body.

285
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,540
We're going to put Chad in the cat.

286
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,540
Don't, don't tell him though.

287
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Okay.

288
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,260
I mean, does Doug, is Doug okay with that?

289
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
He meowed.

290
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
He meowed.

291
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
He meowed for yes.

292
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,260
What is?

293
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,260
Okay.

294
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,880
I really, I really liked the idea, but he, Doug doesn't know the FBI.

295
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,060
Like we have to have somebody tell the FBI not to come back here.

296
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,060
Uh, we'll just text it from his phone.

297
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Yeah.

298
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,980
That's not too bad, fellas.

299
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,340
So he texts the main office, right?

300
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,700
Says, Hey, listen, I'm not, I'm heading up to the city for the afternoon to do a little

301
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,740
sightseeing and I'll be back tomorrow.

302
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,580
Cause the contention situation is locked down and we can keep them distracted for a little

303
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,340
while because we can just tell Doug what to say cause he'll have Chad's voice.

304
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,340
Oh shit.

305
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,340
Yeah.

306
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,340
We just use Doug.

307
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,840
Hey, can we fight Chad right now?

308
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
I don't think we need to.

309
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
No, no, no.

310
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,120
Do you think we could take Chad just in case Doug really goes, uh, loose cannon on us?

311
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Oh, that's agent.

312
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,640
Agent Chad looks up.

313
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,160
Would you guys like to fight?

314
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,280
Maybe maybe ladder Chad, buddy, uh, ladder, maybe ladder, mama, ladder, mama, ladder,

315
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
big and sign.

316
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,160
Uh, maybe later, Chad, you just go close your little eyes.

317
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,000
Now you just take a little nap immediately.

318
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,920
Chad, while mopping up his red bull spill, which he's been doing for like 10 minutes

319
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,720
now, he just closes his eyes and lays down on the ground.

320
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,320
All right, let's drag him into the room.

321
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,660
He's a better cat than Doug.

322
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,560
We could just, I mean, we can drag him.

323
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Sure.

324
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
I helped.

325
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
I helped the dragon.

326
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
I mean, we could have just asked him to walk in there with the cat.

327
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Yeah.

328
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,380
But if he's, we drag him into the room with the radio as you drag him in, you notice he's

329
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:07,860
like squeezing his eyes closed to make sure that he like is staying consistent with your

330
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,860
hopes and dreams.

331
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,860
Yeah.

332
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,860
Hell yeah.

333
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,820
We probably just have Chad press the button then immediately Doug.

334
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:19,540
This cat is just like walking back and forth meowing just like Doug, we're going to leave

335
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,620
you in the room, do your thing.

336
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,340
We'll be back in a moment.

337
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
I'm yeah.

338
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,260
As soon as I'm like across the threshold with the body as far into the door as I can, I'm

339
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,580
stepping over it and out of the door.

340
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
Yep.

341
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
Say, Hey guys, real quick.

342
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,360
Do you think that, well, I guess it would only be beneficial to us if Doug was still

343
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,460
under the influence of the, Oh, cause it's still in his body.

344
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
Yeah.

345
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,460
I was going to think that could be a hindrance, but it'd actually be a great on hindrance

346
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
for sure.

347
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,460
We could, we could, uh, we could ask him whatever we need to about how he got that way and all

348
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
that stuff.

349
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,460
Yeah.

350
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Okay.

351
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,220
Uh, I, you know, all the boys out, the door shuts.

352
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,140
I put my ear to the door.

353
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,220
I'm looking like under the door for like a flash of light or something.

354
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,980
Clarkie, what do you see, what do you hear?

355
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,980
What do we hear?

356
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,980
You hear some pong about as Doug enjoys his cat body.

357
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,940
One last time.

358
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,940
You hear

359
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:28,420
he turned on the radio boys.

360
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,660
And then you hear a click, a song start to play from inside the evidence locker of the

361
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,800
police department of contention.

362
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:46,780
And then you hear the song start to change and you overhear audio that does not make

363
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:54,460
any sense to you that gets louder until it becomes a jumble and there is a high pitched

364
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,140
noise just screeching in all of your ears.

365
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:07,820
As you hear a massive, massive noise and a light flashes brightly from all crevices of

366
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
the door.

367
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,900
And then there is silence.

368
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,300
And you hear from inside the evidence locker

369
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:24,980
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

370
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
All right.

371
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,180
Oh, all right.

372
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,180
Whoa.

373
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,740
Oh shit.

374
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,740
I knock on the door.

375
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Oh fuck.

376
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Doug, is that you?

377
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
Yeah.

378
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Yeah.

379
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Oh man.

380
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Oh man.

381
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Oh, Doug.

382
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:49,220
Why don't you get up and get on out here?

383
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,620
Whoa, guys, do you know what, can you open up the door?

384
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,820
You hear like, uh, the, the, the handle is moving and he says, can you, can you guys

385
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,460
open up the door for me?

386
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:07,300
I opened the door for him standing before you is the body of agent Trent Chad.

387
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,280
Also inside is a cat laying on the ground.

388
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,580
Is the cat alive?

389
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:20,420
The cat wakes up, seemingly opens its eyes, looks around, looks at itself, starts freaking

390
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,020
out and makes a run for the door.

391
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,020
Close the door.

392
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,020
I'm going to try to do a decks check.

393
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,020
Well, yeah.

394
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,020
Close the door.

395
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,020
And also who's got the best decks.

396
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,020
I have 60, 65, 60.

397
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
All right.

398
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,100
What do you, what can we do a twofer where he tries to close the door and a cat duty

399
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
cat patrol.

400
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
All right.

401
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Uh, yeah.

402
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Go ahead and roll first.

403
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,020
Keith to give, uh, to give John a plus 20.

404
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,380
I got a 33.

405
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,540
All right.

406
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,540
That's a Chris success.

407
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,280
You automatically, you guys automatically slam the door in Doug's face immediately upon

408
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,140
the door slamming from inside.

409
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,640
You hear a, Oh, is that what you guys want?

410
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,860
You want it?

411
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Should I be in here?

412
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
And Oh God.

413
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
Oh no.

414
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,860
Oh fuck.

415
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:22,620
Why is this not a visual medium?

416
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Your face was amazing.

417
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,620
Yeah.

418
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,620
That was awesome.

419
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,260
Doug subdue the cat.

420
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
I've got it.

421
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
Okay.

422
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:41,380
I'm, I'm going to go to the front door of the police department and walk it and make

423
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,220
sure there's no way anybody's living here until we want them to, Hey, Hey, what's going

424
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,220
on in there?

425
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,920
Hey, uh, can I get the gun now please?

426
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
In a minute.

427
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Rosemary.

428
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Yeah.

429
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
We're dealing with some others.

430
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,580
Hey drew, can you run to the store across the way?

431
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,580
What do you need?

432
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,580
We need a cat carrier.

433
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Okay.

434
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,780
Um, ASAP cat carrier.

435
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:08,020
Uh, I can go pick one of those up, uh, uh, ASAP Doug, as soon as fucking possible.

436
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,100
Oh, drew, it's been a long night.

437
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
My dude.

438
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Yeah.

439
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
No, no, no.

440
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:22,900
I, it's been a long night and uh, drew, uh, drew kind of looks at everyone and looks at

441
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,500
his keys and turns around and runs out of the police station.

442
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Cool.

443
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Oh.

444
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,860
I locked the door behind him.

445
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,980
Let's get Doug in here.

446
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,380
Where's the gun, John Rosemary, you give us one fucking minute.

447
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,220
We're dealing with some body switching shit here.

448
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
More crazy.

449
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,260
The kind of stuff your boss is interested in, but like right now you're not necessarily

450
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,620
our number one priority.

451
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,580
It's the guy who just switched bodies with the cat.

452
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,580
Okay.

453
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,860
Well, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

454
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,860
Well, it's related.

455
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,180
You're going to know more later if you just have some fucking patients and hold those

456
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,700
goddamn horses here.

457
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,940
Open the door up and let's Rosemary, you can see all this.

458
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,940
You're about to.

459
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,020
Yeah, you'll see it.

460
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,220
You're like a mob enforcer.

461
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,580
We're just letting hang out in our police station.

462
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:19,260
So could you just like chill, chill, uh, go ahead and roll, uh, persuade.

463
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,260
No.

464
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,260
Okay.

465
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,060
And just, uh, walked, unlocked the door of the police station and walks out.

466
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,900
That's probably good for us in the long run.

467
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,420
I mean, where's she going to go?

468
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,720
She doesn't have a car here.

469
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,340
She also doesn't have a gun.

470
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
Yeah.

471
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,480
Let's deal with Doug real quick.

472
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,060
Or should we try to stop her?

473
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Yeah.

474
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
I don't know.

475
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,740
Doug, Rick, we might have to deal with something real quick.

476
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,260
Uh, just to double check.

477
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,220
Do you feel compelled to acquiesce to our desires?

478
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,020
Is that what you would like me to do?

479
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
Cool, cool, cool.

480
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,020
Hold on to that cat.

481
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,020
We'll be right back.

482
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,340
And I run out after Rosemary.

483
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
Okay.

484
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,300
What are the two of you doing, Clark and Keith?

485
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,540
I'm going to stand by inside the police department just to make sure he stays in here.

486
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,420
I'm back in full uniform, right?

487
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
Yeah.

488
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
I'll follow John out.

489
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
Okay.

490
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
Rosemary.

491
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
Rosemary, wait.

492
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:15,460
When you run outside, you actually see Drew is in his car and he's about to back up and

493
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,220
Rosemary is standing behind, banging on the trunk.

494
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,820
Rosemary, that's a very nice...

495
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,780
I pull my gun and point it at her.

496
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,780
All right.

497
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,100
Rosemary, hold on, hold on.

498
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,780
Get your man to open up the trunk door and then he can go get your cat carrier and I'll

499
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,200
come right back inside.

500
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
It's all fine.

501
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Okay.

502
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Everything's fine.

503
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,100
I'm going to come right back inside.

504
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,820
Just open up the trunk, Drew.

505
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,220
I drew all my gun too.

506
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,860
What's what's in the trunk, Rosemary?

507
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
I'm going to roll a...

508
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
All right.

509
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,540
Drew pops open the trunk and she says, thank you.

510
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,500
She reaches in and pulls out a briefcase, closes the door, hits the back of the trunk

511
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,340
and says, all right, Drew, you can go.

512
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,460
And then starts walking back toward you guys.

513
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,900
The gun lowered a little bit, but still out.

514
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,900
Same.

515
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,980
And she's just holding a metal briefcase and walking toward you.

516
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,180
Rosemary, what's in the briefcase there?

517
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
Five million dollars.

518
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,740
Interesting.

519
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,300
Why?

520
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,540
It's not yours.

521
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,540
Is it yours?

522
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
It is now.

523
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,860
Want to go have these?

524
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
No, thank you.

525
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:30,260
And she walks past you and heads to the door of the police station.

526
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,940
I turned to John, do you have any idea what the...

527
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,820
I've got no fucking clue what's going on.

528
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,580
Five million is?

529
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,700
She opens up the door and walks into the police station.

530
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,580
I guess she's back where we wanted her.

531
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,700
I assume so, though much wealthier than all of us, which I think means she's our boss

532
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,140
by American rules.

533
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,420
Is she our new chief?

534
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:59,060
There's only one rule here in America.

535
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,380
The almighty dollar.

536
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,580
Whoever has the most money is the chief of police.

537
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,260
Yeah, that's kind of how it works.

538
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,860
Dude, if either one of us win the Mega Millions tonight, we're going to have the best podcast

539
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,900
of all time.

540
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Welcome to Pretend to Be People.

541
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,980
Oh man, we can finally get that.

542
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,820
We can buy the Nat soundboard.

543
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,620
That Thomas soundboard we've all been wanting.

544
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,620
We can hire...

545
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,620
Nice.

546
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,620
Nice.

547
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,620
No, no, no, no, no.

548
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,620
Nice.

549
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,820
We just have professional voice actors that we dictate everything we speak of.

550
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,100
I mean, yeah, that's the plan for this actual podcast, right?

551
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,340
That's where we're headed.

552
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
Yeah, this is...

553
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,820
What we've been doing is a rough draft.

554
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,820
It's a rough script.

555
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,540
Yeah, we're going to have...

556
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,340
It's the pilot season.

557
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,420
Sam Rockwell and Jake as Keith Vigna on a podcast for whatever reason.

558
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,780
Idris Elba is playing Maggie Cook.

559
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,780
Nice.

560
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,620
Makes lots of sense.

561
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,260
Clark goes back inside.

562
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,300
John also goes back inside.

563
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,340
I see them come back inside and I open up the door and I let Doug in to the main room.

564
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:16,420
He kind of throws the cat back into the evidence room as you shut the door and he walks out

565
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,500
and he looks at his hands and he's like, wow, everything is very weird.

566
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,860
Doug, do you remember who you are?

567
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:37,780
Yeah, I remember that and then he looks past you and his eyes widen and he says, oh my

568
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,860
God, oh my God.

569
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,580
And he starts freaking out and he backs up back against the wall and then he just starts

570
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,620
moving and just dodging and trying to run away.

571
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,620
There's the ooze.

572
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,620
Get it back.

573
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,620
The ooze is here, guys.

574
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,620
The fucking ooze.

575
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,620
Water, water, water.

576
00:24:53,620 --> 00:25:00,140
I run into the sink that's in the police department.

577
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,300
You run into the sink.

578
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Is it there?

579
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
You actually bump into it.

580
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,200
I grab the biggest container I can find, probably a bowl, but if not a cup, fill it with water

581
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,140
and I'm throwing it over my shoulders close to Doug as I can.

582
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:20,340
I go to the other sink and I just smash the faucet off so water is spraying everywhere.

583
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,780
I asked, Doug, can you see the ooze right now?

584
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,660
Yes, it's right there.

585
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,660
It's right there.

586
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Don't let it touch you.

587
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,660
Don't let it touch you.

588
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,660
Where's he pointing to?

589
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,500
He's just pointing on the ground in the middle of the room.

590
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,340
So is water spraying, is water spraying everywhere?

591
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Are we getting close?

592
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,340
Am I hitting it with water?

593
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,340
Am I?

594
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Uh, I'm sorry.

595
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
Cause there's no way I would know.

596
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,860
Am I hitting them where he's pointing with water?

597
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,340
So in your mind, where is the sink in the police station?

598
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,340
I was picturing in my head just now like a firehouse kitchen to where it's like just

599
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,580
the, the side of the half of a room.

600
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,580
Sure.

601
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,580
Yeah.

602
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
Like that's kind of what I was like.

603
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,580
No real separation.

604
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
Yeah.

605
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
Just like a break room.

606
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,580
Microwave sink.

607
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
Right.

608
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Toaster.

609
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,580
You know what I can picture?

610
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,580
That.

611
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,580
Cool.

612
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
So I smashed a bathroom.

613
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
I smashed a bathroom fixture.

614
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,860
Open the cabinet doors up and break the pipe off.

615
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Yeah.

616
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:19,200
So you've got water flowing out from that side of the very open floor plan of the contention

617
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,180
police department.

618
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:27,860
Doug is still freaking out and sprinting about and Drew does not know or Drew's not there.

619
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,940
Rosemary has absolutely no idea what's going on.

620
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,980
She has walked over to Drew's desk and is like sitting up on top of the desk, just Indian

621
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,700
style holding the briefcase.

622
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,180
It's called crisscross applesauce now.

623
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,180
I am so sorry.

624
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,180
Sitting crisscross applesauce.

625
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,180
Fuck.

626
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,180
We got him.

627
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,740
Boom.

628
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,220
I guess I run over to where the water's flowing out and stand there just to be safe.

629
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
Yeah.

630
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,220
Doug get, get to the water.

631
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,100
He runs over and joins you and stays calm.

632
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,780
Doug, how big is the Zeus?

633
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,920
And his eyes get bigger than they were even a second ago.

634
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:14,060
The water is not stopping it.

635
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:20,580
And he sprints around the outside of the room and heads for the front door of the police

636
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
station.

637
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,220
Doug, if you head outside, please just remain right there and wait for further instruction.

638
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,900
I think I run after him.

639
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,900
I think I do too.

640
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
Like out of scare.

641
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Yeah.

642
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,820
I'm going to try to find a vacuum, like a little dust devil, like handheld.

643
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,820
Okay.

644
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,500
So you're going to try to find your little vacuum and Keith and Clark are running after

645
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Doug.

646
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:48,620
I abandoned my fireman's bucket line of water over my shoulder and yeah, it's hightailing

647
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,620
it.

648
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
Following the same path that he took.

649
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,620
Same.

650
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
Yeah.

651
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,620
Following the same path.

652
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:59,580
As you get to the front door, you see him standing in the parking lot and I need whoever

653
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,140
has the worst luck to roll luck right now for me.

654
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,140
What do you guys have?

655
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
75.

656
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
45.

657
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,140
65.

658
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,140
They're the ones outside though.

659
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,140
Did you mean of all of us?

660
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,140
I said what I meant.

661
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
I know what you meant.

662
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,740
I didn't hear you say oh.

663
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,740
I pass.

664
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,740
Crit pass.

665
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
Motherfucker.

666
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
33.

667
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
33 baby.

668
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
That's two 33s tonight.

669
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,740
Yeah, that is.

670
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,260
I hope that's on my mega millions ticket.

671
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:32,020
Clark, Keith, you run out the front door of the police station and see Doug standing in

672
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,220
the middle of the parking lot of the police and contention.

673
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
The fuck.

674
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:45,460
You see him standing in the middle of the parking lot and he is on his hands and knees

675
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,420
and he is weeping.

676
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,700
I yell at Doug.

677
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,980
You still see it.

678
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,660
Doug, come on buddy.

679
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
Come on.

680
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,100
I don't know what I see.

681
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
I don't see anything.

682
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:05,380
I go up to him and I slap him in the face and I say snap out of it, man.

683
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,580
Doug, we can't see it.

684
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,380
We need you to tell us if it's here.

685
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
I can't.

686
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,940
I can't see anything.

687
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,660
I don't know what's going on anymore.

688
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,660
It's just real.

689
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:25,780
And he just throws up onto the parking lot and he's now, I mean, completely bent over.

690
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,620
Snot is just pouring out of his nose.

691
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,060
He's like kind of spitting on the ground and he's like, I just don't know.

692
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,100
Is Keith's car in the lot with us?

693
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
The Cruiser is indeed.

694
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
Yes.

695
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Okay.

696
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,380
Hey Keith, let's get him up into your car, man.

697
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,020
I put an arm under his arm.

698
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
I'll take the other?

699
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Let's put him in the back.

700
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:53,740
I'm trying to give reassuring words, but I'm also, Clark needs him to shape up.

701
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,900
I want to know for sure what he sees.

702
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,900
I cast zone of truth.

703
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,540
Mage Hand.

704
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,620
He's weeping as you get him to the police cruiser.

705
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,500
I would like to persuade him not to weep.

706
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
I'm kidding.

707
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
I'm not even in.

708
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,580
Let's cut back to John in the police department.

709
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
You find a vacuum.

710
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
What are you doing with it?

711
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,940
Well, so not being able to see anything, I'm just like dancing from side to side, like

712
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,700
jumping back and forth and just like stabbing out in the air with this little dust devil.

713
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,700
What do you think, music wise, what's set to this?

714
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,940
I think it's totally silent.

715
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:43,180
I think you just hear his foot falls in wet wet squeaky feet and like Rosemary faintly

716
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:50,780
chuckling shut up, Rosemary, John, you look stupid.

717
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,780
Damn it.

718
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:58,540
I know cutting back, you get him into the police cruiser and he immediately just folds

719
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,380
a head into hands and he's breaking down.

720
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,260
When he looks at you guys, you see a ghost of a man.

721
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:12,660
I want to say, Hey, Hey, Hey Doug, will you, will you wipe your brow with your right hand?

722
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,140
He does so.

723
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
Okay.

724
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,460
I wanted to make sure he was still under the influence.

725
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,460
Okay.

726
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,500
That's, this is all understandable.

727
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,300
He's a man who became a cat who became a different man.

728
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,620
Very hard to process.

729
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:38,620
I uh, he starts coughing.

730
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,880
I start petting him on the back.

731
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
Get it out bud.

732
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Get it out.

733
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,940
And no fur comes up cause he's in a human body now that didn't eat any hair.

734
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,060
Uh, but he just throws up a little bile onto the floor of the police cruiser.

735
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,060
Old habits die hard.

736
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,660
I know, but how long were you in that body?

737
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
I don't know.

738
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,980
Time, time isn't, isn't real.

739
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,260
And I was so cold.

740
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:10,460
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, we don't have any idea where your wife is.

741
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:22,260
Just kidding.

742
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
That's not true.

743
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,980
I think we have a pretty good idea where she is.

744
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,400
The upside down.

745
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,100
He looks up at you guys.

746
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,460
What's happening?

747
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,160
Why is this happening?

748
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,620
Do you remember anything before you change, changed bodies with that cat?

749
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,540
Yeah, I, what led up to that happening?

750
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:55,360
I was, uh, I was sick and uh, Marie was, uh, taking care of me and she brought, she brought

751
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:05,340
in this radio is that radio, that fucking radio and she turned it on and I, I don't

752
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
know.

753
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,340
Then it's just flashes.

754
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,460
I was cold.

755
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,460
I was in the water.

756
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,180
I mean, I was running away from this.

757
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,340
It felt like a dream.

758
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:19,940
I think I was dreaming and then he, uh, he looks up and he, he catches a glimpse of himself

759
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,860
in the rear view mirror of the cruiser and he's like, this is a dream.

760
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,980
This is a dream.

761
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
This is a dream.

762
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
This is a dream.

763
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
I'm going to dream.

764
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
You're in a dream.

765
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,040
You're in my dream and uh, we're all in this dream and it's fine.

766
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Everything's fine.

767
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,580
I'm just going to wake up and everything's going to be fine.

768
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
You're fine.

769
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
It's fine.

770
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Everything's going to be fine.

771
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,580
You're not dreaming, Doug.

772
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,580
I look at Keith.

773
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
I mean, sure.

774
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,460
Hey Doug, you're right.

775
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,860
This is, this is just a crazy dream and as soon as it's run its course, you'll wake up

776
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,540
next to Marie and everything's going to be all right.

777
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,700
But for now, why not give us as much help as you can?

778
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
What's the worst that could happen?

779
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,700
It's just a dream.

780
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
No Dougie, no cry.

781
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,700
All right.

782
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,700
What do we do?

783
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,420
What do we do?

784
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,700
Well, I got, I got, I got a question for you, Doug.

785
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,300
When we, when you were in that cat body, you seemed real confident when we asked you if

786
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,020
you knew how to use the radio to switch bodies back.

787
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,660
How did you know how to do it so well?

788
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,980
She just turned it on.

789
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,300
So you, you, is there a chance we, you could have switched bodies with any of us as far

790
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,460
as you know, or did you know that you were going to go into the detective's body somehow?

791
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
The detective?

792
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
I'm sorry.

793
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,740
Uh, the body that you're in right now.

794
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,700
I just knew that I, there was a great chance that I wasn't going to be a cat anymore.

795
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Okay.

796
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,540
So you didn't like think real hard about wanting to be that body on the floor or anything

797
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,540
like that?

798
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,980
No, I was just thinking about being, I mean, when I was in there, sure.

799
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:55,220
I was just thinking like, be a human, be a human, be a human, but like, you know, like,

800
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,460
what's that even mean?

801
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,460
You know?

802
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Sure.

803
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,740
It's a dream.

804
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:10,860
Doesn't have to make any sense over his head at Keith and roll my eyes.

805
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:16,220
Cutting back to in the police department, John, you're, you're vacuuming around and

806
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,820
just like sprinting all over the place, leaping from side to side.

807
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,300
As you do, you see there is a briefcase that is like a leather briefcase that you haven't

808
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,140
seen before ever in the police department.

809
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:38,060
And it has a little plaque on it, placard that just says, uh, agent Chad on it.

810
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,480
And as you're going about your business, uh, you notice that on one of the desks.

811
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,020
So I'm going to stop in my tracks for just a moment.

812
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,020
Does a goo monster eat me roll now?

813
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,020
You're good.

814
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,020
Okay.

815
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,580
I take a breath.

816
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,620
I'm standing there for maybe like 15, 20 seconds.

817
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,260
And then I go over to the, once I'm sure the coast is clear, I go over to the case.

818
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,940
Uh, why'd you stop dancing?

819
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,100
I think that might've been some kind of illusory goo monster, but I'm not really sure.

820
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,460
Oh yeah, totally.

821
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,300
We're dealing with a man who had his brain transferred into a cat.

822
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Yeah, that all adds up.

823
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,300
More like his consciousness.

824
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Sure.

825
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,020
You're such a dick, Rosemary.

826
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,500
Well, you're a fucking idiot and you're talking nonsense.

827
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,020
Smarter than you says under his breath.

828
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,780
That is actually true for the listeners.

829
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:38,260
Uh, John has a 75 intelligence and Rosemary has a 45.

830
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,140
I'm way smarter than you.

831
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,380
So I go over to the case and see if I can, is it locked or anything?

832
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,760
No, it's not locked.

833
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,740
What has Chad been up to?

834
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,740
When you open it, you notice there are a lot of things inside this briefcase.

835
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,340
There's a lot of things inside this briefcase.

836
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,340
Four specifically.

837
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,660
Well, I mean, several.

838
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,220
But the first thing is a bunch of signs.

839
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,420
Rosemary, I think it's a sign.

840
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,940
It's a bunch of these signs.

841
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:15,620
There is also a list that is right here and there is also a map that is right here and

842
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:21,580
there's also a little device in there that you would recognize as a cell phone jammer

843
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,540
and it is turned on.

844
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
It's strawberry.

845
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,900
Cutting back into the parking lot.

846
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,660
Oh shit, Keith, John.

847
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,060
Oh, Doug, we need you to come tell us if you see any of that goo.

848
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,780
I don't know.

849
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,340
You know, honestly, I'm pretty sure I was just seeing that stuff.

850
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,820
Well, why don't you just come in with us and just double check.

851
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Okay.

852
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,020
And so he gets out and he's, you know, he's still trying to get it together.

853
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,420
He's crying a bit.

854
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,980
He's crying a bit, but you guys get him in.

855
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,180
What do you see, Doug?

856
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,180
Looks around.

857
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
It must be gone now.

858
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,780
No goo.

859
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,660
Got a wet floor though, seemingly.

860
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,820
And then he kind of walks over to where you guys just were in the mirror above the sink

861
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,620
and he just stares in it and he starts feeling his face.

862
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,660
I walk over to John.

863
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,260
What you looking at there?

864
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
Hey guys.

865
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,260
So, Agent Chad had some weird stuff in his briefcase.

866
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,220
You should probably take a look at this.

867
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,740
I was just going to say we might be careful though in case he had some like, since the

868
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:33,120
animals seem to have been able to see the goo and maybe he just had some residuals from

869
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,380
being a cat, that goo might still be in here.

870
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,780
Hey Doug, you think the goo is still in here?

871
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:44,180
I don't, honestly, I just, um, I don't know what you're talking about.

872
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,300
You think the scary thing, the thing that scared you?

873
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,820
Yeah, I, you know, I've been through a lot and I just, um, you know, I think I just freaked

874
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:01,580
out but everything seems to be fine, uh, now, you know, I don't, I think my head is clear.

875
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,860
It's, uh, I don't know if you were aware of this, but you're in my dream right now, where

876
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:11,500
I'm another person, which is nuts, uh, so, you know.

877
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,660
That seems like pretty standard dream stuff for me.

878
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,380
No, I don't think I've ever had a dream where I wasn't myself, but, uh, here is a little

879
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,740
dust devil in case you get the wheelies again and then you can scoop, you can scoop it up.

880
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,900
You can scoop up the, with the dust devil?

881
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Yeah.

882
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
Yeah.

883
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,900
All right.

884
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,900
And then he grabs it.

885
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
All right.

886
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
He just kind of rubs it, keeps looking in the mirror.

887
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:37,740
He's, he's really, you know, as one might be when in a different body, he is fascinated

888
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,740
by his reflection.

889
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,740
Sure.

890
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,740
Yeah.

891
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,900
As you guys probably saw, Chad had this, these signs to put up all over town, uh, saying

892
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,660
attention a chemical spill from the unincorporated land.

893
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:56,100
Once the town perdition just west of contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately.

894
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,580
Don't forget your pets.

895
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,140
There's this list of all the places he was going to post the signage at.

896
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,420
It's all, it's all the main hotspots in town here.

897
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,780
You talk, talk about that one for an equal opportunity podcast.

898
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,740
Everybody gets to read a little something.

899
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,180
Uh, yeah, he's also, uh, got this map here.

900
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,900
It's it's color coded showing all the missing persons and the days that they all left.

901
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,020
And it would have been nice to have had drew tell us about that.

902
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,240
It would have been, he had a lot on his mind.

903
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,220
It's over the dates of December 1st, December 2nd and December 3rd.

904
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,700
There's a couple of dots on December 1st, three on the second and then an explosion

905
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,700
on the third.

906
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,700
That's correct.

907
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,700
Dots all over the town.

908
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
Okay.

909
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,700
Yeah.

910
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,580
So if you get a chance to study that list, is there anything out of the ordinary?

911
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,180
That list is just a list of the places that exist in contention.

912
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,180
Okay.

913
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,180
Okay.

914
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
Yeah.

915
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,980
I don't think there's anything further to examine in that list.

916
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,580
Rosemary says, well, didn't he, uh, didn't he get there this morning before any place

917
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,580
opened?

918
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,740
Probably didn't have a chance yet to go to any of them.

919
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,900
That's why there's so many posters in the whatever you guys are.

920
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Yeah.

921
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,740
I mean, what are you Rosemary?

922
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,740
Rosemary.

923
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,020
Clearly he hadn't put the signs up yet.

924
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,580
I don't know what you're trying to tell us yet.

925
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,980
He didn't put the signs up yet.

926
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,260
That's why they're in the briefcase.

927
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,820
And it looks like there's a little squares for him to make a check mark where he went

928
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
and there are no checkmarks.

929
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,820
I'm sorry.

930
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,820
I cut you off.

931
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,820
I said what I needed to say.

932
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,900
Rosemary, do you think you're telling us something new?

933
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,180
We all got that pretty quick.

934
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,180
Yeah.

935
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,460
It's just been a while since I talked to him.

936
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,580
I just want to remind you that my intelligence is 45.

937
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,380
All right.

938
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,940
What a weird way to quantify your own intelligence, but, uh, out of 50 in my mom's eyes.

939
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,940
Yeah.

940
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,340
Mama's love us all.

941
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,340
What do we do now guys?

942
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:54,500
Well, I would still like to talk to the, uh, the big guy in the city with Rosemary here.

943
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,020
Well, what should we do with Doug?

944
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,980
Well, Doug is a very useful tool.

945
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,980
Yeah.

946
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,580
We want him to stick with us for as long as possible at this point.

947
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,940
Also seems like we could probably get more information out of them.

948
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,060
Well, I think if you want to go by yourself, you want to come with, I mean, you are going

949
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:14,360
to go talk to a mob boss, so maybe it's not the safest for one police officer to go kind

950
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,300
of seems safer than being in a town with a goo monster, but Clark or Clark.

951
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,300
Hey Clark.

952
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,300
Yes.

953
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,300
Joe.

954
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:27,980
Oh, it's fun to watch someone break mentally in person.

955
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,980
Hey John, can you remind me why did the, the Bob want the gun?

956
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:42,860
All right, so John Peters owed money, gambling debts, we assume to the mob, uh, to the glass

957
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,780
crime family.

958
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,620
He sent his two boys down there, Marvin glass, sent his two boys to go collect that money

959
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:57,580
after Peters had already come in to possession of the artifacts and some magic fuckery happened.

960
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,420
One of the boys disappeared, Jermaine Jermaine.

961
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,580
The other one is a babbling idiot just talking about that gun now, Alfred, gun boy.

962
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,740
So that's really all Rosemary knows is that she's supposed to come down here and get this

963
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:15,180
gun gun and take it back to, uh, the Marvin glass boss.

964
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,180
Yeah.

965
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,980
And after we got to talking, I was thinking that, you know, perhaps we could recruit this

966
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:26,620
Marvin glass and his army of games to help us out down here in exchange for maybe getting

967
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,540
his boy back from the upside down.

968
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:36,500
So you're hoping that this gun means that much to him, but that's your big, that's your

969
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,500
bargaining chip, right?

970
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,180
I'm hoping, well, I'm hoping his bullet means that much to him, but yeah, the gun is the

971
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,660
bridge to the boy.

972
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,260
I pulled John far away from Rosemary.

973
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,000
I mean, that's what we're bluffing, right?

974
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,020
We don't know where the gun works.

975
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,780
I don't know fucking shit about how the gun works, but we fucking like, that's kind of

976
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,260
my whole pitch to Mr. Glass.

977
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,380
It's like, Hey man, there's some weird supernatural shit happening.

978
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,940
And uh, if you want your boy back, we could really use any operational assistance your

979
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:14,080
organization could provide that comes without the pesky oversight of say the FBI.

980
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,860
So I thought maybe he could pitch in and would have a strong motivation to do so.

981
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,420
I E it's child.

982
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,420
Yeah.

983
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,420
I don't know.

984
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,020
It sounds risky, but if you think you can do it, the manpower would be helpful.

985
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,060
Yeah.

986
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,860
And just, you know, more minds on this thing, crime boys thinking crime ways, it's a criminal

987
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,860
goo.

988
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,100
It's already taken so many people.

989
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:41,860
So it's a criminal goo.

990
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,860
Yeah.

991
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,860
Okay.

992
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:51,420
Well, so one thing I think we should definitely do is, is there any truth to this?

993
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,260
Was this talk of the chemical spill?

994
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,760
That's probably just a cover up.

995
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,000
Is it a cover up or is there some truth to it?

996
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah.

997
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Something happened in Perdition.

998
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,640
That could be that they think that there's something moving this way either way.

999
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
Exactly.

1000
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,280
I also think maybe it's not a bad idea to just go ahead and post those around town to

1001
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,640
save more people.

1002
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,640
I'm with you.

1003
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,640
Yeah.

1004
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,000
Uh, but maybe we go check out Perdition.

1005
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,840
Also get some of these protesters out of our hair.

1006
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah, for sure.

1007
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,480
Do we, do we need to edit our radio message to adhere to the attention signs that we've

1008
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,640
just now gotten?

1009
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,640
That would not be a bad idea.

1010
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,520
We could have Doug do that right now.

1011
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,520
Hopefully.

1012
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,520
Yeah.

1013
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,520
Hey Doug.

1014
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,520
Yeah.

1015
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,520
Come over here for a second.

1016
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
Sure.

1017
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Can you, uh, here, let me, let me just write it down and I write down exactly what I want

1018
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,520
him to say.

1019
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,520
Okay.

1020
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,240
Would you mind reading this into this recorder here for us and just, just read it as naturally

1021
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,240
as you can.

1022
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,240
But hit me with it.

1023
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
I don't know what it's going to say.

1024
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,320
It says, attention, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land once the town Perdition

1025
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,840
just west of contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately.

1026
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,120
Do not forget your bets.

1027
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,120
Okay.

1028
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,880
Let me give that a go.

1029
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,600
And the contention PD are on your side.

1030
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,600
Once again.

1031
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Yeah.

1032
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:11,020
Uh, tension, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land once the town Perdition just west of

1033
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:16,560
contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately.

1034
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,480
Don't forget your pets.

1035
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,760
And say the boys in blue are here for you.

1036
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,200
The boys in blue are here for you.

1037
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,200
That's right.

1038
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:33,920
The contention PD is your B F D, which stands for best friends and dependable.

1039
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,840
You know, Doug, you, you went a little off script at the end, but you really got the

1040
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,520
message across and I think that was, it was good at lip and it's great how much you sound

1041
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,520
like Chad.

1042
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
That's awesome.

1043
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,520
Thank you.

1044
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,200
Voices come from the body, not the person.

1045
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:53,120
I didn't think you were, it doesn't make sense to me either.

1046
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,120
This does make sense.

1047
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,120
Yeah.

1048
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:01,320
It's just very convenient that we can still have Chad's body as well.

1049
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,920
Uh, okay.

1050
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,380
So a couple, I was going to say a couple of things are going to happen.

1051
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,560
That's not our podcast.

1052
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:27,120
There are other role playing podcasts.

1053
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,620
Have you met anyone?

1054
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,160
They also have a role playing podcast.

1055
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,160
I hate everyone.

1056
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,160
Yeah.

1057
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,160
Okay.

1058
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:43,120
So you have Doug record that message and pretty immediately you see Rosemary is getting a

1059
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:52,260
pretty tired of this shit and she's a stood up now, John gun now, or I'm going to go find

1060
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,260
your briefcase.

1061
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:58,140
I don't know what that means, but well, listen, let me talk with the boys for just a second

1062
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,780
and I think we're going to move things towards getting you that gun.

1063
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,140
Can you hold on real quick while I confer five minutes?

1064
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,140
All right.

1065
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,140
Oh, I thought she was going to start counting.

1066
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,140
Yeah, me too.

1067
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,020
That would not have been enough for minutes.

1068
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,060
Oh, you don't know what a minute is.

1069
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,060
You're real dumb.

1070
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,060
Three minutes.

1071
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,140
Oh no.

1072
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:18,160
Why did Marvin glass and trust you with this last few minutes?

1073
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,640
Let's go start back at 60 then you're good.

1074
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,360
All right boys.

1075
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,080
John Stossel.

1076
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,360
I'm not aware of the reference.

1077
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,720
He's on 60 minutes.

1078
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,480
Good one Rosemary.

1079
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,480
Now I get it.

1080
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,480
Yeah.

1081
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,480
Yeah.

1082
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,300
Boys, she's getting pretty antsy about this gun and getting back to the city.

1083
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,740
I don't know that we have any other leads other than this.

1084
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,740
Well, we've got unincorporated land in perdition, but that might be a pretty dangerous place

1085
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,740
to go to.

1086
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:55,340
Also, it could just be a thing that the FBI said.

1087
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,920
Would we know, would you be able to swing by the unincorporated land quite easily on

1088
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,020
your way to the city from contention?

1089
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,180
Couldn't be more in the opposite direction.

1090
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,260
Guys, that couldn't be more in the opposite direction.

1091
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,020
I mean, contingent is not that big.

1092
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,600
That's not going to add more than an hour or so, I don't think.

1093
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,240
That well, yeah, but I mean, I think Tom is of the essence.

1094
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,240
What is she going to do if we like, we'll get there eventually.

1095
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,960
She's not going to like kill us.

1096
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,920
And if she does, she'll only kill one of us.

1097
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,920
You can't hear this Rosemary.

1098
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,920
We're talking.

1099
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,920
Out of your shot.

1100
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,160
She just overheard laughter.

1101
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,060
She's on Instagram.

1102
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,840
She just follows shit posters.

1103
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,920
She's watching puppy cuts.

1104
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,920
Yeah.

1105
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,920
What do you think?

1106
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,920
Well, I'd like to go.

1107
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,380
You boys don't have to come with me, but, uh, it might be more convenient for recording

1108
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,380
purposes.

1109
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,380
Yeah.

1110
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,380
Yeah.

1111
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,620
Uh, Joe's at a pickle there.

1112
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,300
I don't think Clark would go at all.

1113
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,940
He'd be afraid of the mob and feel like we have to take care of shit here, but I also

1114
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,100
don't want to be away from them for a long time.

1115
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,100
It could be if you guys go to the city and all that shit.

1116
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,100
I don't know.

1117
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:01,520
Hey John, how about can we, can we, can we ask Rosemary to give us the morning to put

1118
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,120
up these signs and get in touch with dog and get the radio broadcast out and then maybe

1119
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,620
we could run up there and run up to city.

1120
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:14,900
We can leave Ray in charge for, she's testy, but I don't know if she has a real strong

1121
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,980
bargaining position here.

1122
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,980
Right.

1123
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,900
Cause it's three men in this office with guns.

1124
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,780
So and we have the one thing that she wants.

1125
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,300
Yeah, that's exactly right.

1126
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:30,300
And we can stop by here first or no, maybe we'll decide on the way.

1127
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,720
We could always just have Drew do the signs.

1128
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,720
Oh fuck.

1129
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,720
Joe didn't think of that.

1130
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,880
Clark probably would have cause that's a very good idea.

1131
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,520
There's no reason that we need to do that personally.

1132
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Grunt work.

1133
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,520
Who has the best alertness?

1134
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
Got a 70.

1135
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,400
Do you want to roll alertness Clark?

1136
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:53,720
I helipass a three on a, it would be a 50 since a minus 20% but yeah, three.

1137
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,320
Which we forgot about all podcasts.

1138
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,080
I don't think anybody's rolled.

1139
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,080
What did we forget?

1140
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Sorry.

1141
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,080
The minus 20.

1142
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,860
But you guys crit.

1143
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,860
Yeah.

1144
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,860
Succeeded.

1145
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,860
So that's true.

1146
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,860
Oh man.

1147
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,100
I need to be a better handler.

1148
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,860
Also my, like it wouldn't have affected, I think I've done two roles because it rolled

1149
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,900
like super low on all your roles.

1150
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:14,900
Okay.

1151
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,900
That makes me feel better.

1152
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:21,580
So you pass, you notice very clearly Rosemary is listening in on the conversation.

1153
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,700
Hey, get out of here.

1154
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,700
Get on out.

1155
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,500
Cause she's just still sitting where she is, right?

1156
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,880
She didn't walk over to us.

1157
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:37,320
If you are in the same room still, yeah, no, she's just intently listening to your conversation.

1158
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,920
I just pulled John in a little closer.

1159
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,960
I think she can hear us.

1160
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,800
It's not ideal, but she's also not the brightest bulb.

1161
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,200
Rosemary, did you hear any of that?

1162
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
No.

1163
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
All right.

1164
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,200
She heard.

1165
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,320
Did you like any of it?

1166
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,320
Yeah.

1167
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,800
Rosemary, we need an hour in contention before we can leave.

1168
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,340
Is that all right?

1169
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,260
Keep in mind we all have pistols and the one thing you want in the world and the one thing

1170
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,340
your boss wants in the world.

1171
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,020
Your boss is a pretty scary dude.

1172
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,700
So consider this hour your entire fucking life.

1173
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:20,020
Like I'll give you an hour for a hundred thousand dollars.

1174
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,020
We'll get it to you later.

1175
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,020
Yeah.

1176
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,780
I mean you've got $5 million in your hand.

1177
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,780
I don't know.

1178
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,780
John deal.

1179
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,260
No, no deal.

1180
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,600
Why would that be a deal?

1181
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,600
Okay.

1182
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,800
And she gets up and has a briefcase and she walks toward the front door of the police

1183
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,800
station.

1184
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,880
I've moved a blocker.

1185
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,880
What do you want to do?

1186
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,880
I want you to wait a fucking hour while we take care of some shit and then get that gun

1187
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,400
for your boss.

1188
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,400
Quick question.

1189
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,800
Are we going to bring her with us?

1190
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Yeah.

1191
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,800
Yeah.

1192
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
One hour.

1193
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
That's fine.

1194
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
One hour.

1195
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
All right.

1196
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,800
God damn it.

1197
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,460
Is Drew, is Drew going to put up the signs for us?

1198
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,460
Yeah.

1199
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,580
Are we going to go here or are we going to, oh, yeah, we might not need that hour.

1200
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,820
What are we doing with her hour?

1201
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,820
So fucked.

1202
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,820
Shit.

1203
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,820
That's it.

1204
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,820
We're going to go put the signs.

1205
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,820
How far away is Perdition?

1206
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,820
Hour.

1207
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,820
One hour away.

1208
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,320
Damn it.

1209
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,320
She's stupid.

1210
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,320
She doesn't know how long an hour is.

1211
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,320
Well, that's what I'm saying.

1212
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:22,040
Once we're in the car, like we can just drive somewhere and then she's still captive with

1213
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,040
us.

1214
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:30,200
Did you hear that Rosemary?

1215
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,120
She looks up from her phone.

1216
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,120
What?

1217
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,160
I mean, our two options are either go to the city or go here.

1218
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,760
I think we should have Drew put up the signs.

1219
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,760
Yeah.

1220
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,760
That'll make Clark feel better.

1221
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,080
And then I think we should just go to the city.

1222
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,080
Yeah.

1223
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,560
And if we need to, we can stop here on the way back.

1224
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,560
Okay.

1225
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Let's do it.

1226
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,660
I want to call Drew and tell him, Drew, forget the cat carrier.

1227
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,460
Would you come on back to the office?

1228
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,460
Don't forget the cat carrier.

1229
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,460
I've already got it.

1230
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,460
Perfect.

1231
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,460
Don't worry.

1232
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,460
Then let's bring that on in.

1233
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:02,820
When you get into the office on your desk, there's going to be a pile of flyers and a

1234
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,820
list next to it.

1235
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,780
And I want you to go and put a flyer at every place on that list.

1236
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,780
Oh, okay.

1237
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,780
Just tape it to the door.

1238
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,700
Don't even, if somebody tries to stop you, just say the police are in control, turn on

1239
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,860
your radio and listen to the message from dog.

1240
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,860
Yeah.

1241
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,580
Clark, I don't think anyone's going to stop me.

1242
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,400
There's like nobody here.

1243
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,360
This place is a ghost town.

1244
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,360
What?

1245
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,360
Like there's just nobody around.

1246
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,360
Like I've been driving around.

1247
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:31,360
I went to the, I went to the store and there's like no shoppers.

1248
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,520
There's no cars driving around.

1249
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,520
This is crazy.

1250
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,280
I just like came in and grabbed the cat grabber.

1251
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,280
What was it that I have?

1252
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,280
Cat carrier.

1253
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,280
A cat carrier.

1254
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,280
Yeah.

1255
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,280
That's what I grabbed.

1256
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,320
And yeah, I just, uh, I waited at the checkout for a while, but, uh, nobody's, uh, you stole

1257
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,320
it, Drew.

1258
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,320
No, I didn't steal it.

1259
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,320
I'm still waiting.

1260
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,400
Oh, I give you permission to come on and come on back to the office.

1261
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,880
Don't worry about putting cash down.

1262
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,760
We'll, we'll get, we'll settle up with them later.

1263
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,760
Oh, okay.

1264
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,040
I'll just leave cash though.

1265
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,040
Okay.

1266
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,040
If it makes you feel better.

1267
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,040
Okay.

1268
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,040
And don't worry.

1269
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,040
We're on it.

1270
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,040
Yeah.

1271
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,040
Same.

1272
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,040
Cool.

1273
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,840
We're all on it.

1274
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
Shit.

1275
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,720
The entire town disappearing does add a wrench to our plans.

1276
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,660
Do we need to leave Drew around if there's nobody here?

1277
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,660
Should he come with us?

1278
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:29,240
You guys hear a car pull up in the parking lot of the police department and, uh, there's

1279
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,240
a knock at the door.

1280
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,960
You guys are standing kind of in the entryway and you look over and you see a woman.

1281
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,440
Uh, she's an older woman with a big glasses, bigger hair.

1282
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,440
She's knocking on the door.

1283
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,960
Do I recognize her?

1284
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,520
Yeah, I think you would.

1285
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,860
Uh, this is Jan Manstein, Jan Manstein.

1286
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,620
She is Ari's mother.

1287
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:54,580
Ari is a, your co-worker, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1288
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,580
Woman.

1289
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,580
Fuck.

1290
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:02,180
Who works in the police department and does a lot of stuff around town for you guys.

1291
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,880
And this is her mom, Jan.

1292
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,900
I wave at her through the glass.

1293
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,900
Hey, Jan.

1294
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,900
Hey, Jan.

1295
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,900
What's going on?

1296
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,900
Oh, hi.

1297
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,900
Yeah.

1298
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:16,820
Um, yeah, no, uh, I'm just here to, uh, I mean, I'm here to pick up.

1299
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:21,600
Her things, uh, you know, she, she, she would have wanted that.

1300
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,220
Maybe she wouldn't have, I don't know, but I got to get the stuff.

1301
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,220
Maybe.

1302
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,700
I don't know, but probably I should probably get it.

1303
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,700
She'll need it.

1304
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,380
So, uh, I just need to come inside, come inside.

1305
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,380
So have a seat.

1306
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,380
Yeah.

1307
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:40,140
She walks in and she's like just completely scattered and she's like, Oh gosh, you know,

1308
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:46,420
I, I just, I thought that, you know, uh, she would want me to, to have her, which desk

1309
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,180
was, was Ari's.

1310
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:54,940
What do you mean was, what do you mean was the fire in the city?

1311
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,620
Ari's dead.

1312
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,620
What fire?

1313
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,300
The hospital fire?

1314
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,460
Yes.

1315
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,660
Is Clark saying who's Ari or is Clark totally aware who Ari is?

1316
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,660
Ari's Ray.

1317
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,220
I know we outside know that.

1318
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,220
What's Clark doing right now?

1319
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,460
Oh, that's a good point.

1320
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,780
What are we doing every time we hear that Ray has a different name, you're immediately

1321
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:19,340
confused and then you have a flood of memories with Ari.

1322
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,340
Perfect.

1323
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,340
Okay.

1324
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,900
Did we send Ray to the hospital?

1325
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,900
Yes.

1326
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,900
Woof.

1327
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:33,260
You sent Florence to the hospital in the ambulance with Rosemary after the skirmish, after we

1328
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,500
shot hotel, hotel, right, right, right, right.

1329
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:44,060
You sent Ari to keep an eye or Florence or Ray or Tim to keep an eye on Rosemary.

1330
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,060
That's weird.

1331
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,540
We forgot about that until just now.

1332
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,660
Rosemary, can I talk to you for a minute?

1333
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,660
Yeah.

1334
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:54,460
And Clark, do you show her where Ari's desk was and so she begins collecting the belongings

1335
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,460
of her daughter.

1336
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,460
I'm very somber.

1337
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,980
Jana, I'm, I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1338
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:05,900
You know, you sign up for this life and you know, she, she always, she always knew that,

1339
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:12,180
you know, go, gosh, maybe there would, you know, but you know, as a mother, you know,

1340
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:19,380
you always think, you know, the, maybe everything will be all right, but maybe it won't, I,

1341
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:25,740
it's just, it's hard, but, uh, I'm sure you'll all, you'll all be there tomorrow, right?

1342
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,420
For the funeral, obviously.

1343
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,420
Of course.

1344
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,420
What, what time is that?

1345
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,260
Uh, it's at, uh, it's, it's at 11 or 10.

1346
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,180
I think it's, we're doing at 11, 10 30.

1347
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,180
It's a 10 30.

1348
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,180
No, no, no, no.

1349
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,180
I decided on 11.

1350
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,620
Yeah, no, it's 11.

1351
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,620
It's all right.

1352
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,620
We'll sign up for sure.

1353
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,620
And we'll be there.

1354
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,020
Did Rosemary burn down the hospital?

1355
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,700
That's what I'm asking her.

1356
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:53,420
Cut to John and Rosemary in the back room and she eyes the evidence locker door.

1357
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,100
Are you going to give me the gun now?

1358
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,340
Hey, first of all, Rosemary, you're never fucking getting that gun.

1359
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,420
It's going directly into Marvin Glass's hands.

1360
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,420
If it goes anywhere, you can escort it with us, but I'm not giving you the gun.

1361
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,780
We clear on that.

1362
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:11,220
First of all, uh, did you fucking burn down the hospital in the city and kill one of our

1363
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,220
officers?

1364
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,220
No.

1365
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,220
Rosemary.

1366
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,220
Come on.

1367
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,220
No.

1368
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,220
Rosemary.

1369
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,220
Yeah.

1370
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:26,220
Did you burn down the hospital?

1371
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,220
Yeah.

1372
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,220
Rosemary.

1373
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,260
You know, mobsters go to the hospital.

1374
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,260
The city needs a hospital.

1375
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,740
Mobsters get hurt all the time.

1376
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,740
They put me in.

1377
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,140
I don't like handcuffs.

1378
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,140
They put me in handcuffs.

1379
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,140
I don't like handcuffs.

1380
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,140
Well, you shot it, please.

1381
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,140
Or, well, I guess we shot it.

1382
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,460
You tried to stab Keith.

1383
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,020
He tried to fucking shoot me.

1384
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,980
Cause you were trying to stab Rosemary.

1385
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,980
He came at me with a knife.

1386
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,980
Okay.

1387
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:51,380
Well, listen, that's not ideal.

1388
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,820
That's not really cool.

1389
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,140
Fully fucking aware, John.

1390
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,020
All right.

1391
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:03,940
Well, uh, can you just play it cool for like five fucking minutes because the mother of

1392
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,420
the fucking cop you burned to death along with, what was it?

1393
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,420
40 other people.

1394
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,420
Yeah.

1395
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,540
I didn't put that together, but she's out there right now.

1396
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,400
I'm always cool, John.

1397
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,900
That is literally never true.

1398
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,340
So you guys walk back out into the station.

1399
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:25,580
Jan is, uh, finishing packing up everything and oh gosh, I just, you know, I, Stan is

1400
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,620
gonna, he's, he's gonna fall apart.

1401
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:29,620
I just don't know.

1402
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,420
I don't know what to tell him.

1403
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,340
I, maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't.

1404
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,340
Should I tell him?

1405
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,340
What do you think?

1406
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,340
Should I?

1407
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,340
Would you like one of us to tell him?

1408
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,340
Yes.

1409
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,340
Yes.

1410
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,340
No, no, no, no.

1411
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,340
Yes.

1412
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,340
Yes.

1413
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,340
Yes.

1414
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,340
Yeah.

1415
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,340
Yes.

1416
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,340
Please.

1417
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,140
And then real quick, remind me where he lives and his exact relation to you so there's no

1418
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,140
faux pas.

1419
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,140
Oh yeah.

1420
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,140
No.

1421
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:59,140
Stan is, uh, my ex husband, Ari's father, uh, he's been in the city asylum for 28 years.

1422
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:02,500
Oh, well as it just so happens, we're about to go up to the city.

1423
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,580
So that might be pretty convenient.

1424
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:08,060
If you could let him know, that would be, no, no, you shouldn't.

1425
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,480
No, I should be the one to tell, no, you do it.

1426
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,480
You do it.

1427
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,480
No, I should be the one.

1428
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,480
Okay.

1429
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,480
Bye.

1430
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1431
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,480
Okay.

1432
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,480
Before you go.

1433
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,620
Hey, do you see anybody else out in town when you came over here?

1434
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,860
Well, contention is a small town, right?

1435
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:26,420
I am never around here, but traffic on the roads, any people walking about, a bunch of

1436
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,420
green lights.

1437
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,860
I, well, I think I ran into one red maybe on the way in perhaps.

1438
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,860
Yeah.

1439
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,860
Um, have a good day.

1440
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,860
Animals.

1441
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:39,340
Wait, wait, wait, Jan, when we, when we talked to Stan, do you want us to tell him anything

1442
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,560
for you?

1443
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,980
Maybe like the last time you talked to Ari, maybe something she said then, do you remember

1444
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,380
the last time you talked to her?

1445
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,380
Yes.

1446
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,380
Yeah.

1447
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,380
It was, uh, it was just the other night.

1448
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,380
What did she say?

1449
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:54,620
She said, uh, her last words were, I'm going to bed now.

1450
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,780
No, they were, I love you.

1451
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,540
No, it was just that she'd just eaten Mac and cheese.

1452
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,540
No, no, no.

1453
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,860
She said, I love you.

1454
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,860
And I said, I love you.

1455
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:02,860
I can't.

1456
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,860
That's fine.

1457
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,580
We'll tell Stan that she, she said, I love you.

1458
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,580
And then one last thing.

1459
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,980
Does the name Ray mean anything to you?

1460
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:11,980
No.

1461
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:12,980
Florence?

1462
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,980
No.

1463
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,980
Okay.

1464
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:15,980
Are those Ari's friends?

1465
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,980
Yeah, those were Ari's friends.

1466
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:18,980
Okay.

1467
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:19,980
Um, okay.

1468
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,980
I'll go.

1469
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:21,980
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

1470
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:22,980
It's in the city.

1471
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,940
It's at the city cemetery.

1472
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,500
She's going to be buried with her family.

1473
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,020
So yeah, we'll definitely be there.

1474
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,380
And she collects the things and leaves.

1475
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:36,420
I turned to John, do you, you remember array and a Florence?

1476
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,420
Yeah, man.

1477
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,420
Yeah.

1478
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,580
This is the first fucking time I've heard of Ari, but I feel like I've known her for

1479
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,580
years.

1480
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:44,580
Clark gets a chill.

1481
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,700
I just got a chill.

1482
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:56,700
Can you guys roll sanity, uh, fail, fail, say one on a 27.

1483
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,700
Holy shit.

1484
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,900
65 on an 18, 78 on a 27.

1485
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,900
Wow.

1486
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,740
You guys all lose one sanity.

1487
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:11,740
All these different iterations of your coworkers start flooding into your brain and you can't

1488
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,740
keep them separated.

1489
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:19,940
They're all starting to combine into this strange amalgamation of this person that now

1490
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:23,880
you can't remember any of what their faces look like.

1491
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:31,160
You vaguely remember some names, some stories, but you never necessarily got close to this

1492
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:35,560
person, but you remember their last name was Manstein.

1493
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,560
Yeah.

1494
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,560
Losers.

1495
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
All of them.

1496
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,560
I mean, they didn't really stick in your mind, but they were all Manstein.

1497
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,560
Yeah.

1498
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,560
Whoa.

1499
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:53,800
Is that what close as he stumbles back?

1500
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,440
Yeah.

1501
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:03,840
And then you guys decide to, we're going to have drew put up those flyers and go to the

1502
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,840
city.

1503
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,840
Was that the last thing we settled on?

1504
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,840
Yeah, I think so.

1505
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,560
I would like a moment alone with Rosemary.

1506
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,560
John and Rose.

1507
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,680
Do you want to describe it?

1508
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,600
Uh, well, first of all, um, does she still have the briefcase on her?

1509
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,600
Oh yeah.

1510
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,600
Okay.

1511
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,600
She's not letting go of that.

1512
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
Yeah.

1513
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,600
So, uh, I take her into the back.

1514
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,600
I'm like, Hey Rosemary.

1515
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,400
Can we talk for a second real quick?

1516
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Yeah.

1517
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,400
Okay.

1518
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,400
Uh, just let's go into this room here.

1519
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,360
So, uh, out at your shot of the boys.

1520
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,360
You're there.

1521
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,280
Um, and I slam her against the fucking wall and put a gun on her head.

1522
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,280
She starts laughing.

1523
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,280
Okay.

1524
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,800
Well I cocked the trigger and I said, let go of the fucking briefcase and give drew

1525
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:46,680
his money back right fucking now or what or I'll fucking kill you and talk to Marvin

1526
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,680
Glass myself.

1527
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,800
You think I care about some dumb ass like soldier.

1528
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,000
You're nothing to me.

1529
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,120
You want to get your job done and live to see the end of this day and give me that fucking

1530
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,120
money.

1531
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,120
Yeah.

1532
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,400
All right, John.

1533
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:10,680
And she drops the briefcase on to your hand and then she turns like she slowly turns.

1534
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,000
You've got it pressed against her temple.

1535
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:19,680
I'm guessing she slowly turns and puts it with the barrel right in between her eyes.

1536
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:30,720
It's hilarious that you think that you can kill me.

1537
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:36,360
And then she just walks away back into the room without the briefcase.

1538
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,520
Okay.

1539
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,000
John lets out a huge breath.

1540
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,440
So yeah, John picks up the briefcase and I guess dashes it somewhere secure in the station

1541
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,280
because I don't want the boys to see me with it.

1542
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,280
For sure.

1543
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,720
There's got to be a like a random evidence locker.

1544
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,120
Like I just put it in a locker.

1545
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,120
Okay.

1546
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,600
You go into the evidence locker and put it in.

1547
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,640
That's a good cover anyway.

1548
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:08,000
It's evidence.

1549
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,920
You hear a ding from the computer at the secretary's desk and there's a fresh email from both the

1550
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,920
dog.

1551
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,160
It says the PSA is about to play.

1552
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,720
So this is what plays on the radio.

1553
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:26,360
I'll do it in post but just so you guys fucking know.

1554
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,360
Okay.

1555
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,360
Not that.

1556
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,360
Wrong station.

1557
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,360
Yeah.

1558
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,360
I click over.

1559
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,360
And we're not using a spooky radio are we?

1560
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,360
No.

1561
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,360
We sure ain't.

1562
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,360
Oh shit.

1563
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,360
I'm sorry.

1564
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,360
I'm sorry.

1565
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,360
I'm sorry.

1566
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,360
I'm sorry.

1567
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,360
I'm sorry.

1568
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,360
I'm sorry.

1569
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,360
I'm sorry.

1570
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,360
I'm sorry.

1571
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,360
I'm sorry.

1572
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,040
You're all flying through a vortex and your faces are melting and contorting and going

1573
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:57,000
into one game over.

1574
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,480
Hey, my babies.

1575
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,280
It's both the dog hitting you with the weather on December 5th.

1576
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:11,640
Now y'all know what's been really nice outside, but prepare for a cold freeze tonight.

1577
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:15,000
Keep those sinks a dripping for your old buddy Wolf.

1578
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,900
And Wolf got some breaking news for y'all today.

1579
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,680
Straight from the mouth of the FBI.

1580
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:31,520
Tension, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land, once the town Perdition, just west of

1581
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,960
contention is heading this way.

1582
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,080
Please evacuate immediately.

1583
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,240
Don't forget your pets.

1584
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,700
The boys in blue are here for you.

1585
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,700
That's right.

1586
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:53,960
The contention PD is your BFD, which stands for best friends and dependable.

1587
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:59,040
Now Wolf the dog got some serious news on the wire from the city.

1588
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,880
Ferguson beans and Joan Robin, the mother of Ferguson's business partner were found

1589
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,660
dead in beans home early this morning.

1590
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,400
Nothing confirmed.

1591
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:14,040
But inside sources say Joan shot Ferguson multiple times with his own firearm before

1592
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,280
turning the gun on herself.

1593
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:29,920
Holy shit.

1594
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,280
Look at Keith.

1595
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,280
You told it.

1596
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,300
Didn't you tell us one time you're part of the bean family?

1597
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,300
Those bean boys.

1598
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,300
You haven't told us yet, right?

1599
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,300
That you're a bean?

1600
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,300
Yeah.

1601
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:43,340
And based on the way that we've been playing it, it's kind of this well known, it's an

1602
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:47,760
open secret and you guys don't bring it up because you have to work with him and he clearly

1603
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,620
fucking hates it.

1604
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,940
That's why he changed his name to avoid it.

1605
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:58,380
You've brought it up like once or twice and then he's ignored it and it's kind of gone

1606
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:06,140
over, especially when you're ordering beans from beans on beans, your family's business.

1607
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,980
And so it is an open secret.

1608
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:13,780
So you do know that he is related to the beans, but you've never really discussed it.

1609
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,780
Okay.

1610
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,780
So I just want to look at him.

1611
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,620
What do I see on his face?

1612
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:25,460
I hear that news and I just, I am just looking down at the ground like blank expression.

1613
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:29,660
Keith, we know you're a bean.

1614
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:30,660
Yeah.

1615
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,660
I knew you knew.

1616
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,620
Who were they to you?

1617
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,620
That was my brother.

1618
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,620
God damn.

1619
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,620
Keith.

1620
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:38,620
I'm so, I'm so sorry.

1621
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,620
Keith.

1622
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,820
I haven't seen him in a while.

1623
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:41,820
A long time.

1624
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:48,060
We never really got along that well, but would you say it's been a while?

1625
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:55,340
Oh no.

1626
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:58,780
I kicked John.

1627
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,740
I wouldn't have wished that upon him though.

1628
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,620
But yeah, that was my brother.

1629
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,620
Huh?

1630
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,820
Well, it's, we're heading to the city.

1631
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,780
We can take a look by the crime scene.

1632
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,780
I mean, maybe.

1633
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,780
Yeah.

1634
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:11,420
Ask the local PD what they know.

1635
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,420
Yeah.

1636
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,740
I'd like to find out what they know and we'll do that.

1637
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:16,740
Yeah.

1638
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:17,740
Okay.

1639
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:18,740
Let's do first things first though.

1640
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,460
Let's there's goo.

1641
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,460
There's goo to do.

1642
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,460
There's goo to do.

1643
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,700
If one beans died, I don't need to die from goo.

1644
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,820
We got to figure out that after, after all this.

1645
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:28,820
Yeah.

1646
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,700
And again, just real sorry your brother got murdered, suicided.

1647
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,700
Yeah.

1648
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,580
I wish I could have, I don't know.

1649
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:34,580
Been there.

1650
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,580
The boys in the air.

1651
01:10:35,580 --> 01:11:04,580
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you know I'm the only one trying to

1652
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:32,580
pull over How can you know I'm the only one trying to pull over
