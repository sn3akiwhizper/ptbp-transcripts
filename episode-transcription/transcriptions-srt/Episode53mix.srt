1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
What is crackin' my babies? Answer, my bones. Constantly.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:17,900
It's your bone daddy Wolf the dog, here to delight and fright as I hit you with the news both past and present from 694.2 PTBP.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,900
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at witch.hazels on Instagram,

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:32,000
who created a stellar piece of art depicting Sharon Shadow Berryman, Liz Lonklin, and Judy Krenkelhoff.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,800
Seriously, go check it out. They right.

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,500
Hi, Mr. The Dog. Hazel and Pals here.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,100
Sorry we had to send this message by Raven. They're basically rats where we're from.

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,100
So why not catch one and convince it to be an errand boy?

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,700
Just wanted to thank y'all for consistently putting out amazing content.

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,600
The show got me through a hard time this year.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's my group of cucks and I share endless laughs and spooks, and inspires us in our own tabletop misadventures.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,300
Mini-cacophonous Howls, Hazel, Alia, Britt, Flynn, Gabby, and Liam.

13
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:21,000
Haha, please. My father was Mr. The Dog. You can simply call me Wolf... The Dog.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,800
I have an unkindness of ravens constantly circling my general area.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,100
Maybe they can smell the death on me and mine.

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,400
But who knows?

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm glad we can put out something that can fright and excite you simultaneously, Hazel.

18
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,100
Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter,

19
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,400
tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,600
or write a five-star review on iTunes and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,300
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, that insatiable invertebrate.

22
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,100
And the dudes from PretendingToBePeople want me to remind you they are accepting questions for a third Q&A episode.

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:13,000
So, if you have questions for any of the trash bags that make that show, tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,200
There's also a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions.

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,000
Or email them to PretendingPod at Gmail.com.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Or go all out, record audio of you asking your question and send that so they can use it in the episode.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,200
Similar to the second Q&A episode, this one will be exclusive for our honorary police officers over on Patreon,

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,000
who keep this show alive five bucks a month at a time.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Those beautiful people who hold that dirty title currently have access to six exclusive bonus episodes,

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,700
and that number is growing each month.

31
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,000
Now, if you want a question answered, but you can't afford that Patreon lifestyle, fear not.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,300
The PTBP crew will answer some of the questions they don't get to in the Q&A session right there on the internet.

33
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,900
Maybe your question will be one of them.

34
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Or maybe you don't give two fucks about the cucks who run amok to chuck this deluxe guck.

35
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,000
In which case, you probably want me to shut the fuck up and deliver the news.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,300
Last time, Judy's body got taken over, Ash freaked out and ran away from the stakeout with the feds,

37
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:34,100
Ken realized he's in the crawl space under the cabin, Jeremy found a closet of sorts, and Liz Longlin lost a noggin.

38
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,900
Let's get right back into the business.

39
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,100
It's Blue False Indigo with Moondance.

40
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:51,100
She runs.

41
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,100
Ooh.

42
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,100
The sun.

43
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Is sleeping soon.

44
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,100
She knows.

45
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:20,100
That the time has come.

46
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:42,100
To dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the moon.

47
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:49,100
Ash Hornbeam. It's completely dark outside, and it's pouring down raining.

48
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:57,100
You are only seeing where your feet are taking you, splashing in all this mud by the moonlight,

49
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,100
and the pretty consistent lightning flashes illuminating everything around you.

50
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,100
You make your way onto the trail and continue running.

51
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:19,100
And in the distance, you see Judy Krinklehoff, sister, older sister of your friend Ken Krinklehoff, walking toward you.

52
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Judy!

53
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Uh, hi, hi, hi.

54
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,100
What are you doing here?

55
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,100
I was just walking, uh, in the woods, uh, for a walk.

56
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,100
I assume I'm running the opposite way that she's walking.

57
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Yeah.

58
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,100
I grab her by the arm, and, uh, I just hold onto her, and I bring her with me, and I'm like,

59
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
We have to get out of here!

60
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
I go with him.

61
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Okay. She goes with you.

62
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,100
I start running down the trail. Is this the trail that leads to the campsite?

63
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Yes.

64
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I head towards the campsite.

65
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
You arrive at the campsite.

66
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,100
What do I see?

67
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Fire was never made, so it's kind of hard to tell where it is, but you see, getting soaked by the rain are your bags and everyone's gear that was brought into the woods with you.

68
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Do I see the naked man?

69
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,100
No, you do not. The rope that was tied around the tree is no longer there.

70
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:27,100
As soon as we get to the campsite, I just fall on my knees, and I'm on all fours, gasping for air.

71
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
I look at Judy.

72
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Kin fell. Kin fell. Kin fell in a hole? Kin fell in a hole.

73
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Uh, yeah, I can.

74
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,100
That sucks that Kin fell in the hole. That sucks that he fell in the hole.

75
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,100
But it wasn't...

76
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,100
It wasn't a real hole. He just fell through...

77
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,100
He fell through the...

78
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
He fell through the earth.

79
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
I saw it happen. He just disappeared.

80
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:04,100
I think that you don't know what you're talking about, and maybe we should find some big rocks to make a shelter to get rid of the rain?

81
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Ash just looks down at his hands covered in dirt and mud and muck and...

82
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,100
You see there's hand sanitizer sitting on the... I don't know if you wanted to use it.

83
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
No.

84
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Clean off your hands.

85
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Ash is freaking out, and he doesn't know what to do.

86
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Judy pats him on the back, and then just walks away and starts looking for rocks.

87
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Okay.

88
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:33,100
When Judy pats Ash on the back, he throws up like a burped child.

89
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:50,100
As you finish throwing up like the fucking child that you are, you're bent over, just like hands on your knees.

90
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Hands on the ground.

91
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Hands on the ground, knees on the ground, just vomiting, and Judy finds a couple of big rocks.

92
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:06,100
I find some big rocks. I set them down next to you, and I am looking at them, picking them up, then I'm looking over at Ash.

93
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Then I go back to look for some more rocks, and I'm like,

94
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,100
Ash, maybe you should just sit still for a little while and just try to breathe.

95
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,100
I'm really nervous about you. You seem to be acting really weird.

96
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,100
He sits down cross-legged.

97
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:29,100
He starts to think about just what he's seen in the past minute and a half, two minutes.

98
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:41,100
He is torn between going back to where he fled from to go find his friend, but also this is his crush.

99
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:57,100
So you don't want to leave. I don't want to leave.

100
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,100
Does Judy know you have a crush on her?

101
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
No.

102
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:12,100
So he sits cross-legged, and Ash sits there looking just at his hands, and he's freaking out, and he wants to go back to the cabin, but he waits for Judy.

103
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Okay, so Judy is frantically looking for a rock, and then I walk up behind Ash, and I hit him on the head with a huge rock.

104
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Luke staring at me.

105
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
You're trying to hurt me?

106
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Yeah, absolutely.

107
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:33,100
This is like a gimme because he is not paying attention at all, so just roll damage for me.

108
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,100
So you're going to roll 1d6 for damage.

109
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Okay. I got a six.

110
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,100
How many hit points do you have, Ash Hornbeam?

111
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Two. I started with seven, so that would have basically killed me anyway.

112
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Ash Hornbeam, what are you thinking about as the lights go out?

113
00:09:51,100 --> 00:10:08,100
I'm hit in the head with a rock. I'm kind of spun around to where I fall on my back facing Judy, and the last thought before my lights go out is, every girl I've ever liked has hurt me.

114
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Oh no!

115
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Joe?

116
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Hey.

117
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
It's dark, man.

118
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,100
I mean, I guess the flashlight's on now. It's not as dark.

119
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,100
My one clinging to hope. A little light.

120
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,100
And you see the door on the other side. You see these tubes.

121
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
I think I put my ear to the door is where we left off.

122
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Joe?

123
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Ken Krenkelhoff has his ear to the door leading up to the inside of this cabin, you would assume.

124
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,100
And you hear, muffled in the distance,

125
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Let's run!

126
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Get the fuck out of here!

127
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Like, through the door, or like from back where I came? From back up the slide?

128
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,100
Just from somewhere in the distance, you can't quite tell.

129
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Shit. Can I tell the voice that was yelling?

130
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
It was Jeremy Pettymore.

131
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,100
I figured. I'm going to try to open the door.

132
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,100
You open the door, and you poke your head up.

133
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Very, very cautiously, this whole action is, I'm moving so slowly and so scared that it's imperceptible.

134
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Roll stealth for me.

135
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Okay. Yeah, I'm actually decent.

136
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:58,100
But I do not pass. A 67 on a 50.

137
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,100
This door just makes a dumb amount of noise.

138
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Damn it.

139
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:09,100
And it doesn't seem to matter as you get your head up into the room, as the room is empty.

140
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,100
This is not the inside of a cabin.

141
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
This is a lab.

142
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Okay.

143
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:32,100
All around the room, there are these same tubes that are translucent, and filling them all is this black liquid substance that is oozing through the tubes and going down into the floorboards.

144
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:45,100
And you would see they're coming from these like stations that are long, about like three feet long and two feet wide.

145
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,100
And there are these like coffin-shaped boxes.

146
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
Okay. Is the room lit in any way?

147
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,100
It is. It is completely lit by lights.

148
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Just as a normal cabin would be, it's got electric to it and a lot of like white light, like laboratory lighting, right?

149
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Fluorescent?

150
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Yeah. And I think as you get up into the cabin and start looking around, you would also see there is a wooden trunk.

151
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,100
A large wooden trunk up against the wall.

152
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,100
And there is a desk with papers littered all over it.

153
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Other than the desk with papers, is there anything written anywhere? Can I glean any...

154
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Is there maybe a brand on the machines or is there signage on the walls like, wear your lab coat or anything like that?

155
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:41,100
No signage whatsoever. The only things that are written are really on this desk and then on this bulletin board above the desk.

156
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:49,100
I'm going to investigate the desk and the bulletin board and just, if I feel, if I feel sufficiently alone, I'm going to take my time.

157
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Uh, okay. I think you likely...

158
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,100
I haven't heard anything since I've been up here that would make me think there's somebody else in this room or...

159
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Go ahead and roll an alertness for me.

160
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,100
I pass a 21 on a 50.

161
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
You hear a...

162
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Out the window and looking out the front window of this cabin, you see Liz Lonklin and Jeremy Pettymore on the other side of a moat that is outside this cabin.

163
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,100
Seemingly surrounding it about five feet wide.

164
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:29,100
And on the other side, Jeremy Pettymore and Liz Lonklin are running and you look over at the exact moment.

165
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Liz Lonklin stops dead in her tracks.

166
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:42,100
A massive metal claw from a branch on a tree right above her swings down, decapitating her.

167
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Oh no!

168
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:52,100
And blood just spurts and squirts. Like when you're peeing after you had sex and it just goes everywhere.

169
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Uh huh.

170
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,100
That's the blood coming out of Liz Lonklin's body.

171
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,100
You know how to paint such a picture for me, Zach. Thank you. Thank you so much.

172
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
I do it specifically for each person.

173
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Oh fuck.

174
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Real sanity.

175
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Yeah. No problem.

176
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Oh my god, I pass a six on a 29.

177
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,100
Okay. I think you're just going to go with your usual idea, which is...

178
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
That didn't happen.

179
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
That's not real.

180
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,100
There's no way that happened.

181
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,100
This is some kind of television screen monitor here at this window.

182
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Exactly. To show you a scary thing.

183
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
It's trying to scare me.

184
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,100
After that happens, what's Jeremy doing? Where's the last place I've seen you?

185
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
He's gone. He dipped. He just kept running.

186
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Oh god.

187
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
He just kept running.

188
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Oh my god.

189
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Well, I don't want to go outside where the claw that decapitates people is.

190
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,100
So I'm going to turn around and look at this desk.

191
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,100
So of course, naturally after seeing that, you want to read some papers.

192
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I want to do some accounting to make sure other decimal points are in the right places.

193
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:06,100
You see the articles of organization for a new business called Cole's Orphanage.

194
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,100
New school under modern etiquette.

195
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Okay.

196
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:19,100
And all of the other papers are plans for a gun that is being created.

197
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
Oh my god.

198
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,100
And looking at the plans, it seems to have been recently completed.

199
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:33,100
There are also plans for small metal spheres, one inch in diameter.

200
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:42,100
And looking at the plans, it seems that they are being put into small human bodies.

201
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Yeah, I was going to say that when I see the Cole's Orphanage thing,

202
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I take a weary glance at the three feet long coffins.

203
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Uh-huh.

204
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Oh no. Oh no.

205
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Can I go through the drawers of the desk?

206
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Sure.

207
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
I just want to see if I can find anything.

208
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,100
I've got my spear still, but I think I'm kind of panicky just looking for anything I can.

209
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Okay, roll search for me.

210
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:15,100
And that'll give you a good old, a very interesting piece of information.

211
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,100
Fuck.

212
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Don't pass. A 97 on a 50.

213
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,100
You're in no state to be reading in detail anything, really.

214
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,100
You're just looking over these plans in a very broad, vague sense.

215
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Okay, going back to survey mode, is this room four walls or is there other places I can go in here?

216
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
Just four walls.

217
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Is there only the front door out of this place?

218
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Yes.

219
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
And it's kind of by the window that I just saw terrible things happen?

220
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Yes.

221
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Fuck.

222
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:50,100
When you walk over and look at that window, you see that there's also another building within the premises of this moat.

223
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Okay.

224
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Being surrounded by the moat.

225
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:59,100
And it is smaller than this cabin and the door is open and there's a light coming out of it.

226
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Can I see any shadows in the light?

227
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,100
You see no shadows in the light.

228
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Yeah, I want to, I don't know, I kind of want to look at a coffin.

229
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Can I see, does it open in any way?

230
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
Oh yeah.

231
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I want to open it.

232
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Wait, if I can see into the coffin at all and there's black goo in the coffin itself, I don't want to open it.

233
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,100
But if it's opaque, I guess I'm going to open it.

234
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
It is opaque.

235
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
I'm opening it.

236
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Go, oh fuck.

237
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Roll dexterity.

238
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,100
Roll dexterity to see how quickly this happens.

239
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
I pass a 35 on a 75.

240
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:47,100
You open up this coffin and this black viscous, sludgy, oily goo starts pouring up out of it,

241
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,100
all over the table that it's on, and then onto the floor.

242
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:57,100
And you get out of the way just in time to not touch any of this, but it is starting to spread throughout.

243
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:06,100
And as it dissipates out of this coffin, you see that inside the coffin, there is a two-year-old body.

244
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Oh no.

245
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:17,100
That is not quite human-looking, as if it is being 3D printed and it is not finished.

246
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Oh my god.

247
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Wow.

248
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,100
So it's like all the edges aren't sharp yet, everything's smooth.

249
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,100
So picture a face with a plastic bag over it, that's what this face looks like.

250
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I can totally picture it, holy shit.

251
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:39,100
In my haste backwards, do I have time to maybe close the lid so it's not pouring out more?

252
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
Probably not.

253
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Probably not.

254
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Okay.

255
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Then I am going to run out the front door.

256
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,100
And when I say run out the front door, I am panicking running to the front door,

257
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,100
but when I get to the door, I want to try and gingerly open and close it behind me.

258
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Okay.

259
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Jeremy Pettymore, you're running through the woods.

260
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Rain is pouring down on you and you're splashing in puddles and mud is splashing up onto your pant legs.

261
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,100
And the dark night sky is being lit by the moon.

262
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,100
And all these lightning flashes that keep illuminating everything around you.

263
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:36,100
You've seen so much shit tonight that every single time lightning flashes, you think you see something off in the woods.

264
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,100
And then eventually you do see a figure walking toward you.

265
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,100
And it is Judy Krinklehoff, the older sister of Ken Krinklehoff.

266
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Judy, where the fuck did you come from?

267
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,100
I was just walking in the woods and I saw you and you're running and your clothes are all cattywampus and I don't know what to do.

268
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Cattywampus?

269
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Nevermind.

270
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Nevermind.

271
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Anyway, wait, were you with the girls?

272
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
No, they ran away and they left me.

273
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,100
I was in the shackled by myself and then I had to run and find help.

274
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
What shack?

275
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
The shack up at the front by the parking lot.

276
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
The parking lot?

277
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
We should go back there.

278
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Okay, I'm just really scared so can you just stay really close to me please?

279
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
I guess.

280
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,100
You're like three years older than me and at this point in our life cycles that's like,

281
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:28,100
really, honestly, I feel like you're an adult figure and I'm like, okay, but damn.

282
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,100
I know, but like size-wise and body-wise and like how are puberty cycles have been working?

283
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:40,100
Like you are significantly larger than me so if somebody tries to come and get us you could probably kill them first so can you please just go in front?

284
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Jeremy has like never heard more overshuring but he's like, okay, and he runs in front of her.

285
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
And he doesn't look back.

286
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Okay, so you're running, I guess, in front of me?

287
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Yeah.

288
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:09,100
So I run up behind him and I pull the machete out from behind my shorts and I stab him in the back multiple times.

289
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Well, I'd like to avoid that if I could.

290
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:25,100
Jeremy Pettymore, I'm going to need you to roll an alertness at a negative 40 because of the situation you're in to even roll dodge against her.

291
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Right, I've got to get below a 10.

292
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,100
24.

293
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,100
You do not notice and therefore there will be no opposed check here.

294
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
So are you stabbing?

295
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
You're stabbing multiple times?

296
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100
Yeah, I'm stabbing.

297
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Okay, so we're going to roll melee.

298
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
What is your melee?

299
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
You're going to have a bonus.

300
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
I have a 40.

301
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Plus 20.

302
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Okay.

303
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,100
I got a 66.

304
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
That is a critical failure.

305
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
Oh, fuck.

306
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
I kind of wanted it for her.

307
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
What the hell?

308
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:18,100
He screams as Judy Krinklehoff goes to stab him in the back, missing desperately and falling forward, tripping on the mud and the rock underneath her and landing directly on the machete face first.

309
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:42,100
As the machete slides its back between a crevice of two rocks on the trail and her face falls directly into it, splitting her skull wide open enough for Jeremy Pettymore to see a small one inch in diameter silver sphere in the middle of her head and black ooze begins gushing and running out from underneath it.

310
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Roll Sanity, Thomas.

311
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Jeremy Pettymore has no idea what that is, but Thomas Cox is gaining a new understanding of the central mystery.

312
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
Fucking 19.

313
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Jeremy Pettymore is fine.

314
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Always has been, always will be.

315
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Jeremy Pettymore, what are you going to do?

316
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Run.

317
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
Let me do that when I'm not yawning.

318
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Is this game boring?

319
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Run.

320
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Run.

321
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,100
Go fuck yourself.

322
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
It's late.

323
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Late.

324
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
How did you know my theme song?

325
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
I never sang it for you.

326
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
That's awesome.

327
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,100
I read your dream journal.

328
00:24:53,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Ken Krenkelhoff walks out of the cabin, out of the front door, onto the front porch.

329
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,100
You see three figures approaching.

330
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
It's raining.

331
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
It's dark.

332
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:14,100
The moonlight is revealing part of them, but then a lightning strike reveals three individuals.

333
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,100
They're all wearing black suits with white shirts.

334
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Two of them have black ties and one is wearing a bolo tie.

335
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Ooh, the cool one.

336
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Obviously.

337
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,100
The tall one has got buzzed blonde hair.

338
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,100
The man with the bolo, shorter, pants pretty tight.

339
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
He's got a thick mustache.

340
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:42,100
And then the third is a woman and she is smiling.

341
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,100
A cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs.

342
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Oh, you fucker.

343
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
Covering one of her eyes.

344
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Oh my god.

345
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,100
And they see you and she begins chanting.

346
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100
Where are they in relation to me?

347
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Are they inside the moat perimeter?

348
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,100
They are just on the other side of the moat, walking toward you pretty slowly.

349
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
I want to run.

350
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
I want to get away from that.

351
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
That's creepy chanting, lady.

352
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Roll power.

353
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Oh, it's my second worst stat.

354
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
She rolled a 20.

355
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
I fail.

356
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
61 on a 35.

357
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,100
As you turn back to go into the cabin, when you reach out to open the door,

358
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:36,100
your hand phases into the door and you feel a slight push behind you.

359
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:43,100
And your body moves toward and into the door of the cabin.

360
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Wood fills your body as the thoughts in your mind go out of existence

361
00:26:51,100 --> 00:27:03,100
into the door of the cabin, killing Ken Krenkelhoff in an extremely similar way to Clark Bishop's parents.

362
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
Yep. Holy fuck.

363
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:17,100
Your mind still works for just long enough for you to watch as these three people ransack this cabin.

364
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,100
As soon as they come in, one of them starts yelling about the ooze that is all over the floor.

365
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Another one grabs a bucket and runs out to the moat, comes back in with a bucket full of water,

366
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,100
and splashes it on the ooze, pushing it backward.

367
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,100
Two of them grab the trunk and they leave.

368
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
One of them comes back in.

369
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:51,100
It's the woman, and she starts chanting again, and the entire place begins to light up in flames.

370
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:58,100
Ken Krenkelhoff dies burning as part of the cabin in these contention woods.

371
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Jesus God. Oh, that's awful.

372
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,100
He was conscious for some of that.

373
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
Oh, no.

374
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
Thomas Jeremy Pettymore is fucking running.

375
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,100
Yeah, he is.

376
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Are you going to stop by your campsite before you bail to grab your bag of things?

377
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,100
No, I assume he has the pistol on him, and otherwise he is just fucking booking it.

378
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:47,100
He's seen Ken disappear, Ash is apparently stuck in a tree somewhere that no one could find,

379
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,100
so he is just fucking booking it back to the ranger station.

380
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,100
Okay, when you make it back to the ranger station, you see there's one light that is shining down,

381
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,100
like a streetlight on the parking lot. It's flickering.

382
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Rain is torrential downpour at this point. You are completely soaked.

383
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:12,100
You've got some blood on your shoes from where Judy Krenkelhoff fell on that machete,

384
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:20,100
and it splattered out onto you, and it's probably washed off with the mud and the wet at this point,

385
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:28,100
but you see from the moonlight shining down a reflection on all this water that's pouring from the sky,

386
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,100
and the lightning strikes are illuminating everything around you.

387
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:41,100
You're all alone in the parking lot, and you see there's the car, the notice on the driver's side window.

388
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
He's running for the Bronco with the Bronco keys.

389
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,100
I forgot you had those. You run to the Bronco, you slam the keys into the ignition,

390
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
and when you go to turn it over...

391
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,100
Give me a roll. You're going to say it doesn't start, right?

392
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Yeah.

393
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
Give me a roll.

394
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
I'll give you a roll.

395
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
Okay. I don't know what that should be, but...

396
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
Oh, driving.

397
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,100
Okay, I didn't put anything to drive because I'm a 14-year-old.

398
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Yeah.

399
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,100
But naturally, on your page, you have a 20% drive.

400
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
And you rolled?

401
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
A 27.

402
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
Oh. Forks.

403
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,100
Yeah.

404
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Fucks.

405
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,100
Spoons.

406
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Fucks.

407
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
So he doesn't know how to start a car.

408
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
When you go to...

409
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
It's just dead.

410
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
There's a point to where something is wrong.

411
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Either the battery's dead, like literally no lights are coming on when you turn the car over.

412
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,100
I get out of it and I start running down the road towards town.

413
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:42,100
As you're running down the road toward town, trees are on either side of you lining this country road.

414
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
I'm going to get ashed.

415
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:48,100
They're going over the top of you creating a sort of canopy.

416
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,100
And the camera is down low, like on the ground.

417
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,100
As you're running off into the distance.

418
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:05,100
And then we see a black sedan driving incredibly furiously come over the top of the camera.

419
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,100
And behind it, a four-wheeler.

420
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:16,100
And as they approach, the four-wheeler overtakes the black sedan and rolls up next to you as you're running.

421
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:21,100
And you look over, and riding this four-wheeler is a man.

422
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Pretty fit.

423
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Early 40s.

424
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,100
He's wearing a black suit with a white shirt and a bolo tie.

425
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,100
And he has a fucking badass mustache.

426
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,100
And you recognize it as John Lee Pettymore the Third.

427
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Your second cousin.

428
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
I wave.

429
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
I want to hop on the four-wheeler.

430
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
John!

431
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
John!

432
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,100
Uncle John!

433
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Uncle John!

434
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
He stops the four-wheeler.

435
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
And he sees you.

436
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,100
And his heart sinks.

437
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
And you can see it in his eyes.

438
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Uncle John!

439
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
Thank God you're here.

440
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
What's wrong, Uncle John?

441
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
And he lifts up a pistol.

442
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
Okay.

443
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Puts it to your head.

444
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:08,100
Jeremy Pettymore, 14 years old, closes his eyes tight and is shaking.

445
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,100
You feel the gun trembling on the other side as well.

446
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
And then there's nothing.

447
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
She knows.

448
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
She knows.

449
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
She knows.

450
00:32:46,100 --> 00:33:02,100
She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the moon.

451
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:32,100
She moves with the howling wind.

452
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:44,100
The sun, the sun, the sun has come again, come again.

453
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:55,100
Her eyes, her eyes have seen it all.

454
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:07,100
The wonders of, the wonders of the shadow of the moon.

455
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Alright, thanks everybody for listening to the Woods of Contention mini-arc of Pretending

456
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
to Be People.

457
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
Zach, what's wrong with your voice?

458
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Way to crush that mood that they just came out of.

459
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,100
They're back in the scrap pit.

460
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Justin's not here, but we figured we'd pop on in at the end of this episode.

461
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:59,100
And we recently just said that we would take Q&As for a new Patreon episode that's coming out next month.

462
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:07,100
And we figured we'd pop in here and answer a couple of the quickly asked answers on the subreddit.

463
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,100
And we're going to take down a couple of them right now.

464
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:17,100
So, Sky Spore, or Sky's por, or Sky's po ar asks,

465
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,100
What do you all do when you're told to leave the room?

466
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:27,100
We kick and scream and say, no Zach, no, no, no, I'm not gonna, I don't wanna.

467
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
I go and hide in the corner.

468
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
I don't know what happens.

469
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
They don't notice me every time.

470
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
I don't know what happens.

471
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,100
I have to grab Thomas by the ankles, but I just have to find Joe.

472
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,100
As soon as he's found, he like hangs his head.

473
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,100
And it's actually just Joe with his hands over his eyes.

474
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,100
Sitting in his chair still.

475
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
He thinks that's how it works.

476
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:52,100
And in all the commotion, Luke just sits in his chair and nobody really notices.

477
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,100
I usually go sit in the kitchen and smell whatever Taylor's cooking.

478
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Yeah.

479
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Tonight's her meal prep night.

480
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
It's Zach's wife's meal prep night.

481
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,100
So she's always making like dope smells in the kitchen.

482
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,100
It currently smells delicious right now.

483
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
Every time we open the door, it walks in.

484
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,100
Some awesome fucking barbecue chicken.

485
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,100
She had like barbecue chicken, beets and sweet potato.

486
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,100
As opposed to the smells she normally makes.

487
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,100
Ew!

488
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,100
Yeah, her disgusting farts.

489
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:28,100
She's prepping those right now.

490
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,100
That's the bitch I own for.

491
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,100
It's pretty annoying because when the weather is nice, I think you guys can go outside,

492
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
but it's fucking terrible out now.

493
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Yeah, it snowed and iced yesterday.

494
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Yeah, so the answer is we hang out with Taylor.

495
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,100
Just kind of shit amongst ourselves.

496
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,100
If there's multiple people back there, we will talk.

497
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Beyond being podcast superstars, we're all good friends.

498
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,100
So we shoot the shit and hang out because we see each other once a week this way.

499
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,100
We don't have to fucking keep up the act on these Q&As.

500
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
You signed the contract.

501
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
I don't care.

502
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,100
I don't fucking care.

503
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,100
There's an ADA that says that you have to like us.

504
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Right.

505
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Also, we pet the cats, Ramona and Ropo.

506
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Oh yeah.

507
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Two cats.

508
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,100
Nice sweet kitties.

509
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,100
Tell them about your not so fat cat now.

510
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Well, yeah.

511
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
How big was she?

512
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Ropo was 35 pounds when we got her.

513
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,100
So fucking insane.

514
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
And she's short too.

515
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
She's really short.

516
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,100
She's not a long cat.

517
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,100
There are so many breeds of dog where that would be like a problematic weight.

518
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,100
Oh, it was extremely problematic.

519
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
And she was so cute.

520
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,100
We had to get her, but I didn't want a diabetic cat.

521
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,100
So we've been working out with her every day.

522
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
She's really toning up her core.

523
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:51,100
We just moved an elliptical machine into a room that Ropo is going to be good at.

524
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Honestly, mostly Ramona just chases her around and doesn't let her eat.

525
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
So that's the diet that she's on.

526
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
It's really worked.

527
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
Yeah.

528
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
What is she now?

529
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
She is down to 16 pounds.

530
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Oh, shit.

531
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Really?

532
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,100
Wow.

533
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Yeah.

534
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,100
It's super impressive.

535
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:12,100
However, now she has this flap of skin that just drags the ground everywhere she goes.

536
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
And she was never pregnant, I don't think.

537
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
But fun story about Ropo.

538
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,100
Her name was Roly Poly when we got her, and they shortened it to Ropo.

539
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:24,100
But she was owned by a woman who took in lots of shelter animals.

540
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
And when the woman died-

541
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,100
And fattened them up to eat them?

542
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Fucking clearly.

543
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,100
But before she could eat Ropo, she passed away.

544
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:42,100
And when they went into the house, they found I think she had eight cats and 13 dogs or something.

545
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,100
And Ropo was hiding in the cabinet under the sink.

546
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
Aw.

547
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Full of old lady face.

548
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
100%.

549
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:57,100
They had to use special tools to cut the cabinet off to get Ropo out of it.

550
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Your cat is so fat.

551
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
How fat is she?

552
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,100
The jaws of life.

553
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:15,100
I did like the first night that we had Ropo, I woke up to her just like chewing on my cheek.

554
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,100
And like, I'm not dead yet.

555
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:24,100
We got another question from Room Service Nachos.

556
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,100
It says, why is Luke so handsome?

557
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:33,100
As a child, I had to have facial reconstructive surgery because I was too ugly for my parents to love me.

558
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,100
But now, look at me.

559
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Asked by Luke and answered by Luke.

560
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
There you go.

561
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
Don't dox my Reddit account.

562
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,100
You doxed your own Reddit account.

563
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,100
We've got another question here from, I believe it's Malidori.

564
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
M-A-L-I-D-O-R-I.

565
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,100
It says, howdy everyone. Fellow Missourian here.

566
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,100
What up, what up.

567
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:00,100
I hope you're all staying nice and warm with the winter incoming fast.

568
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,100
It is coming all over us.

569
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:07,100
Speaking of staying warm, one, what is your all beverages of choice?

570
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,100
They've been into Kraken Spiced Rum recently.

571
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,100
Fall beverage of choice?

572
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,100
I think it's not specifically fall, but...

573
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,100
Y'all's beverage of choice.

574
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
Y'all's fall beverage of choice?

575
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Me and Thomas went through the Kraken phase. We used to bring that to parties all the time.

576
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
I used to buy the little...

577
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Yeah, before we were 21.

578
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,100
I'm picturing the tiny little shooters with the Kraken on it.

579
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,100
We would get the big bottle.

580
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Also, that is exactly the viscosity level that I'm thinking when I talk about the ooze in this campaign.

581
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,100
Oh, really?

582
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:50,100
Kraken is brutal, and it'll take your life from you.

583
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,100
I like hot tea.

584
00:40:54,100 --> 00:41:01,100
I've been buying a shitload of that memory lane chocolate milk.

585
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,100
That shit is fucking awesome.

586
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:10,100
You buy the gallon of it, and it lasts me three days.

587
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Oh, Jesus.

588
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,100
Yeah, I drink way too much milk.

589
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:21,100
We actually tried to record last week, but Luke came in, and his mouth was so filmy with chocolate milk that he couldn't talk.

590
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,100
I threw up on the table, and we spent the time cleaning it off instead of recording.

591
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,100
Whoever sits in that spot just pukes every single time.

592
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
Oh, yeah, this was Taylor's fault.

593
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:36,100
Dude, that's the fucking craziest thing I've ever seen in real life.

594
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
Yeah, in real life.

595
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:42,100
This is your wife puking for ten minutes after trying to make herself burp.

596
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:48,100
She thought it was super funny at the time, and then it wasn't really funny immediately.

597
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,100
What about you guys?

598
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,100
Well, you know, Kristen Schall's horse? It got funny again.

599
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:59,100
I've been trying to force myself to like those seltzer waters, the La Croix type thing.

600
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,100
Dude, the bubblies are way better.

601
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Because I hate them, but I've got to stop drinking soda.

602
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,100
Yeah, bubbly's good and spindrift is good. I've been having good luck with those.

603
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,100
What's the one that you said you bought it all or something?

604
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,100
Spindrift.

605
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:18,100
Spindrift, yeah. I've cleaned out the grocery store that is near me because nobody else is buying the spindrift there.

606
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,100
I just noticed actually the other day they were restocked. So yeah.

607
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,100
Lucky.

608
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,100
I'm bumping up dim numbers.

609
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:33,100
So I actually am fully moved away from even the flavored seltzer waters to the best choice unflavored original seltzer water.

610
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Wow.

611
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,100
I just can't do that.

612
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,100
That sucks.

613
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
You can see these two cans right next to me.

614
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,100
You could put lime juice in them to make them taste good.

615
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,100
I put lime juice and bitters in there.

616
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
Yeah, there you go. What sort of bitters? Angostura?

617
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,100
Angostura. I'm not a monster.

618
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,100
Peychaud's.

619
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,100
Oh, Peychaud's is dope though.

620
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,100
So is that so you don't drink soda and beer?

621
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,100
Yes.

622
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,100
Okay.

623
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Yeah.

624
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Because a thing I really like is just water.

625
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Yeah.

626
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:03,100
At the point, a thing I don't like is unflavored sparkling water.

627
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,100
Oh, I'm such a fan. I also love water. I chug so much water.

628
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:11,100
I drink a lot of water too. I'm trying to replace just the soda that I would also drink.

629
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:18,100
One of my roommates has an affinity for buying tons of bottled water at a time.

630
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,100
Oh, that sucks.

631
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:24,100
It does suck, but it also doesn't suck because I drink way more water now and pollute the ocean.

632
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,100
There it is.

633
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,100
There's the terrible part.

634
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,100
I was going to say that I refill my water bottles, but my sister gets mad at me every time.

635
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:36,100
Apparently that's bad for you. I guess it's still carcinogenic or something like that to reuse the water bottles.

636
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,100
If you just have it sit in there for like a minute or two.

637
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,100
There's also this cream soda that I have been super into recently.

638
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,100
Lost Trail?

639
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:52,100
No, it's that shit that I brought over to your house. I don't know. It's fucking good. I'll look it up.

640
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,100
So those are the beverages that we like for our choices.

641
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,100
Was he talking alcohol though? Or were they talking alcohol though?

642
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,100
My go-to if I'm at a bar is High Life and a shot of Fernette.

643
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Yeah, Fernette Baraka.

644
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
For the win.

645
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:10,100
I'm a beer guy in general, but I also always have a bottle of whiskey at the house.

646
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:17,100
I'm fully obsessed with Angostura Amaro. That's my current go-to, especially for fall drinking.

647
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,100
Oh man, that with a shot of espresso next to each other? Baby, baby.

648
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,100
Nice.

649
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,100
Baby, baby.

650
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,100
My heart will always belong to Bell's Two-Hearted Ale.

651
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,100
I think that's up there with me too.

652
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:35,100
I think the people who follow us on our social media accounts saw your love of Bell's Two-Hearted Ale in a picture recently.

653
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:41,100
I mean, we tag Bell's in a lot of pictures where we're drinking Two-Hearted, but the recent picture from Halloween.

654
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,100
Yeah.

655
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,100
Pretty great picture.

656
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,100
Nice.

657
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,100
If any of you have played Disco Elysium, I was a disco cop.

658
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,100
And it was a killer costume.

659
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:59,100
Yeah, you only see my bottom layer and the wife beater shirt that I ripped in half.

660
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,100
Don't worry, he was proving a point.

661
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,100
You did the facial hair though. That's what brought it all together.

662
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,100
You look great.

663
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,100
It's called Natural Brew Cream Soda for anybody out there liking cream soda.

664
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,100
Natural Brew.

665
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,100
Natural Brew, dog.

666
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:25,100
All right, so this type of sweet behind the scenes action is what you can expect on our upcoming Q&A episode that'll be for patrons only at our $5 and up level.

667
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:33,100
There are honorary police officers of the Pretending to Be People Patreon, and we are so fucking grateful for them.

668
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Thank you.

669
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,100
Jesus.

670
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,100
Big time.

671
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,100
Thank you, babies.

672
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,100
Seriously.

673
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:43,100
Don't forget about that and up, by the way.

674
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,100
And yeah, I'll say it here, we'll have some new tiers popping up soon.

675
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:53,100
Can we maybe debut the highest level tier that we discussed the other day?

676
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,100
The very highest level?

677
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,100
Yeah, the very highest level.

678
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:05,100
If you want to support our podcast for $10,000 and buy Zach and I hair plugs, that would be immensely appreciated.

679
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,100
It would be super helpful for-

680
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,100
Really, really cool.

681
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,100
What is that tier called?

682
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,100
Buy Zach and Thomas hair plugs, please.

683
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,100
Please.

684
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:20,100
Hey, and we want to add a really big thank you to our guests from Basement Cats.

685
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,100
Basement Cats.

686
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,100
Straight up.

687
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
Ali and Lindsay.

688
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,100
And then Taylor also was there.

689
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,100
Your beautiful wife.

690
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,100
And all three of them really knocked it out of the park.

691
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,100
I was so stoked to have them be a part of this little adventure that we made together.

692
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,100
This is one of those things that Zach let us listen to, so I was able to join in-

693
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,100
Yeah.

694
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,100
It's the first time we've gotten to go back in here, kind of hear everything that went on behind our backs.

695
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,100
So that was a lot of fun to listen to.

696
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,100
Super fun.

697
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,100
And spooky.

698
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,100
Yeah.

699
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,100
It also just makes it way much more fun that it is closed because you get to record and

700
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,100
then every week you get to find out a little more of what was going on.

701
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,100
Yeah, right.

702
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
Exactly.

703
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,100
I was really nervous actually about running six PCs in one area, but I think everyone

704
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,100
had a pretty good time and it turned out sick.

705
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,100
I'm really happy with the end result.

706
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,100
I love listening to it.

707
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,100
And playing it.

708
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100
And we got some cool artwork out of it too.

709
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,100
Oh my gosh.

710
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,100
Really cool artwork.

711
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
Go check out Witch Hazel.

712
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,100
I believe so.

713
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
Witch.hazel on Instagram.

714
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,100
You might check that she's okay with us saying it on air, but yeah.

715
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,100
Yeah.

716
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,100
It's witch.hazels.

717
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,100
I think it's plural.

718
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,100
Yeah.

719
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,100
It's dope though.

720
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,100
Super cool art of the girls' characters from this past story.

721
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,100
It's really, really well done.

722
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,100
And I checked out all her Instagram stuff.

723
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,100
It was all really cool.

724
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,100
Yeah.

725
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,100
Follow her.

726
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,100
Follow Basement Cats on Instagram.

727
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,100
Check out their live shows.

728
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,100
Is it the first?

729
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:45,100
This next one is December 7th at Best of Luck Beer Hall in Springfield, Missouri.

730
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,100
Drive to Springfield.

731
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,100
Fly to Springfield.

732
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,100
We got an airport.

733
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,100
So.

734
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,100
Come drink with us.

735
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,100
We'll be at that show.

736
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,100
It'll be very fun.

737
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
Thanks for listening.

738
00:47:53,100 --> 00:48:01,100
And we'll have more content for you that is part of the contention narrative coming very,

739
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,100
very soon.

740
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,100
Bye guys.

741
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,100
Bye.

742
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,100
Like and subscribe.

743
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,100
Yes.

744
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,100
Bye.

745
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:36,100
