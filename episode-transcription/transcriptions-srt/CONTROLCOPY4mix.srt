1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
It's your Dimension Super Heavyweight Champion, Wolf the Dog.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:12,680
And I'm here to do some big punches live from 694.2 PTBP.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:19,800
Prepare your skulls to be pummeled by my beautiful voice and maybe my nasty fists.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,440
If you start acting up, that is.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,640
Now, I ain't pulling no punches here with this week's Howlin' with Wolf.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,240
It's from AtAlchemistBBQ on Twitter.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,320
They write,

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,720
Hey PTBP crew, thank you for inspiring me to run my own Delta Green game.

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,440
Whether dealing with aliens, time travel, yeetin' babies, or stealing microwaves,

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,680
there's not been a dull moment while handling the bastard's crew.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,480
I look forward to the next arc post-contention for more inspiration.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,120
Just sure hope that all these games aren't secretly a summonin' ritual,

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,880
allowin' the tendrils of the crawlin' chaos to manifest in our world.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,840
What are the odds of that?

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,440
What the fuck is a yeet?

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,800
Thanks for writin', AlchemicalBBQ pitmaster.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:20,200
I still don't know what you people all mean by these games that people are runnin'.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,280
I only report on what is happenin' in real life.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,360
The great IRL.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,720
Now, if you wanna write up something for your heavyweight champion Wolf to Hal,

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,520
please send your messages as a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.

22
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,920
And I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP,

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,760
the newest and only radio station wherever I happen to be next.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,400
And speaking of next, here's an announcement.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,520
Whoa, this here is the finale of Control Copy.

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,960
So strap in for safety, my restrained pups, and hold on tight.

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,520
We're gonna take a week off.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,280
If all goes as planned, we'll be back on Friday, January 28th,

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,400
with the kickoff of a brand new short story.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,520
I'm sure you have questions.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
Will it be Delta Green?

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
Will it be written and handled by Zack?

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,600
Yes, again.

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,280
Will it have an entirely new set of players?

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,480
Whoa, yes, yes.

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,000
Allie, Lindsey, and Taylor will be back,

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,120
returning after their acclaimed run in the woods of contention.

39
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,760
And they will be joined by a secret special guest.

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,800
And if you can guess who it is,

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,560
I'll say your internet name live on air.

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,440
All right, that's enough news.

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,360
It's time for the news.

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,000
Just now, a corpse washed up on 34th Street Beach in Ocean City.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,440
The body is horribly disfigured and the eye sockets are empty.

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
The skin has mostly sloughed off,

47
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,440
but witnesses at the scene say the corpse has a long,

48
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,320
knotted scar up the right side of its face.

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,000
Hmm, who else have I heard of recently

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,160
that had a scar like that?

51
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,280
Oh, that's right.

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,160
It was Arvin Chilton's landlord, Alexander Duchesne.

53
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,600
But if this waterlogged carcass is Duchesne,

54
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,600
then who or what is in Duchesne's apartment?

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,480
Now, for the last and most on-the-nose time,

56
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,280
give it up for Brian Bulger with Bad in a Good Way.

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,080
Feels like I'm on the last bend of the deep end

58
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,880
But the drowning's been just fine

59
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,280
And when my ears pop and the shell shock

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Of this pit stop frees my mind

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,280
I'll be all right, I can go there

62
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Now that I stare, death in the face

63
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,280
I'll be all right, I can go there

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Now that I stare, death in the face

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
What's up, everybody?

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,080
Oh, that was pretty good.

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,880
Do you want to give it a...

68
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,080
What's up, everybody?

69
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,280
Do you guys want to give it a quick go of like,

70
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
it's Zach, I'm Zach?

71
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,080
Do you want to?

72
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
It's Zach, I'm Zach.

73
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,680
Oh, it's Zach, oh, I'm Zach.

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,480
Oh, no.

75
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,880
That's what it sounds like to me every time.

76
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,280
Oh, no.

77
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,280
God, God.

78
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Well, how close was I?

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,480
You were over.

80
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,280
By how much?

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,080
Like four seconds.

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,280
Were you rushing?

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Were you rushing?

84
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,080
Or were you dragging?

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,680
I was dragging.

86
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,880
Dragging these nuts across your face.

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,080
God damn it.

88
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
At the end of the last episode,

89
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,480
you all made an alertness check.

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,680
Two of you passed and the last thing you heard was rain.

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
But what a wild up.

92
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,080
I mean, so much happened.

93
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
Oh, my gosh.

94
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Really the most we've ever...

95
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,880
The most land covered?

96
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,280
So much distance covered.

97
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,880
So much plot covered.

98
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,680
If you guys were on Find My iPhone

99
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,880
and you were tracking each and every one of you,

100
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm not sure much would have changed

101
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,880
during the last episode.

102
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,480
Oh, no.

103
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Yeah, I couldn't pinpoint it.

104
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,680
It's not going to pinpoint that closely.

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,080
We went above.

106
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,680
We went upstairs.

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
Yeah, we could be in the exact same dot location,

108
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,880
just one story above.

109
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,880
Find My iPhone can't tell you that.

110
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,480
Maybe it can.

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,080
I've never used it in like a tall building.

112
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
We don't have many of those around here.

113
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,880
We really don't.

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,280
We're from Springfield, Missouri

115
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,680
if you're listening to this

116
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,080
and you haven't heard us before.

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
It doesn't matter, tall building or not.

118
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
I've never used it on a second floor.

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,680
Okay, so I recently used it on a second floor

120
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
to find Taylor's phone.

121
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Did it say it's on the second floor?

122
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,280
Nope.

123
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,080
There you go.

124
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
How many stories is the Hammond's Tower?

125
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,880
16?

126
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Yeah, 69.

127
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,480
1669.

128
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,080
That's where I grew up.

129
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Go there.

130
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,880
Doc Zach in the past.

131
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,080
Go there right now.

132
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,880
Past docs.

133
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Oh, I do have to actually delete that probably.

134
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Because people will go there.

135
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,080
It probably could be used for an interview.

136
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,480
It could be used as like an old address number.

137
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,680
Or they could go murder the people that bought that house.

138
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,280
Right.

139
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,880
All right, let's bail, bail, bail, bail.

140
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
And it's raining.

141
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
So we passed alertness rules,

142
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,080
but all we heard was rain.

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,680
I know.

144
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,280
And I'm going to tell you, I met a game tier.

145
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,680
Yeah.

146
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,280
You said, was the highest 114?

147
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,080
And I said, yeah.

148
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,880
Which means it was an opposed roll.

149
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,480
Oh, interesting.

150
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,880
I wonder who we were opposing.

151
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
We're doing a fair amount of meta gaming here

152
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
at the end of this scenario.

153
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,480
So we know this thing can create some kind of false reality

154
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
or even shield.

155
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,280
It prevents things around it from sensing it, right?

156
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,080
Because it killed that gas station attendant.

157
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,480
In full view of that witness who thought they heard something,

158
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,480
like it looks like they almost hear something,

159
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,480
but then they just turn around, like walk away.

160
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,080
So yeah, good meta gaming Joe.

161
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,280
I hadn't put that together.

162
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,080
Roll sanity, Luke.

163
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,880
Just for Luke.

164
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,280
I fail.

165
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Luke's eyes just got so big.

166
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,080
Yeah, he hit a breaking point.

167
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,680
Put them back in your eye.

168
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,280
I'm obsessed with vaping now.

169
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,680
And being a little stinker.

170
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
What a horrible mania to take.

171
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Well, he's a little stinker.

172
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,880
All right, let's dive in and let's cover ground.

173
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,480
We'll see.

174
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
GPS wise.

175
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,880
What about Nikomania?

176
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,880
And I'm addicted to nicotine and the Velvet Underground.

177
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,680
Boom.

178
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Great one.

179
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
If it was called Nikotine.

180
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,880
As you guys have been reading through the phone of Arvin

181
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:59,180
Chilton, you have found this phone number that was called

182
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,980
twice. Once the day after the McCarty murders and once the

183
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,680
day of the Quentin Harris murder, but previous to that gas

184
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,880
station attendant being murdered and you hear rain outside.

185
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,080
Okay, I look out the window.

186
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,780
Is it raining?

187
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,680
Yes.

188
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,780
Hey Sparrow, do you want to call this number?

189
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,380
I don't think I should do the talking.

190
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:22,880
Yeah.

191
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,380
All right.

192
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,180
Yeah.

193
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,480
Just feels like we should be running downstairs, but at least

194
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,780
check the bathroom that we did see the dirt trail didn't go

195
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:37,980
to it.

196
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,380
I have to pee Elwood.

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Oh Jesus.

198
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Do you ask me permission to pee?

199
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,580
Joe, Joe, what happened for the story?

200
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,280
Somebody needs to check the bathroom.

201
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,480
I got a pee.

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Is it really bad?

203
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,580
Number one, number one bad.

204
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,680
Scale of one to ten.

205
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
So you can't hold it.

206
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,580
He's hopping around and it's like making the whole house.

207
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,980
Oh, you look like you're about to pop.

208
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,680
Get in there.

209
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,080
Go.

210
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
I go to the bathroom.

211
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,280
There's nothing abnormal in the bathroom.

212
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,180
Ought one.

213
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,580
I get it right in the toilet.

214
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,180
You wasted an ought one on pissing.

215
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,280
Yeah, incredible piss.

216
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,180
He feels he feels like a spring in his step.

217
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,380
Maybe like he's got an extra awareness or something about

218
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,180
it. Plus twenty to any role that you would like during this

219
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,380
episode because of how well I just pissed incredible.

220
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,280
I wash my hands, but you have to tell me before you roll that

221
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,380
you want to use your plus twenty.

222
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,380
I wash my hands and slowly walk out of the bathroom.

223
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,280
So yeah, did you want to call this number or are we just

224
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
going to leave it be?

225
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,080
Yeah, she was about to but then she heard like what was

226
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,480
obviously the clearest like most perfect piss hitting the

227
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
center of a toilet.

228
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
It dazed you.

229
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,180
Yeah, this is an Andre giant.

230
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,380
So it's like it's kind of like a getting a fire hose like

231
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:05,880
stream in there.

232
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,580
Maybe I would assume I picked up my dice tray and I showed

233
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,280
it to Joe.

234
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,180
I saw that you want me to share what it was or you want to

235
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,980
keep it. So I didn't share what I rolled.

236
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,580
It was a 69 or we don't know.

237
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,280
Well, so every time so yeah, I think I kind of know.

238
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,580
Yeah, so agent Sparrow calls that number bring bring bring

239
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:36,780
bring bring bring bring bring bring bring bring bring bring

240
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,980
bring bring bring it rings until you think it's the last

241
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,080
possible second before it's going to go to voicemail.

242
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,080
She hangs up.

243
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,280
Totally kidding Arvin you goddamn son of a bitch.

244
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,480
What the fuck did you do?

245
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,680
What did you do?

246
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,480
Hello.

247
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,780
This is not Arvin.

248
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,380
My name is Clarissa Sparrow.

249
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,280
What did Arvin do to you?

250
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,280
Who are you?

251
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,780
Who are you?

252
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Someone who's trying to help.

253
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,480
How do you have this phone?

254
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,980
Arvin dropped it.

255
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
We don't know where he is.

256
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
We're worried for him.

257
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,480
Worried for him?

258
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,480
Be worried for the death wake that he left behind you.

259
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,580
Be worried for my fucking brother.

260
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:25,980
Okay.

261
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,180
Yeah.

262
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,180
So that's kind of I didn't know if you were really on his

263
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,080
side or not.

264
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,880
Seems like not right.

265
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,380
Yeah, so you're not neither are we we're not worried for him.

266
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,580
We're trying to stop him.

267
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,980
He killed my brother.

268
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,380
He killed Quentin.

269
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,380
That was the gas station attendant.

270
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,380
Yeah, interesting.

271
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,680
He called you two days before your brother died.

272
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,680
How do you know Arvin?

273
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,680
My brother knew Arvin back in 01.

274
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,180
You know him from the Steel Hill home.

275
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,180
The Steel Hill home.

276
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,180
Yeah, it was this fucked up fucking cult that my brother

277
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,180
got stuck in.

278
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,480
They trapped him there.

279
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,480
It tricked him told him the world was different than what

280
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,180
it is and he fucked with them.

281
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,080
It changed him different how he wasn't able to focus on

282
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,580
anything.

283
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,180
He was not able to be inside.

284
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:16,980
He was different.

285
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,780
Sorry, not your brother.

286
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,480
How did they say the world was different?

287
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,080
No, I don't listen to the endless nonsense that came out

288
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,680
of his me and Arvin close after that.

289
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,080
I didn't even know that Arvin was a part of it until he

290
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,980
called me.

291
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,980
What did you talk about when he called you?

292
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,480
I didn't even know him.

293
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,880
I didn't even know his name.

294
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,080
He's just sound like an old friend who would lost touch

295
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:49,480
and I just mean to told him where Quentin was.

296
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,280
Yeah, cuz he lied to you.

297
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,180
Yeah, he told you he was somebody else.

298
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:06,280
What did he say to you the next time he called what did

299
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:14,680
he say I'm gonna kill she did he say anything like oh,

300
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,480
I'm gonna kill him.

301
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,480
Oh, that's a fail on the sanity check from hearing even

302
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,980
a mimicry of the sound that you heard from Arvin Chilton

303
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,480
that horrible day the worst day of this man's life.

304
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:40,080
And he weeps and weeps and you hear him set down the phone

305
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,880
and then you hear him kind of walk away and he's just crying.

306
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,980
Okay, so I hang up I dial again.

307
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:59,680
Sir, hello.

308
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,880
You're gonna fucking laugh at me when you meet for me for

309
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,680
gay. No, I swear to God.

310
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,480
I'm not laughing.

311
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,280
I'm trying very hard not to laugh at your me me me's.

312
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,180
He lost his sanity check, so he's not going to be much use

313
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,480
anymore. Okay.

314
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,680
What was the name of that cult Steel Hill home?

315
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,580
All right, let's go check on Mr.

316
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,080
Duchesne.

317
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,880
My God is actually just keep rolling for these cops to be

318
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,680
brutalized.

319
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,980
I think he did the cops kick his ass.

320
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,880
Whoo doggy.

321
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,180
Yeah, the scenario is wrapped up now.

322
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,880
They took care of it outside for us.

323
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,380
Well, they were they really wanted to bully somebody some

324
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,980
more like they got it.

325
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,180
They really got it into them with Kevin and they're like

326
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,980
this old man is going to be easy to pick on.

327
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,380
Let's just beat the shit out of him.

328
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,580
I also like the picturing like cop cars and bodies flying

329
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,980
by the windows outside.

330
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,780
We're like it's raining.

331
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,480
It's raining tentacle laps against the window.

332
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,180
It's really coming down.

333
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,480
Yeah.

334
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,880
Wow.

335
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,280
We're going downstairs.

336
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,580
Aren't we?

337
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,080
Yep.

338
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,080
All right marching order, please Kevin go down first.

339
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,480
All righty for the first time Clarissa is kind of behind

340
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,780
Kevin to like she's seen Elwood do so many times we can share

341
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,880
him. I'll be at the very back.

342
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,280
Yeah now like you're actively crouching behind her to now

343
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,580
and like your hand is occasionally on her shoulder like

344
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,080
pushing her into a more like wow, this guy's Weasley.

345
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,680
I go down the stairs are the cops still outside as you're

346
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,980
going down the stairs.

347
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,980
You see no police officers outside.

348
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,680
Whereas before you would have seen six police officers outside

349
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,980
and how many were inside there were two inside other cars

350
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,880
gone their cars are not gone.

351
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,080
No, I didn't expect it would be those mean.

352
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,780
Cops are going to be inside.

353
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,580
I open the door.

354
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,180
Go ahead and roll sanity all of us.

355
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,980
Yeah 97 I fail.

356
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,280
I crit succeed.

357
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,480
Oh, wow.

358
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,480
The only one who's going to lose zero sanity here probably

359
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,580
85 on a now 80.

360
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,380
Failing failing crit succeed.

361
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,780
So at the Chris exceed Elwood Boyd, he's fucking free.

362
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,780
There's like something in him that just represses all of

363
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,180
this sanity loss down to absolutely nothing.

364
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,180
Whereas the the other the other two of you.

365
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,780
How much?

366
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,680
Who's tensing today?

367
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,580
Hi, that's my breaking point for sure.

368
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
Elwood what's wrong with you?

369
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,880
I mean seemingly a lot because the Duchesne home is an

370
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,880
abattoir a slaughterhouse and the smell of spilled blood

371
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,680
and flesh both rotting and fresh penetrates your nostrils

372
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,680
like an unwelcome houseguest as you all notice there's been

373
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,980
a distinct vibe switch in this withering old man's apartment.

374
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,580
It's as if a merciful veil has been cruelly lifted and the

375
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,580
reality of your situation begins to sink in as you stare

376
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:56,080
into the face of Arvin Chilton the target of your mission

377
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,780
and you know deep down in the sickening turmoil that's brewing

378
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,680
in your guts that you never spoke to Alexander Duchesne

379
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,080
at all. Arvin Chilton looks like his photograph but a version

380
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,480
that has been completely lost to madness his hair darts

381
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,080
in every direction akimbo like his eyes any visible skin

382
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,880
is covered in scratches and dried blood and the often mended

383
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,180
clothes that wrapped around the short stout landlord now

384
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,980
hang awkwardly from his tenants tall gaunt frame the whole

385
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,880
confusing and unnatural switcheroo situation is topped by

386
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,980
the same old pork pie cat dawned by what had appeared to

387
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,480
be Alexander Duchesne, but Arvin Chilton isn't the only

388
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,880
horribly unfamiliar thing in this room.

389
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,680
The walls are now or always were painted in human blood

390
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,380
dirty hands spread and shaped the gore like gruesome finger

391
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,880
paint into the symbol of the testament of new flesh displayed

392
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,180
man seen on the side of the Ocean City Cafe human body parts

393
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,480
are strewn throughout this place a loose tongue here a sole

394
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,980
foot there a length of dripping intestines is draped over

395
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,380
a stained lampshade and in some cases you recognize instances

396
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,380
where your eyes must have lied before the ashtray on the

397
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,380
coffee table is now a Glock 17 wet with vital fluids the

398
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,180
two mops are now Mossberg shotguns where there were once

399
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,480
five baseballs placed randomly around there are now four

400
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:54,680
M67 grenades and the food that's still sitting out my fucking

401
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,480
God dude.

402
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,580
He stole that straight from David Winters.

403
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,480
What is it?

404
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,380
What is it?

405
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,980
How did you eat the next time?

406
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,380
We had an opportunity at the very next time.

407
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,980
How did you fall for that?

408
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,280
Guess what the olives are eyeballs eyeballs and guess what

409
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,780
the thin cuts of meat were penises flesh human flesh and

410
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,580
slices and there's a mound of chewed up human flesh.

411
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,280
Oh my God.

412
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:32,580
So I need another sanity check point from both Elwood Boyd

413
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,280
fail again and Kevin gelato for having eaten eyes and flesh

414
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,080
that one's a fail.

415
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,080
You're gonna lose three more sanity each of you and you are

416
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,480
overcome with uncontrollable vomiting for a number of turns

417
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,580
equal to the loss three turns.

418
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,480
So for three full turns the only action you can take is yacking.

419
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,980
Oh and one more change in the scene dressing the copy of as

420
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,980
you like it that's sitting on the table as I lay dying.

421
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:17,980
It was just a book.

422
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,280
It's a title changed.

423
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,480
That was all seems to be a diary of some sort some sort of

424
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,480
leather-bound diary is the leather made out of humans.

425
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,080
I feel like that seems obvious.

426
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,780
So no, it's just a diary.

427
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,580
The horse meat diary.

428
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,880
Yeah, not not horse leather.

429
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,680
No horse meat diary rotting flesh and finally at the feet

430
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:54,580
of Arvin Chilton in a pool of their own blood are seven bodies

431
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,280
each with their throat slit all uniformed police officers

432
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,680
because I fuck you not he out rolled all eight.

433
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,680
Police officers.

434
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,680
So I don't doubt that but and then he rolled a 69.

435
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,080
Yeah, but what so he's in front of seven bodies and the

436
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,980
eighth one.

437
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,580
He has this cop by the back of the neck and this cop is staring

438
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:29,380
at the three of you with eyes that make you think maybe he's

439
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,580
not looking at you even though his eyes are pointed in that

440
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:40,680
direction and as Arvin, let's go of this body you see he's

441
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,080
been holding this long knife that has a weird Bend on the

442
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,780
end of it this crooked knife and this cop just slides off

443
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,880
the end of it and face plants into the ground in front of

444
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
you speaking of eyes.

445
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,680
How are the bodies looking?

446
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,680
Are they are they eyeful or eyeless so far only two of them

447
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,980
are our eyeless cool that weird knife.

448
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,480
He's got that look like an eye shucking knife.

449
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,380
So let's work in dexterity order.

450
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,780
I believe Elwood Boyd is up first Elwood.

451
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,280
Where do you throw up?

452
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,480
Just inside just inside the door.

453
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,980
I think that's we've lost the sanity because we've peaked

454
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,080
in so I'm at least that far inside Kevin gelato normally

455
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,780
when someone loses over five sanity in one go we would have

456
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,580
you roll fight flight or faint.

457
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,480
However due to what is written in the scenario it says that

458
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,980
for the next three rounds you are vomiting and so therefore

459
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,580
I'm going to use that as your fight flight or faint response

460
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,080
if that's cool with you, that's fine.

461
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,380
Where are you violently throwing it?

462
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,780
I had just stepped right inside the door since I was the

463
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,580
first you were the first one in and I step right inside see

464
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,780
it all and within seconds just like Jersey burger is coming

465
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:05,580
out of Kevin and the munchy platter whatever that was called

466
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,980
projectile vomits everywhere and as that's happening the

467
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,880
camera zooms like into his head and Kevin is standing in

468
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,380
the middle of a giant Stadium hot bright lights shining

469
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,480
down on him the crowd is roaring Kevin is staring across

470
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,380
the field giving a menacing look to Tom Brady Tom has a

471
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,780
nervous look on his face and sweat is pouring off his forehead

472
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,080
hike Kevin rushes through the defensive line and smashes

473
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,980
into Brady Brady's head comes clean off his body is the

474
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:48,680
crowd chance man yet man yet Kevin reaches down and grabs

475
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,980
Tom Brady's head and holds it up in the air proudly displaying

476
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,880
his bloody trophy money begins falling out of the sky

477
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,480
as the camera zooms out 40 million dollars for two years.

478
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,780
That's crazy, bro.

479
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,180
Yeah, I know but I would can't come with me and it makes

480
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,580
him it makes us sad.

481
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,980
So I don't think I'm going to do it Kev.

482
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
Are you serious?

483
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,180
That's insane.

484
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,580
Elwood walks in.

485
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,180
We were just talking about Kevin's future football career

486
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,280
Elwood sound thinking about that bullshit minion.

487
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,080
You're better off here with me.

488
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,180
We can do big things together together together and then

489
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,380
the camera zooms out to Kevin puking in this living room.

490
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Hey Luke, you get 10 luck points for the rest of the scenario.

491
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Hell, yeah, basically these are going to be one-to-one for

492
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,080
changing any role that you want to make for the rest of your

493
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
time and I get on you already had plus 20.

494
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,180
Oh and you have a plus 20 to a roll.

495
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,880
Badass.

496
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,280
Agent Sparrow's eyes meet the eyes of Arvin Chilton and they

497
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,680
are absolutely crazed standing above eight slumped uniformed

498
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,380
ocean shitty PD officers.

499
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,280
Hey, man, only people from Ocean Shitty can say that.

500
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,380
As the person playing everyone in Ocean City right now.

501
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,280
I'm allowed to say it.

502
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:24,180
He's holding a grenade in his hand and the pin has been pulled

503
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,880
and his thumb is covering the clip.

504
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,880
Roll a five fighter vane.

505
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:35,180
One, two, three, fight, four, five, freeze, and six, flight.

506
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,380
What'd you roll, Thomas?

507
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,380
I rolled a one.

508
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,380
Oh hell yeah, dude.

509
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,980
Get that fight going, baby.

510
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,980
Agent Sparrow, her eyes are darting around at this whole

511
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,180
situation is she's trying to balance her FBI agent mind, her

512
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,680
Delta Green agent mind, her student body president agent

513
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,880
mind. It all builds to just, I've got to destroy this.

514
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,480
Yeah, and she picks up one of the grenades.

515
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,180
Yeah, pulls the pin on her own.

516
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,380
Oh, yeah, and just tosses it like right towards him and the

517
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,480
bucket of dynamite.

518
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
Oh my God, what?

519
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,880
Wow.

520
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,080
Oh my God, okay.

521
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,580
Joe doesn't know, sticks of dynamite and a grenade all mixed

522
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,480
together would take out a block, wouldn't it?

523
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,980
So in Delta Green, there is a 15% lethality rating for M67

524
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,180
grenades within 10 meters.

525
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,080
What about dynamite?

526
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,480
Which is easily within this and then within dynamite is going

527
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,880
to have a 10% lethality rating within 20 meters.

528
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,180
And how many sticks are there?

529
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,680
There were 19 sticks of dynamite in this bucket.

530
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,080
It is absolutely going to compound and Agent Sparrow has chosen

531
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,180
to end this threat.

532
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Which is the fucking Delta Green thing to do!

533
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,380
I told you I fucking knew how to play Delta Green.

534
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,480
Please roll athletics to throw this grenade in an accurate

535
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,080
way. How big is this room?

536
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,980
Dude, it's tiny.

537
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,980
You really don't even have to pass this check for everyone

538
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,580
to die.

539
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,680
15 on a 30.

540
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,980
It lands right in the bucket of dynamite.

541
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,780
It lands right in the fucking bucket.

542
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,080
You really based on the lethality of 19 sticks of dynamite

543
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,680
as well as these two grenades and the other grenades in this

544
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,280
room, which is three more.

545
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,580
We're all going to die.

546
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,780
Yes, before that happens.

547
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:44,280
She takes one last look around at Kevin and Elwood and she's

548
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,280
like, man, if we'd gotten three or four more episodes with

549
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,180
these characters, I might have really cracked something in

550
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,180
that dynamic and help Kevin realize his own potential.

551
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,880
That thought manifests as just like a small glint in her

552
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,480
eye before the entire room is a ball of light and flame.

553
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,280
Elwood as he's puking puts his hand on Kevin's back.

554
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,380
Kevin is still throwing up, but he sees the grenade get

555
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,080
launched in there.

556
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,280
He grabs Elwood and just lays like on top of him to try to

557
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,480
prevent Elwood from getting exploded.

558
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,480
Maybe the only thing and Andre the Giant from the blast.

559
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,280
Okay, let's take a top over.

560
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,380
Early Grand Theft Auto.

561
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,780
Look at this scene.

562
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:46,780
This two-story duplex fucking explodes.

563
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:54,980
All four cop cars immediately just boom over on their sides.

564
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,480
All the cars on the street are

565
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:07,380
step away from the car.

566
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,780
I mean, yeah, every window for a couple blocks.

567
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,280
Every dog is barking.

568
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,580
Twitter is blowing up.

569
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,880
Did you guys hear that noise?

570
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
And yeah, everyone is just a sonic boom.

571
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,880
So here's what we're going to do.

572
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,080
I'm going to have Luke roll the last roll of the scenario.

573
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,780
Don't roll yet, please.

574
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,380
You've got a plus 20 on this roll plus 20 plus 10.

575
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,280
I'm going to add and you've got a plus 10 due to the luck.

576
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:44,280
And what role do you think would satisfy the requirement

577
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,980
of covering the body of Elwood Boyd enough to shelter him

578
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,880
from this absolute blast?

579
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,180
Just pure will and strength.

580
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,580
Strength or athletics a thing, right?

581
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:01,980
Let's see.

582
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,380
Like are your constitutes your sheer size?

583
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,480
Yeah, like your con.

584
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,480
I could do con.

585
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
All right, let's roll con.

586
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,080
91 on a 95.

587
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,280
Oh, so wait, we gave you a roll.

588
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
You could not fail.

589
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:28,580
I rescind my scream for something more dramatic.

590
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,280
Is there anything you have at a 70?

591
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,680
Well, everything else is at 80.

592
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,780
So it would have been just automatic.

593
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,280
So that at least gave a little leeway and I saw the nine

594
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:47,780
I was like fuck 91 sirens smoke is fading from the scene

595
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,180
red and blue lights cover everything.

596
00:31:52,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Red-eyed night shift EMTs begin uncovering 107 East 12th

597
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,480
Street Ocean City, New Jersey as they're picking through

598
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,780
the rubble they see movement a heaving spine.

599
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:25,580
As Kevin breathes his last breaths his lungs are like popping

600
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:32,580
out of his back and Elwood Boyd pushes his giant bodyguards

601
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,780
body off the top of him.

602
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,780
We got a live one.

603
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,080
Somebody get the ambulance over here everybody.

604
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,980
We need a stretcher.

605
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,480
We need a stretcher now.

606
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,380
Kevin's goggled eyes are staring right into Elwood's eyes.

607
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,180
What is going through Elwood Boyd's mind as he looks through

608
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,980
the goggles on the corpse of Kevin gelato?

609
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,780
Oh, oh Kevin.

610
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,880
Well, I'm going to need a new one.

611
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,280
Oh, Jesus.

612
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,580
Death in the face.

613
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
I'll be all right.

614
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,480
I can go there now.

615
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,580
Loves their death in the face.

616
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,880
Doesn't it always seem like the parts and made us laugh

617
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,580
now make us cry.

618
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:22,780
Doesn't it always seem like the villain Paul in the strings

619
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
is a regular guy.

620
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:31,180
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

621
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,380
Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.

622
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,780
I'll be all right.

623
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,480
I can go there now.

624
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,980
I'll be all right.

625
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,580
I can go there now.

626
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:36,480
There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.

627
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:44,480
White washed hymns and the deadly sins push me to my limit.

628
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,480
When you deconstruct, you shit out of luck for a minute.

629
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,480
After the last bend, you can break it all down to rebuild it.

630
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:24,480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

631
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

632
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

633
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

634
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:16,480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

635
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,480
He's trying to eat another grinder.

636
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Without a key, please.

637
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:05,480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

638
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Clasp your fist over all the blood.

639
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Water leaks through your fingers.

640
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,480
You're standing in a swirling flood.

641
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,480
And only darkness leaves.

642
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Falling fast into a deep abyss.

643
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Till it sets you out again.

644
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Find your feet on your broken bones.

645
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:18,480
You're out for the edge again.

646
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:49,480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.
