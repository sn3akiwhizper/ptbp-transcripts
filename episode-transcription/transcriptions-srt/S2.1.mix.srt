1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Thanks. Thanks for that fridge. It was like the grudge sound. Sounds like clinking bones.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,640
My fridge used to make that noise and I thought it was mice for the longest time. It's just

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,760
the ice machine, right? It's the ice maker, right? I don't have an ice maker. It was something

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,380
that went back in the fridge. There was a mouse in the fridge? No man, it was the ghost

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,340
of his old fridge. I used to think it was mice and it was. What's up everybody? I'm

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,740
Zach. Welcome to season two of Pretending to be People. First off, Joe, do you need

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,700
to listen to season one of Pretending to be People? Hell no. But should you listen to

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,680
season one of Pretending to be People, Luke? Hell yeah. And what did you think about season

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,740
one of Pretending to be People, Thomas? I thought we could do better. That's why we're

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:59,220
here. The whole gang is back together for another quick and simple role playing campaign.

11
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,900
In and out, 20 minute campaign. Justin is also back with us as both Wolf the dog, the

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,640
AM radio DJ, who will continue to introduce each episode. And he's also returning as our

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,260
in-house composer. Justin actually messaged me and said, hey Zach. That's how he messages

14
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,980
me, or at least the time. Oh, he's got to relate. Parentheses, sultry, sexy. Hey Zach,

15
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:31,100
I created all new music for season two. What the fuck? We're so fucking excited to have

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,420
Justin back in-house composing for season two. Very excited. I hope it's good. Oh, I

17
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,700
listened to it. We'll see. Now we are here because what do we do? We play a role playing

18
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:51,180
game. We play a tabletop role playing game. That stands for TTRPG. That's right. And

19
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,820
what are TTRPGs, Thomas? Well, that's where you get your best friends around a table or

20
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,140
whatever you have, but we have a table. I thought you meant like best friends or whoever

21
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,300
you have around. Right. Which is also true. We lucked into our role playing group, but

22
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,300
I understand that that is a very common phenomenon. Yes. Fortunately, we are best friends who

23
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,860
role play together. So we get around our table, our tabletop, and we roll some dice

24
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,980
and pretend to be people. And we tell stories together. He said the name. He said the name.

25
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,380
He did it. I got that in there. Hell yeah. So last season we played an amalgamation of

26
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,060
a game called Delta Green, the role playing game and a game called Pulp Cthulhu. This

27
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,480
season we are maybe going to utilize a lot of those same rules, but we're really focusing

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,860
in on just using a stripped down version of the original Delta Green rules. Which is a

29
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,020
what offshoot of Call of Cthulhu. It is an offshoot of the game by Chaosium, Call of

30
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,820
Cthulhu. I should mention here Delta Green is published by Arc Dream Publishing. Shout

31
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,220
out to them for creating an absolutely phenomenal game that we can't remember all the rules

32
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:02,460
to. So we play our own version of it. That's what we mean by stripped down. Complete. Whose

33
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:10,980
green is it anyway? We should also mention that we play what's called a closed game.

34
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,220
What does that mean? Oh, that just means that when your characters choose to go off on their

35
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:23,300
own or split the party, then we actually split up our in real life party here and have the

36
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,180
people whose characters are not in the room go into a different physical room. Dude, I

37
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,580
must have not been paying attention like the last season because I legit thought that you

38
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,300
would just like get mad at us and like randomly be like, get the fuck out of this. And I was

39
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,740
like, it's confusing. And then, but you know, sometimes it's like a long time out. Sometimes

40
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,020
it's just like 30 seconds. So, but that makes so much more sense. Luke was getting confused

41
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,700
because we do send them on time outs. Those are different than the closed game. Yeah.

42
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,820
Time out. If any of us were there with you, that was a moment of a closed game. But if

43
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,700
you were just in the corner with your hat, that was a time out. I hate that fucking hat.

44
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,740
Zach, it really defeats the purpose of the discipline if he doesn't even know he's being

45
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,940
punished. That's a good point. You just said fuck. I've already said fuck. Let's talk about

46
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,780
the explicit content warning. Yeah. There's a real big fucking content warning on this show.

47
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:26,300
And we delve into some pretty dark subjects. Yeah. It's not just cursing. We use the cursing

48
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,020
to describe terrible things. Terrible things is what the explicit tag is for. It is certainly

49
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,380
not just for fuck words. Uh, we're going to get pretty gross. We're going to get pretty

50
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:41,140
weird. Yeah. Slimy, gory, violent, scary. It's going to get fucked up. Some real twisted

51
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:50,460
stuff. Although it's fun when we do it. Yeah. If you're scared of, yeah. Trigger warning.

52
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,300
Are you scared of fun? And we've been doing this as a group for a while. Does anyone know

53
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,620
how long we've been playing together? 18, 19 years. It hasn't been quite that long.

54
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,700
I'd divide that by three and I think we'd be about right. So how long did we play before

55
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,300
we started recording? It was like a year and a half. Yeah. We played for like two years,

56
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,860
I think before we started playing. And then season one was almost four years of recording.

57
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:24,700
We're going to cut that down. So we've been playing together for something like six years

58
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,220
now. From what I've heard on the internet, that is considered rare. How do you think

59
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,300
we've been able to keep it up by making a lot of the rules? Yeah, I would say the fact

60
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,780
that we generally have a great time together is what's going and the money. We have a Patreon

61
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:52,180
by the way. Yeah. And Hey, that money is not keeping me around yet. So maybe keep Thomas

62
00:05:52,180 --> 00:06:01,620
around. Well, should that be a stretch goal? Keep Thomas. Oh man. I love this group. I love

63
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,620
this group because you're literally my, I was going to say best friends. You're my only friends.

64
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,500
But I also- Is that better or worse? It's the same dude. It sounded like a downgrade in the

65
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,460
middle of the sentence. He's stuck with us either way. Speaking of, you guys played three small

66
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,260
town cops last season. This season, we're not doing that. And we're also not playing Delta

67
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,220
Green agents. What are you guys up to this season? We'll say goodbye to the small town because we're

68
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,700
in the city. We're in the city, baby. We're going to the city. Do you want to know what happens in

69
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:38,940
the city? We can tell you. Newsworthy action and that's what we cover because we're a fucking news

70
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:47,220
team, y'all. An action news squad tooling around in our sweet van, bringing you all the news that's

71
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:55,140
fit to print. Wait, city action news van, the can van? The can van. Fuck yeah. First good improv of

72
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:03,620
the season. Actually, I have that written down right here in front of me. So thanks so much for

73
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:12,740
listening to this first episode of season two. And now let's turn that dial to 694.2 PTBP and hand it

74
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:30,740
over to Wolf the dog. Good afternoon, everybody. And I do literally mean everybody because we are

75
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:41,740
coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the city's oldest and only radio station. It's your sweaty

76
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:49,860
teddy bear with the news to share, Wolf the dog. It's a wet hot day here in the city this Saturday.

77
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:59,700
It's June 18th, 2022 if that means anything to you. And oh damn, there's an email in my inbox. Why,

78
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:06,100
it's a new Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from John Scott Tynes,

79
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,940
an American writer best known for his work on the role-playing games Unknown Armies,

80
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:20,180
Call of Cthulhu, Puppetland, and Delta Green. John tweeted about the show and tagged at

81
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:28,460
Pretending Pod, a very cool and very easy thing to do. He writes, I've got a message here from

82
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:36,100
high up on the down low. Hey, clockwork child, love your style. Watch out for minotaurs in the

83
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:46,140
labyrinth. Dr. Gonzo, keep on keeping it surreal. Jeff Hawthorne, hello and goodbye. Nice job keeping

84
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:54,940
ahead. And Florida man, master of the dude way. Rock that red beard and tell Jane hi. Blood and

85
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:04,500
kisses JC lens. Damn now y'all aren't even trying to make sense anymore. Does anyone know what in

86
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,300
the grease any of this means? Kids these days. If you want to write up something for your steamy

87
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:18,900
Wolf to howl, just tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram. Tag pretending to be people on

88
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:26,020
Facebook. Or if you want to be one of Wolf's favorites, submit a five star review on Apple

89
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:33,420
podcasts, screenshot that super supportive endorsement and send it to our socials. And if

90
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:41,340
you want to interact with other nasty folks in this PTBP community, join us on discord or over

92

40 hours of confidential bonus content, give us your money on Patreon. And if you want to drape

93
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:03,100
your body in the finest of branded threads, go grab a shirt, hat, beach towel and fanny pack over

94
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:10,900
at PretendingPod.shop. No need to remember all that. The links are in the show notes and me, I

95
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:19,820
need to go folks. Find some wet debris and with a whole dose. We've got a brand new theme to warm

96
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:27,300
up your throats. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

97
00:10:40,900 --> 00:11:10,620
Our story begins on a sweltering, muggy Saturday in the city.

98
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:21,220
It's June 18th, 2022 and walking feels more like wading through a pool. But plenty of people are

99
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,820
parading up and down the perpendicular pathways that make up the city. Each intersection, four

100
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:35,820
perfectly 90 degree angles. Each street sign, splendidly shining in the sunlight. Each person

101
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:43,180
walking outside for more than 30 seconds, drenched. The severe and sterile design of the city helps

102
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,460
some folks keep their heads on straight, helps them keep a grip on their reality, but everyone's

103
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,940
different. Though I bet plenty of people would agree it'd be nice to be able to get an eyeful

104
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,460
of the city without being inundated with so many advertisements. Facebook, Olive Garden,

105
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:05,100
The Godel Company, Gucci, Amazon, The City News, Apple, Exxon Mobil. It's impossible.

106
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:12,140
They're everywhere. You say The Gobble Company? G-O-T-T-L-E. It's like Butterball. The Godel

107
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:23,500
Company is a food based company. They work on bio-farming. Wait, that ain't right. Bio-farming

108
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:35,660
is just farming? Yeah. Then yes. It's organic farming. Is it like growing a steak in a lab

109
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:43,740
or is it like growing a cow in a field? Honestly, it's more like growing corn in a field. Okay,

110
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,620
to feed the cows? That's just agriculture. Yeah, they're an agriculture, they're an ag company.

111
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,300
Hell yeah. Who's going to be the bad guy, do you guys think?

112
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,500
Zach was hoping he could just slip that Godel in there and we wouldn't mention anything and now

113
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:06,380
he's got the entire plot ruined. Even Luke took down a note on Godel.

114
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,300
I spelled it wrong and then I wrote over it, but I can tell.

115
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,660
Well, Luke, let's start with you. You're the producer, one of the segment producers

116
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,060
out in the field of City Action News. I want you to tell me about your character and what

117
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:26,700
they're up to on this oppressively moist Saturday afternoon. My character is Julius

118
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,580
Summers and you can do MFA after that if you want. Do I have to? It's preferred.

119
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,500
I'm getting an NBA vibe from this guy. No business, film and arts.

120
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,700
All right, what's Julius up to on this heater of a start of the weekend? Julius is

121
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:51,660
in his closet. He is color coding his suits. He's getting ready for his first real week

122
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,900
at Cannes. City Action News.

123
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,740
And he is super stressing out about which suit he's going to wear.

124
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,020
What are your options? Blue, tan or black.

125
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,900
He has 19 suits, various shades of blue, tan and black.

126
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,620
Do you mix and match or do you always keep it monochromatic?

127
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,300
Monochromatic and they're 90s fits.

128
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,380
Oh, anything else I need to know about Julius Summers?

129
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,220
He is starting at City Action News because nepotism, basically.

130
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,340
Speaking of, your uncle calls your cell phone. You get a vibration and the name says

131
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:35,020
Tyfe Ralen, T-Y-F-E, Ralen. Shout out to Jeff from Seattle. One of our patrons at the $10

132
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:41,180
above level has given us this character who is a six foot tall man with dark slicked back hair

133
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,940
and a permanent smirk.

134
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,220
Tyfe is a cool name.

135
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,860
It is cool.

136
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,220
Tyfe Ralen is the executive producer of the City Action News and he is

137
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,060
Julius Summers direct report.

138
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,900
Hello.

139
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,500
Hey, what the fuck is up? My beautiful baby nephew. Come on.

140
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,060
Huh? It's a beautiful day for overtime. Yeah.

141
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:03,760
Stucks.

142
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,180
Overtime.

143
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,060
Good. You keeping the talent happy?

144
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,100
Of course you are. All right. Well, get him, get the camera guy, get them all out to the,

145
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:19,420
get him out to a farm. Okay. Find a magnetic fucking farmer to do 90 seconds. Only 90 seconds.

146
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,420
Okay. On whether they would sell their land to the Godel company. I heard Fred Godel himself

147
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,300
is going around and closing these land deals in person. See what they think about that, right?

148
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,780
Okay. Just 90 seconds this time. Don't let him go all in depth like he likes to. Oh, and nephew.

149
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:45,580
Y'all gotta do a TikTok for the can. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm real serious this time. Okay. Yeah.

150
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,260
Yeah. You have to make a TikTok for the can. Can do.

151
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:55,980
Okay. Have fun. You're based for this bro. And he hangs up. Fuck. A farm in the city?

152
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,420
It's going to be hard.

153
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:06,700
He, uh, was standing there completely naked because he was trying to decide what to put on.

154
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,060
Who doesn't love a naked phone call with their uncle? It wasn't a FaceTime.

155
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,660
What's his dong like? Um, you see him from the back. So the dong, can you see the dong?

156
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,900
The dong has not been revealed, but he is standing with, he has no thigh gap. So he's standing.

157
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,820
There'd be no way to see the dong. He's thick. He's got, uh,

158
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,980
Julius Summers. Yeah. Big thighs. He ran in, in college and he ran even while he was getting his

159
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:41,660
masters, which is weird. He big thighs, normal rest of his body. He throws on. So normal dong,

160
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,780
normal dong, normal calves, no more arms, no more torso, huge thighs, huge thighs,

161
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,420
but thick thighs. People are like, whoa, get it, get a load of those. Do they save lives?

162
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,540
They report on whether life was saved or not. Could he smash a watermelon with those bad boys?

163
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,740
He has before. And he'll do it again. Fun party trick in college. He just kind of like closes

164
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,700
his eyes and starts pointing around and then stops and he puts on a light tan suit with a tan

165
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:16,860
undershirt, a tan tie, tan pants and tan shoes. So everyone can see your sweat stains on this

166
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,460
super hot Saturday. He does, uh, throw on a couple tan undershirts. It's going to be hotter,

167
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:28,140
but it'll soak up as much sweat as possible. Grabs a cell phone, puts it in his pocket,

168
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,060
grabs the keys to the van, the city action news van, the can van, the can van. Where's it at?

169
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:45,100
The can van is a parked in front of Julius Caesar's. The can van is parked outside of Julius

170
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,140
Summers house, which is located right on the outskirts of town and the first like little

171
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:58,140
suburb. He runs out to the van and calls up the talent. All right, sick. So, uh, let's, uh,

172
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:07,740
let's dive in and see what Thomas's character is. As a character. When you get this phone call,

173
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,260
what are you up to? It's a hot Saturday in the city. Cal Colorado has definitely been

174
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,460
sitting by the phone waiting for a call from his producer. Cal Colorado?

175
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,580
Veteran newsman, Cal Colorado. Holy shit. And he's got, he's got a landline that rings

176
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,500
and he sets down his, his cup of black coffee and he picks up the receiver and he says,

177
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:39,980
hello, Cal Colorado. Awesome. Cal. Julius. We need to get ready. Ready for what? We are

178
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,020
going to the farm. Which farm? You can figure that out while I drive to come get you.

179
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:52,060
Cal hangs up confused. The producer doesn't know it's his job.

180
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:00,220
This is Saturday. Julius's first day, um, was on Friday just as like a, like, you know,

181
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,100
kind of get to know you thing. As soon as the phone is hung up, he's like, fuck that.

182
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:13,900
And he starts Googling farms near him and the, the can van pulls up on this sweltering hot day.

183
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,020
Honestly, the AC hasn't even kicked in to full gear at this point in time. Windows are kind

184
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,500
of rolled down while you've got the air flying through. Oh, I thought you meant the AC in Cal

185
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:30,940
Colorado's house because yes it has. It's very well maintained. Oh, what degree? 73. Character

186
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:37,580
development. Tell me about it stud. Oh, well 73 just seems a little more like I keep it at 69

187
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,060
cause that's funny and comfortable. It's expensive and hilarious.

188
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,980
But Cal Colorado keeps it at 73 no matter what time of year.

189
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,540
He pulls up in front of your house, apartment, high rise. Where are you? Where are you at?

190
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:02,940
Cal Colorado lives in a modest townhouse. Well-kept with a finely functioning air

191
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:11,340
conditioner. He sets down his cup of black coffee. He had TV on to like a competitor's network.

192
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,780
Awesome. He was idly like scratching his cat's ears. Can you tell me a little bit more about Cal?

193
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:24,380
Cal keeps a very neat home. Pretty small. It's just him. The tan line where his wedding ring was

194
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:30,940
is long gone. Really you can tell he's, he's a pretty simple guy. There's not a lot of flashy

195
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:37,020
accessories. There are a bunch of pictures along the entrance hall, like showing a long career.

196
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,820
Is it just him shaking hands with different people? It's him with Edward R. Moreau and Walter

197
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,900
Cronkite and Dan Rather on down to like Anderson Cooper. Starting out when he's just like clearly

198
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,820
like a pimply faced intern and going to now he's, uh, he's in his late fifties, tall man,

199
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,780
slim with well-kept but thinning hair. Is he a gray? Is he a gray? Is he a gray?

200
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,500
Spoilers. I'm about to blow this bitch wide open. Is he, uh, is he being controlled by amigo?

201
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,020
Didn't amigos get canceled? Are you guys still on the phone? When I said I'm gonna go get him,

202
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:21,180
I figured that was the end of the conversation. He's just describing his house to you. I'm like,

203
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,460
I am a simple man with austere possessions, but my memories are important to me.

204
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,780
And out the door, honk honk. Good afternoon, Julius. Are you ready to make some news?

205
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:40,540
I'm not sure how the last guy did it, but I'm sure I'll do just as well. Well,

206
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,580
Marvin left some pretty big shoes to fill, but you'll get the hang of things.

207
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:51,180
He just kind of nods and then he calls his camera man and heads to the camera guy's house.

208
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,180
Damn. He didn't answer the phone. Hold on.

209
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:09,580
It goes to voicemail. Hey, you've reached back. Uh, didn't get to the phone. Uh,

210
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,140
I guess you could try again cause I'm not calling you back.

211
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,180
Julius was going to leave a voicemail and then he hears that.

212
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,260
I keep driving to the camera guy's house. Uh, have, have you been to his house before? I

213
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:34,780
try not to go in, but yes. Is it that one? It's the one where the top floor is a little burned

214
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:40,060
out. Pull up to the house and then, uh, just jump out and go.

215
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:50,860
So inside the house, uh, you see Beck Wilder is laying a face down on his bed. Uh,

216
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:57,900
he is just in his tighty whities, pasty skin, uh, blonde hair, kind of medium length,

217
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,460
all messy from a fitful night of sleep. There are pizza boxes and energy drinks all over the floor.

218
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,300
And on a desk that has a bunch of computer monitors. When we say bed,

219
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,060
are we talking bed frame or mattress on the floor? Mattress on a floor. Uh,

220
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,700
he's on top of the sheets. Like he obviously just conked forward from a standing position

221
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,300
and uh, he starts to hear the pounding at the door in his dream. Oh, it's his mom has been

222
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,620
pounding on the door in his dream and he's been scared to answer it. And then he, oh, uh, uh,

223
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,980
oh shit. And he starts jumping up and he goes to his closet, he rips it open and there are

224
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,780
a variety of Hawaiian shirts are on the rack. But his favorite one is on the floor crumpled

225
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,100
and he wants to wear the favorite one. So he grabs it and sniffs it. It passes the test.

226
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:54,140
He throws it on, uh, he goes and opens the door and he still just got the tighty whities.

227
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,100
I really don't appreciate you making a character so obviously inspired by Luke and I.

228
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,900
Uh, Becca's bleary eye looking at you. Hey, uh, uh, hail Caesar. What's up dude?

229
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,820
Julius just kind of looks him up and down. The Caesar reference goes right over his head.

230
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,540
Yeah, I think we might've edited that part out. Nah, give unto summers what is summers.

231
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:28,220
Give. Is that some fucking newfangled translation? Render bitch. Oh, I, I wasn't allowed to read the

232
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:35,500
old one. Are you gonna put any pencil on? Oh shit dude. Hang on a sec. Hey,

233
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,940
this is a house is Dawn. Jesus. It's how tight are the whitey spilling out?

234
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,740
So he's standing there. Lenny Kravitzing in front of you.

235
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,660
Luke almost just spit out his shelter. The image immediately was perfect in my mind.

236
00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:00,940
As he unfurls in front of you. Becca is still talking to you from inside the house.

237
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,700
Uh, so I mean like, why are you here man? Do we have something going on?

238
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,540
We're going to the farm. 90 seconds at the farm. All right man. Hang on a sec. And he's throwing

239
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,660
on a cargo shorts that have a lot of pockets. These are, these are the cargoiest of cargo

240
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,700
shorts. He's a real camera man. Shorts. These are real camera man shorts and he's grabbing,

241
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,300
first he grabs the leftover energy drink that's sitting on his desk and he takes a big swig of it

242
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,820
and realizes that it was from like five days ago and that wasn't the one he was drinking last

243
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:36,060
night. At least it wasn't one of the piss jugs. Also, I love that you know the difference in

244
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:42,300
tastes between a one day old energy drink and a five day old energy drink. Well, three days is the

245
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,220
perfectly aged Gatorade. He wipes the film off his teeth.

246
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,820
Yeah, that's an old one. And loads it into his camera.

247
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,540
Amongst this chaos though, you do see that like the computer desk that's strewn with

248
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,460
energy drinks and stuff, it's got the computer monitors and stuff. The actual computer monitors

249
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,580
and desk and stuff are impressive. It's a good high quality setup and kind of over in a corner

250
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,900
is where he keeps his camera equipment and it's the cleanest part of the house and he grabs two

251
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,100
cases. One's got the camera and one's got all of his accoutrement and he grabs a tripod and gets

252
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,860
it up under his arm and it's all a little disheveled as he's walking toward you. Alright

253
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,620
man, let's get going. Julius is already kind of overwhelmed with the day and just kind of

254
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,180
180s and heads back to the van. On the way out, he tries to get everything under one arm so he

255
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:39,180
can grab his lucky blue baseball cap, puts it on his head and meets you guys in the van. Hey, Cal!

256
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,300
Good morning, Beck. Good to see you, man! It's always a pleasure. So, uh, what are we doing?

257
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:49,740
We've got 90 seconds at the farm. You know where that is, right? Uh, the farm. I mean,

258
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:55,020
there's a lot of, uh, which, uh, I mean... Which one comes to your mind first?

259
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:04,540
The O'Carney Farm. Okay, let's get us there. Let's go. You, uh, you want me to drive?

260
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:15,660
Do you? He's got bloodshot eyes in it. Do you, uh, you want me to drive? I am actually good. Cal,

261
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,780
could you open the glove box? Cal is, like, kind of looking over his script and not really paying

262
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:27,820
attention and he's like, Beck is a fine driver. He would be an admirable choice. Julius opens the

263
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,820
glove box and he has some, like, cool, like, flame striped racing gloves in there and he puts those

264
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:43,260
on. He's like, I'm good. Cal raises a huge eye at those gloves. Just one? Eyebrow. Oh,

265
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,900
I thought he pulled his eye out, raised it into the air. Cal plucks his eye out of the socket

266
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,580
and raises it up closer to the steering wheel so he can get a good peek at Julius's sweet gloves.

267
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,140
Pedal to the metal for, like, two seconds and then, like, starts going the speed limit to the farm.

268
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:07,180
You peel out into a slo-mo. Into, like, a 35-40. Into a school zone.

269
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,220
Okay, you know that the O'Carney Farm is only a few miles out of town. Just a few mile markers

270
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,260
off the highway right outside of town. You're gonna hit a country road and then head off on a

271
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:25,740
two-lane farm road that, uh, shockingly has farms on either side of it. As you head down,

272
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,860
you see that the O'Carney Farm has a bunch of trucks and cars parked on the grass up by the

273
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:38,540
house, uh, and then to the left you see a, uh, a very quiet farm. Far, far less. Is it a bio-farm?

274
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,100
Are you gonna hit me with that every time I do this?

275
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,900
Well, it doesn't make any sense because I edited out my stupidity earlier.

276
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,140
No, it's there. You make me sound like the idiot. You just sound like you're genuinely asking,

277
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,580
oh, is it a bio-farm? On the left there's a really quiet farm. There's just one pickup truck hanging

278
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,540
out there. No one's out and about currently. And then on the right you see a farm, which is,

279
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,460
yeah, the O'Carney one, but it has a bunch of cars and trucks pulled up by the house.

280
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,580
More, more cars and trucks than should be pulled up at a farmhouse?

281
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,420
Oh yeah, I'm talking 30 cars and trucks up in front of this. Sorry.

282
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:21,500
On the way here, Beck has been putting together his camera equipment and he is now filming B-Roll

283
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,340
out the window. Awesome. I don't know if I should say it every time, but he, that's one of his

284
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,980
things is he's always filming. So think of that when you think of Beck. Think of that when you

285
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:35,340
think of Beck. Julius tries to pull the van up as close as possible to like where he thinks

286
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:44,540
a farmer would be. Do you see anybody standing with a pitchfork anywhere?

287
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:52,940
It's a nice long gravel road up to this farmhouse and parked in the grass. There are like upwards

288
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:59,340
of 30, maybe even 40 cars and trucks all haphazardly parked, but nice enough to where

289
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:05,020
no one is blocking anyone else in. As you guys approach, you see that there is a folding table

290
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:13,500
to the right of the farmhouse. And there is a man who is dressed to the farmer nines standing

291
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:21,260
behind it with a metal box in front of him with the lid wide open. He is very much a farmer,

292
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:28,220
what with overalls and a big straw hat, but you also see that he is wearing a full face mask,

293
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,380
like a luchador. Is it like crazy and fancy like a luchador mask or is it like... Yeah, it's got

294
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:41,180
corn all over it. For real? Yeah, it's like a corn-based luchador. Cartoon or realistic

295
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,180
depictions of corn? Let's go cartoon. Faces or just cartoony like clipart? Oh, it's just corn.

296
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:54,460
Faces? Like corn with faces. Is it corn people? Legitimately, my question is, was it a corn with

297
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:03,740
a face and arms and legs, a corn person? Oh, fuck. No, I like the thing I said. Corn-based

298
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:09,500
luchador mask. That's dope. Lots of kernels. And as you pull up, he's giving you a nice

299
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:16,700
friendly wave. I throw it in the park and I jump out. We're with CAN Action News. I guess I don't

300
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:23,820
have to say Action News because CAN stands for City Action News. Yes, I do. See that by the name

301
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:31,740
on the side of your van. Sir, could we borrow you for about 90 seconds? Welcome to Farm Wrestling.

302
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:38,700
Come on down. It's going to be a $5 entrance for each of you to see some Farm Wrestling. I'm the

303
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:46,060
tiller, which is funny for two reasons. One, I till the ground and till my opponent into the

304
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:56,060
ground. And two, I also fill up this till here with your $5. The tiller. I turn around and look

305
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:02,380
at Beck and Cal. Guys, I heard about this in college. I didn't think it was real. Farm Wrestling.

306
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,380
Beck is balancing the camera on his shoulder and trying to reach for a wallet in the cargo pants

307
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:14,460
because he's got to get that $5 out. Cal is motioning to Beck to put his wallet away while

308
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:21,180
he's just saying, a big black bug bit a big black bear. A big black bug bit a big black bear. Wow,

309
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:30,060
you nailed those. Julius turns back around to the tiller and hands him the CAN card. Oh, yes,

310
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,540
of course. And he pulls out his cell phone and attaches a little square on the bottom of it,

311
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:41,340
swipes and is like $15. You want to add a tip for the tiller? He looks at his companions.

312
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,700
It's crazy that you handed him a business card and he ran it.

313
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,980
Oh, it was a business card. No, I meant the credit card.

314
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,620
Oh, so you and I were on the same page. Why are we paying to cover your Farm Wrestling?

315
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,540
I don't know what you're here for. I thought you wanted to watch some Farm Wrestling.

316
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:05,260
No, no tip. Yeah, no one else did either, but it's worth a shot.

317
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,340
All right, welcome and enjoy your time inside. It's right around the back there.

318
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,580
Are you the owner? No, I'm the tiller.

319
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:26,300
You want to talk to Mario, call me if you want to talk to the owner and the real farmer of this

320
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,900
here farm. As he's saying that I'm kind of elbowing you and pointing at Mario.

321
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,780
From what I've seen, it's her. She's the Okarni that I know of.

322
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:39,740
Which is an old lady with blown out and dyed hair wearing an American gladiator

323
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,700
t-shirt with the sleeves cut off. Nice.

324
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,940
She seems to be in her mid-50s, maybe up to 60s. You're not quite sure.

325
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,220
Big old shout out to Curtis from Deez Moneys,

326
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:57,580
Iowa. A patron at the $10 or up level on patreon.com slash pretending pod for suggesting

327
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,700
a backyard wrestling arena. Thank you, Curtis.

328
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,940
Ma'am, did you hear what I asked the tiller? Oh, sorry. What are you guys here for?

329
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,460
Do you have 90 seconds to talk about the farm? As this conversation is happening,

330
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,220
Beck is going to already start setting up a tripod to see if he can get a good angle

331
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,900
of her just standing here. We don't even need to go anywhere in his eyes.

332
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,220
What is this for? City Action News.

333
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:24,140
Oh, yeah. And what would you like to talk about my farm for on the news?

334
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:31,420
Well, I'd like to save the specific questions for later, but it's about the company.

335
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,940
Fucking godels. Guys, I set it up. I think this is going to be good.

336
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,820
Beck is approaching her and attaching a lapel mic to her.

337
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,980
Would you mind just saying her name and spelling it for me?

338
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:51,980
Marielle O'Carney. Marielle, M-A-R-I-E-L-O-K-E-A-R-N-E-Y. Marielle O'Carney.

339
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:58,460
And she takes a massive swig from the bottle of Jim Beam that she had in her hand.

340
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,460
Nice. And then I just attach a lapel mic to Kal, but we've done this a thousand times.

341
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,740
We don't even need to communicate.

342
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,580
Kal is combing his hair as you do that.

343
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,220
Yeah, there you go.

344
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Julius is like, thanks, ma'am, and grabs the bottle out of her hand and just kind of walks

345
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,620
inside of the camera. She accepts.

346
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,580
And like, as I'm walking off, I kind of like point her at the camera.

347
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,340
I go behind the camera and I'll do a, I'll go to you with a silently, a five, four.

348
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,820
I'm here at the O'Carney farm. Not many trains come by through.

349
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,140
Hey guys, fuck it. Let's cut it again.

350
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,180
Hold on. I'm sorry.

351
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,580
Got a piss.

352
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,180
We're doing a lot of pissing.

353
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,460
That's what we're good for here. An old P-T-B-P.

354
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,340
Stands for pissing.

355
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,820
We're, uh, we're going one at a time. I just decided that.

356
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,380
Pissing.

357
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,940
Pissing.

358
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,460
The best piss.

359
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,300
Pissing the best piss.

360
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,420
Pissing the best piss.

361
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,100
Farm wrestling.

362
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,100
That's one of the words that you use to warm up.

363
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,600
Yeah.

364
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,500
Cal, I love it too, but that's not why we're here.

365
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,580
I'm here at the old O'Carney farm.

366
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,380
Muriel O'Carney has been running this place with her family for four generations.

367
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,100
But now, thanks to changing times, she's forced to do the unthinkable.

368
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,700
She hosts violent combats on her property just to make ends meet.

369
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,540
Muriel, when did these farm wrestling matches begin?

370
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:47,020
I wanted these men to all meet each other and have a nice place to wrestle for fun.

371
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:53,260
My son, Mitch, is a big fan of wrestling and he loves his wrestling mask.

372
00:36:53,260 --> 00:37:00,540
He actually, he loves his wrestling mask so much at a young age, he started having sex with it.

373
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:06,780
And then eventually, the mask actually became pregnant and had a baby.

374
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,060
I didn't even know he was fucking his mask, but now it's apparent.

375
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,900
Cal is a professional, so he's kind of like motioning to his crew like,

376
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,980
we gotta cut all this, we gotta cut all this.

377
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,860
In the footage, you would see that the camera dips down kind of wildly when she dropped the curse word.

378
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,420
It's pointed at the ground right now.

379
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,540
She's kind of like laughing to herself and her eye is kind of like twitching a little bit.

380
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,780
You can tell that she is intoxicated, even though she's very good at holding her liquor.

381
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,980
Muriel, maybe we steer more towards the Godel company.

382
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,580
Yeah, okay.

383
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,180
The camera comes back up and he gives you another quick count in, it starts at three.

384
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,300
And ma'am, my producer didn't mention it, but you should probably watch the language.

385
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,500
Oh yes, so sorry, sir, Mr. Colorado.

386
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,020
Oh, a fan.

387
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,100
Yeah, good to see you on top still.

388
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,260
A pretty sharp pained look comes across Cal's face.

389
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,860
It's quickly replaced by a professional smile.

390
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:12,860
And he says, Muriel, many local farmers are selling out their land to the Godel company,

391
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,700
a major player in agribusiness.

392
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,860
You are one of the last holdouts in the area.

393
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,740
What keeps you here?

394
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,420
For that, I guess I'd have to walk you back if you'd like.

395
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,380
Come on back here.

396
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,260
And she kind of motions the camera and you as well toward the back of the farmhouse.

397
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,860
Beck goes ahead and takes the camera off the tripod, but he's following your guys's lead.

398
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,980
Cal Colorado is going to stay in the frame no matter what he does.

399
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,220
Come with us as we explore a vanishing lifestyle in this America.

400
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,860
As you guys pass around the back of the farmhouse, you see that there is a tarp

401
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:52,300
strewn over the back door as a makeshift tunnel for wrestlers to make their entrances.

402
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:59,900
And there is a farm DIY wrestling ring set up right near this tarped tunnel

403
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:08,940
in which there is a wrestler dressed as a crab, also wearing a luchador mask with the sign of,

404
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,300
I don't know, the cancer sign for...

405
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,740
Which one's the 69?

406
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,540
That's the one.

407
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,860
He's got a big old 69 on his face, I guess.

408
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,500
Gemini, right?

409
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,220
Oh, wait, what?

410
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,260
I thought that was the crab.

411
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,860
Well, one's his moon, one's his son.

412
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,220
Oh, I hate it.

413
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,540
I don't know what any of it is.

414
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,140
Yeah, cancer is the 69.

415
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,620
Oh, nice.

416
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,420
Yeah, cut me out.

417
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:36,380
So on the mask, the 69 is around the two eyes, but besides that, fully dressed as a crab,

418
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,540
even including claws on his hands.

419
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:43,420
The other wrestler is extremely patriotic, just stars and stripes all the way through.

420
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:50,220
And she leads you back there and she yells out to this crowd of 50 to 80 people.

421
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,980
What do you guys think about the Godel company?

422
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,900
The entire crowd turns and looks at Mariel with reverence.

423
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,980
They all start chanting.

424
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,020
Fuck Fred Godel!

425
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,620
Fuck Fred Godel!

426
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,980
Fuck Fred Godel!

427
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,740
I'm looking at Beck and I'm like, stoked, just stoked.

428
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,420
Beck is doing a panning shot of all the crowd.

429
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,860
And then toward the end of the panning shot, he's getting really up close to one of the

430
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:30,300
more vehement, sweaty, spittle, coming out of the mouth shots of a person who's just

431
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,900
red-faced and angry yelling this.

432
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,380
Oh, yeah.

433
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:39,020
And she's got pigtails on the top of her head on either side, and she's just screaming

434
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,420
into the camera, Fuck Fred Godel!

435
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,380
So I would say that's what I think about the Godel company.

436
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,220
Powerful words.

437
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,740
Beck hears that she is now talking again on his headphones, that he's always got around

438
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,660
his neck at the least, but they're on his ears at this point.

439
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,780
So he whips back around to get her in frame with Cal.

440
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,700
What do you think about that, Cal?

441
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,260
I'm not paid to think, ma'am.

442
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,540
I'm paid to report.

443
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,780
Well, did we give you what you need?

444
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,060
Oh shit, 90 seconds.

445
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,980
Wrap it up, wrap it up.

446
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:16,860
No, very little of what you presented to us here today is usable or fit for network television.

447
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,420
Did you pay?

448
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,700
Yes.

449
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,260
Well, you're free to stick around if you want to.

450
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,420
And she walks back to the wrestling ring.

451
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,860
The camera more focuses on you and starts to zoom a little.

452
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,820
A confusing scene here in the countryside outside the city, at once a mix of vibrant

453
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,100
folk culture.

454
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,220
Where does he want to go with this?

455
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,780
I mean, you don't have a teleprompter here.

456
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,620
So give me some outlines so I can script some of these in advance.

457
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,860
What we're going to be doing.

458
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,660
If I'm being honest, I had no idea this was going to happen.

459
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,580
Oh, you didn't know we were going to farm wrestling?

460
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,860
No, I knew you were going to farm wrestling.

461
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,780
I had no idea they were going to be so abrasive.

462
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,820
That was your call.

463
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,620
Yeah, it felt right.

464
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,380
Doesn't mean I planned it.

465
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,140
Anything for it.

466
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,500
You guys are going to be a news crew and you're going to go and interview people, but they

467
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,460
don't want to be interviewed.

468
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,700
That actually, that actually is what, what Cal addresses.

469
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:18,220
He, he motions to Beck to like put the camera down and he, he approaches like Muriel without

470
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:18,940
the microphone.

471
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,740
Ma'am, you have an opportunity to get your side of the story out today.

472
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:31,100
Now, so far with the profanity and well, frankly, a lot of those men are covered in blood.

473
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,940
We can't show that on our family network.

474
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,980
Do you want to give us something we can use?

475
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,580
She sighs and I'd like you to roll persuade.

476
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,100
First roll.

477
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,180
First roll of the second season.

478
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,660
It's an 86.

479
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,740
He has an 80 persuade, but he doesn't quite make it.

480
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,580
Well, let's talk about luck real quick.

481
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:03,420
I have given you each a one point of luck to start this campaign with.

482
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,980
And when I say point, I mean that you have luck.

483
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,700
We are doing luck in a slightly different way than we've played in the past.

484
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,820
So it might take us a little bit to remember it all, but you either have luck in this game

485
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,060
or you do not have luck in this game.

486
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:24,860
If you do have luck, then when you roll after you've rolled, if you would like to use your

487
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,820
luck, you can switch your tens dice and your what's the other one called?

488
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,540
Hundreds.

489
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,620
No, single single.

490
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,260
Singles.

491
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,380
Your ones dice.

492
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,580
You can switch the tens and the singles dice in order to perhaps create a success.

493
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:47,020
In this situation, the 86 would indeed turn into a 68 and that would lend itself to a success.

494
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:53,180
Also, I will be giving luck for sweet character play and moments.

495
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,660
Please ask me for luck if I don't give it to you.

496
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,300
And the kissing thing, right?

497
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,580
You told us about the kissing thing.

498
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,900
That if we gave you a kiss after the session, you'd give us our luck back.

499
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,580
And what did I say about that kiss, Joe?

500
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,300
It had to be good.

501
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,540
It had to be sweet.

502
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,100
Tonguey.

503
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,940
He said sweet like cherry pie, I think.

504
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:23,500
So that's a pretty easy way to do it.

505
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,740
I was banking on that because I did that anyway.

506
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,500
I had a garlicky breakfast.

507
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,780
It's unfortunate you did that, Joe, because you did already have the luck starting out.

508
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,820
So just think of it as practice.

509
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,340
A wasted sweet little kiss.

510
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,220
It wasn't wasted on me.

511
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,700
I'm going to spend that luck, turn that into a 68.

512
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:50,940
As Cal sees his words fall flat, he just gives her a huge wink with his piercing blue eyes.

513
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,940
The animal magnetism switches something in her brain.

514
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,220
That's the Cal I know.

515
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,500
Cal can be on top.

516
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,860
And she looks up at you.

517
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,360
Again.

518
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,340
Damn it, Cal.

519
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,700
I miss you being the anchor, Cam.

520
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,380
I do too, Mrs. O'Carney.

521
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,820
All right, well, let's go over here with a nice shot of the farm in the background

522
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,220
and say something nice for the people, huh?

523
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,660
I would surely appreciate that.

524
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,060
Beck follows her lead and he notices that she's got a good eye for what is pretty on her farm.

525
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,940
She set herself up in a good spot with rolling fields behind her.

526
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,940
The edge of the farmhouse is there to get a sense of perspective.

527
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,340
She set up a nice shot and I follow her lead.

528
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,660
The corn is swaying in the breeze.

529
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,940
Crabs are walking by.

530
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,780
It's a corn and crab farm.

531
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:43,840
Right.

532
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,940
That's why the wrestlers were corn and crab guys.

533
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,500
I'm not selling my damn farm to no Godel.

534
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,860
All right, let's do this.

535
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,060
Mariel O'Carney.

536
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,620
This farm has been in your family for four generations.

537
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,420
The Godel company has been purchasing many of your neighbor's properties.

538
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,260
You are the last holdout in the area.

539
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,020
What keeps you here?

540
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,580
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Cal.

541
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:17,660
I don't appreciate someone who has been given everything that they have coming in

542
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:25,820
and trying to use that privilege to buy up what is rightfully mine

543
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:30,140
and has been, like you said, in my family for four generations.

544
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,340
I am not going to sell to Fred Godel because I do not trust him.

545
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,060
I think he is a snake of a businessman

546
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,180
and I think he is bad for both the economy and the world at large.

547
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,460
Kind of leans in and he's like,

548
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,420
could you just say the Godel corporation instead of Frank Godel?

549
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,980
Well, Frank is Fred's dad who actually put in the work.

550
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,500
I would respect it if Frank was around,

551
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,140
but he's no longer mentally capable to run the Godel company,

552
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,180
which is why his idiot son has taken over.

553
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,700
Sorry, I'll do that again.

554
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,780
I don't want to sell my land to the Godel company

555
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,700
because they are ruining America.

556
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,260
As she stares straight down the camera.

557
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,620
How are they ruining America?

558
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,580
In my opinion, they are taking the ability to make a living for oneself

559
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:30,860
out of the hands of those of us who have been doing the living for ourselves for generations

560
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,780
and feeding America.

561
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:38,300
Are you comfortable, Cal, with one person being in charge of feeding America?

562
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,740
Julius is doing the wrap this up, don't answer that.

563
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,500
No, Cal was never going to answer that.

564
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,860
Are you dodging the question, Cal?

565
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,620
Are you not here for the truth?

566
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,180
Ma'am, I am only here for the truth,

567
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,140
but I'm not the one who answers the questions.

568
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,300
I ask the questions and the people seem to think I do a pretty good job.

569
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,780
Can I ask you a question?

570
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,420
Yeah, Colorado, you can ask me a question.

571
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,740
Hold on, I got to think of a question now.

572
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,660
I was going to mention, ask her opinion on her neighbors selling their land.

573
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,100
Does she fault them for it?

574
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,060
Great question.

575
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,340
And maybe even why she thinks that they sold, that kind of thing.

576
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:17,840
Yeah.

577
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,820
Do you fault your neighbors who have already sold to the Godel company?

578
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,460
Good question.

579
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:26,860
Hey, thanks, Zach.

580
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:32,780
No, unfortunately I don't.

581
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,860
It's none of my business.

582
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,340
They can do with their land what they want to do.

583
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,420
I'm going to do it my land, what I want to do.

584
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,620
Are any of them here today?

585
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:41,840
Yeah.

586
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,820
And she points over at one of the guys watching the match.

587
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,340
He's just dressed in like super normal clothes.

588
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,540
He's car hearted out.

589
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,020
That's a typhus.

590
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,100
We already have typhus.

591
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,060
Oh, sorry.

592
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,940
Typhoid barge.

593
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,540
We're playing Star Wars, right?

594
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,040
Exactly.

595
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,660
Typhoid barge.

596
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,620
Such a good Star Wars name.

597
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,180
That's great.

598
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,260
Cholera candlestick.

599
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,740
Yeah, there's a...

600
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,700
That's the lupus mcmanus.

601
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,740
It's never lupus.

602
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,580
Well, Jesse's over there.

603
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,220
He sold the lemon farm like a week ago.

604
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,020
Muriel, is there anything else you want the people to know?

605
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,520
No.

606
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:34,940
You are doing the wrap up thing you were saying earlier and Beck is doing the stretch out thing.

607
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,060
Like kneading dough above your head.

608
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,060
Pulling it out, pulling it outward.

609
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,420
Oh yeah, that's not kneading.

610
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,740
Julius goes around you to not get in the shot,

611
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,500
but he goes over and is going to go talk to Mr. Lemon.

612
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,220
Nice.

613
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,420
As Julius Summers approaches, Jesse, Lemon.

614
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:02,060
Wow, you'd go just not far outside the city and people get real country.

615
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,500
Real fucking over the top.

616
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,900
We're just over the train tracks.

617
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,620
Did you hear that tiller guy?

618
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:16,060
That tiller guy sounds like he fucking lives in the swamps in Louisiana.

619
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,620
One of those contention hicks.

620
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,220
As you guys are like making your way around,

621
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,100
you hear him talking in his normal voice to someone.

622
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,820
So anyway, I am called the tiller because not only do I till my soil,

623
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,340
but I also control the till.

624
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,060
Succinctly said.

625
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,380
To which Jesse Lemon's response.

626
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,980
You sure do control the shit out of that till tiller.

627
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:47,740
Yee-haw.

628
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:48,540
Do you touch him?

629
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:49,500
Sorry.

630
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,180
That's a leading question.

631
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,020
How do you approach Jesse Lemon?

632
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:00,780
Do you touch him?

633
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,500
Do you touch him?

634
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,100
Objection.

635
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:04,860
Leading the win.

636
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,860
As you caress the small of his back.

637
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,420
You walk up behind him and blow on his neck.

638
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,700
Big circle, little circle, question mark dot.

639
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:17,980
Open up.

640
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,100
Did you guys ever do that?

641
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,340
Was it make the chills happen on the back of somebody?

642
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,020
Carry on Luke.

643
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,340
I didn't know if that was like your alphabet trick for eating pussy.

644
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,900
Big circle, little circle, question mark dot.

645
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,380
Julius walks up to Jesse Lemon.

646
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,180
He tries to whistle, but he can't.

647
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:46,380
Julius is like super intrigued by the like wrestling match.

648
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,820
So he walks up to Lemon and what are these guys' names?

649
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,100
We got miss cap and crustacean down there.

650
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,060
And cousin Sam.

651
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,020
And cousin Sam.

652
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,660
We got cap and crustacean versus cousin Sam.

653
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,740
Sir, what do you like to be on TV?

654
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,660
Oh, about what now?

655
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,020
I hear that you recently came in to a lot of money.

656
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,100
And that's what you would like to talk to me about?

657
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,980
Well, specifically, the decision to do that.

658
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,900
I said a lot of money.

659
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,260
What do I need to tell you about?

660
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,540
I made a lot of money.

661
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,940
Cal will be asking you some questions.

662
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,860
Cal reaches out and spits you with a shake.

663
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,100
Cal Coran!

664
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,700
And he spits in his hand and then shakes with his other one.

665
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,300
He spits in his left hand and shakes you with his right hand like a normal person.

666
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,900
Cal gamely spits in his left hand and shakes.

667
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,820
Yeah, that's sick!

668
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,460
Because he's got the personal touch.

669
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,780
Beck has got the camera set up and he's lapeled you.

670
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,820
And if I could just get you to say and spell your name, please.

671
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:53,260
Yeah, that's right, J-C-D-E-A-J-C, Lemon, spelled like a fruit.

672
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,180
I like to think that the background is literally just the wrestling ring.

673
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:57,980
Oh, yeah.

674
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,020
Yeah, that's good.

675
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,860
He's already looking at the camera and he's like,

676
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:07,580
I sold all my property for a whole lot of money.

677
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,100
To the God Company!

678
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,300
Thank you, God Company!

679
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,540
Beck, after he lets him finish and then says to him,

680
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,500
if you'll address your questions to Cal there,

681
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,180
he's the one that's going to be talking to you.

682
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,620
You don't have to look down the barrel.

683
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,140
Okay, before we start, making sure everybody's ready.

684
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,100
Headphones on.

685
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,580
Beck is momentarily like, fuck, do I have them on?

686
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,780
And he goes and pats, yeah, we're good to go.

687
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,260
Okay.

688
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:37,100
Immediately, you see Jesse has a streak of terror run through

689
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,860
his entire body, his face goes pale and he starts sweating

690
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:47,100
as he's just staring at the headphones that are on the ears of Beck Wilder.

691
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,860
Why did I bring up the headphones?

692
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:55,820
Beck goes to swat at him, do I got something on me?

693
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,740
Hey, bro, tell me what's going on.

694
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,900
Every time you're touching him, he's just kind of like squirming as he's standing.

695
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,820
It's like a physical reaction.

696
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,380
Beck takes him fully off to look at him.

697
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,940
As you're holding him closer, he backs up.

698
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,900
Beck notes that and he just slowly puts them back onto his head

699
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,820
and then does hands up like they're done.

700
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:25,100
You see in Jesse's eyes that he is not aware of the terror that just struck across him.

701
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:30,540
And he looks at Cal and he says, are you ready for an interview or what are we doing here?

702
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,500
Mr. Lemon, do you have some issue with our equipment?

703
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,180
Which part of the equipment?

704
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,780
Beck's headphones?

705
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:41,660
As you say the word headphones, he shudders to the point where he almost falls over

706
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,900
and is like, wow, sorry about that.

707
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,900
Yeah, Cal reaches out to steady him.

708
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,940
I've been having a bit of drinking today, having some fun.

709
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,660
It's Saturday afternoon straw.

710
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,420
Can I human this reaction?

711
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:53,980
Yeah, of course.

712
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,780
64, which is a pass.

713
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,980
It's a pass because you rolled under your skill of?

714
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,460
70.

715
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,260
Fantastic.

716
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:08,140
And so as you pass, you see that there is a pure unconscious terror in this man

717
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:13,660
directed toward headphones for some reason that he is not seemingly aware of.

718
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,700
Yeah, well, we've all been there.

719
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,100
Mine do have demon faces painted on the sides.

720
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,580
Mr. Lemon.

721
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,620
Name's Jesse.

722
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,980
Thank you so much for having me.

723
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,700
Tell us if you would, why you sold to the Godel company?

724
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:35,740
Well, you offer me a lot of money and you don't see a Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos

725
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,300
or a Fred Godel around very often.

726
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,940
Now, do you?

727
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,100
When it came to my property and made me do, I couldn't quite refuse you.

728
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,060
Not good at that.

729
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,740
What sort of deal did you make?

730
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,060
Well, you offered me a whole lot of money.

731
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:52,140
Not going to tell you how exactly much, but enough to where I was ready to sell pretty

732
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,340
much merely.

733
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,500
Between you and me, Mr. Lemon.

734
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,700
How much money was it?

735
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,220
Well over what it is worth, in my opinion.

736
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,620
Was it well over what it was worth in a real estate assessor's opinion?

737
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,380
My goodness, you are a very prickly fellow, are you not?

738
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,060
When it comes to money, I will tell you.

739
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,980
You seem like a nice man, I'll just tell you.

740
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:17,820
My farm is roughly estimated to be worth about 1.2 million dollars.

741
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,500
This man came into my own home and offered me 2.5.

742
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,100
A generous offer to be sure.

743
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:27,580
Indeed, it's enough for me to live off of for the rest of my life.

744
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,020
If you invested wisely.

745
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,060
Well, I doubt that.

746
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:33,900
Fair enough, Mr. Lemon.

747
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,980
My money don't go in no bank, my money don't go in no crypto.

748
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,740
My money stays right with me.

749
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,660
Julius Summers is trying to imagine how many jet skis this guy has bought.

750
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,060
Is Julius Summers also thinking about how much crypto he could buy?

751
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,900
2.5 million?

752
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,340
And it's way more than he currently owns, which is still a lot.

753
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,700
This is June 18th, it's not the past.

754
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,260
Crypto is crashing right now.

755
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:03,340
Right, he has deleted his crypto app off of his phone so that he doesn't look at it.

756
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,140
Oh, is that a little...

757
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,420
That's actually Luke.

758
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,820
Is that a Luke detail?

759
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:13,660
I diversify my portfolio across my pockets.

760
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,300
Well, that is a folksy if impractical method.

761
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,940
Do we have anything else we want to ask this guy?

762
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:24,140
Does he have to leave or are they paying him to maintain the land now?

763
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,500
As surfs.

764
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,380
Mr. Lemon, what does the Godel company want with your land?

765
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,380
Are you still on it or have you moved?

766
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,580
He gave me about a month to get everything cleaned up.

767
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,700
You see, I'm right over there.

768
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,300
He points across the street where his old pickup truck is the only thing seen on his property.

769
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,380
He's like, yeah, I'm just literally right there.

770
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,980
So I'm just selling off all my equipment.

771
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,540
They said they didn't want none of it, they just want the land.

772
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:55,420
So I'm just selling everything else off and then I'm going to take off to who knows where, maybe Greece.

773
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,620
Is there anything growing on the Lemon farm right now?

774
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:58,860
No.

775
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,740
No, it's not a crab in corn form.

776
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:02,700
Damn.

777
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:10,460
One of the crab tanks is broken and some of our carnies crabs are scuttling across the road.

778
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,340
Some of them make it.

779
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,860
Some of them frogger.

780
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:18,620
Jesse Lemon's off to explore Greece.

781
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:24,700
The Godel company gave me myself lemon and I'm going to go to Greece and make lemonade.

782
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,260
That was rad.

783
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,220
Bec's giving you like enthusiastic thumbs up.

784
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,020
Yeah, Julius is doing the like, that was perfect.

785
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:35,900
Cal is stoked that he said that and just says, Mr. Lemon, enjoy the wrestling.

786
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,420
Cal, Colorado reporting from Okarni Farm.

787
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,460
And we're out.

788
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:56,220
Do you think you can edit that to 90 seconds?

789
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:26,620
Jesse Lemon, how do you eat pussy?

790
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,260
Question Mark Dye puts a little baby in a spiral.

791
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:35,660
And I'm a big fan of Kendrick Lamar.

792
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,380
Question Mark Dye puts baby in a spiral.

793
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:44,220
Now all that pussy talk has to stay in.

794
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,340
Not all of it.

795
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,460
Just a taste.
