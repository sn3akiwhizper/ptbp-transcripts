1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Welcome y'all to the most rip-roaring radio show in contention.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,020
It's your friendly neighborhood DJ, Wolf the dog.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,800
We are broadcasting live and uncut from 694.2 PTBP.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,760
Welcome to one of only two segments on this show, Howlin' with Wolf.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,040
This listener wrote, hey Wolf, just wanna give a shout out to all my amazing DM Joe

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,320
and my swashbuckling comrades Opus, Dick Buggsley and Wingapo.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,480
We have survived pirates, shark people and hurricanes raining blood and I wouldn't have

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,920
wanted to go through it with anyone else.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,360
Thanks for a great adventure, love Blythe.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,240
You know, that was real sweet, except for that part about shark people and bloody precipitation.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,240
That sounds nasty, Wolf the dog kinda nasty.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,360
Your old buddy Wolf wants to hear all about your nasty, go ahead and submit a 5 star review

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,100
on your podcast app, screenshot that shit and send it to us or tag us on social media

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,960
at pretendingpod on instagram and twitter, pretending to be people of facebook.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,560
Now speaking of blood filled hurricanes, I'm about to make it rain some news on y'all.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,800
Officers Bishop and Pettymore headed to the suburbs to chat with Dr. Marie Jacobs when

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,040
they saw an unkempt man frantically vacuuming his lawn.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,560
There are two more paragraphs here but they have been crossed out with a very, very thick

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
sharpie.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,720
Our brave and heroic contingent police officer Keith Vigna was made unconscious by Billy

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,240
Harrison, the man found tied up in the trunk of Charles Donovan, the drunk who threatened

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,000
the woman at Forgotten Treasures.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,840
Both of these cats have told officers that they are friends of John Peters.

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,160
Now speaking of cats, Dr. Marie Jacobs seems to be up to no good y'all.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,240
Officers Bishop and Pettymore found man sized fecal matter in the litter box and then doctor

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,440
yelled Salem, prompting something to begin running up the stairs from the basement.

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,720
Y'all ever take a shit in your cat's litter box?

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:59,440
Keith, you wake up wearing a thin gown and both of your wrists have been handcuffed to

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,880
the sides of the hospital bed that you are in.

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,120
Billy Harrison, your uniform and your gear are nowhere to be seen.

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,520
However, the door to this room is now open and a decent amount of the clinic staff is

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,720
standing around outside it.

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,960
Some of them are pointing their phones at you.

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,280
All of them are laughing.

35
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,520
Some more subtly than others, you overhear a few phrases like, no wonder William was

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,240
so embarrassed by him and oh, isn't that, isn't that Keith Beans?

37
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,300
What's he calling himself now?

38
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,920
And they notice you wake up and awkwardly shuffle about as a young woman comes into

39
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,360
the room with bolt cutters and breaks the links on your cuffs, leaving you with a pair

40
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,760
of nice iron bracelets.

41
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,240
And she says, ignore them, a bunch of gossip hounds.

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,520
Are you okay?

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,960
What the hell happened?

44
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,720
We're not entirely sure.

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,960
It seems that you may have been unconscious for, for some time.

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,360
Have you found, where's Billy Harrison at?

47
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,480
The man that you came in with is no longer here.

48
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
No one has seen him.

49
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,040
Well, I gotta, I gotta get going.

50
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Okay.

51
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,440
I want to see if I can see security footage to see where he went off to or how he got away.

52
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,640
You can go check and she'll take you to go look at the security footage in the clinic

53
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,400
and they really just have like a couple cameras in the lobby.

54
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Oh yeah.

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,600
We were at the clinic and not the hospital, right?

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Correct.

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
You're at the clinic in contention.

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,800
The footage shows Billy Harrison in your uniform, just walking out the front door.

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Okay.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,160
Well, the guys are not going to be happy about this one.

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,360
As you, as you, as you, uh, as you get to the front door, it is rather dark outside.

62
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,400
What time did we get here?

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,620
Early evening.

64
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,640
So it's been like a couple hours or an hour or?

65
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,360
I would say, yeah, I mean you came in and you waited around for a while for his results

66
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,160
and for him to come to.

67
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,600
And he had had a concussion.

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Is that right?

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Yes.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Hmm.

71
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
I rode here in the ambulance, didn't I?

72
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Correct.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,040
So I'm going to have to radio the guys to come get me.

74
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
I think.

75
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Okay.

76
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Yeah.

77
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
That sounds good.

78
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,880
Okay.

79
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,440
John had just finished getting handcuffs on Dr. Marie Jacobs when she hollered, and you

80
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,040
heard something glumping up the stairs from the basement.

81
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,120
What do you do?

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,400
If I just hear footsteps going up the stairs, I'm just looking down the stairs.

83
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,800
Clark, you've got your hand keeping the basement door open and you lean your head back to look

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,600
down the stairs and you see a man with blood pouring down his face onto his chest from

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,080
a seemingly broken nose.

86
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:02,400
He is wearing a pair of novelty boxer briefs featuring Pepe Le Pew and a black collar around

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
his neck.

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:11,800
And he is on all fours making his way up the stairs at a rapid pace.

89
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,800
John.

90
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,560
I guess I draw my gun.

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,920
And yell, stop right there.

92
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Same.

93
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,320
I mean, as soon as I would see it.

94
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Okay.

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,680
So, Clark, he is going to jump at you.

96
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,240
He is like raising up onto his hind legs.

97
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,620
Any visible claws?

98
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,360
No claws, just hands.

99
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,120
And he is, it looks like he's pouncing on you.

100
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,080
I want to get away from that.

101
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,680
So are you going to try to get away or how are you handling the situation?

102
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,760
I would like to dodge out of the way.

103
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
All right.

104
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Sounds good.

105
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,000
Against his unarmed combat.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
Passed 24 on a 50.

107
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Okay.

108
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,480
He passed 40 on a something.

109
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:07,200
So he is going to, he actually, he rolled pounce.

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,120
And so John, you actually see right next to you, this man takes Clark to the ground with

111
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,400
his hands on Clark's shoulders.

112
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Huh?

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
What the fuck?

114
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,640
And it is John's action.

115
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Jesus.

116
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,520
What do you do?

117
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,880
I, uh, what is Marie doing?

118
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
She's just handcuffed.

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Correct.

120
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,640
She is not doing anything right now because it's your turn.

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Okay.

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,400
I just yell, get off him.

123
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,880
Come on, come on Salem.

124
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Get off.

125
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Fuck man.

126
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
I don't know what to do in a cat man situation.

127
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,120
Uh, I want to try to like kick him off.

128
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Okay.

129
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Get out of here.

130
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Get out of here.

131
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Get.

132
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Get.

133
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,360
Roll unarmed combat to kick him off.

134
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,440
Can I roll strength?

135
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,440
If you, if you're trying to kick him, if you want to roll strength, that would be like

136
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,520
trying to grab and like, I'm trying to push him with my leg muscles.

137
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Okay.

138
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,040
I mean, an arm's fine.

139
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Neither one is great.

140
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Ooh.

141
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,440
Pass 32 on a 40.

142
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Nice.

143
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Yeah.

144
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
He's distracted right now.

145
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,480
And so you put your foot where on his body?

146
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,640
Like wherever I think I'm going to get the most leverage, like center mass, like right

147
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,480
above his hip, you just like chest area, just trying to like, but I feel like I'm coming

148
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
at him from the side.

149
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Right?

150
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Yeah.

151
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
It's just a solid like rib like.

152
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Yeah.

153
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Right in the ribs.

154
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,080
And you, uh, you, you, you hoist him off of Clark.

155
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,280
Does he not seem to recognize that he has like a gun pointed at him?

156
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Like no.

157
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Okay.

158
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,760
So he's pretty full cat man.

159
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,040
And immediately Maria Marie says, don't, don't hurt him.

160
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Don't hurt him.

161
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Clark.

162
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
It is your turn.

163
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,680
Uh, we saw pictures earlier of her and her husband and the cat.

164
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
That is correct.

165
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
Does this guy look like the husband?

166
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
This is Doug Jacobs.

167
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Okay.

168
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,800
So say Salem, Doug is laying on the ground now.

169
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Yes.

170
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,320
He has a, he has fallen over on his side and he just lays there and puts his hand on your

171
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
face

172
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,920
rub his belly.

173
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,720
I want to try and cuff him.

174
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Okay.

175
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Roll law or dexterity.

176
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,000
They happen to be the same.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh fun.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,040
38 on a 60.

179
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Okay.

180
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,320
You reach out and throw a cuff on the hand that has reached out for your face and you

181
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,400
can pretty easily get his other hand cuffed as well.

182
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Nice.

183
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Behind or in front?

184
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I would like behind.

185
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Okay.

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,680
So you just kind of do a maneuver and roll over on him and handcuff him.

187
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,480
So now you are on top of him and he is face down on the ground and he's just kind of laying

188
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
there.

189
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
He's not worried about it.

190
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
He seems domesticated.

191
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Clark.

192
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,000
Dr. Jacobs, do you want to tell us what the hell is going on here?

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,560
Why is your husband a cat man named Salem?

194
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,080
Oh, so you know that's what's going on here.

195
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,560
Do you want to describe the process?

196
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,800
Go ahead and roll sanity for me real quick.

197
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Both of you.

198
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Oh, 95.

199
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
92.

200
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
92.

201
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
92.

202
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
All right.

203
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
You both lose one.

204
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm at 42 now.

205
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm at 43.

206
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,640
I want to roll Doug over on so that he's looking at me.

207
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,920
Hey, Salem, Doug, can you hear me?

208
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
In English?

209
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,880
He doesn't speak English.

210
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
He's a cat.

211
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,560
How long has he been a cat?

212
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Couple days.

213
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,360
Okay.

214
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,000
How did he become a cat?

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,440
Why am I?

216
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,020
Ma'am, this is all kinds of illegal.

217
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,380
I don't think there's anything on the books.

218
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,620
You can't have cat golems.

219
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,620
It's not a golem.

220
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,620
It's...

221
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,860
Listen, lady, whatever the hell this is, you can't have, okay?

222
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
I didn't ask for this.

223
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,980
This belongs in a science lab or something.

224
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,860
You can't just take away my cat because he happens to be taking the place inside the

225
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,060
body of my husband.

226
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,300
Oh.

227
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,040
It's a regular old Salem in the body thing.

228
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
It's a freaky Friday?

229
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
It's a freaky Friday.

230
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,100
Did your husband get freaky Frid- Doctor, I'm sorry.

231
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,560
Did your husband get freaky Friday-ed?

232
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Which one?

233
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,080
The Jimmy Lee Curtis.

234
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Oh.

235
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,080
Yes.

236
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,280
How did your husband get freaky Friday-ed?

237
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,640
I'm not positive, but it happened when I got the radio.

238
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,680
Interesting.

239
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,640
You didn't think this was something you needed to tell anybody?

240
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,760
I have personal reasons for being fine with the current situation.

241
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:49,840
You know what, man?

242
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,080
I think we needed that.

243
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,520
I think we can all understand that a little bit.

244
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,760
Is your husband in Salem?

245
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,080
Where's the cat boy?

246
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Doug ran out of here almost immediately.

247
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:10,640
It's not that he was a- Doug was not a very good man or a good husband.

248
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,560
I was fine to be rid of him.

249
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,360
If he wants to wander the streets as a kitty cat, that is totally fine by me.

250
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,760
I don't think this concerns the police, honestly.

251
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,920
You know, I can't tell you exactly how, but I am certain 100% this concerns the police.

252
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,520
I just don't see it.

253
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,960
There's a lot that feels illegal here, but you're right, I can't exactly put my finger

254
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
on it.

255
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
If only Maggie were here.

256
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,080
I haven't been able to find any statute on the books.

257
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,040
So you've been looking into, you had a suspicion, maybe this wasn't right.

258
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,880
You've been checking your P's and Q's here?

259
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,240
I quit Google search.

260
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,280
Hey doctor, why is Doug man cat, cat man Doug, nose bleedin'?

261
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Oh, that tall awful man punched him in the face.

262
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,040
I thought it was very rude.

263
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,280
When he stole your radio?

264
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Yes!

265
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,360
He was very aggressive, and Salem tried to protect me, thankfully he didn't shoot him.

266
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,600
He follows instruction really well, you know, we could maybe use something like this on

267
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
the force.

268
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,880
This is my cat, and I'm not going to give him to the contention police department just

269
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,480
because he's a giant man now.

270
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,160
I mean he's a regular, he's a tall man, he's not, you know, giant per se, but...

271
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,260
It's gonna take scientists and philosophers decades to figure out what this is.

272
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,380
This is not your cat.

273
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:37,340
I would personally appreciate it if we didn't go to scientists or authorities above yourselves.

274
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,060
On this matter, if you could just leave me be, I don't see an issue here.

275
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,140
Clark, you want to talk a minute?

276
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,380
Me and you, yeah.

277
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,020
We've garnered the information that the radio is not here anymore, that maybe our drunk

278
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,540
Charlie guy took it.

279
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,160
Right, and the lead we have on him is falling up on his hotel room, where maybe all this

280
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,820
stuff might be waiting for us.

281
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:03,460
John would be open to, like, John would just be like, oh, if you want this not talked about,

282
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,460
what's in it for me?

283
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,260
I don't, Clark wouldn't though, right?

284
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
Probably?

285
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,260
No.

286
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
Yeah.

287
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,180
But Clark is also a little insane and doesn't know, like, we real quick were happy with

288
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,280
the Freaky Friday explanation, which I'm cool with, but so I don't know where to take him

289
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,780
from here.

290
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,500
He can still, I mean, he can, he could have not processed anything yet.

291
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,460
He might just in the moment like, uh-huh, yeah, okay.

292
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,180
Yeah, but this still leaves us, where do we go?

293
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,180
Where do we go?

294
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,180
Yeah.

295
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
We've got to secure this cat man somehow.

296
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,180
Thanks.

297
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,180
God damn it.

298
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,620
Do we take a cat man in?

299
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,180
I think we should take them both in because it would be hilarious to have them in a jail cell.

300
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,180
Yeah, let's do that.

301
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,160
Ma'am, um, I'm really sorry to tell you this, but we're going to have to take you and Doug

302
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Salem in for further questioning.

303
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Just Salem?

304
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,660
Well, again, the theological, the biological.

305
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,860
Salem?

306
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,860
In Doug's body.

307
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,860
In Doug's body, yeah.

308
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,860
Eh.

309
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,540
This is your cat in spirit and his mind has inhabited your husband's body.

310
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,660
Our vessels matter very little to me.

311
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,660
Well, I don't know if they do to the law is the thing.

312
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,320
In fact, most of our laws are about the harming of those vessels.

313
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,460
This seems like harm.

314
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,100
Yeah, he's a victim.

315
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,980
Go catch, uh, go catch that drunk man.

316
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,980
Yeah.

317
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,360
Do we, I don't know if we need to take them like taking them in would be handy for us

318
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,980
if we need to ask him or anything, anything more, but also just, I think it would be hilarious.

319
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,980
Yeah.

320
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,020
Doctor, uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to take you down to the station for 24 hours,

321
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,880
48 maybe, uh, ask you a few more questions and what are you going to do?

322
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,140
Put this on the books.

323
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,500
Who's going to believe you?

324
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,220
You're all going to be fired immediately.

325
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,660
Actually, ma'am, uh, there is a bit of an, uh, managerial crisis at the police station

326
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,660
right now.

327
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,060
We don't have a whole lot of supervision at the moment, so I think for 48 hours we can,

328
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,420
uh, get some more out of you.

329
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,680
Well, I think that's genuinely horrifying.

330
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,600
I think your cat husband is genuinely horrifying.

331
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,380
I think he's rather cute.

332
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
He's also that.

333
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,860
Uh, does Salem have any, uh, toys he particularly likes?

334
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,100
Clark, he's a perp.

335
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,140
I just figured we'd have to get him in the car somehow.

336
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,500
This is a man who literally just tackled a police officer.

337
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,740
She kind of steps over to the side and reaches behind her back onto the couch.

338
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

339
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Oh, sorry, sorry.

340
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,340
This is his favorite toy.

341
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,660
Well, why don't you, uh, stand on up and direct us to the toy?

342
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
Okay.

343
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
It's right here.

344
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,660
And she kind of points with her chin down at a, uh, it's just a long string cat tail

345
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,860
kind of thing that Salem immediately perks up at.

346
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,980
I go and grab it.

347
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,420
He's on the ground and he's handcuffed behind his back, but he is shuffling kind of over

348
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,600
to you and nipping with his mouth at the end of the cat toy.

349
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
That's real unsettling.

350
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,420
And there's blood everywhere, all over his chest and it's dried and it's all over his

351
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,420
mouth.

352
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,020
You know, at the very least, he needs some medical attention, which he's not getting

353
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,020
them.

354
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
Yeah.

355
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,140
I start using the cat toy to lead him into the back of my car.

356
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,540
Here Salem, uh, get the, get the mousy.

357
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,540
Come on.

358
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
Follow me.

359
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,540
Meow.

360
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,540
Meow.

361
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,540
Meow.

362
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,140
I lead them all the way outside to the back of my car and throw the toy in.

363
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,860
Dr. Marie Jacobs will reluctantly follow.

364
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,980
She's laughing to herself the entire time she walks to the cruiser.

365
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,140
As well as she should.

366
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:43,720
And once you guys get out to the cruiser, you get a call from Keith Vigna on your cell

367
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:53,100
phone.

368
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Welcome back everybody.

369
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Do we start?

370
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
He didn't say one.

371
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Oh shit.

372
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Yeah.

373
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Start over.

374
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Okay.

375
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Sorry.

376
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Three, two.

377
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Welcome back everybody.

378
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Did he?

379
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
He didn't say it.

380
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
We got to start over.

381
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
I don't think we're supposed to start.

382
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
Four, three.

383
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Yeah.

384
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,260
I'm just not hearing it in the phone.

385
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,260
I'm not getting it.

386
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
No, I'm not getting that one.

387
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
There's a short in my.

388
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
Not getting that go.

389
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
I don't think.

390
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
That go word.

391
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,920
So Clark, you receive a call on your cell phone from a number that comes up as the contention

392
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
clinic.

393
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Officer Bishop.

394
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Hey, it's Keith.

395
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Hey Keith.

396
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,220
I need a ride because remember I rode here in the ambulance.

397
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,220
Oh, that's right.

398
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,700
Our imitating life.

399
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,740
I got a couple of perps in my car.

400
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,060
I'll send John your way.

401
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,060
Who's the perps.

402
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
Uh, congratulations.

403
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,380
It's a, it's, it's a real long story.

404
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
You'll uh, cool.

405
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:52,420
Well, I'm glad that you got some perps cause I'm not a big deal, but, uh, well I'll just

406
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,060
let John see me when he gets here, send him over my way.

407
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
Yeah.

408
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,060
That's what I'll do.

409
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Okay.

410
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,060
Have a great one.

411
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Bye.

412
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,060
I click.

413
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,140
Uh, Hey John.

414
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,660
It sounds like Keith fucked up again.

415
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Yeah.

416
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,380
He's just becoming less and less effective as he loses motility.

417
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,800
He needs a ride though from the clinic.

418
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,060
I'm going to take these guys back to the station and uh, I'll meet you guys there.

419
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,060
Right on.

420
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,660
John, you pull up to the clinic.

421
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,200
The sun is very down by now.

422
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,760
It is a late evening.

423
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,740
I don't remember if I could walk or not.

424
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,880
Yes, I can.

425
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
You can walk now.

426
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Okay, cool.

427
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
You can walk.

428
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
You're just a little hobbled.

429
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Gotcha.

430
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,680
Luke, do you want to describe what John sees when he pulls up?

431
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:48,440
Um, I'm standing outside in just a hospital gown with some nice new bracelets on, uh,

432
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,480
they're handcuffs and I had to cut the chain.

433
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,880
So the chains are just kind of flopping down on either side and uh, I have no shoes or

434
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:03,480
anything else on and I'm waving John down to come get me.

435
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,380
John sees that pulling up and it's just like, what the fuck?

436
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,920
I popped the passenger door open and go, well, you wouldn't believe what happened.

437
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,720
Yeah, we uh, we, we had something a little strange happen to us as well.

438
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,480
Well, I heard that you got a couple guys.

439
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,640
That means we're up.

440
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
One woman and one undetermined.

441
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,920
Oh, interesting.

442
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,240
Let's go back to the police department so I can get my change of clothes.

443
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,320
It's a little breezy in this gown.

444
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,560
Also yeah, he attacked me and handcuffed me to the bed and he got away, stole all my stuff.

445
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Who attacked you?

446
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,440
The guy that we took to the, to the clinic.

447
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Billy Harrison.

448
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Oh, the soldier?

449
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Yeah.

450
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Okay.

451
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,300
So I had a conversation with him about John Peters.

452
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,240
Something was up there and then he, I was kind of catching onto something and so he,

453
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,560
I don't really, it was kind of a blur, but next thing I know, you know, people are taking

454
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,840
pictures of me and laughing at me, you know, cause I was chained to the bed.

455
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,140
Did he cuff you with your own handcuffs?

456
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
He did.

457
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
Vigna.

458
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,320
He stole my gun too.

459
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,040
Oh my God, Vigna.

460
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,880
And he's probably wearing, I, I know that he's wearing my uniform right now.

461
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
God damn it.

462
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Vigna.

463
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Vigna.

464
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Shoot.

465
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I did the best.

466
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,320
I didn't do the best I could do.

467
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,840
I can do better next time.

468
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Clearly.

469
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Can you?

470
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
I promise.

471
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,080
Let's just get back to the police department so I can get into a change of clothes.

472
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,540
All thoughts of a cat man are out of John's mind.

473
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
Cat man?

474
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,760
He just thought it and in fact didn't thought it.

475
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
So.

476
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Okay.

477
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
You haven't heard that yet.

478
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,040
Well, don't, don't tell Clark about, well, I guess I'm going to have to tell Clark about

479
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
this.

480
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,160
Oh, I'm going to tell Clark about this.

481
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,040
We followed up on Dr. Marie Jacobs and that radio Freaky Friday'd her husband and her

482
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
cat.

483
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
According to her.

484
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,680
Her husband is in her cat's body and her cat is in her husband's body?

485
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,440
You are grasping it right away.

486
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Cool.

487
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,700
So as soon as we get you all- Wait, so do you arrest them?

488
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,980
We arrested the husband's body and the cat and Dr. Marie Jacobs.

489
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,260
The cat with the husband's mind is MIA.

490
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,660
It ran away or- It ran off apparently the second the switch

491
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,660
happened.

492
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
Okay.

493
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,580
Well, that'll be- Can he talk or does he meow?

494
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
He meows.

495
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,980
He's a friendly little bugger though.

496
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,420
This'll be a sight to see.

497
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,180
I don't really believe you, but- Yeah, I don't know why I'd lie about something like that.

498
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:46,180
Alright, so you guys make it to the police station and when you arrive, what are you

499
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
up to?

500
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:54,180
As soon as I got there, I stepped inside and I said to Drew, Hey, uh, Drew, I need you

501
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:00,540
to get together some blankies and, uh, make, it's like a cat bed, but for like a human

502
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,980
size cat in one of the cells for me.

503
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,980
Okay.

504
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,980
Thank you, Drew.

505
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
Yeah, of course.

506
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,440
Then I go back out to the cruiser, I open the door and I say, doctor, would you, would

507
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,140
you mind helping me make sure Salem gets in here real safe?

508
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
Yeah, of course.

509
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,440
So I'm using the toy, but I'm also hoping that she is taking up the rear.

510
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
She is.

511
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Yeah.

512
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
No, they're gonna, yeah.

513
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
She's going to play ball.

514
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,960
And I'm leading the cat man into, and you guys go into the police station and there's

515
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,560
one open cell inside it is a blanket palette.

516
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,880
The other cells are filled with stuff that you guys took from the storage units.

517
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Right.

518
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,720
I'm going to lead them both into the cell.

519
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,300
She is cracking up.

520
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,900
She thinks this is the funniest thing that's ever happened and she keeps saying things

521
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,980
to you like, who's gonna believe you?

522
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
No one.

523
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Absolutely no one.

524
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
I think Drew believed me.

525
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,180
Drew, you believe me that this is a cat man?

526
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:04,140
Drew is pouring coffee onto the floor, missing his mug completely.

527
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,500
Another late night.

528
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Um, yep.

529
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
See, he believes me.

530
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
You said cat man.

531
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Yeah.

532
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
That's you believe me.

533
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Drew, you believe me?

534
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Yes.

535
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Clark.

536
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Sorry.

537
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,500
Officer Bishop.

538
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Excuse me.

539
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
So we at least got something going here.

540
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,160
We're going to figure things out, but, uh, for now I just want you guys to rest in here.

541
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Do you have their IDs?

542
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,340
Do you want me to start on the paperwork?

543
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,980
Uh, doctor, do you have your ID on you?

544
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Yes, of course.

545
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,260
Can we get, can I borrow that?

546
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,060
She hands you her ID.

547
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,620
Doug is not wearing pants.

548
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,620
Yeah.

549
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,300
Uh, Drew, uh, we got hers.

550
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,780
Doug is a cat man.

551
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Um, he doesn't have his ID on him, but, uh, if you'll run hers, you can run her husband

552
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,780
too.

553
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,780
You should check them up.

554
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,780
Doug Jacobs.

555
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,780
Okay.

556
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,780
Sounds good.

557
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,980
I'll, I'll start putting it in the system.

558
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,020
Thanks Drew.

559
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
All right.

560
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,260
So John and Keith arrive at the station.

561
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,220
I go to my desk and open up.

562
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,820
Hey everybody, look at Keith.

563
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,340
I run as fast as I can over to my desk and try to get the extra uniform out and just

564
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,180
put it on with my gown on.

565
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,420
I'm not even taking my gown off.

566
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,180
I'm just putting it on over my gown.

567
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,180
Okay.

568
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,180
Keith.

569
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:27,580
Hey, um, before you say anything, do we have an extra, um, set of keys to this particular

570
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,580
set of handcuffs?

571
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,580
Keith, are those your handcuffs?

572
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,220
Yes, but I lost the key to them.

573
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,860
Soldier boy handcuffed him up and stole his gun.

574
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,140
Oh, he's also out there with his uniform, so we should probably get on that.

575
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,140
That's nice.

576
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,140
Keith.

577
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,140
Pretty dangerous.

578
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,740
It sounds really bad, but it wasn't like, you know, it all happened pretty quickly.

579
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,580
I don't think the other, you could have stopped it from happening either.

580
00:25:52,580 --> 00:26:02,860
He's an army man and now he's an honorary police officer for contingent.

581
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,160
We can spin this.

582
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,660
We can spin this so that it looks like we're improving the force while he's talking while

583
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,660
we're having the conversation.

584
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,420
I'm going in and finding the keys for the cuffs.

585
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,420
Yeah.

586
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:20,260
And then, uh, we'll have Keith Vigna, roll luck, 41 on a 60.

587
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
You find the keys.

588
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,260
So while I'm uncuffing him.

589
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,340
So before he got the jump on you, did you get a chance to talk to him, glean anything

590
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
from him?

591
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
Yeah.

592
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,100
So we talked, I asked him some questions about John Peters.

593
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Hold on.

594
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,380
I don't remember exactly what I talked to him about.

595
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,380
Yeah.

596
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
Yeah.

597
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,380
He hit me in the head pretty hard.

598
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,860
So some of that conversation was a little bit of a blur, but for the most part we talked

599
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,420
about him being friends with John Peters.

600
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,860
He told me they played video games together, but I don't know why he was like peeking around

601
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,300
John Peters house cause they hadn't, they don't talk all the time, but he said they

602
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,340
hadn't talked in a while.

603
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,500
So he was poking around, but I started to not really believe that.

604
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,940
And as soon as I showed any kind of a, like that I wasn't believing him, he, that's when

605
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,460
it kind of turns into a blur.

606
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,260
You know, the guy that came in saying he was friends with John Peters also, he was trying

607
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,260
to find his keys.

608
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,700
So people keep trying to say that they're his friend and then get weird.

609
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Yeah, that's true.

610
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,100
While you guys are having this discussion, Drew kind of walks over to John and he's like,

611
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,940
Hey, um, can I talk to you real quick in the back room?

612
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Sure.

613
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
A little buddy.

614
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,140
You guys want to head out of the room real quick?

615
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:33,580
Anything you can say to me?

616
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,220
Drew leads you into the back room and he's like, Hey, um, you guys went out to, um,

617
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:48,060
to Splashylvania and you sent Lauren out there and she said that there was just blood and

618
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,180
gore everywhere.

619
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:57,540
Now I, I asked her if it, if it looked like a deer and she said no, but I convinced her

620
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,740
that it was just, uh, that we'd heard like a deer accidentally fell off a water slide.

621
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,820
But that is a, that's a hilarious excuse.

622
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
Thank you.

623
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
What happened?

624
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,580
Did you guys, what's going on, John?

625
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,820
Did you guys kill someone?

626
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Yes and no.

627
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,420
Oh my God, Drew, you should have seen this shot.

628
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:28,820
It was fucking pretty as a picture, but it turns out Julie Maxwell, she killed old Leo.

629
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,940
Uh, so we had to shoot her.

630
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,380
Clark just, you know, right between the eyes.

631
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,860
Does this have to do with all the cocaine?

632
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
The what now?

633
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,100
John, I found all the cocaine in the lockup.

634
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,900
Oh God, it's been such a full day.

635
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:50,220
I got curious about what all was confiscated and John, that's a lot of money's worth of

636
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,220
cocaine Dean.

637
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,660
Aren't you glad it's off the streets?

638
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,060
Do you know how much there is?

639
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
How much it costs?

640
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,100
I mean, I'll, I'll have to have that information when I write up my report.

641
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,140
Oh, don't you worry about that one.

642
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,860
This is still an ongoing investigation, so you don't need to write anything up on that.

643
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
Okay.

644
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,780
Well, Drew, you know what, I'm going to, there's something big going on in contention.

645
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
I'm going to level with you.

646
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,340
We don't know what it is, but we've got it under control.

647
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
We're working towards it.

648
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,260
I feel like we're about to break this thing.

649
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,660
You know what would help a whole lot though?

650
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
What?

651
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,660
If we had Maggie around.

652
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,660
Yeah.

653
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,040
Drew, can you, can you do everything in your power to, that's, that's what I want you.

654
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,660
Don't worry about these reports, man.

655
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,500
Just focus on finding the chief.

656
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,780
We need her leadership at a time like this.

657
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
Okay.

658
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
I will.

659
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
I will.

660
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:50,900
Um, you wouldn't, John, you, you wouldn't be interested in unloading that cocaine, would

661
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
you?

662
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,900
Is this some kind of test?

663
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
No.

664
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,020
John, I did the math.

665
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,780
That's millions of dollars worth of cocaine.

666
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,700
In fact, that's $10 million worth of cocaine.

667
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,100
That's what are you suggesting, Drew?

668
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:22,660
Well, I know that you have a bit of a history and uh, I mean, I slam them against the wall.

669
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,380
Drew, anything you think you know about me, you don't.

670
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,100
All right.

671
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
I'm just fucking with you.

672
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Let's sell this cocaine.

673
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Okay, thank God.

674
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
Holy shit.

675
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,820
We already have a buyer set up in the city and he's going to pay us $10 million.

676
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,060
If we get Keith and Clark in on it too, they can help out and that's two and a half million

677
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,060
dollars each.

678
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,260
I don't think we're going to get Clark in on this.

679
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,260
Okay, that's fine.

680
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,420
That's $3.3 million each, but that's going to be hard.

681
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,100
I don't know if we need to get Keith in on this.

682
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,740
That's $5 million each.

683
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,740
You and me, buddy.

684
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
Okay.

685
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:03,660
Well, there's, his name is the Duke and uh, we're gonna, we're waiting right now to hear

686
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,900
back from him on where to meet.

687
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,360
And he's got a glint in his eye of like pure ecstasy.

688
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,260
You are a much more interesting man than I figured you for.

689
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,540
We're going to be millionaires, Jon.

690
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
That's right.

691
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,460
We're going to be millionaires.

692
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,180
Both of us.

693
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,780
And he's just like giggling.

694
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,980
He's very happy.

695
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,180
And then he's like, also, I fixed the four wheeler.

696
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
Hell yeah, buddy.

697
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
Okay.

698
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,180
Okay.

699
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,540
Uh, we'll, we'll talk about this later.

700
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
Okay.

701
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:41,460
Well, um, yeah, if you do breathe a word of this to anybody else, I'll kill you.

702
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,460
So don't.

703
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Okay.

704
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Okay.

705
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,460
Okay.

706
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
Okay.

707
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
Oh boy.

708
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,460
Okay.

709
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,460
Cool.

710
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,460
Yeah.

711
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,460
Okay.

712
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,460
Bye.

713
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,460
And he walks back out into the room.

714
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:02,740
Drew comes back out from the back room while you guys are having the conversation.

715
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,340
Jon comes out shortly after good news guys drew fix the four wheeler.

716
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Hell yeah.

717
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Vroom, vroom.

718
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Okay.

719
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:17,860
So Clark, Clark, I believe you were asking Keith about his bad cop work.

720
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,180
He was just a better criminal than I was a cop.

721
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:27,740
I wasn't a bad cop, which means we really should find him.

722
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,660
How long ago did this all happen?

723
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Two hours ago.

724
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,500
Did anybody at the hospital see where he went or no?

725
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,140
I looked at the security footage.

726
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,740
The only shot they got out of him was like him leaving the lobby, basically dressed as

727
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,740
me.

728
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,740
So nobody knows where he went.

729
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,320
Hey drew, in the last hour or two, you get any calls about us working on something you

730
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,740
had heard from us about?

731
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,740
Nope.

732
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,660
Let me double check that my car is still parked out front.

733
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,660
It is.

734
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Cool.

735
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
So yeah, he didn't steal my car though.

736
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,540
So we got that going for us.

737
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
So why did you arrest them?

738
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,860
You know, it was real confusing at the time.

739
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,860
At the very least it seemed like things weren't right.

740
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,380
So on a hunch.

741
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,980
He's got this real bad bloody nose.

742
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,580
So we, I mean, at the very least he's hurt.

743
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:14,820
Did she punch him or she says, so yeah, here's the, so she had the radio, right?

744
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,460
And she had the radio.

745
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,380
So back at the treasured place.

746
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,580
So she was the one who bought the radio.

747
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,400
So we went to see if she had the radio.

748
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,780
She said, no, somebody had taken it.

749
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,980
We said, who?

750
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,020
And she described a tall, angry surly man had come and taken it.

751
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,580
Did that ring any bells?

752
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,580
We think it's Charles.

753
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,580
Yeah.

754
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,240
We think you rung his bell earlier today.

755
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,020
Where would the radio be then?

756
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,660
We think it might be back at his hotel room, which we found out.

757
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Yeah.

758
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Okay.

759
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
And we haven't been there yet, have we?

760
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
We've not been there yet.

761
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
So that's kind of our biggest lead.

762
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,260
When he came in, he punched Salem Doug cap man.

763
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,160
How did this freaky Friday situation happen?

764
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,260
She blamed it on the radio.

765
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
Okay.

766
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,260
That makes sense.

767
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
Totally.

768
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
Let's you know what?

769
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,180
I'll go check out his apartment with the help of you guys.

770
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Yes.

771
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,540
A hundred percent.

772
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,700
That should be our next step for the mystery, but we should probably find there's somebody

773
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,780
out there in your clothes.

774
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,020
How would you suggest we, I don't know.

775
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
Oh dude.

776
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,380
And call call for him and see if he answers my radio walkie talkie, whatever it is.

777
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,780
Oh, send out a call on the radio that sets up an irresistible trap for him.

778
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
Ooh.

779
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
I like that.

780
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
I like that too.

781
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,900
Got a good head on you, John.

782
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,340
So we know he was looking for John Peters, I think.

783
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,540
So maybe we should say that John Peters is somewhere and then he won't be there, but

784
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
we will.

785
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
Yeah.

786
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,140
We're like a free buffet for soldiers with John Peters.

787
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,140
John Peters is hosting a free buffet for soldiers.

788
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,560
Charles had this guy in his trunk.

789
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
That's true.

790
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,740
So this guy might be out for vengeance.

791
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,700
He might be at the hotel already.

792
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,460
Did you tell him that you killed Charles?

793
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,820
I don't think if that came up so we can, yeah, we can see if he's poking around Charles's

794
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,820
place.

795
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
Okay.

796
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
Wonder where Charles first ran into this guy.

797
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,460
You know, where did he abduct him?

798
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,200
He didn't remember.

799
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,320
I think when I asked him, I think I might've suffered a concussion too.

800
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,440
So some of these details are a little, little off for me here, but I feel fine now.

801
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,600
Just don't let me go to sleep.

802
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,880
That's actually outdated information.

803
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Oh, okay.

804
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,480
I'm going to take a nap in the back of the cruiser then while we are at the motel.

805
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,600
How are you feeling on that foot?

806
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Much better.

807
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,720
I can walk, but I am not back to where I was, but I will get there soon.

808
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,360
We can probably take three cars then.

809
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
I can drive.

810
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
Yeah.

811
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,680
So you would remember that Billy said that his last memory was looking in a window at

812
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
John Peters house.

813
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,600
At least that's what he told me, but I had a pretty reasonable suspicion about him and

814
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,360
kind of confronted him on it and that's what started the violence.

815
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,760
If he's telling the truth though, he might've been caught snooping around outside the house

816
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,360
by Charles, who was also snooping.

817
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,940
That's what I was probably thinking.

818
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,320
Did he say why he was snooping, why he was looking around the windows?

819
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,420
He said that John Peters is his friend and they play video games together and he hadn't

820
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,840
heard from him in a while, so he went over to check it out, but that's kind of when his

821
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,200
story started not making a whole lot of sense.

822
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,280
How old is John Peters?

823
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,720
John Peters is 30 years old.

824
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,920
And Billy, Billy Harrison is probably around that same age, right?

825
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,560
I think his ID said he was 31.

826
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Yeah.

827
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720
It makes sense that those guys would play video games together.

828
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,260
I got the feeling that that was either a half truth or just a story.

829
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,040
It raised my suspicion because I was thinking of John Peters as like an old man.

830
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Okay.

831
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Yeah.

832
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,600
Can you remember any specifics about how his story started falling apart?

833
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,520
Do you remember where you caught him?

834
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,360
Well, they had grown up together, I think, and then for a long time had just been playing

835
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,600
video games together and they weren't like super close friends.

836
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,460
So it was just strange that he would feel the need to go to his house, especially when

837
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,040
all of this crazy stuff is going on.

838
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,440
And then it was, it made me even more suspicious when he attacked me.

839
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,300
I was like something, I don't think this guy's just telling the whole truth.

840
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
This fella.

841
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,440
All right, fellas, I guess we should head to the hotel first.

842
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,520
Hotel Motel.

843
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,240
Can we call the Motel Hotel Motel?

844
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Holiday.

845
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Motel.

846
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Motel.

847
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,680
Okay, so if you want to continue the evening doing adventure investigating type stuff,

848
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,040
you'll all lose some willpower.

849
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
That's right.

850
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
He already said it was late.

851
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
We have to go to sleep soon.

852
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,620
I feel like we should go now though because it's while it's fresh.

853
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,640
And that guy's out there in green uniform.

854
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,120
We really need to hire some more cops in this town.

855
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,560
Well, we potentially have a fourth one.

856
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Just depends on what he's doing.

857
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,800
If he's doing crime or if he's, yeah, what if he's out there just doing our jobs?

858
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,400
Like maybe we should just let him keep at it.

859
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Seems competent.

860
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,460
Did we ever figure out where he was, what country he was a soldier for?

861
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,300
He might be an Al-Qaeda.

862
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,960
You got your ass kicked by a Canadian soldier.

863
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
He's a Mountie.

864
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,260
Billy's a pretty Russian name.

865
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,860
You said we were going to lose willpower.

866
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
How much?

867
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,900
Just to get that back.

868
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
I can't remember mechanically.

869
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
Sleep.

870
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,900
Sleep, right?

871
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,900
You regain it when you sleep?

872
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
Okay.

873
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,580
So a full night's rest regains one D six willpower.

874
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,580
Okay, cool.

875
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,180
How much are we going to lose if we stay up?

876
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,860
You're going to lose one willpower per hour that you stay up starting now.

877
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,860
So everybody lose one willpower.

878
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,620
Good thing none of us are magic users.

879
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:33,020
For the listeners, willpower is one of the statistics in this game that is used for keeping

880
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:40,720
your shit together when going through a mental disorder or staying up late or trying to resist

881
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,700
interrogation or anything of that nature.

882
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,940
It'll also maybe come in handy when spells are introduced.

883
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,780
If they are willpower is also used for that.

884
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,780
Pew pew.

885
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,120
If we were actually just three guys trying to go find this guy, we'd all go out in separate

886
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,100
cars and just like search the town, I guess.

887
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,140
Do you trust me to do that?

888
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:09,260
As a, as your character, would you trust Keith to go out looking for the guy that bested

889
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,460
him last time?

890
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,660
As long as you radioed in when you found him and didn't move to engage.

891
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,380
Where else would you want to check out then?

892
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,900
Well, we have to go to the hotel too and like maybe sooner rather than later, but that can

893
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,540
also just be the first place we look for him and we could all take separate routes to it.

894
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:29,060
Do that and then split up if he's not at the hotel motel, then we can split up and cruise

895
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,060
around.

896
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
I like that.

897
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
Yeah.

898
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
And then figure it out from there.

899
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,060
Cool.

900
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,180
Uh, we do want to take all separate routes.

901
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
Oh cool.

902
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,340
Uh, and you're taking separate routes to look for this guy on the way to the establishment.

903
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,660
Well, everybody, uh, how are we going to do this?

904
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,180
Let's go ahead and get a luck roll from each of you first.

905
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
Pass.

906
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,180
20 on a 50.

907
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,180
Uh, pass.

908
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
51 on a 70.

909
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,380
37 on a, what are we rolling?

910
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
Luck.

911
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,380
60.

912
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,380
That's a lucky night.

913
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,860
I need all three of you to roll search for me.

914
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
Fail.

915
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
Crit fail.

916
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,860
We all.

917
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,860
Perfect.

918
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:18,820
We're all feeling really good and then each of you feels like you just missed him.

919
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,340
I feel him in the night.

920
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,420
Hot.

921
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,380
As you all converge at hotel motel, Keith's current home, you arrive in the parking lot.

922
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,460
It's midnight and there are a couple cars.

923
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,700
If I could get an intelligence roll from the person with the highest intelligence, I'm

924
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,980
at a 55, 75, 50, 92 on a 75.

925
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,140
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

926
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,420
Another night at hotel motel.

927
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,420
Do I recognize any of the cars from living there?

928
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,060
Seems to you like all the ones that are normally there, there there's, you know, eight, 10

929
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,060
cars there.

930
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
There's some new ones.

931
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,300
Do we have a room number and the keys to the room?

932
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,540
You have your keys to your room and to Charles's.

933
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,200
You also have the key to Charles room.

934
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
What is my room number?

935
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
What's his room number?

936
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
What's your room number?

937
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,200
One Oh eight.

938
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Cool.

939
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
What do you guys think?

940
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,060
Do you think that the room number would be on the key?

941
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,140
I mean, depends on what kind of key it is, but if it's a real key, it's a real key.

942
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
Then yeah.

943
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,400
It's a real key with a rubber little thing on it that says two Oh two.

944
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,620
Welcome to my home guys.

945
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,220
This is a real shit hole.

946
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,940
I thought you would never come visit me.

947
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,820
It was very sad that you live here.

948
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,820
It's just temporary.

949
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,500
You've been saying that for months.

950
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,980
I like try not to get a lump in my throat and go up to two Oh two.

951
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,980
I know the way guys.

952
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:58,940
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you heaven knows how
