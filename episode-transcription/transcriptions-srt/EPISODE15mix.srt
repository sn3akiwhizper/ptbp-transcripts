1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,020
Hola, que pasa mis perros, esta es Wolf the dog.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,200
On this week's edition of Howlin' with Wolf, we got ourselves a beautiful poem written

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,960
by a listener who gave us a five-star review on iTunes.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,220
That was a super cool thing to do, listener.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,780
She writes, My dearest Samuel,

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,260
You are the ying to my yang, The chicken tendies to my basement dweller,

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,520
The window to my wall, The sweat that drips down my balls,

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,920
You really butter my bread and stain my bits, I love you even if you keep taking weird pictures

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:51,360
of my paddle-board feet, Wow, that is so fuckin' gross,

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,020
Sorry y'all, Wolf is just jealous of all this love,

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,940
It gives me wet in the eye-holes, Now, wholesome news,

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,860
Officer Vigna broke into Officer Pettymore's house to find some cocaine for personal use.

13
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,780
This is the cocaine they stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of

14
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,420
a missing person.

15
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,220
The fire at the city hospital has now claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals.

16
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,640
The names of the deceased are not yet being released, my babies.

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,260
More importantly, however, the officers of law here in contention eat the most awful

18
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,260
breakfast food.

19
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:41,700
The officers are also dealing with the situation wherein Officer Bishop seems to be in more

20
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,080
than one place at a time.

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,700
He has no recollection of this.

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,300
Then, a lot of super important plot stuff happens, involving the FBI agents, the black

23
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:00,280
Nike bag, a small silver sphere, and things of that nature.

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,260
It seems like our boys at the local precinct might be getting called up to the big show.

25
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:15,600
For all our listeners in Springfield, Missouri, contentions greatest band, Kudzu, will be

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,380
playing in a show March 2nd at some place called the Front of House Lounge.

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,880
In honor of this actual event, we are premiering a brand new song by Kudzu.

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,580
It is No Backbone.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:07,720
Okay, so in order to dig into these characters a bit more, we're going to take a look into

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,640
the past, starting with Clark Bishop.

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
Howdy.

32
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,280
I have Joe with me here today, and we are joined by a long-time Delta Green player and

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,760
my favorite person in existence, Taylor, my wife.

34
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
That's me.

35
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
And...

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
Borat.

37
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
My wife!

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Nailed it.

39
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,360
I'd prefer you not do that.

40
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,520
Let's flash back to a time when Clark Bishop was a much, much younger man.

42
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,680
One might even call him a boy.

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,840
Yeah, and then I'll put in that in post.

44
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,340
It'll be like the nice dream sequence.

45
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,580
So you are in your childhood home, which just so happens to be, if I'm not mistaken,

46
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,620
to be the home that Clark Bishop still lives in.

47
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,620
Do you want to give a quick description of what it looks like back then?

48
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,160
Yeah, it's real clean.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,820
It's one of those houses that keeps the plastic on the couch.

50
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,940
Lots of angel wings and crosses on the walls.

51
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,940
Maybe a framed picture of Jesus.

52
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,940
Jesus.

53
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Is it tatting?

54
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,140
The little doilies and things on armchairs?

55
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,580
Yeah, your chairs have tats.

56
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
Yeah.

57
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
Tatted.

58
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,580
Yeah.

59
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Awesome.

60
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,580
Yeah.

61
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,000
So as you're going about your normal kid time, I don't know what you're doing, but your parents

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,020
are in the kitchen making dinner.

63
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:47,860
Pat Sajak is loud and clear over the television, and as you're playing in the living room,

64
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,980
you hear your mom yell from the kitchen, Kermit the Frog in my throat.

65
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,700
And your dad is like, oh, it was right there.

66
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,940
I had the frog in my throat.

67
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,580
I couldn't come up with the Kermit.

68
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,620
And they're jawing back and forth, and you're looking over on the walls, you got all the

69
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,860
pictures of the Jesus, the crosses, you got some angels.

70
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,660
I don't know, maybe like a family picture of you guys on vacation somewhere.

71
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,460
And your mom walks over as your dad keeps working on dinner.

72
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,940
And she leans down to you, Clark, and she kind of like looks at the TV as Wheel of Fortune

73
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,220
goes into its final clue in the bonus round.

74
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,820
And she says, Clark, life is like the bonus round.

75
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,620
We were already given the best letters.

76
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,860
Then she gives you a big old hug and a kiss on the forehead and says, are you off to the

77
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,860
library?

78
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Yeah, of course.

79
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:58,700
You're going to go say hi to Mr. Fingerson.

80
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Mr. Fingerson?

81
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Yeah, of course.

82
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,700
Yeah, go say hi to Mr. Fingerson.

83
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,180
Tell him that we send our guards and oh, also.

84
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,780
And she goes and grabs a little basket of muffins, lemon poppy seed muffins.

85
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,340
Yeah, they're good.

86
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,300
I bet he would enjoy these.

87
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Mr. Fingerson?

88
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,540
He loves muffins.

89
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,580
So off we see little Clark Bishop riding a bike, maybe, or contentions in small town.

90
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,940
You could easily ride your bike.

91
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, totally a bike.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,380
To the contention public library.

93
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,020
When you go in there, you would see it's dead.

94
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
It's dead.

95
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,020
It's a really nice place.

96
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,380
The general's a little musty in here.

97
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:50,940
The library is not frequented often by the general population of contention.

98
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:58,180
However, you do see that at the information desk, Mr. Fingerson is having a conversation

99
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,740
with a man that I think you would recognize.

100
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,420
His name is Gary Daley and he runs the Pho Shop in town.

101
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,700
He is having a very loud conversation with Mr. Fingerson.

102
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,100
Uh, yeah, no, I really like this one for sure.

103
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,260
The true and horrifying confessions of the St. Oscyth witches.

104
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,540
Yes, of course.

105
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:28,260
If you have anything of this elaborate nature, something so esoteric, like this is the kind

106
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,780
of stuff that is right up my alley.

107
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,580
Oh, yes, Mr. Daley.

108
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,620
We have quite a bit in the occult.

109
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,500
I can surely gather some materials for you.

110
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,340
Tell me, what are you going to be reading these for?

111
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,880
Oh, I am just perusing them because I enjoy the story.

112
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,740
See nothing, I don't know.

113
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,660
It's just life is a little bit too bland and I like spicing it up.

114
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,200
I completely agree.

115
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,300
Often I feel in contention.

116
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,260
I don't feel fulfilled.

117
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:03,060
Perhaps if I had made better decisions in my younger life, I would be a greater man.

118
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,420
Jerry Daley walks away with his book and kind of denotes where he's going to be sitting.

119
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
Like, huh?

120
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,900
Well, I'm going to be right over here.

121
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,300
Oh, Clark, thank goodness you're here.

122
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Hey, Mr. Fingerson.

123
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Oh, please call me Gerald.

124
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
All right, Gerald.

125
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
No, no, no.

126
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Good sir.

127
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
It is Gerald.

128
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Oh, of course.

129
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,420
Extend that short O.

130
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,940
I always mess that up, Mr. Gerald.

131
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
That's very close.

132
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,920
We'll keep working on it.

133
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,080
It's only been, what, seven months that we've been practicing?

134
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,560
I'll get there one day, I'm sure.

135
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,720
Oh, I'm sure you will.

136
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
And what brings you here today?

137
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,040
Well, first of all, here.

138
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
My mom made these for you.

139
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,080
Oh my goodness, muffins.

140
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,720
If only I weren't gluten intolerant.

141
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,120
She always forgets, doesn't she?

142
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Yes, she sure does.

143
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,840
I keep telling her you like muffins.

144
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
That's probably why.

145
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,040
I'll put these with the other batches.

146
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:13,520
So we see Clark and Gerald walking through the stacks, picking out books, and talking

147
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:21,640
about life, and then the phone in the contention public library begins to ring.

148
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Ring, ring.

149
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Ring, ring.

150
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Thank you.

151
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,680
I was going to do that in post, but I think we don't need it anymore.

152
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
No, we're going to keep that.

153
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
No, that's-

154
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
And that's going to be the phone sound for the rest of the podcast.

155
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,760
All of the podcasts got that sweet, sweet sample.

156
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
You're welcome.

157
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,560
It will be used from here on out.

158
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Yes.

159
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,960
Hello, this is Gerald.

160
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Clark, Clark, get Clark.

161
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Hurry.

162
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Who may I ask is speaking?

163
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Tell him.

164
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,000
Tell him he was already given the best letters.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You have to tell him.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Are we talking about-

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Excuse me, are you still there?

168
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,320
He put his heart monitor on the line?

169
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,280
How very strange.

170
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,760
Clark, I believe you got a phone call.

171
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,640
He told you you have the best letters.

172
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,640
I've often liked the spelling of your name as well.

173
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:25,280
What do you think that means?

174
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,560
He sounded panicked, and then he screamed a little.

175
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,800
So you guys look outside the windows to the outside world.

176
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:41,560
The sun was still out, you know, late summer, and the sky turns, and it is dark before you

177
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
know it.

178
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,880
Like, it is not time for sunset, however, the sun is no longer shining over contention.

179
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,800
Oh, that precarious contention weather.

180
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,760
And you immediately see these figures start moving outside the windows, and you can't

181
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,480
make them out, but something is moving around outside the library.

182
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,600
And you kind of look over, and Gary Daley is just, you know, in his book, oh my, yeah.

183
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,000
You kind of look over, and you see the front doors, and you see this dark figure in the

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,400
darkness behind him, shrouded.

185
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:24,000
He's clearly wearing a cloak, and he is locking the doors of the library with a massive chain,

186
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,120
and he's locking you into the library.

187
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,560
As soon as he finishes, he turns and runs, and out of the windows, you see a bright flash

188
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
of light.

189
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,340
What do you guys do?

190
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,520
My God, what is happening?

191
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,440
Mr. Finkerson, did you see that?

192
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,960
Well, I sure did.

193
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,320
Let's go take a look.

194
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,280
Seems something's finally interesting is happening in contention.

195
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,560
Interesting is, I guess, one way to put it.

196
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,080
Yes, don't you worry, Clark.

197
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm your mentor.

198
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
I will take care of this.

199
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Okay.

200
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,440
And I go and stand very behind Mr. Finkerson.

201
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,080
All right, Mr. Finkerson.

202
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,240
All right.

203
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,920
So I go over and take a peek out of one of the windows.

204
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Okay.

205
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,160
When you go over and take a peek out of the windows, I'm picturing...

206
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,720
Oh, also, real quick, what does Mr. Finkerson look like?

207
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,360
He looks like, let me try to think of a celebrity comparison.

208
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,160
Oh, we don't do that.

209
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,280
We don't do that here.

210
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,080
We don't do that here.

211
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,660
That's what all the other actual play podcasts do.

212
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:36,280
So we'd like to give a quick physical description using two to three descriptive words.

213
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,960
Okay, two to three, that's all I get?

214
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Yeah.

215
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Okay.

216
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Sweater vest.

217
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
All right, you already used two.

218
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:53,080
No, that's a hyphenated word, if not just one complete word.

219
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:02,800
And if I only get one other word, bifocals, I was going to say like low on the bridge

220
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
of my nose.

221
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Okay.

222
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,280
A sweater vest and bifocals that are low on the bridge of my nose.

224
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,560
He's also only 19, it's a weird choice in the voice.

225
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,480
As you look out the window...

226
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,600
Sweater vest but no shirt underneath.

227
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Oh, that's a good look.

228
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,320
They tat it up.

229
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,040
Tribal tattoos going all the way down.

230
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,040
The glasses aren't even real, they're just like for to be trendy.

231
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,680
Are they transitions?

232
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,200
Oh, of course they are.

233
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,480
So we see, what's your fucking name?

234
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Gerald.

235
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
Gerald.

236
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I said it wrong.

237
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Gerald.

238
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Gerald.

239
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,280
So we see Gerald Fingersen looking out, creeping along and looking out this window and a young

240
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:55,320
Clark kind of peeking out from behind him and this massive, massive shadow moves right

241
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,520
out of frame and you actually see this man.

242
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:06,940
He's a very tall man wearing a black suit and he is sprinting away and following him

243
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:15,500
is this completely cloaked figure who is running after him into the darkness of the night.

244
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,720
That's happening outside the windows?

245
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
That's happening outside the window.

246
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,560
And it would have previously been like 2pm or something?

247
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,000
It would have previously been like 5.30pm, maybe even 6.

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,440
Do I recognize the man in the suit?

249
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
No.

250
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,680
Mr. Fingersen, do you know who that was?

251
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,040
I sure don't and there's only a population of...

252
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,000
Insert whatever you think the population of contention is.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,760
I don't think we've ever talked about it.

254
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,600
So let's not.

255
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,200
We might need a whole lot more at some point.

256
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,560
Yeah, probably small.

257
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,200
Okay, how about this?

258
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,200
I do not, however, I only ever interact with people at the library, so it's pretty much

259
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,520
just you and now Mr. Daley.

260
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Just geographically, would that guy have been, should he have been running from the library

261
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,000
or could he have been coming from somewhere else?

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Geographically?

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Mm-hmm.

264
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,440
Oh, they were coming from the library.

265
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,680
It looks like they ran through the wall and popped out the other side.

266
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
No, not quite.

267
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
No.

268
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,240
No, they're just running away from the library.

269
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Okay.

270
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
But how far would you say they are?

271
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
20 yards.

272
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Okay.

273
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
And then...

274
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Take a shot, Mr. Fingersen, take a shot.

275
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,040
I pull out a big rifle.

276
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,040
They aren't even serpentining.

277
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,360
Dear boy, I'd like you to get behind the reference center.

278
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,800
I do believe I'm going to try to interact with them.

279
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,680
And then I go try to open a window.

280
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,920
When you open up the window, light actually comes back into the world and both figures

281
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,440
that you saw running away are no longer within sight.

282
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,160
However, based on how fast they were running and how far away they were and the flatness

283
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,800
of the land, you should still be able to see them, but you no longer can.

284
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,480
Okay, I'm going to go see if the lock is still on the door.

285
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,580
It is.

286
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,640
But it's lighter out now?

287
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Yeah.

288
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,120
It's normal, but there's a lock on the door.

289
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:16,000
Clark pops his head up from behind the reference desk where he dutifully went and hid and sees

290
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,520
that it's kind of light out.

291
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,400
I want to look at Mr. Daley.

292
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,760
How's he acting?

293
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:27,600
Mr. Daley is sitting staring at this book and he looks at you and he's like, was there

294
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,940
a big cloud?

295
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,000
Maybe Mr. Daley.

296
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,720
It seemed pretty dark for a cloud though.

297
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,940
That was crazy.

298
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,340
I've read those occult books frontwards and backwards in my many years alone in the library

299
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,420
and I do believe that they have something to do with this.

300
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,340
Mr. Daley, I think we must have a sit and talk.

301
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,180
Okay, come on down.

302
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
We go on down.

303
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,660
All right, so we see, give me just a second.

304
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:05,940
I was going to do the Georgia booboo beep boop booboo.

305
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,400
There was an article that my favorite murder is the most listened to podcast in Missouri.

306
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Is it really?

307
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
How interesting.

308
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,840
It's that and cereal and something else that they're all three of the things that my mom

309
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
listened to.

310
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,620
She was like, I'm bumping those numbers up, baby.

311
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,700
Well, I've almost finished all of my favorite murder in a short period of time.

312
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
They're good.

313
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,300
I've only listened to a handful, but I've always enjoyed them.

314
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,500
All right, well here, I'll show you what I was reading while, uh, when all that went

315
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:40,580
all dark and stuff, I was, I was looking at this page here, it says, uh, and casting her

316
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,060
eyes aside.

317
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,380
She saw- Mr. Daley, don't say it again.

318
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,900
What if it, what if it was the thing that did the thing and then you did it again?

319
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,300
Well then I guess it would get dark if you believe in that sort of thing, Clark, but

320
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,980
well, you know, you're a young boy, I suppose beliefs aren't that crazy for you.

321
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,900
Clark starts to kind of realize that he's being a little wimp and he's like, no, I mean,

322
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,940
of course, of course that's not what happened.

323
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,940
What are you, a little pussy?

324
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Sorry.

325
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,460
Mr. Daley, do not talk to my son.

326
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,520
I mean my, my friend that way.

327
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,960
And casting her eyes aside, she saw a spirit lift up a cloth over lying over a pot looking

328
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,320
much like a ferret and it being asked of the examiner why the spirit did look upon

329
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,440
her, she said it was hungry.

330
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,160
This examiner being asked how she knew the names of Mother Bennet's spirits saith that

331
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,120
Tiffin, her spirit, did tell this examiner that she had two spirits and one of them was

332
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,680
like a black dog and the other was red like a lion and that their names were Sucken and

333
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,160
cleared and sayeth that Sucken did plague Biet's wife unto death and other plague three

334
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,160
of his beasts where of two of them died.

335
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,160
That voice is incredibly difficult to listen to.

336
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,200
Thankfully it's a small character.

337
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,960
I don't know what any of that means, but it sounded cool.

338
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,280
These spirits of a dog and a lion that made a, I don't think, I don't know if that has

339
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,240
anything to do with this, but that's pretty cool.

340
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,040
Clark is still trying to put on a brave face, but he is definitely peeking out the window

341
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,080
seeing if the sun's blinking out or anything.

342
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,920
Oh yeah, it's completely back to normal outside.

343
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Nothing out of the ordinary.

344
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,880
Perhaps we should bury this deep inside ourselves and never talk about it again until we have

345
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
another encounter.

346
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:43,520
Yeah, I do think that's a real good idea there, Gerald.

347
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,120
Perhaps a formative experience will happen to you that will unveil this again.

348
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,480
Gerald, that's a really good point, Clark.

349
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,640
I think that if you guys think that this is going to, you know, affect me in some way

350
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:04,080
down the line, then I'm going to trust you older gentlemen.

351
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Thank you for calling me a gentleman.

352
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Same.

353
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,960
I don't know where to go from here.

354
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,600
Yeah, I think we're good in the library.

355
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Cool.

356
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Yeah, I think that was good.

357
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I love that.

358
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,360
Is that an episode wrap on Taylor?

359
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,920
Well, yes, that is a wrap on Taylor.

360
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
You killed it.

361
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
I made it.

362
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
You fucking killed it.

363
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:35,620
Joe, when Clark turns the corner onto the street his house is on, his mind begins to

364
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,720
falter.

365
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,640
Your mind effectively breaks, shattering into different realities, and these different scenes

366
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,040
play out in front of you, but they're constantly changing like a television flipping through

367
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
the channels.

368
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,000
First, you see your house exactly as you know it.

369
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Then it's on fire.

370
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,520
Next, the house is normal, but there are police officers and vehicles everywhere, and yellow

371
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,840
tape surrounds your home.

372
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,880
One after another, relentlessly, the scene changes around you.

373
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,620
There are a couple black sedans out front.

374
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,360
Now everything is normal again.

375
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,000
Now it's a wasteland.

376
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Your surroundings continue to vacillate as you approach the door of your home.

377
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,220
A man in a suit hops out of a black sedan and hollers to get your attention as you open

378
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,920
your front door.

379
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,680
Inside is quiet.

380
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,840
Looking down the hallway, you notice something's off.

381
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,920
There are more wall decorations than normal.

382
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,520
Your reality breaks again.

383
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,960
Everything's back to the way it always has been.

384
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,800
You hear the sounds of Wheel of Fortune, but the sound of the wheel spinning just goes

385
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,700
and goes and goes, and you hear voices all around you and inside of you.

386
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:49,480
One says, well, we couldn't find the artifact, but we'll have to get the fuck out of here

387
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,400
because Karen did her goddamn magic trick again.

388
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,520
Your vision flickers back to your unacceptable reality.

389
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,960
In the hallway, there are not more pictures of a happy family, or of angels' wings, or

390
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,800
of Jesus.

391
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,840
Instead, suspended a couple feet off the ground as if they had been halfway quicksanded into

392
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:18,760
the wall, the parents of Clark Bishop, your parents, have become interior design.

393
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,480
Their knees jutting out into the hallway, their hands grasping out for life, their faces

394
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,920
contorted in anguish and disbelief.

395
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,800
A voice snaps you out of it.

396
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,460
We the jury, find the defendant and love.

397
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,220
You look up and see a cold, vacant woman smiling out from behind the thick, asymmetrical bangs

398
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,600
covering one of her eyes.

399
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,120
All you can remember about that day is how perfectly normal it all was.

400
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,800
How your house looked completely empty.

401
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,000
They weren't there anymore.

402
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,920
There was very little evidence in the trial, but the words of Anne Love's confession

403
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:05,200
haunt you as you try desperately to remember anything about that abhorrent day.

404
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,120
I did it, and I'd do it again.

405
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:26,880
It's X-Files.

406
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,480
It's like D&D, but it's like X-Files.

407
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,160
That's what I have to say to everybody when I describe this game.

408
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,920
I never think to use the X-Files analogy.

409
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
That's what I always say.

410
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
It's good.

411
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,040
Luke got it from me.

412
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,960
Speaking of the X-Files.

413
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,640
I always say that it's like true detective, but stupid.

414
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Yeah.

415
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
That's awesome.

416
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,400
Wow, it literally sounded like you had a mouthful of vomit or something.

417
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Dick.

418
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Dude, I wish I had a mouthful of dick right now.

419
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,760
Dude, does anybody bring in any dicks to suck this weekend?

420
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
I think.

421
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,720
I think we're gonna suck Alex's dick all weekend.

422
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,480
Dude, honestly, I think if we're ever gonna get involved in a once in a lifetime gay orgy,

423
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
it's this weekend.

424
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
It's gonna be this weekend.

425
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
12 dudes.

426
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,320
And a lot of them are strangers to me, so I won't feel that embarrassed.

427
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,520
I'll never see them again.

428
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
And it ticks a few boxes.

429
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,040
And Alex is leading the party.

430
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,240
He's so drunk that he's not verbal again.

431
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,940
Alex would never do something like sleep with a stripper at his bachelor party.

432
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,440
His last hurrah of being single would be fucking 12 dudes.

433
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
11.

434
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
11.

435
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,720
Dude, it's gonna be fun and I hope that we all make it.

436
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,200
Yeah, I hope none of us drown in Lake of the Ozarks.

437
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Yeah, we get arrested.

438
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,520
Or, yeah, I hope none of us get dragged by a cop underwater.

439
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,200
They slap cuffs on us and throw us in the water.

440
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Oops.

441
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,800
Did that guy get fired?

442
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,280
You have the right to remain splashed.

443
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,920
No, like, nothing happened to that cop, right?

444
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Nothing happened to that cop.

445
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,200
I didn't know this was a real thing.

446
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,040
They handcuffed a guy in a lake and he couldn't swim?

447
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,680
No, they handcuffed a guy, sat him on the side of the boat, and he fell backwards and

448
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
drowned.

449
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Nobody got him.

450
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Holy shit.

451
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Holy shit.

452
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Yeah, dude.

453
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
That's a big ol' oopsie.

454
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,040
I don't think the cops got disciplined, but the family is suing the fuck out of the city,

455
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
I'm pretty sure.

456
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
I mean, it's Keith's shit.

457
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Like, straight up.

458
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Straight up.

459
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Hard.

460
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
That's us.

461
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,320
I want to say that he actually got charged with involuntary manslaughter or something.

462
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
Was it here?

463
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Was it at Lake of the Ozarks?

464
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Well, that's just a ticket in Missouri.

465
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Yeah, that's not us.

466
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Yeah.

467
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
50 bucks.

468
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Duly noted.

469
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,640
I didn't mean to accidentally kill him.

470
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,880
Okay, give me one more puff and then I'm ready to boot this baby up and start playing my

471
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
Bean Boy.

472
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,440
You ready to boot-skootin' Biggie?

473
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,640
Also, I think we're going to...

474
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Well, I'm good.

475
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,360
Okay, one last puff.

476
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Can you do it?

477
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Oh my god.

478
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
That's your third last puff.

479
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
I know.

480
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,280
Okay, so Agent Kennedy looks at you guys and she says,

481
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Good luck.

482
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,180
And Kennedy and Billy Harrison turn around and walk out of the police station.

483
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,180
Before they do that...

484
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,960
I think they already did, though, in the last one.

485
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
They did, yeah.

486
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,220
Yeah, that was just, like, getting us back in.

487
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,220
Well, shit.

488
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,320
I mean, I don't think we just let him leave, though.

489
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,460
I'd be like, wait, what the fuck?

490
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
What is this number?

491
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,460
Who are you?

492
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,460
What are you talking about?

493
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,040
Please fill us in.

494
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,600
We're in what?

495
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,360
Should we just call the number right now?

496
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
None of this is helpful so far.

497
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,800
You've just added more mystery to our, like, horribly chaotic lives.

498
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:45,360
Yeah, how about you're too stunned by the recent revelations that have been brought

499
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,880
to your attention to say anything.

500
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,680
Well, but the only revelation brought to our attention is that there was a phone number.

501
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,960
She also confirmed that weird shit exists.

502
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,840
Yeah, weird shit is happening, but...

503
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,920
Yeah, like, super weird shit.

504
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:05,300
Like she is letting you hold onto a Nike bag that makes things disappear, and she was desperately

505
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:11,120
trying to get rid of a small silver sphere, and Billy Harrison, the bald guy from Charles

506
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,560
Donovan's trunk, is one of them, and, okay, how about this.

507
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:26,200
On the back of the paper with the phone number, it says, your job is to stop the incursion,

508
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,300
minimize exposure, save lives, and cover the whole thing up.

509
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,720
But the ink disappears after you read it, and on the other side, the phone number is

510
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
still there.

511
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,520
Okay, so you guys were talking at the end, and maybe I just missed this in the game.

512
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,760
Did you really say call this number in 48 hours?

513
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
With in.

514
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
With in, yeah.

515
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Oh, with in.

516
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,080
They are gonna call us in 48 hours if we don't.

517
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
If we don't call them first.

518
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Gotcha.

519
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,040
I thought it was call when you've completed.

520
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,160
That also.

521
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,640
Our job is to stop the incursion, minimize exposure, save lives, and cover the whole

522
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,080
thing up to save it from being exposed.

523
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,820
Cool, I'm glad you wrote that down.

524
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,320
Quick question, is there, when we spend luck, is there any way to get it back, or is this

525
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,760
just like our bank?

526
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,520
There is a way to get it back, and also, I haven't awarded any of you luck.

527
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,720
Have any of us used luck at all?

528
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,040
None of you have used.

529
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,520
I thought you did once.

530
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
No, no one.

531
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,760
I didn't, because I'm still at 60.

532
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,000
No one has used any luck so far.

533
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,760
We've rolled on it before, but we haven't spent any for it.

534
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Exactly.

535
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,480
And so, let's go ahead and change the economy of luck at the beginning of this session.

536
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,640
I will award you all five luck.

537
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Right now?

538
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Yes, right now.

539
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,520
You all gain five luck.

540
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,520
I'm at 65.

541
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,600
That's four away from the cool number.

542
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,760
And only a math problem away from 420.

543
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,440
Yeah, I was trying to do that in my head when you made that joke.

544
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,320
Scott Aukerman wouldn't have it like that.

545
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,140
Rob Crockleman.

546
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,880
Is that even one, or did you just say syllables and ended it at three?

547
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Harg-Barkerman.

548
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
I said Op-Crockleman.

549
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
That's not one.

550
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
No.

551
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Nice.

552
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,820
So I'm rewarding you this luck for making it this far, I guess, in the plot and also

553
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,560
doing the cool stuff you do.

554
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:22,840
Now from here on out, I will say, if I don't award you luck, if you do something cool and

555
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,100
you think that you deserve luck, go ahead and call me out and be like, can I get some

556
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
luck for that?

557
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,400
Like a waiter demanding a tip.

558
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Exactly.

559
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,640
Yeah, I did a really good job tonight.

560
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,480
I know there's only two of you, but I'm doing automatic gratuity.

561
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:44,320
20% is generous and customary, but I really think this was more of a 35 night.

562
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,600
I kind of knocked it out of the park with y'all.

563
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,400
Yeah, so that's allowed.

564
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
And also...

565
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,960
Okay, I think I deserve more luck.

566
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Yeah, me too.

567
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
You don't.

568
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,500
I think I would have had a stronger case.

569
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,140
So from here on out, let's go ahead and do that.

570
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,660
And hopefully the luck economy can start changing more throughout.

571
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:12,980
I'm hoping not only will I try to put you in situations where maybe luck is more necessary,

572
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,660
that's just going to happen based on the story that we're playing.

573
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,680
And also keep doing cool stuff, keep role playing well, and you'll gain more luck.

574
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,340
Can we speculate and trade luck?

575
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
No.

576
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,340
Okay, well...

577
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
I'm going to short luck, Joe.

578
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,740
So it's not really an economy.

579
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,080
I think you're going to get luck tonight, okay?

580
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,840
I bet you 50 luck you get luck tonight.

581
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,080
But yeah, I bet you 10% of that luck that you will get luck.

582
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
I don't understand it.

583
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
So...

584
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Why would he make that bet?

585
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
Yeah, like I give you luck if I'm lucky?

586
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,280
Yeah, and if you're not, then I give you a little bit of luck and you get some anyway.

587
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,180
Let's think about this later.

588
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,040
I have no idea where to start.

589
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,960
So we're all sitting, we're literally standing there in a stunned silence, and then we would

590
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,580
probably reiterate, so uh, what do you feel this like, that old man, that the world isn't

591
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,580
as we know it?

592
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,320
Probably got something to do with all the shit that we've seen recently.

593
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,660
She was talking about saving humanity, like that's some heavy shit.

594
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,660
That's super hero shit.

595
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,780
Isn't that why we became police officers?

596
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,600
To save humanity.

597
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,580
Why did you become a police officer, Keith?

598
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,940
Well, it seemed easy, and so far it's been pretty easy.

599
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,820
So the...

600
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,620
They didn't trust me to be a doctor.

601
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,060
The thing that I've devoted my life to, you got into because it was easy?

602
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,580
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

603
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
Oh Keith.

604
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:44,900
I mean, I graduated, well, I wasn't the, I was in the class, yeah, I graduated at the,

605
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
in the class.

606
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,020
I wasn't the top of my class, but...

607
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
Well that's something.

608
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,940
Yeah, I graduated from the police academy.

609
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,780
I also love the movie police academy, that's one reason, cause I was hoping that I'd work

610
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,520
with somebody that could make cool noises.

611
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,820
What if you tried to bring that to the table yourself?

612
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
No, I'm not very good at it.

613
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
You could be the cool noises guy.

614
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,820
I don't really have any skills.

615
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Try a helicopter.

616
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
That's it, Landy.

617
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,820
Just keep working.

618
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,820
Um, no.

619
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
Anyway, yeah, it's been super easy.

620
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
Oh yeah, it's been super easy.

621
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
It's been super easy.

622
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,820
It's been super easy.

623
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,820
It's been super easy.

624
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,820
It's been super easy.

625
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
It's been super easy.

626
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,420
Anyway, yeah, it's been super easy.

627
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,620
Oh yeah, the Delta...

628
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Uh, fuck.

629
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,620
The mysterious organization.

630
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,620
So do you think we're dealing with some like X-Files type...

631
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,620
I'd say exactly like X-Files.

632
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,620
What's X-Files?

633
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,620
No, Clark would definitely know what X-Files is.

634
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,620
Like, like a fictionalized ancient aliens?

635
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,820
Okay, so we, we have no information about what she just said, but I feel like it makes

636
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,820
sense.

637
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,220
She asked us to stop the incursion.

638
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,820
Do you think the incursion could be that black oily goo we've been seeing?

639
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,820
It seems like exactly...

640
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,820
That could be it.

641
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
Yeah, that's, that seems like the incursion to me.

642
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,820
How do we stop it though?

643
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,820
We get a...

644
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,420
Dude, we should find out what this bag is made out of and make a big, big one and just

645
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,420
put it...

646
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,420
Over the town.

647
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
Over the town.

648
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Like a dome.

649
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
Well, uh...

650
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,780
Like the Simpsons movie.

651
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,220
Me and John ran into this guy yesterday who was sucking it up in a vacuum and it seemed

652
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,100
to be working for a while there.

653
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
And yeah, it, it just worked.

654
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,100
Like a drive-back?

655
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Yeah.

656
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,220
It kind of looked like just a hoo, it was, did it look like a Hoover?

657
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
I think you described it.

658
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,220
Like a wet-vac?

659
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,220
H-vac?

660
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,500
It was a, like a, yeah, like just a normal upright vacuum with a bag.

661
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,260
Yeah, it just looked like a normal upright vacuum with a bag.

662
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,200
It also had a hose, like a wand.

663
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,300
Should we put an alert out for all citizens to be at the ready?

664
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,940
Well, what about those gather their vacuums?

665
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,100
Didn't they mention something about a couple of kids missing?

666
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
I think that was unrelated.

667
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Yeah, I don't know about that.

668
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
We were in the area.

669
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,100
Yeah, that's...

670
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
Was that not kind of where you guys were?

671
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,180
No, we'll probably have to investigate that when we get finished with all this stuff.

672
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
Okay, yeah.

673
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
They probably just ran away.

674
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:58,140
I know that we just got a lot of weird shit thrown at us, but we were going to go check

675
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,140
out the mill before, you know, the whole house explosion.

676
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,100
That can definitely be our next step.

677
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,460
Wait, weren't we all going to split up and go to, we had three different places we were

678
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,460
going to go to.

679
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
Yeah, at the end.

680
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
It was the mill?

681
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
We talked about that.

682
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
What was the other two places?

683
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,420
The mill, the church, because the church has a helmet.

684
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,620
The third place was investigating the chief's father, but that's the mill.

685
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,280
So he worked at the mill, so, okay, so we need to check out the helmet at the church

686
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,860
and the mill and the chief's father.

687
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,800
I feel like there was a third, a real third, third thing.

688
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,180
Were there any property crimes we needed to investigate?

689
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,380
Like any break-ins, random home?

690
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,380
What about the trashings?

691
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,420
Well, no, the hospital burnt down, but there's some of the hospital burnt.

692
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,460
Yeah, the hospital burnt down.

693
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,460
It's...

694
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
But we weren't going to do that.

695
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,780
While you guys are talking, you hear Drew's phone start ringing and he picks it up.

696
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,980
Drew, Andrew, Contingent Police Department, can you hold for a moment of silence for our

697
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,980
chief?

698
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,100
Oh, you have what?

699
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,100
Okay.

700
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Okay.

701
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,100
Yeah.

702
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
I'll send them right over.

703
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:09,380
Uh, hey, officers, Gary Daley has information about the chief's house blowing up.

704
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,820
You guys would know that Gary Daley is the longtime partner of Harry Klinker and he's

705
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,000
also the owner operator of The Daily Pho.

706
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The Daily Pho?

707
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The Daily Pho?

708
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,980
Is that like a Korean or a Vietnamese newspaper?

709
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:34,660
Uh, no, it is a, uh, is The Daily Pho spelled D-A-L-Y, as in Gary Daley, and it is a pho

710
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,780
restaurant located in the northeast corner of downtown Contingent.

711
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,220
You'd know this place has been around for generations.

712
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
Damn.

713
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,220
Okay.

714
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,060
Let's, uh, I think we should not split up as long as possible.

715
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Not yet.

716
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,060
No, yeah.

717
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,060
I still want you guys in here.

718
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,060
Yeah.

719
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,900
I'm kind of a lone wolf, but I'll stick with you guys for now.

720
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,300
We're going to head over to Gary.

721
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,300
Gary's.

722
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,300
Okay.

723
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Yeah.

724
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,180
He's at his place of business in northeast downtown is where The Daily Pho sits.

725
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,780
When you guys walk in, there are lots of pictures hanging on the walls of the history of this

726
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:12,060
restaurant, including one very large picture of four generations of Daley's, a young Gary

727
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,020
Daley, his mother, grandmother, and great grandfather.

728
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,460
They had all owned and operated this restaurant at one time or another.

729
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,700
There are also a bunch of prints with black and white designs on them.

730
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,880
One is a circle with a star inside of it.

731
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,860
Inside that star is another star, and there are a couple of triangles, curved lines and

732
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,080
tiny circles as well.

733
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,380
Another is a tree branch with three twigs growing on one side and two twigs growing

734
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,960
on the other.

735
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,340
Another print is a black circle with six black dots surrounding it.

736
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:55,700
Another is a wonky question mark with lines, one curved and one straight jutting down from

737
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,780
the question marks dot.

738
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,100
And behind the counter comes walking an older man, but he dresses very hip.

739
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,560
He's wearing jeans cuffed halfway up his calves and a nice short-sleeve button down with tiny

740
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,540
cartoon bean sprouts printed all over it.

741
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:20,900
He walks up to you and immediately says, do you guys remember, you guys, hey officers,

742
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:26,660
hey, do you guys remember when I would help watch you down at clinkers when you were but

743
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,300
wee little fellas?

744
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Sure do.

745
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Absolutely, yeah.

746
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,300
Good to see you again.

747
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Thanks.

748
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,900
All right, come on, come on back, come on back here.

749
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,320
And he, uh, and he starts walking back to a little office in the, in the back of the

750
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
daily pho.

751
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,620
Real quick, the symbols on the wall, were they like framed photos?

752
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
How what were they?

753
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
They're prints, right?

754
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,620
They're prints.

755
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
Okay.

756
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,620
Yeah.

757
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,620
So they were like, like on paper, just yeah, they were just framed prints.

758
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
Okay.

759
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,620
Pretty artsy.

760
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,620
Cool.

761
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
We're back in the office at this point.

762
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,520
I do want to have a room in my house someday where I've just got a bunch of fucking pictures

763
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
of prints.

764
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,240
And I'm like, Hey, do you guys want to come see all my, my framed prints?

765
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Nice.

766
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,240
Okay.

767
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
So we're in his office, his office.

768
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Yeah.

769
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,960
And he sits down behind a small desk.

770
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,120
I, there's a tiny desk on three.

771
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Yes.

772
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
He begins singing for you.

773
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,600
Uh, what a beautiful lullaby Gary.

774
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,720
Just like it's like he used to sing to everybody.

775
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
Come on down.

776
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,620
We're at the daily fall.

777
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,420
You got to get your fall.

778
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,980
And um, I remember those commercials and didn't run too long.

779
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,740
So thanks for calling Gary.

780
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:44,260
There's a, there's in the office, there's one chair on the other side of the desk.

781
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,500
So I don't know if somebody wants to sit down or if you guys are all standing.

782
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
My feet hurt.

783
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
So I'm going to sit down.

784
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
I stay standing.

785
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Yeah.

786
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
John says, okay.

787
00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:00,020
He says, uh, so it's, uh, it's kind of an embarrassing story, but, uh, I, I heard that

788
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,660
all, uh, Harold Dorsey was in town from the city and you know, he's got a pretty popular

789
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,780
blog these days and I wanted him to write a blog post about the daily fuss.

790
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:17,400
So I wasn't, I wouldn't call it stalking, but I was kind of following him around town

791
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,740
when I realized where he was.

792
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,020
And uh, I followed him over to the, to the chief's house.

793
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:32,460
Uh, didn't realize it was, it was that house at the time, but, uh, we saw, uh, I, I guess

794
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:40,540
I was watching him watch, uh, the, there's a, the chief's car pulled up and the chief

795
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:46,260
and uh, James, you know, James and uh, another guy got out.

796
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
I'm sorry.

797
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,260
I'm sorry.

798
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
James.

799
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,780
He's a mononym.

800
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
Yeah.

801
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,060
He's just James.

802
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,060
He works at the mill.

803
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,180
He lives over in the suburbs.

804
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,180
You guys don't know James.

805
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,440
He's a cool guy.

806
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
He was a cool guy.

807
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Right.

808
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
What do you, what do you mean?

809
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,780
We don't talk about ongoing investigation.

810
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,700
Just go ahead and finish your story.

811
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,340
Then we'll forget about it.

812
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,340
Okay.

813
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:13,260
Well, uh, yeah, no, we saw the, uh, that other guy, I didn't recognize him, but he had the

814
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,860
chief and uh, and James at gunpoint and he was walking him into the house.

815
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,580
I thought that was really scary.

816
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:27,140
But then, you know, Dorsey, Dorsey left pretty quickly and I kept following him cause I wanted

817
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,180
that blog written.

818
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:34,380
And so he went to the police department and then I guess he went and picked up Drew and

819
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,980
they, they went back to the chief's house and so Drew was with him the second time.

820
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,980
That's his name, right?

821
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,860
The guy, your little fellow who works down there, he's Drew.

822
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,860
Cool.

823
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,860
Yeah.

824
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,860
Hey Gary.

825
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,740
So at gunpoint, how did chief look?

826
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,020
Did she, did she look scared?

827
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,300
Did she look like she'd been hurt previously?

828
00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:00,420
I didn't really get a great view of it honestly, but uh, yeah, I mean, you know, she, she didn't

829
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,660
look herself.

830
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
That's for sure.

831
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,300
You know, she, she wasn't, she wasn't standing tall and proud like, like chief cook would,

832
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
you know?

833
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,760
Yeah, no, her and James got walked in there and you know, I was pretty scared, but I wanted

834
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,140
to follow Dorsey and see where he went next.

835
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
You know?

836
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,380
He followed him instead of calling in to the police.

837
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,980
Well he was going, I mean, he was going to the police.

838
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,380
I guess I didn't know that at the time, but I was pretty flustered, you know, it was a

839
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,380
crazy situation.

840
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,060
Gary, I've known you for a long time, man, you know I love you, but you had to have made

841
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,060
that call, man.

842
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,060
I'm sorry.

843
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,980
You know, the past is the past though and we got to move forward.

844
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:46,420
It just seems like maybe, obviously you're not directly responsible for anyone's demise,

845
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,140
but John Lee Pettymore has definitely seen it that way.

846
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:55,060
I mean, he looks really sad when you question him on it and he's like, I know, I'm sorry.

847
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,860
I mean, I certainly didn't expect the chief's house to up and explode on us.

848
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,900
That's certainly not what I expected to be the next course of action.

849
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,500
But you saw a person held at gunpoint.

850
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,820
That's not, you don't see that every day.

851
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,660
That's you got to say something when you see something.

852
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,880
I was scared.

853
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,780
Can you, can you give me a description of that other guy?

854
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,780
Which one?

855
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,140
The one that held him at gunpoint?

856
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,780
I mean, he was just a guy, you know, he was wearing all black.

857
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,300
I couldn't really get much on him.

858
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,780
I didn't recognize him, but was he, was he fat?

859
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,780
No, he was pretty fat.

860
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,780
Wait, I have a question.

861
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,940
Did we ever send, did we ever get any like of the dental record stuff figured out?

862
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,100
Did we send that off?

863
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,140
That was, I think our third thing we were going to try and that's what I was just thinking.

864
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,140
Okay.

865
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,100
And then you also, you mentioned Harold had a, had a blog.

866
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,220
Do you remember the name of that blog or the address for it?

867
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,700
Well, when you look up Harold Dorsey, you know, you, you'll find his blog.

868
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,480
I think it's called, uh, what's behind Dorsey BAM.

869
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,760
That's it.

870
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,880
It's called what's behind dorsey.com dot blog, spot.com.

871
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,700
So is Dorsey spelled like his name or like Dorsey name D O R S C Y.

872
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
Yeah, that guy's super duper clever.

873
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,060
I wish I could be like him.

874
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,060
Yeah.

875
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,020
He's a, he's real smart.

876
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,020
He was.

877
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,260
He's also a great writer.

878
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,420
I mean, he worked in the city for a long time.

879
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,220
So did you follow, you followed him to the police station and then you followed them

880
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,220
back to the house?

881
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,220
Yeah.

882
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,220
And then what?

883
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,580
Well, they went in there and I, I hung out for a little while, but then it got late and

884
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,080
I had to go help close.

885
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,980
So I just left and uh, came back here.

886
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,980
Could you guess how long you waited?

887
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,980
How long they were in there?

888
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,660
Oh, I only waited like 15 minutes.

889
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,060
I wasn't, you know, I wanted, you know, him to write something, but I figured I could

890
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,300
always, you know, catch him the next day.

891
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,540
Maybe if he stayed in town, it was pretty late already at that point.

892
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,420
So I figured he was going to stick around.

893
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,580
About what time was that?

894
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,580
I don't know.

895
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,060
It was around 1am maybe.

896
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,060
I don't know.

897
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,060
Okay.

898
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,620
No, it was later than that.

899
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,500
Now I can't remember, but they were having some trouble closing down here.

900
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,020
And so it was, it was around insert time.

901
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,340
Yeah, no joke.

902
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,140
Uh, wait, what time did I get there?

903
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,140
Like two.

904
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,700
That's why he's having trouble placing it.

905
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,780
I think it was like around two o'clock, but I don't because our stakeout was at one o'clock.

906
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,060
I was there from one 30 to one 45 am.

907
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,060
Exactly.

908
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,060
Thank you.

909
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,060
Thank you, Gary.

910
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,420
I time myself in all my endeavors.

911
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,380
So they pulled up in Maggie's car, all of all three of them.

912
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,700
Yeah, I think so.

913
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
Who was driving?

914
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,900
I think it was, I think it was the chief and they were in her cruiser.

915
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,900
Yeah.

916
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,900
Well they were in her.

917
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,380
Uh, yeah, they were in her car, her police cruiser.

918
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,660
Is that what you said?

919
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,660
Yeah.

920
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,660
Is there something?

921
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,820
This is Joe asking you guys, is there a better question we can ask to get more information

922
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,820
about the gunman?

923
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,820
I don't know.

924
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,900
I was trying to lead him with the fat and I was going to keep going, but all I remember

925
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,500
was he was fat and dead.

926
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,940
I mean, we were assuming it's the guy at the table.

927
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,020
I, yeah, I don't.

928
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,900
I just wondered if there was a way we could get even more because the guy at the table

929
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,740
was the one eating Maggie's foot and his, was it his, it was his own foot that was cut

930
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,740
off.

931
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,740
Right?

932
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,740
You, you have no idea.

933
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,740
I mean, he was missing a foot.

934
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,740
His foot was missing.

935
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,380
Her foot was missing and there are two feet in the, yeah, so I figured we can't jump to

936
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,380
any conclusions.

937
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,220
It's a good pun.

938
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,220
Two people can't.

939
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:18,340
Did the, did the gunman have any like tattoos or scars?

940
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,300
Oh yeah, he had a big scar.

941
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,420
He's all covered up by a giant tattoo.

942
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,500
His whole face was missing.

943
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
His whole face was scarred up.

944
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,100
Across his forehead it said Jerry, Jerry Pinkerton.

945
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,820
His whole face was scarred up.

946
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,820
Was it?

947
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,820
Oh yeah.

948
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,820
Yeah, no, actually he did.

949
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,580
He had a pretty big scar over, over one eye.

950
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,580
How about that?

951
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:46,140
That seems like a prominent feature that could help you.

952
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,980
Keith is trying to remember super hard whether or not the guy at the table had a scar over

953
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,980
his eye.

954
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,340
You would remember that he was not overweight.

955
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,340
He was not overweight.

956
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,540
Oh, that's the one thing I thought I knew.

957
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,540
I thought he was.

958
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,540
I thought he was a fat guy.

959
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,860
The one descriptor I think that was used to describe the guy hunched over was he was unkempt.

960
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,860
Fuck.

961
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,900
Unkempt.

962
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,900
Yeah.

963
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,900
Unkempt.

964
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,060
So this guy was fat and had a scar on his eye.

965
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,060
Yeah.

966
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,060
Was he tall or short?

967
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,060
He was kind of shortish.

968
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,140
Okay, so short, overweight, had a scar on his, which eye?

969
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,580
The one on my side.

970
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,580
So the right?

971
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,580
Sure.

972
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,460
So how many people did you, you saw, he saw him taking Maggie and who at gunpoint?

973
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,460
James.

974
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,460
Oh yeah.

975
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,820
The mononym to James.

976
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,820
So was-

977
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,820
He's a crazy fella.

978
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:39,340
He was wearing all sorts of, he was wearing one of those white over, over, what are they

979
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,340
called?

980
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,020
It's the stuff that you wear when you don't want stuff on your clothes.

981
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,020
Overall?

982
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,020
Coveralls.

983
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,620
James was wearing white coveralls.

984
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,620
Yeah.

985
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,620
Um.

986
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,940
And then, so was Dorsey already in the house?

987
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,940
I guess.

988
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,940
I don't know.

989
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,940
You were following him though.

990
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,940
Oh yeah.

991
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,940
No, they weren't in the house yet.

992
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,940
No.

993
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,420
When we saw those people, Dorsey was just watching as well.

994
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,280
That's before he went to the police station.

995
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,920
So Dorsey was not in the house before he went to the police station?

996
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,920
Correct.

997
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,120
Does Clark know James?

998
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,120
Uh, no.

999
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,120
Can you tell me more about James?

1000
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,120
What'd he look like?

1001
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,860
Oh he had like, his hair was going all over the place and he was wearing those white coveralls.

1002
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,960
You seem to know a lot about him though, do you know if he and the chief were friends?

1003
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,760
I never saw him together.

1004
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,520
Uh, James, he moved to town not that long ago and well, it was probably a couple years

1005
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,120
ago but that's, you know, pretty new kid in town for around here in contention.

1006
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,880
How old of a guy is he?

1007
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,880
James?

1008
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,880
Yeah.

1009
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,880
Well I don't know, he's middle aged or so.

1010
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,280
Maybe a little younger.

1011
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,360
Very helpful, Gary.

1012
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,040
He's a little younger than middle aged.

1013
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,720
38.

1014
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,720
Seems right.

1015
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:50,240
Gary, not to digress, what, those prints you have in your restaurant, do those have

1016
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,640
any special meaning to you?

1017
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:58,400
Are you, I mean, I, yeah, they're fun, I mean, you know, I'm really into like magics and

1018
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,200
stuff like left hand, right hand path stuff, so.

1019
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,200
Magic stuff?

1020
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,160
Well, you know, just like fun, like a cult-y type stuff, I'm like pretty into that kind

1021
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,160
of thing.

1022
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,240
I used to be more into it, but.

1023
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,880
How much do you know about all that?

1024
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,800
I mean, I read a fair amount, I'm like really into that kind of stuff.

1025
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,600
It's really, I don't know, it's like, it's fun to think that maybe there's more to the

1026
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,160
world than there is, but, you know.

1027
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,640
Do you believe it or is it just like a fantasy kind of thing?

1028
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,200
Well, I mean, it's just like being into sports or anything else, you know, it's like, oh,

1029
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
that's fun.

1030
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,640
If we had a bunch of questions, hypothetically, about a cult-y type stuff, you think you might

1031
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,440
know information that could shed some light on those things?

1032
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,280
Well, I've read quite a bit, I could probably point you in the right direction.

1033
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Right on.

1034
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
Good to know, good to know.

1035
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,280
What do those symbols mean?

1036
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,600
What do they symbolize?

1037
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
Which one?

1038
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,600
All of them.

1039
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,440
The one with the dark circle with the circle, the other dots around it.

1040
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
What's that one?

1041
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,440
What if we go in order?

1042
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,160
All right, I mean, yeah, sure, why not?

1043
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:08,460
The one with the circle with the other circles around it is, it's this old ancient sign for

1044
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:14,640
this weird group that used to exist, maybe, I don't know, have you ever, I forget, it's

1045
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,760
like this group that tries to like keep the world together kind of thing.

1046
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,240
What are they called?

1047
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,880
They're called the circle of knowledge.

1048
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,880
How many people were in it?

1049
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,880
Oh, I don't know.

1050
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,560
I mean, it's probably not real.

1051
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,560
It's like the Illuminati.

1052
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,560
Okay.

1053
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,400
How about the one with the tree branches?

1054
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,400
Oh, I don't know much about that one.

1055
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,760
That's just, it was on a bunch of old texts that I've seen around before and I always

1056
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,760
liked it.

1057
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,760
I thought it was real pretty.

1058
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
Seen around where?

1059
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,040
Oh, at different museums and different libraries and such.

1060
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:54,280
And in relation to any particular culture or across many cultures and times.

1061
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,240
Seems like probably the latter.

1062
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,200
And then there's one that's like some stars and some swirls and some triangles.

1063
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:08,920
Oh yeah, that one's just like a fun take on like the chaoticness of the universe.

1064
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,960
Has my voice changed during this conversation?

1065
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,600
It's it's no more than usual.

1066
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,760
It's consistent enough.

1067
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,760
Yeah.

1068
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,720
I'm not like, Whoa man, who am I talking to?

1069
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,720
All right, cool.

1070
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,520
Yeah, no, as long as you know, it's me, Gary.

1071
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,520
Wait, were there four?

1072
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,080
How about the weird question mark one?

1073
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,120
Oh, that one's about a land unknown.

1074
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,680
Do you know anything about it?

1075
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,080
Officer Vigna, why would you ask me such a silly question?

1076
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,080
I'm just goofing.

1077
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
You're funny.

1078
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,080
New boot goofing.

1079
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,080
A land unknown.

1080
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,080
Well, that's, that's mysterious.

1081
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,200
Can you tell us more about the circle of knowledge?

1082
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,600
I mean, all I really know about it is like, maybe there's like one person in the middle

1083
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,760
and then maybe six people underneath that person and they hold the knowledge of the

1084
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,320
universe or something like that.

1085
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
I don't know.

1086
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,320
It seems cool though.

1087
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,320
It's a pretty sweet design.

1088
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:03,480
You seem, you seem a little casual about all these, but you've, you've taken the trouble

1089
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,200
to get these nice prints made and had them put up in your restaurant.

1090
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,200
Oh yeah.

1091
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
I'm a fan.

1092
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,280
If we, so you, you put these up though.

1093
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,440
They haven't been, how long have they been in the restaurant for?

1094
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,080
I put them up 30 years ago.

1095
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,080
Okay.

1096
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,960
The pho restaurant when your great grandfather had it.

1097
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,960
Yeah.

1098
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,960
The daily pho.

1099
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,520
It's been called that since my great grandfather started it.

1100
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,600
Do you know how he got around contentions, extremely strict obscenity loss?

1101
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,780
Yeah.

1102
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,780
One continent.

1103
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,780
There you go.

1104
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,780
All right.

1105
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,780
Okay, Gary.

1106
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,840
Well, do you guys have anything else for him or you haven't seen James today at all?

1107
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
Have you?

1108
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,840
No.

1109
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,560
Where do you think we, do you have James's number or any contact information for him?

1110
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,920
I'm pretty sure he lives over in the suburbs, but I don't know.

1111
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,960
Do you have an exact address or do you have a phone book perhaps?

1112
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,320
Uh, yeah, I've got a phone book.

1113
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,080
All businesses have a phone book.

1114
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,080
That's what I figured.

1115
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,400
Throw that phone book over here.

1116
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,400
Let me.

1117
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,400
He throws the book at you.

1118
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,680
I, it hits, it hits me.

1119
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,680
Get it?

1120
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,680
Oh, ha ha.

1121
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,680
You're in jail man.

1122
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,680
Like a, like a police officer.

1123
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1124
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,680
Well.

1125
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,680
Would do.

1126
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,680
Yeah.

1127
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,680
Okay.

1128
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,880
I flip through the phone book.

1129
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,880
Oh shit.

1130
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,880
His name is James.

1131
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,520
How do I find this guy?

1132
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,520
It's a monitor.

1133
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,320
I'm looking for the only guy named just James.

1134
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,320
Okay.

1135
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,800
I'm looking, I go to the J's and I start looking for just James.

1136
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,200
When you go through the phone book, you do find a person, last name, James, comma, just.

1137
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,320
Let me, I'm going to ring him up.

1138
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,320
Oh, there's no phone number.

1139
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,320
There's just an address.

1140
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,320
Okay.

1141
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,320
I write the address down.

1142
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,880
That's the only, there's not any that is just the single James.

1143
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,440
Actually three James mononyms.

1144
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,440
Yeah.

1145
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,840
Let me go to M and look up mononym.

1146
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,240
James.

1147
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,240
Yeah.

1148
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,240
Is there any, any luck with that?

1149
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,240
Roll luck.

1150
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,360
James, James, James, and cool James.

1151
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
That's a crit fail.

1152
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,360
Yeah.

1153
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
There's nothing there.

1154
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,360
The phone book catches fire.

1155
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,360
Okay.

1156
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,360
Well, uh, he gets angry at you.

1157
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,360
He's like, get out of my restaurant.

1158
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:07,760
So I have the address for just James, but we know he works at the mill and we also have

1159
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,760
business.

1160
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,080
You guys want to go to the mill?

1161
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,080
Yeah, I do.

1162
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,520
But Gary, you know that circle of knowledge thing.

1163
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,520
That's a cool idea.

1164
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,040
Do you know of any of anything around today that might still carry on that mission?

1165
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,940
Well, it said that the circle of knowledge is all inclusive and all seeing and all abroad

1166
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:27,360
the stores of America and across the world itself.

1167
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,360
So yeah.

1168
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,360
Okay.

1169
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,360
Okay.

1170
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,360
Well definitely.

1171
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,960
I mean, it seems like trying to think, nope, we're good.

1172
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,960
Appreciate it.

1173
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,960
Thanks.

1174
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,280
Uh, do you guys want any pho?

1175
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,840
I was just about to say, we just had, we just had breakfast.

1176
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,120
I just watched Keith eat a big old mess of beans.

1177
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,120
So many beans.

1178
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,080
I can back some noodles up to go with some broth.

1179
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,960
I've been thinking about calling him beans.

1180
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,760
Did he like beans as a baby?

1181
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,760
This one?

1182
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,760
No, he liked cut up hot dogs.

1183
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,760
Oh, good.

1184
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,760
Pull.

1185
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,760
Was that from earlier?

1186
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,760
That was like episode one.

1187
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,760
That's all he ate.

1188
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,760
Ever.

1189
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,760
He's the pinky cedar I'd ever seen.

1190
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,760
Or maybe the least picky.

1191
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:32,000
How am I, the only one trying to pull over, how am I, the only one trying to pull over,

1192
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,480
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?

1193
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:53,560
There's nobody home, nobody home, nobody home.
