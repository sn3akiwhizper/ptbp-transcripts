1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
What is up my babies, do y'all know what time it is?

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,220
It's time for your ear holes to get filled up by y'alls truly, Wolf, the dog.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:18,480
And your ears are absorbing these sounds from Contentions greatest radio show, broadcasting

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,640
from 694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf was submitted by a listener who tagged that pretending pod

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,220
in their Instagram story.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,240
What a fuckin' champ, spreading the good news like that.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,120
They write, Better buckle up baby, because your new favorite band, Buckle Up Baby, is

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,800
dropping their first tape this Friday, March 8th.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,720
Don't sleep on this one, don't be late.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,000
If you like fun, then save the date.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,460
Buckle Up Baby is celebrating their tape release with a live musical performance alongside

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,060
Suzy Trash, Casual Cal, and Contentions own, Kudzu.

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:09,380
This Friday, March 8th at 1703, South Fremont in Springfield, Missouri.

15
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,980
That place sounds made up, y'all.

16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,140
Check out the track and use the internet to learn more.

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:44,460
You are a bad teacher.

18
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,740
Hell yes, my brothers.

19
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,700
Now time for the news.

20
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,420
Listeners were treated to a blast from Clark Bishop's past.

21
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,820
But it was less of a treat for Clark, who found himself locked in the public library

22
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,460
with Gerald Fingerson as the sky turned completely dark.

23
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,860
The doors were locked by a cloaked figure who began chasing after a tall man in a suit.

24
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,740
That sadly was not the worst of it, my babies.

25
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,180
Clark got back home only to find his reality shattering, eventually remembering the confession

26
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,860
of the woman who killed his parents.

27
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,920
Man, I didn't know they had a new Clark dirty like that.

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,580
Back in the real world, the officers went to the Daily Fur after Gary Daly called in

29
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,400
to report information about the chief's disappearance.

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,020
They learned the chief arrived to her home accompanied by James, who works at the mill,

31
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,180
and another man who held them at gunpoint.

32
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,100
The gunman was in all black and had a scar over his eye.

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,700
Gary Daly saw this because he was following Harold Dorsey, the writer from the city who

34
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,280
took Drew to the chief's home.

35
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,400
The officers, always utilizing their time mighty efficiently, spent a while asking Gary

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,780
Daly about the art he was hanging in his restaurant.

37
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,860
Now y'all know your old buddy Wolf is a connoisseur of sorts of the arts, but the only art he

38
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,900
ever has time for is Kudzu's No Backbone.

39
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:51,500
All right, welcome everybody.

40
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,620
We are doing flashbacks today and right now we're doing a John Lee Pettymore's flashback

41
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,460
and our friend Justin is here with us today to play, who are you playing?

42
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,300
I am playing one Don D. Pettymore.

43
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,580
And who is that?

44
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,920
I am this John Lee Pettymore's uncle.

45
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Kind of uncle.

46
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm his dad's cousin, but I'm only like 13, 14 years older than him.

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Yeah.

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Does that sound good?

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Mm-hmm.

50
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Does it sound good?

51
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
I need to look at the mic more.

52
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,880
Can I rearrange it really quick?

53
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,960
Just pretend like the mic is...

54
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
One with me?

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,180
A muppet that you never want to kiss, but that always wants to kiss you.

56
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
But you want to get real close?

57
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,860
You got to stay just out.

58
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,240
You're trying to tease the muppet.

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,120
Something you always want to stay out of.

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,080
Just don't let the muppet get what it wants.

61
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Stay away.

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,240
Never let a muppet get what it wants.

63
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
No.

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
I think that's...

65
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,880
If you give a muppet a cookie.

66
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,200
I mean, crumbs are everywhere.

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
It'll get everywhere.

68
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,240
Have you ever tried to clean a fucking muppet?

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:02,800
All right, so today we are flashing back to an essential moment, a very important time

70
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,880
in the life of John Lee Pettymore.

71
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,460
This is the moment that John Lee Pettymore's sprint car racing career is cut short in a

72
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,320
horrible accident.

73
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,680
And John Lee Pettymore has prepared a little monologue.

74
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
I believe you've prepared some words.

75
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,680
About his experience, yes.

76
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,640
Hold on, let me...

77
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:40,640
What propels a man?

78
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,040
What propels a man to seek glory?

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,660
What propels a man to test his mettle, to meld his talents with that of a machine and

80
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,480
together seek victory?

81
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,720
What was propelling me through the air and towards the hard steel of the Contention County

82
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,040
Speedway's main grandstand?

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,000
I briefly had time to consider all this as I was thrown free of my sprint car and head

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,020
first into the abundant lap of Mrs. Eldora Jane Duncans.

85
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,440
To her great fortune, God saw fit to place a support girder in my trajectory, and that

86
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,000
girder shattered my pelvis and snapped my right leg, sparing Mrs. Eldora the full force

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,720
of my impact.

88
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,520
Dear boy, Elvis Jr. was not as lucky.

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,420
The flying buckle of my defective safety harness took his eye in an instant.

90
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,760
God was all out of girders.

91
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,080
What propels a man?

92
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,100
I didn't figure that one out before I lost consciousness, but as I flew towards the grandstands

93
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,760
I could see with perfect clarity who had propelled me there.

94
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,400
Laura Jetty.

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Dickhead.

96
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Chucklefuck.

97
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Shitbird.

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,620
King of the sprint racing circuit.

99
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,300
She had cut across my line and forced me into a wall.

100
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,860
The corners I had cut to get there in the first place did the rest.

101
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,780
Ordering a race-used harness in fair condition from eBay wasn't the best idea, but I could

102
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,460
only stretch Uncle Don's money so far.

103
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,360
Turns out it stretched just as far as a young boy's eye, which was farther than my luck.

104
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,420
Every scrap of it that had propelled me here had burnt out.

105
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,940
Don D. Pettymore looked out at the world from dead eyes.

106
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,300
Uncle Don came from the hard side of the family, the side that had starved before and vowed

107
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,300
to never starve again, and now I owed him real money.

108
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,140
Adora's screams grew more distant as I faded out of consciousness, and the last thing I

109
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,260
remember seeing is Uncle Don's unknowable expression, peering straight down at me.

110
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,940
Fuck yeah!

111
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,940
That's some good shit.

112
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,940
Thank you, that's uh...

113
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
I'm not really, uh...

114
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,940
John Lee Pettymore, me, is not the creative writing type, so...

115
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,940
But uh...

116
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,940
My physical therapist, Jane, she really worked me through my shattered pelvis and leg, and

117
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
she suggested that...

118
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
Journaling?

119
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,940
Well, yeah, I mean, in other words...

120
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Writing prose and whatnot?

121
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:12,340
Well, yeah, she suggested that perhaps my mental spiritual self was also shattered like

122
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,340
my pelvis, and that it might help to get some of that out.

123
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,340
Dude, a haiku or two would heal you.

124
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
Haiku?

125
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
That didn't come out right.

126
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Hold up.

127
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
Haiku?

128
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,340
Okay, let me get some of those names.

129
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,340
I crashed into the family of Miss Aldora Jane Duncans.

130
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
Aldora Jane Duncans?

131
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,340
Yeah, married to Elvis Duncans.

132
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,340
How do you spell Duncans?

133
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,340
Duncans like the donuts.

134
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,340
And...

135
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,340
Not like the basketball?

136
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,340
No, also like the basketball, but if you're doing it with an apostrophe.

137
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,340
Okay.

138
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,340
If you're Duncan.

139
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,340
And her son was in the race?

140
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:00,340
No, her son was seated next to her, the young Elvis Duncans Jr.

141
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:06,340
And my safety buckle, which had separated, it was a defective piece of equipment that

142
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,340
what happened there is that it flew into the young boy's eye and took it from him, as

143
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:17,340
the Lord is wont to take many things from us in his mysterious and unknowable mycenations.

144
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
Mycenations.

145
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
Oh, man.

146
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,340
Oh, man, talking so hard.

147
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Talking so goddamn hard, man.

148
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,340
I hate talking.

149
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Fuck.

150
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,340
Okay, so we're going to cut to the scene.

151
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Don and John are sitting in the back of the ambulance from the Contention County Speedway,

152
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:49,340
and the EMT who works there is checking out John, and actually she kind of walks up and

153
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,340
eh, well, eh, there's just no way.

154
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,340
Never going to race again.

155
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,340
I don't see any way around it.

156
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,340
Yeah, I mean, I don't see myself ever getting the money together to get back into something

157
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,340
like this, but how did you know that about me?

158
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:12,340
Oh, no, I just mean that there's no way that you're going to be able to race again, not

159
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,340
around here at least, that's for sure.

160
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,340
You're just, you're an EMT.

161
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,340
You're not involved with the race officials or anything.

162
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,340
Why are you, what a thing to tell a man in recovery.

163
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:29,340
She kind of pulls Don aside, and you can very clearly hear her talking.

164
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:37,340
She's just like, yeah, well, see the issue being that for sure the Duncans aren't going

165
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,340
to take too kindly to their boy losing an eye.

166
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,340
You know how, you know, Patriarch Duncan owns the Contention County Speedway as well as

167
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,340
almost all the speedways in this region.

168
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:58,340
I just don't see any way that he's going to allow Jon to get on the track ever again.

169
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,340
So I think y'all might be done fucked.

170
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,340
My dreams.

171
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,340
My dang dreams.

172
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,340
My dang dreams.

173
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,340
My dang dreams.

174
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,340
What are you trying to tell me?

175
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
That my dream is over?

176
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,340
I turn away from.

177
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Her name is Ernti.

178
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
Ernti.

179
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:25,340
I turn away from Ernti and I look at my boy who, wait, is his dad dead?

180
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,340
Yes.

181
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,340
Okay, I wasn't sure if I, I look at him like he's my own, my own son.

182
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
He is my own flesh and blood.

183
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,340
And I walk over to him and I grab his face and I look at him.

184
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,340
Uncle Don, how?

185
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,340
Look at me boy.

186
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,340
You're going to have to give up on this dream now.

187
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
Don't.

188
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,340
You got to face reality, boy.

189
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,340
No, Don.

190
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,340
You got to face it.

191
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
No, Don.

192
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,340
Why am I going to face it today, Don?

193
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
What am I going to do?

194
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,340
I pull his head gingerly towards my head and give him a warm embrace that I've given no

195
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,340
one before.

196
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
I didn't expect this kind of thing from you.

197
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,340
It's okay, boy.

198
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,340
We're going to be all right.

199
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,340
I owe you so much money.

200
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
Yeah, we're going to figure that out.

201
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,340
Are you going to kill me?

202
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,340
I say nothing.

203
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,340
Whoa.

204
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:21,340
So John asks if Don is going to kill him and Don just stares coldly at him.

205
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:30,340
And next we see Don pushing John in a wheelchair because you can't afford that ambulance ride.

206
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,340
Not after you lost a lot of money in that crash just now.

207
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,340
So you decide to drive and on your way, actually it's kind of weird.

208
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Don, you see these two figures.

209
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,340
John, you don't see this because you're in a wheelchair.

210
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:52,340
But Don, you see these two figures that are watching you from behind, kind of on the side

211
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,340
of the track.

212
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,340
And as you're walking out, they begin approaching you from the back.

213
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:06,680
They are both extremely tall people with large frames, but they are very gaunt and they begin

214
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,020
walking faster and faster toward you.

215
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,680
And they are going to catch up with you if you don't begin to move a bit faster there.

216
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
John, you ready to hustle, boy?

217
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,680
We're getting off this track.

218
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
I'm in a wheelchair, man.

219
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
How am I going to hustle?

220
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
I start shoveling on real quick.

221
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,680
Whoa, Don, we're going too fast.

222
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,180
You guys are flying and Don is just running in a full sprint at this point with John in

223
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,680
the wheelchair ahead of him.

224
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,680
And these two figures are catching up.

225
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
There's no one else around, weirdly enough.

226
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,680
As soon as you see them, no one else seems to be on the track.

227
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,680
And you see as they're approaching on you, Don, you're looking backward as you're running.

228
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:53,680
They're both wearing black suits and their skin is weirdly translucent.

229
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,680
And as you guys are running and running and running, one of them just starts screaming.

230
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:08,680
This, like, weird, banshee type yell is just like...

231
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,680
As they're running toward you and then...

232
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Hey, hey, you fancy, you fancy men, you fucking stay away.

233
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Go on.

234
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Get, get, as you yell, get at these fancy men that are following you.

235
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Fanciest men John Lee Bettymore has ever seen.

236
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,680
You turn back to look at the parking lot and not only is the parking lot full of people,

237
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:47,680
but you do see your car, Don, that you both came in today.

238
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Hell yeah.

239
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
Surrogate, son.

240
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,680
And, actually, large Eddie.

241
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:08,680
Hold up, please give me time to think of a dope Second Cousins fucking pun.

242
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
I got nothing.

243
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
It's hard.

244
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Second Cousins give good loving, that's not very good.

245
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
That's just the Hall & Oates song.

246
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Second Cousins give good loving.

247
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,680
Oh boy, we missed it.

248
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
You missed it, it's my song.

249
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:38,680
As you're looking into the parking lot, you would see that your car is currently being flipped over by large Eddie and his pit grew.

250
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
What the hell, Eddie?

251
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
God damn it, Eddie.

252
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Eddie, you fucking knocked me out of this race, you son of a bitch, you dickhead fuck, and now you're gonna fuck with my car, you piece of shit, and I'm in this goddamn wheelchair?

253
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Eddie, you're gonna rule the day you fucked with the petty, Morris.

254
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,680
I'm gonna do whatever it is I wanna do, cause I'm large Eddie.

255
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:08,680
And he begins walking toward you guys as his crew continues to try to lift, but they're clearly having a harder time now that large Eddie isn't helping them.

256
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
How large is he?

257
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
And so they're trying to make it.

258
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
He's like 6'5", which is not a-

259
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
He's larger than you think would fit in a sprint car.

260
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Not a traditional build for a sprint car driver.

261
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,680
He seems as large as a sprint car is.

262
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:31,680
He is, yeah, he's thick, he's skinny strong though, you know, he's like, he's stringy, but he's real strong looking.

263
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,680
And he walks right up to Don and he's like, say something.

264
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
Do it.

265
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
Do it.

266
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
Do it.

267
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
Don't make me fucking do it, Eddie.

268
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
Say something.

269
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Hey, I'm walking, I'm large Eddie, I'm walking here.

270
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Yo, large Eddie, fucking do it.

271
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
Fucking do it.

272
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Fucking do it.

273
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Do it, dude, push me in the face, dude.

274
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Fucking do it, Don.

275
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Don, you think you got shit?

276
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,680
I take quite a large swing at this gentleman right in the face.

277
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Oh damn, okay.

278
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Oh damn.

279
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Yeah, you swing away, what happens?

280
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,680
I just clock that son of a bitch in the face for fucking with me and my boy cousin.

281
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Large Eddie, you loud-mouthed son of a bitch, that's what you get, you fucking piece of shit.

282
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
God damn, Uncle Don.

283
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
This is man's business now.

284
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Okay, so let me get this straight.

285
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:38,680
This guy walks up, he's talking shit, you hit him, John starts talking shit to this guy on the ground and you tell him to shut the fuck up?

286
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Shut your mouth, bull ass, and respect.

287
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Large Eddie gets up again and looks at you and he just like...

288
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,680
You know, he does that thing where he like grabs his jaw and he starts rubbing it.

289
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Am I close enough in my wheelchair to kick him in the ball with my cowboy boots?

290
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Yeah, you can kick him in the ball.

291
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Okay.

292
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
Do your legs work?

293
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Oh yeah, well, not my right one.

294
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Actually, you know what?

295
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,680
It's inconsistent with the injuries I've received to be able to kick him in the balls.

296
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Very inconsistent.

297
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Anyway, I guess I just think real hard about kicking him in the balls and how cool it would be.

298
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
You want to. Oh, you want to so bad.

299
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
He just sees it in my eyes.

300
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
But it hurts to think about it.

301
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Everything hurts right now, to be honest.

302
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,680
My pelvis is shattered and I haven't been to the hospital yet. I'm just in a wheelchair.

303
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,680
You're extremely concussed. You're just sitting in a wheelchair. He just pushed you very rapidly over what I'm guessing is gravel.

304
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
There are still fancy men chasing us.

305
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
A lot of rocks.

306
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,680
And there are fancy men that might be chasing you. You haven't looked back.

307
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Oh, Justin.

308
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,680
I look back. I assess the situation.

309
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
There's actually no one there.

310
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Oh, that's scary. But good. For the moment, I suppose.

311
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,680
A spooky portent of things to come.

312
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,680
I do think that I need to solve this situation quick and forthright.

313
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,680
So I look at the man. Is the man coming towards me?

314
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,680
He's just, he's doing that thing with his jaw where he's just rubbing it and he's like, ah.

315
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,680
And he just kind of growls and then he spits on the ground.

316
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Now you get the fuck out of our way and let us go about our day.

317
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,680
I got to take this injured boy to the local doctor hospital.

318
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Fine.

319
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Yeah, what do you got to say to that, Eddie?

320
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:22,680
He looks down and he's like, you're going to need to go to the city hospital after I get done with you.

321
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
And he goes to throw a punch at Don.

322
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,680
I mutter under my breath as I catch his hand with my hand.

323
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Catch these hands.

324
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,680
But I'm literally catching his hand.

325
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
And what happens next?

326
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,680
His hand starts a sizzling like a, like a country fried steak on a Sunday morning.

327
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Yeah.

328
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
And smoke starts coming out of it.

329
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
I assume it hurts.

330
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
And he starts screaming.

331
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
He's like, ah.

332
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Oh God. Oh, Don.

333
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
And I'm like, Eddie, you ready to stop, boy?

334
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
I hold on for a couple more seconds.

336
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Oh, it's excruciating.

337
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,680
I drop his hand and then I give him one more in the face again.

338
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
He runs away like a beat dog.

339
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
He, I mean, he just runs away.

340
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
He gets his crew.

341
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,680
They set your car down and he, and he gets out of there as fast as he possibly can.

342
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
I want to shovel my boy into that there car.

343
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I'm going to show him how a real man drives.

344
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Damn, Don.

345
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Why do you got to kick a man while he's down?

346
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
I was driving pretty good today.

347
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
You owe me so much goddamn money.

348
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
I know, Don.

349
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Don, in your concussed state, man, you have no idea what's been going on.

350
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,680
You're just like from one place to the next and then you end up in the hospital.

351
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Did we get brunch with Large Eddie?

352
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
I think we're finished with that.

353
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Did we get brunch with Large Eddie?

354
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Keith Vigna, roll me an intelligence check real quick.

355
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Pass 16 on 50.

356
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
He's very smart.

357
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,680
The hunched over guy, unkempt, was wearing large rubber waders.

358
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Okay.

359
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,680
On his bottom half of his body, like waders.

360
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Wait, I forgot what we know already.

361
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,680
You saw in the house, the guy slumped over with the bolt hole in his head, the unkempt man,

362
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
he was wearing big rubber waders.

363
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
What do we know about James?

364
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Not that.

365
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Go ahead and Clark and John, who has the higher intelligence between you guys?

366
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
I've got a 55.

367
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
75.

368
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
All right, John, go ahead and roll.

369
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,680
57 on a 75.

370
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,680
You would remember that the man with the vacuum in his front yard was also wearing rubber waders.

371
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,680
Also, looking at the address that Keith has written down from the phone book,

372
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,680
you would notice that the address for James is on the same street in the suburbs

373
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,680
as the house that Dr. Marie Jacobs lives in.

374
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Okay.

375
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
So it's likely that that was James.

376
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,680
That the guy in rubber waders that you saw on that street is James.

377
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
We should go to the mill.

378
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Yeah, let's not examine this at all.

379
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
I mean, James is dead.

380
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
Long live James.

381
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
He might not be.

382
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
He was in the house explosion, though.

383
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Was he?

384
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
With a bullet hole in his head.

385
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Oh, that's, yeah, fuck.

386
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,680
He was dead before the house exploded, and he's double dead now.

387
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Double dead.

388
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Double dude?

389
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,680
I guess Joe is asking, why did Keith have that realization suddenly?

390
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
It just reminded him.

391
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,680
I mean, it was a very tense moment when he was going through the house,

392
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,680
and he didn't pick up on every detail that was happening around him at the time.

393
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,680
So I went ahead and had him roll intelligence to recall a detail that had been forgotten to him before.

394
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Perfect.

395
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
I dig it.

396
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,680
I think we ought to follow up on the leads that we were looking at before the whole Nike bag thing.

397
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Well, I mean, from our standpoint, we know our chief is dead, and she was-

398
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,680
As far as we know, but also remember how you came in and talked to Drew, and it wasn't you?

399
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Gary said something.

400
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Keith, that is the first smart thing you have ever said.

401
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
Thank you.

402
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:20,680
I just, I remembered Gary said something along the lines of, she wasn't standing up straight the way that Chief Cook would.

403
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
That is almost police work.

404
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Good work on that there, Keith.

405
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
It might not be Maggie.

406
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:36,680
I mean, I saw her with my own eyes, but these days I don't know if I believe what I see anymore.

407
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,680
We do know that her car, though, was at the mill.

408
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,680
We do know that her car, though, was at the mill for an extended period of time.

409
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,680
Right, and that's why I think we ought to check out the mill.

410
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,680
We ought to, I don't think we need to do the dentist thing anymore, because I'm pretty sure that was James.

411
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
And then what was the other thing?

412
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Oh, the church.

413
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
The helmet.

414
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
Should we go to the church or the mill first?

415
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
I think-

416
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Fuck.

417
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Because her dad worked at the mill, right?

418
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,680
I think the mill is going to tie a lot of things together.

419
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:11,680
Right now, a loose end is that helmet out in civilian hands with God knows what it is.

420
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Let's go get the helmet, because we got all the other things.

421
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
We might as well have it all together.

422
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
That way we know a little more.

423
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,680
We ought to just go do it now, because we have the gun, we have the radio-

424
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Yeah, and the camera.

425
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
And the camera.

426
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
I hate to say this, though.

427
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Maybe we should split up, because time might be of the essence in both these matters.

428
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
I'll go to the church.

429
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
What do you think is more important?

430
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
That's a great question.

431
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
What time is it right now?

432
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Oh, it's probably noon.

433
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,680
I go back in and I get a pho to go.

434
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Pho to go?

435
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
Pho to go.

436
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
A pho to go?

437
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
A pho to go.

438
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
Take home a pho.

439
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Take home a pho?

440
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Do you get the pho to go?

441
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Hey, Gary, what's your most popular pho?

442
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Tri-tip.

443
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Seafood.

444
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Ooh, what kind of- what's a seafood?

445
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Oh, it's got all sorts of tentacles in there.

446
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Yeah, give me that.

447
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
To go, please.

448
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
One small seafood pho to go.

449
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Okay.

450
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Extra pho.

451
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,680
One small seafood pho extra pho coming right up.

452
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,680
What do you guys want you- who should hit where?

453
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,680
I'm just so hesitant to split up.

454
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,680
I just- yeah, off- maybe off mic or just out of character.

455
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,680
I totally feel like Zach is gonna fuck us, and like something's going down at the mill right now,

456
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
and like we have to be there.

457
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
We should not split up.

458
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:36,680
As fun as it is to do, and as fun as it is to like, listen back and how much I fuck up on my own,

459
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
I think maybe we should stick together for this one?

460
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
We shouldn't trust anything to make no-

461
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,680
I think if you guys split up and one of you went to the mill, one of you went to the church,

462
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,680
one of you went to James, the mill worker, like the guy who worked at the mill, his house,

463
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,680
like if one of you went to each of those locations-

464
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
We might have accomplished a lot.

465
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
That would be fine.

466
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
It would be fine.

467
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,680
You say that, but- I mean, okay, what-

468
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Fucking DMs.

469
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
What would-

470
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
I think that you would all have a great time.

471
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
What would a real police station do?

472
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Well, okay, so that's what I was actually going through.

473
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,680
We now have this new purpose given to us by an unknown entity of figuring out crazy shit,

474
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
which would be the helmet.

475
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,680
But, as police officers, we've worked with Maggie for a long time, so the mill would also-

476
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,680
We would have it in our hearts to be-

477
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,680
So that's why I'm saying we're real conflicted about what would be important to us.

478
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Wait, okay, we don't have to ask them any fucking questions.

479
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,680
All we have to do is bust into that church and say-

480
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Give it to us.

481
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,680
We're confiscating this helmet like it's part of the-

482
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
It's evidence in an investigation.

483
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
And then we go to the mill right after.

484
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,680
We will talk to you about it later, but we need that right now.

485
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Let's do it.

486
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Let's try that.

487
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Let's do it. Good police work, guys.

488
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Where's the church at?

489
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Yeah, where's the mill at?

490
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Where's the church at, Keith asks.

491
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Oh, shit, that's real handy.

492
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
That's real handy.

493
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
It's right around the corner for the listener.

494
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Maybe we should go to the mill first.

495
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Where is the mill?

496
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,680
The mill is on the other side of the city.

497
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Of the town.

498
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Of the city.

499
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Oh, really? It's like on the other side of the big city?

500
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
The mill?

501
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Yeah, well, let's definitely go swing by the church and then go out to the city.

502
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
But all these people work there?

503
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
I mean, how far away is it?

504
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
It's like 45 minutes to an hour away.

505
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
It's not a bad-

506
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
I just figured it was like the town's mill.

507
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Same.

508
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
The mill.

509
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Yeah, well, you were fucking wrong.

510
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
The mill.

511
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Let's go over here and then head on out to the mill.

512
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Yeah, I agree.

513
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Let's swing by the church.

514
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
It's literally right around the corner.

515
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
There's no reason not to.

516
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Sounds good.

517
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,680
Are you getting into one vehicle to go?

518
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Let's take all three.

519
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Yeah, let's take all three.

520
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,680
The quickest path to the church of contention would take you over a small bridge.

521
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,680
There is a creek running underneath the bridge.

522
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:50,680
And as you go over the bridge, you would all notice something pretty odd.

523
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,680
The water is filled with animals.

524
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,680
There are dogs and cats hanging out in the water.

525
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:11,680
There are also raccoons, skunks, squirrels, possums, badgers, weasels, and minks all hanging out in the water.

526
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Do I see an old black lab?

527
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Go ahead and search for me.

528
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
Fail, 95 on a 20.

529
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,680
You do not see an old black lab, but you do see all the aforementioned animals.

530
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:33,680
They are all hanging out in what would be the deepest part of the water, the most center part, furthest away from land on either side.

531
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,680
I want to slow down on the bridge, roll down my window, and go, Tyler!

532
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Come here, Tyler!

533
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
You do that.

534
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Any dog come up running my direction?

535
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Do any of the animals look at him at all?

536
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Or are they all focused on something in the creek?

537
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:56,680
All the animals are facing the land, and they all look to be on edge, but they're all in the water.

538
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Do any of the cats resemble Marie Jacobs' cat?

539
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:08,680
In that part of the creek, there are three different black cats that all look to be similar.

540
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Out of character, I'm thinking classic animals, you know, when they know a tornado's coming or some shit like that.

541
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,680
What if they know something we don't?

542
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Because this is a very, very weird thing.

543
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,680
My sanity is at... I pass.

544
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Hell yeah.

545
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Yeah, I passed.

546
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
I passed. 21 on a 41.

547
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Okay. What is your rationalization? Does none of you lose sanity?

548
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Pool party for the animals.

549
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
It's hot outside.

550
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,680
It's hot out.

551
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,680
It's December. I mean, it's unseasonably warm still, I would say, but it is December.

552
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Somebody must have dumped a bunch of real good animal food in that river, upriver, and it's all collected down here.

553
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Maybe the cable factory has exploded.

554
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Out of character, they probably know that maybe the goo or whatever we're fighting can't go...

555
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
Get in water.

556
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
Get in water, yeah.

557
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
I was thinking that too.

558
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,680
But Keith would not ever think that, so...

559
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Why are you slowing down?

560
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
You say over the radio?

561
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
Yeah.

562
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Oh, you know, that Carrie Page, that councilwoman, she lost that dog.

563
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,680
I just thought maybe it ran over here with all these other animals.

564
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
I don't know. Animals are weird. Maybe.

565
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Let's keep going, though. I don't...

566
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Yeah, I didn't see it up there.

567
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,680
I don't care about a councilwoman's dog. Probably the homeless people ate it, right?

568
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Isn't that what she thought?

569
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
That's what she thought.

570
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,680
Yeah, that's what I think too. Maybe she should join the force, too.

571
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Were they feeding dogs?

572
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
That's ridiculous.

573
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
Those homeless people you saw?

574
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Nope.

575
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
That seems really prejudice.

576
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,680
I didn't like it when she said it. I don't like it when you say Keith.

577
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Yeah, well, you weren't stuck on a bus full of stinky, scary people.

578
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Who were not eating dogs.

579
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
At the time.

580
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
You guys pull up to the first church of contention.

581
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
It is one of the largest...

582
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,680
It's the fattest fucking building.

583
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
It's greasy as hell.

584
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
It's some weight, church.

585
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,680
It's one of the largest buildings in contention.

586
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:14,680
The entirety of the wall facing the street is made of enormous windows with a massive stained glass cross in its center.

587
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,680
The parking lot is the size of a football field.

588
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,680
And an electronic sign displays the time, temperature, and the hours of the different services.

589
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,680
It also currently has a slide that says in all caps,

590
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Free meal for anyone who needs it.

591
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Just come inside.

592
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:38,680
As you guys park in the parking lot, go ahead and roll an alertness check for me, John.

593
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
89 on a 60.

594
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
Okay, everything's good to go.

595
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
What do you guys want to do?

596
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,680
What temperature is up on that board?

597
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
48 degrees.

598
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Okay, that was just a wild stab at the dark at the thing I was supposed to pass my alertness roll for.

599
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
I just think we just go in.

600
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Yeah, everything seems fine to me.

601
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Do we know what day it is?

602
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
It's December 4th.

603
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Which is what day of the week?

604
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
It's Thursday.

605
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,680
We gotta get Ramona out of here.

606
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Ramona wanted out. She was just like, I'm gone. You guys are nerds.

607
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,680
If that fucks up the...

608
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,680
I've never thought about it, but how about this?

609
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
That's a good question though, whether it's Sunday or not.

610
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
It started on Monday. How about that?

611
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Monday night was when we started, and so Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

612
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
It's Thursday at noon.

613
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Let's just go in.

614
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,680
There's no reason to call and ask.

615
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,680
We're here to confiscate a piece of evidence.

616
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
So yeah, that's what we're here for.

617
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
And it's a church. There's no way that they're gonna be...

618
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
How full is the parking lot?

619
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,680
There are a handful of cars in the parking lot.

620
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,680
There is also a motorcycle.

621
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,680
I'm gonna stay in the parking lot just in case.

622
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Do you think I ought to stay behind just in case somebody tries to run outside or something?

623
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
I don't know why they would though.

624
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Yeah, why don't you stay here and watch the cruisers?

625
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Yeah, I will.

626
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I'll sit in the cruiser and listen to NPR.

627
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Actually, no. Keith would listen to the classic rock station.

628
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Rock.

629
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
All right, Luke, leave.

630
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Actually, it's the Doobie Brothers.

631
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Oh, I have to leave?

632
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
I mean...

633
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Or just come in with us.

634
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,680
Yeah, I'll go in. I don't wanna say that.

635
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
You know what? That's kind of realistic.

636
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,680
You don't wanna miss out on whatever's going on inside.

637
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Yeah, go in with them.

638
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Okay, cool. So when you guys walk through the front doors, the church is mostly empty.

639
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,680
But you can hear a rumble of noise coming from down the stairs.

640
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Hey, do any of us go to this church?

641
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
I am not a religious man.

642
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
I don't think Clark is.

643
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Maybe when he was a kid.

644
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Yeah, I went here when I was a kid.

645
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
I think we probably all did.

646
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,680
So we know the layout of the church. We just haven't been in a while.

647
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,680
But we probably would have some relationship with the pastor as the only three cops in town, for sure.

648
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Yeah, do we know just the pastor's name?

649
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Yeah, his name is Adam Cain.

650
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Adam Cain.

651
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
We probably do security for church events and shit.

652
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Would I know where Pastor Cain's office is? Or is there maybe signage that would tell me?

653
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Yeah, you could pretty easily find the offices.

654
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,680
I walk in and I unload my full clip screaming for Pastor Cain.

655
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Yeah, I wanna go back into the offices.

656
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
Yeah, we'll follow him.

657
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Okay, cool. Yeah, there is a door that says Head Pastor Adam Cain.

658
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,680
And the door is locked.

659
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
I knock on it.

660
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:38,680
Pastor, it's Clark here. Officer Bishop, we gotta talk to you.

661
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
I knock again.

662
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
You hear no response.

663
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,680
I'm gonna use my lock picking skill to pick the lock.

664
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,680
Keith pulls out his lock picks.

665
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
Wait, wait, wait.

666
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:54,680
While he does that, I go and try to find an administrative assistant or anybody who works here to ask where somebody is.

667
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,680
I did it already though. I got an 18 on a 50.

668
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,680
John, as you turn around to start walking through the church, you hear a click and the door opens.

669
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,680
I'm still gonna do what I was gonna do because we need to find the pastor.

670
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
The door clicks open. I immediately go inside.

671
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Okay.

672
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
So, Clark, what are you doing?

673
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,680
I don't know. I think I'd probably peek in the door behind Keith.

674
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Keith, what are you doing? Get out of there.

675
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Dude.

676
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
It was locked.

677
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
I know. There's not any more.

678
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Do you see the helmet in there?

679
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,680
I walk into the room and sitting on top of the, hold on.

680
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,680
John, you go walking through the church and you actually don't see anyone in the office.

681
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,680
There's a desk for a secretary, but she is or he is not sitting at the desk.

682
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,680
But you do hear that noise coming from, there's a large stairwell that goes downstairs.

683
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
And it sounds like there's-

684
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,680
And the lights are on down there and you can hear noise coming from down there.

685
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
I'm heading down there.

686
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Sounds good.

687
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Back in the office, Keith, you see sitting on the desk of the pastor, there is an old motorcycle helmet.

688
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,680
And it has some tubes on either side of it.

689
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,680
And there are two lights on it, one green, one red, and the red one is lit up.

690
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,680
I look at Clark and I go, yeah, baby.

691
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
And then I grab it.

692
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
No.

693
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,680
I grab it. I don't put it on, but I grab it and I am going to go outside and look at that motorcycle.

694
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Wait, so when he grabbed it, did anything happen?

695
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,680
When you grabbed it, nothing happened, but then you turn around and Clark is-

696
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,680
Keith, we got one of these fucking radio, like switch people's bodies when, I assume when they touch it or something.

697
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:55,680
It's in my, I'm looking at you, like realizing that as you tell me it and it's in my hand, like, well, I just won't put it on, but it seems okay now.

698
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,680
The red lights on, remember the green lights, the one that-

699
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,680
Scary stuff happens.

700
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Scary stuff happens.

701
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Clark, Luke, Keith, do either one of you have microelectronics or-

702
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
I have computer science.

703
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,680
Microelectronics is not a thing.

704
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
Oh, it's not.

705
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,680
You don't have a craft skill or anything?

706
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,680
My craft is lock picking.

707
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,680
Okay.

708
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,680
I have 20 in computer science.

709
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,680
I've got a 50 in forensics.

710
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Okay.

711
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,680
Then, yeah.

712
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
You guys are good?

713
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
Yeah, I don't have anything else that could even close.

714
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,680
Actually, instead of going out to check the motorcycle out-

715
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
Let's go find John.

716
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Yeah, let's go see where John went.

717
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,680
I got the helmet and I'm carrying it like under my arm.

718
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Sounds good.

719
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,680
John, you head down the stairs.

720
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:50,680
As you go down there, you see there's an extremely large room at the base of the stairs and there are a bunch of tables set up.

721
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,680
There is a long line of people.

722
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Each person in line kind of looks down on their luck and the line leads to a serving window where there are a few people scooping pasta and salad onto paper plates.

723
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:14,680
And just past the food is Pastor Adam Cain and he is praying with each person who goes through the line when they grab their food.

724
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,680
He's doing a quick prayer with them and then they head to a table and start chowing down.

725
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,680
I take that all in and I stroll on up to the pastor.

726
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,680
You stroll up to the pastor, Adam Cain.

727
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Adam Cain has a balloon-shaped head.

728
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:35,680
He has eyes that are so dark that the irises look black and he seems to be in his early 30s.

729
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,680
He is quite smooth and steady.

730
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:48,680
Everything he does seems to be deliberate and he's praying with each person who comes through and in between two people, you walk right up to him.

731
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
Good afternoon, pastor.

732
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
Oh, hello, officer.

733
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,680
What are y'all putting on today?

734
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
I mean, nothing in particular.

735
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,680
We're just doing our daily lunch service for anyone who is in need of a free meal.

736
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,680
Real quick, off out of character.

737
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,680
The homeless reports we had gotten, right, were about the homeless disappearing, right?

738
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
Or they were about the being a bunch of homeless?

739
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
An influx of homeless.

740
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
An influx of homeless.

741
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,680
You might be able to shed some light on something for me.

742
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,680
We've been hearing about an awful lot of homeless people coming into contention and you pray with these people.

743
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
You minister to them.

744
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
Have they been telling you where they're coming from?

745
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
What troubles have brought them here?

746
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:38,680
It seems to me that all of these new sheep into the herd of God's kingdom have come from the city.

747
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,680
They all are down on their luck and I am here to feed them.

748
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
Well, that's very Christian of you, pastor.

749
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,680
I do what I think is the right thing.

750
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Hey, you know, the reason I'm here today.

751
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,680
We've been dealing with some things going on in this town.

752
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
Some stuff is coming together.

753
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:04,680
We had a pretty important ongoing investigation and unfortunately, eh, this is gonna just sound strange, but...

754
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:11,680
To the right of you, there are a lot of homeless people piling up who each have their plates waiting for a prayer with Pastor Adam Cain.

755
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Um, I kinda, I am like sideways and I'm like, alright, alright, give me a minute with the pastor.

756
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Ain't got a fucking monopoly on salvation, you homeless fucks.

757
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
I say that all into my breath.

758
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Sorry, pastor.

759
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Here's the long and short of it.

760
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,680
We heard that the church had purchased a helmet from a flea market, a motorcycle helmet.

761
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,680
That is unfortunately related to an investigation we are conducting right now.

762
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
Should have never been on sale. Let's just put it that way.

763
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,680
So we're gonna need to take that in for evidence if y'all still have it.

764
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,680
Uh, yes. It's actually up in my office right now.

765
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,680
I know you got a whole lot of praying and blessing to do, but would you mind taking me up there right now?

766
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
Absolutely not.

767
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,680
Everyone, I'm so sorry. I will be back in a flickscrow of a switch.

768
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Y'all, y'all stay blessed now.

769
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:09,680
And the two of you begin walking up to the stairs right as Keith and Clark come walking down the stairs,

770
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Keith holding the helmet underneath one of his arms.

771
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,680
And as you all approach each other...

772
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,680
Hey, I found the pastor. He's gonna let us in to his office.

773
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
Why?

774
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,680
Oh, uh, pastor, your office was open back there. We found the helmet we needed.

775
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,680
Yeah, the door was wide open and I saw the helmet and I figured, you know, I might as well grab it now,

776
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,680
um, save you the trouble from having to go back up there and then we'd come tell you that we got it and head on our way.

777
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Yeah, pastor, that's all proper procedure and not Vigna being reckless.

778
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
Yeah, I mean...

779
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
That's correct. That's...

780
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,680
There's no reason for you to, yeah.

781
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,680
Uh, Keith, if you could roll persuade for me against his humit.

782
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,680
Oh.

783
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
Fuck.

784
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,680
Oh, fuck no.

785
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
That's a hundow.

786
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,680
He rolled a hundred. The worst of the worst.

787
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:11,680
You rolled a hundred and the pastor passed his check and he looks at you and he says,

788
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:20,680
That's quite alright. I'm always willing to comply with anything that the enforcers of the law of this great country can do for us.

789
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
So is that all you need?

790
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
What attracted you to the helmet?

791
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,680
Why'd you buy that?

792
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,680
What kind of food?

793
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,680
What am I smelling down there?

794
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,680
Look, you can just go look at that. We're trying to ask real questions. It's pasta, you eat.

795
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,680
He's right, okay. I'm gonna kind of squeeze past everybody. I'm super embarrassed.

796
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,680
Uh, squeeze past everybody, go grab a plate of whatever's down there.

797
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,680
I'm sticking with John and the pastor. Keith, are you holding on to the helmet as you...

798
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
Oh, yeah, definitely.

799
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Yep, so as you pass through, Pastor Adam Kane kind of looks at John and Clark. Was there anything else?

800
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
Yeah, I just asked you a question.

801
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Oh, I'm sorry. I was taken aback by Officer Vigna's actions.

802
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,680
He hadn't eaten for like 30 minutes, so he was...

803
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,680
He only had his daily flow.

804
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Well, he's gotta fit into those pants somehow, I suppose.

805
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
He's trying, you know. He's trying.

806
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,680
So what was the question that you asked me?

807
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,680
Why did you purchase that helmet?

808
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:19,680
Oh, I was in the market for a helmet after I decided to go out and buy a motorcycle.

809
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Have you ever ridden one?

810
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,680
Oh, is that your bike out there?

811
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Yes.

812
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,680
I'm acquainted with speed, Pastor.

813
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,680
Is it not just the most exhilarating?

814
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,680
Heavenly.

815
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,680
It's wonderful.

816
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,680
I find them dangerous and reckless, but to each their own.

817
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,680
I appreciate that, but when you have God on your side, nothing is reckless.

818
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,680
And you got a helmet. Well, you don't have a helmet anymore, but...

819
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,680
I did have a helmet, and you said you will be taking that?

820
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,680
We are gonna have to take a little bit of a look at it. You should get it back in 12 to 32 weeks.

821
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,680
Oh, gosh, I really thought you were gonna say hours. Okay, I will...

822
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,680
You should buy a new helmet.

823
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,680
Then I suppose I am once again in the market for a helmet.

824
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,680
Hey, I hate to do this to you, but we see you riding without one.

825
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,680
We are gonna have to give you a ticket, so you should probably get that taken care of immediately.

826
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
Well, I will indeed.

827
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:12,680
I'll have you know that I am working on legislation to have that particular law removed.

828
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,680
There's nothing like riding a motorcycle with the wind in your hair, am I right, John?

829
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,680
Sorry, Officer Pettymore.

830
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
Thank you, Pastor.

831
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,680
Thank you, Pastor. Now, I have to say I disagree there.

832
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,680
You know, Clark's right, these are dangerous machines.

833
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:35,680
It frankly seems irresponsible of somebody, you know, who has his own flock to be introducing this kind of legislation to the community.

834
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,680
Well, I certainly don't believe that there's anything un-Christian about such legislation.

835
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Oh, well. Feels like you'd be leading directly to deaths. I don't know.

836
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,680
Pastor, you think that people shouldn't wear helmets on motorcycles?

837
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
That is my goal, yes.

838
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:57,680
Hell, man, that makes you the coolest pastor I know, but that is not responsible.

839
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,680
To each their own, I suppose.

840
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,680
That seems like the definition of reckless.

841
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:07,680
Yeah, your recklessness is gonna lead to a lot of wrecks, and folks is gonna be cracking their heads open, because they ain't got no helmet.

842
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,680
I personally don't understand the correlation between a lack of helmet and an influx of wrecks.

843
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
We're talking about the severity of the accident?

844
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,680
Okay, I'm sorry. I misunderstood you then, I suppose.

845
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:28,680
Pastor, I just gotta advise you completely against submitting this, like, this doesn't seem like it would be good for your reputation, for the advancement of our plot in particular, or...

846
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,680
To each their own, I suppose.

847
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,680
That's not the law yet, so you do need that helmet.

848
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:41,680
Absolutely. I guess I'm in the market again, and I tend to buy used, so I will be back at Forgotten Treasures soon, I suppose.

849
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Okay, also though, you should definitely get a new one, because they don't last if they've been in a crash or something.

850
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Well, I always get my helmet facts on all the used helmets that I buy.

851
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,680
What did the helmet facts say on this one? I guess you could just tell the tubes weren't broken, so that's a good...

852
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,680
There's glass on the outside of it, so I assume...

853
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,680
It's like a rudimentary quality assurance.

854
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:10,680
Absolutely. I thought it was quite clever of the original makers, although I didn't find a name on it, interestingly enough.

855
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,680
Have you seen what these lights do?

856
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,680
I'm sorry, lights?

857
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,680
Yeah, the red and green light.

858
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,680
Oh, yeah, it's just...

859
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,680
You ever seen that green light come on?

860
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,680
No, it's just been red.

861
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,680
Okay.

862
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,680
How many times have you used the helmet since you bought it?

863
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,680
I picked up the motorcycle, and I rode it here.

864
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
So once?

865
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,680
I suppose so, yes.

866
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,680
When was that?

867
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:36,680
Well, it's, you know, there was, you know, some weather conflicts, and I stayed home one day, and...

868
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
Oh, okay.

869
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,680
I've only gotten to ride it once, but it was quite thrilling.

870
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,680
Hey, Pastor, what does the Bible say about animals congregating in funny ways in streams, or creeks?

871
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,680
You have noticed that is...

872
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,680
Well, I have thought that was quite strange.

873
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,680
That's all the spiritual guidance you got for us there that's quite strange?

874
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,680
Well, I've been praying about it.

875
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,680
How long has it been going on?

876
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,680
Oh, a couple days.

877
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,680
They've been out there?

878
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,680
Seems rather odd. Do you see them come and go, or have they just been staying there?

879
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,680
Well, some of them run through the water, and that's always a joy.

880
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,680
You know, it's not every day that you get to see a mink and a raccoon interact.

881
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,680
Yeah, for sure. No, I mean, thank God for all these creatures.

882
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,680
They give us company and nutrition.

883
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,680
I come back up, I got a plate full of all the...

884
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,680
Pasta and salad.

885
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Pasta and salad that I could fit on there, and I've got a mouthful of food,

886
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,680
but I shoot up and swallow it, and I come up to the pastor, and I say,

887
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,680
Hey, do you know where all these people are staying?

888
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,680
I believe they live in the city.

889
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,680
All these homeless people live in the city?

890
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,680
Well, there are more shelters there than there are here,

891
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:44,680
and I believe from talking to them, they seem to be moving from shelter to shelter,

892
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,680
depending on which days are available.

893
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,680
Do you know the plight of the homeless well, Keith?

894
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,680
Sorry, Officer Vigna?

895
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,680
Thank you.

896
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,680
I... I just...

897
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,680
I have a...

898
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,680
This might sound like an odd question, but do the pistons attend your congregation?

899
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,680
Yeah...

900
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,680
Well...

901
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,680
I can't say that there are regulars here at the First Church of Contention,

902
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,680
though I do see George and Kathy,

903
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,680
and they'll sometimes bring Leo on holidays here and there.

904
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,680
When's the last time you saw them here?

905
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,680
Oh, gosh.

906
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,680
Might have been our Fourth of July celebration, I don't know.

907
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,680
It could have been Easter.

908
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,680
Okay.

909
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,680
Were you aware they might be running a...

910
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
A homeless shelter?

911
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,680
Shooting daggers at...

912
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,680
Yeah, we're both shooting daggers at Keith.

913
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,680
With their eyes.

914
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,680
Yeah, I...

915
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,680
No.

916
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,680
I say no.

917
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,680
We're firing daggers out of our service business.

918
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,680
Roll mail.

919
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,680
Yeah, I say...

920
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,680
He's not...

921
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,680
He's running...

922
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,680
Yeah, he's not running.

923
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Did you know that the pistons are running a pig farm?

924
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,680
Well, yes.

925
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,680
That has been their business for some time.

926
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,680
All right.

927
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,680
I just wanted to check.

928
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,680
Hey, Keith...

929
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,680
I'm pulling this.

930
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,680
Keith, what the...

931
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,680
We don't fucking just tell people about facts about the investigation, God dammit.

932
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,680
So, Pastor...

933
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,680
I do need to get back to my flock.

934
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,680
If that's all that you need, then...

935
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,680
Of course.

936
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,680
You got a lot of blessing and praying to do.

937
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,680
I am...

938
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,680
Thank you so much for understanding about the helmet.

939
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,680
Hey, if you remember anything about that, why don't you give us a call?

940
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,680
Here's my card.

941
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,680
Hey, real fast, before you go, did anybody else come asking about this helmet?

942
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,680
You are the first ones I've talked to about it.

943
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,680
All right.

944
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,680
Can I humint that?

945
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,680
Oh, yes, you can.

946
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
Roll humint.

947
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,680
93 out of 50.

948
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,680
Fail.

949
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,680
All right.

950
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,040
I take a few more bites of my food and then I go back to the buffet and I scrape the leftovers

951
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,040
back into their...

952
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,040
Oh, my God.

953
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,040
Back into their...

954
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,680
Like the salad, back into the salad, and the pasta, back into the pasta.

955
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,080
How do you think real people...

956
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,680
How do you think your coworkers are actually supposed to react to that?

957
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:49,680
If you saw somebody do that that you knew, you would hate that person.

958
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,340
Vigna, what the fuck?

959
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:58,060
Get those trays, throw those out, help the kitchen workers bring some new ones back.

960
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,380
What the hell are you doing in this church?

961
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,340
Do you hate homeless people?

962
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,340
I was just trying to...

963
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,340
I didn't need it anymore.

964
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,340
Vigna.

965
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,340
And they need it more than me.

966
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,340
Let's get out of here.

967
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,520
Vigna, you dumb son of a bitch.

968
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:15,120
You guys are yelling this weird conversation on one side of the room as Pastor Adam Kane

969
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:22,420
is just staring daggers into both of you as he circles around and gets to the front of

970
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:28,180
the group, grabs a microphone, and begins speaking.

971
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,340
Hello everyone, and welcome to the First Church of Contention.

972
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,260
I am the pastor, Adam Kane.

973
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,700
You guys are having this weird conversation.

974
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,420
Clark, I imagine you still standing on the stairs looking into this room.

975
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,060
And the pastor goes on.

976
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,920
We here at FCC believe that every life has a purpose.

977
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,200
No one comes through our doors by accident, and we aim to help alleviate any pain in any

978
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,000
life, in any way possible.

979
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,580
Today that pain may be physical hunger.

980
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,160
We can help with that.

981
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,500
Let's all give a round of applause to our wonderful volunteers from the youth group

982
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,240
serving up the pasta that my beautiful wife Evelyn and our kids David and Sarah have made.

983
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
Well done.

984
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:17,880
Now please enjoy the food and the fellowship, and we hope to see you back with us on Sunday.

985
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,040
So that we may relieve your spiritual pain.

986
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,880
You know, a beautiful afterlife awaits everyone who believes.

987
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,000
It is just on the other side of the veil, and...

988
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,400
Look at me, I'm getting ahead of myself.

989
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,360
Enjoy yourselves, and we'll see you all on Sunday.

990
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,520
And he clicks the mic off and goes back walking through.

991
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:44,200
In a little bit of time dilation, as he was doing all that, can I scan the crowd?

992
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,600
Is the crowd reacting like a normal crowd would?

993
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,600
Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

994
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,160
Have you ever seen, have you ever been to like a soup kitchen or a church when they're

995
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,880
serving a group of homeless people?

996
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,440
No, I guess not, not homeless people.

997
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,800
I've been to like churches serving dinners, but...

998
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,480
It is weirdly quiet.

999
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,480
So Keith?

1000
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,160
Yeah, I head back up the stairs, I'm like, I don't want to be here anymore.

1001
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,600
I do want to go look at this guy's bike, just to check it out, because I got this cool helmet.

1002
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,680
I've never ridden a motorcycle before, but all of a sudden I feel like, damn, this is cool.

1003
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,880
It's a pretty sweet motorcycle.

1004
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,880
Is it black?

1005
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:27,120
Yes, and it's pretty, it's got a naked lady on the gas tank.

1006
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,920
This pastor's a really cool pastor.

1007
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,920
It's Mary Magdalene.

1008
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Bathing Jesus's feet.

1009
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,080
With her hair, pin-up style Mary.

1010
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,040
I would rise up for three days for that.

1011
00:52:46,880 --> 00:53:10,960
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the

1012
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,960
night?

1013
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,960
No, I'm not.

1014
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:12,960
