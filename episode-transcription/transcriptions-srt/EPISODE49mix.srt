1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Salutations and greetings, friendos of all shapes and sizes.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,500
It's your geometry, Professor Wolf the dog, hittin' you up from the past.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,500
And I am here celebrating every hexagon I see,

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,500
because that's just how Professor Wolfie likes to roll.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,500
And I'm rollin' in filth, live from the past, from 694.2 PTBP.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now we bout to roll on over to a new howlin' with Wolf.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This week's howlin' with Wolf is simple.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Name, Ahmed Adudi.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Message, I have nipples, fucker. Could you milk me?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Listen here, Ahmed Adudi.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't know what you're tryin' to pull,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,500
but you better be happy I'm trapped here in the past,

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,000
because I don't milk no one, lest we got prior arrangements made.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
I take the art of milkin' quite seriously,

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,500
and it sounds like you're tryin' to play me for a fool.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Last time I milked a stranger on the internet,

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,500
I ended up with two gallons of sour milk.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,500
And let me tell y'all, this wasn't no buttermilk.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I tried to make me a big ol' stack of pancakes out of that shit,

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
and it damn near burnt my esophagus.

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500

Get to the campin', cuz y'all deserve this tent.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
With all of the pros and none of the cons,

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,500
it's Blue False Indigo with Boooooooon Daaaaaaams.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,500
She runs

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,000
oooh

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The sun

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
is sleeping soon

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,000
She knows

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
that the time has come

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,500
to dance beneath the

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,500
dance beneath the shadow of the moon

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Luke, you said that it has felt like ages in the mind of Ash Hornbeam

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,000
since this human face, this head, went back down beneath the bush out of sight,

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,500
and you're just sitting there. What do you do?

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I get up and I go over to the bush with axe in hand.

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
As you approach the bush, you hear like a

45
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I turn heel and I run back to camp as soon as I hear that.

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Cuz I don't have any intent of using, I didn't wanna use this axe,

48
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
it was just kind of like an intimidation thing.

49
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Sure.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
But whatever I just saw and whatever I just heard, yeah.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I think this is a job for more than one boy, because

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you know, I've seen horror movies and when you go off by yourself and try to do something,

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it doesn't usually end up well.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So, I mean, I know nothing's gonna end up well, but I don't want it to be this soon.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I run back to camp where

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
To meet up with Jeremy Pettymore.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Jeremy Pettymore.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Jeremy Pettymore.

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Jerahim Pettymore.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, that is correct.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,500
Okay.

62
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Jeremy Pettymore, you're standing at your campsite and you've been looking around for anything out of the ordinary

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
as there was no wood at this campsite, which caught you off guard as you had called earlier

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
to make an arrangement to make sure there was wood at the campsite,

65
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,000
which you mentioned was a very dutiful thing for a 14-year-old boy to have done, especially Jeremy Pettymore.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah, and not necessarily for a 14-year-old boy, but definitely for Jeremy Pettymore.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,500
Absolutely.

68
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
This is the only thing.

69
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
He doesn't, like, talk to adults on the phone.

70
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,000
That makes a whole lot of sense.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,500
And as you're walking around, you don't notice anything out of the ordinary,

72
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,500
you don't notice anything interesting, however, sprinting back into the campsite.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Jeremy, Ash comes in, who typically has a level head, tends to keep cool, but you can tell that I am perturbed.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What's going on, man?

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
As far as I could discern, there's literally nothing of interest in this entire vicinity.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And you see me, like, two hand-wielding an axe with white knuckles, and I'm like,

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,500
There's a man in a bush by that log, and he doesn't sound, he sounds like he's making animal noises.

78
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I went over to the bush, but I was too spooked, and...

79
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Do you want to come check it out with me?

80
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Yeah, absolutely.

81
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
You should grab one of the machetes or axes just in case.

82
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
I've got this gun!

83
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
That is true!

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,000
And Ash is like, okay, and I lead the way back to the bush.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,500
As you get back to the bush, you notice the exact same bush is still rustling with movement, and you hear a

86
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
I want to pick up a stick that is on the ground, and I want to just poke at the bush.

87
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh man, there's so many sticks on the ground.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,500
Yeah, I want to pick up the longest one I can find and poke the bush with it.

89
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,000
You gotta roll to make sure you don't pick up a short one.

90
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Uh, it's 93 feet long.

91
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:34,000
You find the longest stick in the forest, and you poke at this bush from a distance, clearly, and you hear a

92
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:46,000
And stepping back away from the bush is a naked human man who has scratches all over his body, and some are deeper than scratches.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They seem almost like cuts, and he's bleeding, and he looks at you with these huge eyes, and he just freezes and stares at you.

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,500
Thinking back to those Polaroids, the Polaroid of the Polaroids.

95
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, I bring that up.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do we recognize this man as any of the missing people?

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can barely make out anybody in this picture, but I don't know.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
When you squint, does he look like the top man?

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, we start squinting and squinting at the picture and looking up at the naked man, and then back.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What would be a check that you could use to discern?

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,500
I mean, as long as we don't have facial aphasia, I think that's uh...

102
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you have facial aphasia?

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,500
No.

104
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Okay, then you can tell that it...

105
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't have that written down.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,500
Then you can tell that it is one of the people who has gone missing.

107
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Ash, it's that one!

108
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Did we learn his name?

109
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,500
No, you did not, and it is much harder to read the names on this Polaroid than to see faces.

110
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Hey, hey guy?

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Wait, what time is it right now? Is it dark out?

112
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
No, the sun is going down currently.

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Guy, it gets cold out here after the sun goes down this time of year.

114
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
We got a... You wanna put some pants on?

115
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
We got a first aid kit if you need it, or a machete.

116
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
He kind of walks up toward you pretty quickly.

117
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Ooh, I point the gun at him.

118
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:09,500
You point the gun at him, and that does not change his movement as his hands come together.

119
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:17,500
And he's using his fingers, pushing his fingertips together, and he looks at you and his eyes get really big.

120
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,500
And then he kind of like, droops down his eyes to make a sad, solemn face.

121
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Like a puppy dog face.

122
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Like a puppy dog eyes.

123
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I look at Ash.

124
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
You should follow us back to the shack.

125
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Ash, what the hell, man? We don't want to take this thing anywhere.

126
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Well, it doesn't seem like he's going to hurt us, and honestly...

127
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:47,500
He's a naked dog, man. I want to get him away from our campsite, but he's in that missing persons thing.

128
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
We ought to bring him back to the old man.

129
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
He sniffs the air.

130
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Oh right, our civic duty.

131
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,500
And he looks back, and he looks behind you, and he smells the air, and he's going to start running for where your campsite is.

132
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Should I follow suit?

133
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Or should we try to red rover him?

134
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Are we in front of him, or...?

135
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
You're in front of him. You're in between.

136
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Yeah.

137
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Let's try to stop him.

138
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
We make eye contact and just grab each other's arms and try to like, clothesline him.

139
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Red rover, red rover, send freak boy right over.

140
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Go ahead and roll sanity for me, both of you, because this is not a normal situation.

141
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Coming across a man in this state in the woods.

142
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I fail.

143
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
I pass.

144
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Okay, Luke, Ash Hornbeam is going to lose one sanity.

145
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Jeremy Pettymore will lose none.

146
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
This is kind of fun.

147
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,500
He's been around his criminal uncles long enough to see what a naked cut-up man looks like.

148
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Yeah, I've seen plenty of this.

149
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Like, you get into the shine a little too much.

150
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:46,500
So as you guys reach out to each other to red rover, Ash freaks out and backs away and is going to let this guy go right through.

151
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Yeah, I trip over the log that's located right next to me.

152
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
It's perfect.

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:58,500
And I need Jeremy Pettymore to, if you're going to attempt to grab him alone, roll an unarmed combat for me.

154
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Ooh, fail, 67 on a 50.

155
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,500
And the man makes it right past through you and takes off running.

156
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,500
And as he's running, I want you both to roll a humant for me.

157
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Ooh, pass, 27 on a 40.

158
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
41 on a 50.

159
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Alright, so you would both realize as he's running away from you, Ash you see from the ground on your butt after falling from tripping over this log.

160
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:40,500
And Jeremy, you see as he brushes past you and continues to sprint in his own way, this is not the sprint of a normal human man.

161
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Like, way too fast.

162
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Not only is it very fast, but he's also crouched.

163
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:58,500
And as he comes across like any brush on the ground, he's using his front legs, I mean arms, to help him in his transport.

164
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
So he's running on all fours essentially.

165
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,500
And he is making his way directly to your campsite.

166
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Have you seen that video of that horse girl who runs like a horse and jumps over stuff?

167
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Fuck, that shit is, I hate that.

168
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
That's exactly what I'm imagining.

169
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
It's really unnerving.

170
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,500
And it's also terrifying, and people went to high school with that person.

171
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Actually, probably not, she was probably homeschooled.

172
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
That's it, that's a little bit of a relief.

173
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
One can only hope.

174
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,500
I get off my butt and I start regularly running back to the campsite.

175
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Yeah, Jeremy Fettymore has certainly never seen anybody whose mind has been switched with that of a common house animal.

176
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
No, Jeremy doesn't anymore.

177
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
He doesn't know what the fuck is going on.

178
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
He runs after it too.

179
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,500
And he's kind of trembling with the pistol in his hand, but he's like, mister, I'll shoot.

180
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
I'll do it.

181
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Yeah, and I'm still firmly holding onto that axe, but when I start sprinting, I'm one hand in it.

182
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm holding it like when a server, such as myself, holds a steak knife up against your arm, blade away, so that it doesn't cut me if I fall.

183
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Yeah, ironically, that's actually the worst way to hold an axe.

184
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,500
They call that the lumberjack's demise.

185
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Well, I have never been a lumberjack.

186
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Ash has never been a lumberjack.

187
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
He thinks that's the best way to do it, so that's how I do it.

188
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:30,500
When you arrive at the campsite, you see that this man is hunched over, he is ripped apart, whichever bag had food in it that you guys brought,

189
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,500
and he is just going to town on any snacks that you may have brought, and he checks mixes.

190
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
My little smokies!

191
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Ash, without thinking, drops the axe, takes a running jump, and just both feet into this guy's head, kicks him off the food.

192
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Oh shit, Ash! Kicked him in the face!

193
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Roll an unarmed combat, and I'll give you a plus 20.

194
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Fuck.

195
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
78 on what would be, with a plus 20, 70.

196
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:14,500
He ducks right out of the way, he rolled an aught 7, and he continues to feast as you slide on your back, and you get covered in mud.

197
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Like, absolutely covered your eye. Actually, go ahead and roll a dexterity for me to make sure you don't stab yourself with that lumberjack's demise.

198
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I already, I said I dropped it before I did the flying kick.

199
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Well, that's extremely smart of you.

200
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
It's also good real playing to listen to your players.

201
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Yeah, it is.

202
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,500
As I slide in the mud, I hear Jeremy Pettymore go,

203
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
You're out!

204
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
I didn't hear it either, so for all we know, he's just lying.

205
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Yeah, if so, he's a beast.

206
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
It was a grave.

207
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
You can pause it and play it back if you want.

208
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
No, I appreciate the bluff.

209
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
And I trust Ash Hornbeam.

210
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Yeah, he's inherently really cool.

211
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Right, so Jeremy Pettymore calls you out, and then does what?

212
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Jeremy is going to look at his skill sheet that he hasn't seen in a couple weeks.

213
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Disguise. Jeremy Pettymore is going to charge the naked man.

214
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,500
And how is the dude situated after his tussle with Luke?

215
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Oh, still crouched. He just crouched a little bit lower to get out of the way there.

216
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
So he's maybe belly on the ground.

217
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Prone eating little smokies and Chex mix.

218
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,500
He's got little weenies in his mouth and little Chexes on the ground.

219
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm going to just try to throw him off our food.

220
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Yeah, let's go ahead and roll that unarmed.

221
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I'll still give you a plus 20 because he is busy.

222
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Critical success.

223
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Oh, shit.

224
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Well, then describe exactly what you would like to do with this giant, bloody, cut-up man.

225
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Naked.

226
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
He's naked.

227
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Jeremy Pettymore is like, give me those.

228
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
And with one hand, he snatches the can of little smokies,

229
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,500
and with the other, he just pushes the dude on the forehead straight off away from our backpack of food.

230
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:09,500
So he backs up, and he gets on his haunches, and he's holding his hands up in front of him like a prairie dog,

231
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
and he looks at you, and he's just hissing.

232
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I want to throw the can at him.

233
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
You're going to waste your smokies?

234
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Brother, I've got more.

235
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
That'll be athletics.

236
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Fail. 40 out of 30.

237
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
You sail.

238
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Sail!

239
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
The little smokies.

240
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Sail.

241
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Sail.

242
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Which is what I meant to do.

243
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
I just wanted to throw a warning shot across his bow, his proverbial bow.

244
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Well, it actually seems to help because he immediately runs away toward them.

245
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,500
He runs behind where he was, further away from you, and goes and grabs the can of little smokies

246
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,500
and is attempting to open it, but cannot quite figure out how to do it.

247
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Did that ranger mention any way we could contact him out here?

248
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Shoot a gunshot.

249
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Oh, come on.

250
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Yeah, but maybe this thing will run away.

251
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
What is that?

252
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
I kind of would...

253
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Well, you're right.

254
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
We need to bring him in.

255
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Well, okay.

256
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Before you do that, I...

257
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
What if we just keep giving him smokies?

258
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Ash is on the wrestling team, so Ash goes over and...

259
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Well, fuck it.

260
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Yeah, I go over, and I want to just full Nelson him and smash him onto the ground, and then

261
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
leg lock him, and then...

262
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
He's going to run away as soon as you approach him.

263
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,500
So as you run up to him to do this, or even walk up to him to do this, he's going to take

264
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
off running with the little smokies.

265
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:41,500
In order to catch him before he dips, I need you to roll an athletics check against his own.

266
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
A 12 on a 30.

267
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
He rolled a 97.

268
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Hell yes.

269
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
So you grab him.

270
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Now we're going to go unarmed combat straight up and down against each other.

271
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Can I support this?

272
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
I failed.

273
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Passed with a 26 on a 50.

274
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,500
You describe what you do, and then Thomas, you can put yourself in the situation in a

275
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
positive space.

276
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,500
I get up from my slide.

277
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,500
I kick the can of little smokies before he can figure out how to open it up back kind

278
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
of towards where the pile of food is.

279
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
So what's important?

280
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I give him a little elbow in the face since he...

281
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Or actually, I give him a knee in the face since that's closer, and then while that's

282
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,500
kind of got him off guard, I just full Nelson him, push his face into the mud, and then

283
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,500
I lock my legs around his legs so that he is pretty much immobile.

284
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,500
You are a bloody muddy mess of a two clump person.

285
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I want to take a rope that we...

286
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Like Eddie Murphy.

287
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Perhaps found in the camping equipment from the Bronco or the other car.

288
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
A hundred percent.

289
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,500
And I want to tie him up while Luke's got him...

290
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Yeah.

291
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Got him wrestled down.

292
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,500
If anyone knows how to tie up a naked man, it's Jeremy Pettymore.

293
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Honestly, it falls far too often on the Pettymore children to hog tie the obliterated adults

294
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
at the family get together.

295
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
The other adults are too busy pouring more drinks, and they're just like, hey, handle

296
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
it, Jeremy.

297
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
That's his fourth jar of moonshine.

298
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I get the rope ready.

299
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Take his keys and grab the rope.

300
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Well, once a kid is old enough to push a lawnmower, he's old enough to tie up his uncle when he's...

301
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Which in the Pettymore family is like about three years old.

302
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I really hope that there's a beautiful circular cross stitch that says that in every Pettymore

303
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,500
home.

304
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,500
I'm trying to remember something specific that was in an ex-girlfriend's parents' house.

305
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,500
It was basically just said that faith is...

306
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Being certain of what you hope for and sure of what you cannot see?

307
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Yeah.

308
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Exactly.

309
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I was raised.

310
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,500
The Pettymore one says, mow the lawn and tie up Don.

311
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Holy shit.

312
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Yeah.

313
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,500
And there's a little picture of Don D. Pettymore that's also like...

314
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:12,500
He's tied up and in the background, a little tiny Jeremy's just mowing the grass.

315
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Anyway.

316
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Anyway.

317
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,500
You guys have a tied up, naked, bloody man.

318
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:25,500
And currently, you both are also just covered in this blood and mud.

319
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm gonna sanitize my hands with the hand sanitizer.

320
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Oh shit.

321
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Yeah.

322
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
That makes sense.

323
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
But other...

324
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
All the mud and shit.

325
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Yeah.

326
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
We're like 14 year old boys out in the woods.

327
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
I think we probably feel pretty cool.

328
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Yeah.

329
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
I bet you do.

330
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
All right.

331
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Jeremy, are you also hand sanitizing?

332
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
No.

333
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
That's all I do though.

334
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,500
I keep all the mud and muck and blood on me, because I really don't have anything to clean

335
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
it off with.

336
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,500
I want to tie the wild man up to a tree.

337
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Okay.

338
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,500
And then I kind of want to start trying to calm him down with another can of smoke.

339
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
One at a time, giving him little smokies.

340
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,500
And I'm trying to experiment with commands like, hey, sit.

341
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Jeremy, stay.

342
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
You think I ought to...

343
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,500
I mean, I can just run real fast back to the shack and go get that old man.

344
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Yeah.

345
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Let's split up.

346
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Okay.

347
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Sounds good.

348
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
And I take off towards the shack.

349
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Perfect.

350
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Thomas, leave the room.

351
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:46,780
Luke, as Ash Hornbeam runs back down the trail, I need you to make a sanity check.

352
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,820
That is a pass of 38 on a 39.

353
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,500
You are still going to lose one sanity, putting your current sanity at 38 now.

354
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Cool.

355
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:05,660
As you're running, the trees begin to warp and the trail becomes almost non-existent

356
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,780
in front of you.

357
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:15,100
And you are immediately looking at trees instead of the trail ahead of you.

358
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,740
And you turn around and it's just trees.

359
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,620
And you have no fucking clue where you are.

360
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,780
You're by yourself.

361
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:30,900
The sun is going down and you are in the woods of contention.

362
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Exactly what I wanted to do.

363
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,100
Perfect.

364
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:47,420
Joe, Terry.

365
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,380
That's me.

366
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Hey Joe.

367
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,380
Howdy.

368
00:21:53,380 --> 00:22:00,180
I believe Ken Krenkelhoff was just walking down the trail, heading to his campsite.

369
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,220
Going to meet my buddies.

370
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,220
Going to meet your buddies.

371
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,260
I got a couple checks for you to roll on your way there.

372
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Alrighty.

373
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
First one's a survival check.

374
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,860
Uh, I don't have my character sheet.

375
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,260
Oh yeah, I have your character sheet.

376
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,100
I was like, yeah, I'll just roll dice.

377
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,980
You tell me what happens.

378
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,540
I do eventually want to play a game where I am the only one who knows what you're like

379
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,260
search and alertness and sanity are.

380
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,360
And then we'll just describe it in character.

381
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,660
That way you guys never know if you pass or fail.

382
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,660
I think that'd be kind of fun.

383
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:39,380
It would take away some of the dice rolling aspect, but it is what it is.

384
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,300
I fail a 79 in my, you said survival, right?

385
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
I did indeed.

386
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
A 50.

387
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,300
So I fail.

388
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
Okay.

389
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,500
As you're walking down, you think to yourself, yes, this trail is exactly how I roll.

390
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,100
I remember it.

391
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:59,540
And now I need you to roll an alertness check.

392
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,060
I also fail that one.

393
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,340
An 87 on a 50.

394
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,260
All right, then nothing cool happens and you may as well fuck off.

395
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
It's for real?

396
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,260
No, I'm kidding.

397
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,260
So you're, uh, so you're walking down the trail and you make your way all the way back

398
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:23,040
to the campsite where you normally camp every year with Jeremy Pettymore and Ash Hornbeam.

399
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:29,100
And when you arrive from a distance, you can see two figures.

400
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:38,340
One is Jeremy Pettymore and the other is not Ash Hornbeam, but rather it is an adult man

401
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,900
who is naked, who is covered in blood and mud.

402
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:51,600
He's cut all over his body and he has been tied up hands and ankles and then tied to

403
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,320
a tree and Jeremy Pettymore is waving little Smokies in front of his face.

404
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,900
What the fuck?

405
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,100
Is he conscious?

406
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Yes.

407
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,240
Little Smokies like the sausages.

408
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,640
What the fuck?

409
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:23,480
Everyone is going to say that as he enters the clearing.

410
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Shark flips.

411
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,000
Do you have sharp toenails right now?

412
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
No, shark.

413
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Shark.

414
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,800
I thought you were like cutting Ally with your...

415
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Shark flip flops.

416
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Did she do that?

417
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Oh, all the time.

418
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,220
All the time.

419
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,720
Every time she comes in, she's like, look at me, I'm Sandra Dee and then she cuts me

420
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,260
with her toenails.

421
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,340
And then I have him put the blood in a vial and then I put it around my neck and then

422
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,180
we have hoard sex.

423
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,820
Call me Billy Bob Thornton.

424
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,820
Call me...

425
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,740
I don't get that.

426
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,580
He used to wear Angelina Jolie's blood around his neck in a vial and she did the same with

427
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
his blood.

428
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
That's a lie.

429
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,580
The 90s were crazy.

430
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,580
What the fuck?

431
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
That's a lie, right?

432
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,740
And then Brad Pitt was like, give me some of that lot of blood.

433
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,860
He wanted the blood, really.

434
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,100
He was just after the blood.

435
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
I've tasted blood.

436
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Yeah, I think we all...

437
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
I think we've all tasted blood, Ally.

438
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
You're being weird about it.

439
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,460
I bite my lip on purpose every day.

440
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,540
Ally said that she's tasted blood in an actual...

441
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,660
You sat down and had a flight of blood or something.

442
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,540
You acted as if you have sucked it from a woman.

443
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,540
I've tasted blood.

444
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
Okay, whatever.

445
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
We've all done it.

446
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Right, right.

447
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,540
A woman specifically?

448
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,540
What kind of blood are you talking about, Lindsay?

449
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,420
I said wound, but I meant wound.

450
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,220
So would a flight of blood be like the different blood types?

451
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
Oh.

452
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
Oh.

453
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
Yeah.

454
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
Like type O, positive.

455
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
That's a good one, Shadow.

456
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,340
Hey, name all the rest of them.

457
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,260
O negative, A, B, and C.

458
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,500
Oh, so close.

459
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Is C a blood type?

460
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
It's not.

461
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
I think it's A and B. A and B are things, right?

462
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,340
I can't wait to tell someone that I'm blood type C.

463
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,340
A, B, O.

464
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,340
What blood type?

465
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,340
A, B, O.

466
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,340
C.

467
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
Um, C, bitch.

468
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,340
Universal donor.

469
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,340
Um, C.

470
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,340
I don't really know anything against C.

471
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,340
C plus, I think is what it is.

472
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
You know what they say.

473
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
C is get degrees.

474
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,340
I'm a C student, so I have C plus blood.

475
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,340
Do you think phlebotomists, when you leave, they're like, C plus.

476
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Yes.

477
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,180
She clearly needed the crackers.

478
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,180
I always need the crackers.

479
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,180
Yeah, you're a C plus.

480
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,180
C.

481
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,180
I don't know why I keep doing that.

482
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,180
Why is not my reaction to things?

483
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,180
What are you doing?

484
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,180
I keep going.

485
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,180
It's an audio format, Taylor.

486
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,180
She's sticking her tongue out for you listeners out there.

487
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,180
And also like rolling her eyes in the back of her head while shoving both pinkies up her nose.

488
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,180
She's a little bit like a fish out of water with pinkies.

489
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
What if that was my initial reaction?

490
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,020
It was just like you say something like ever so subtly offensive and I go.

491
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,020
Oh my gosh.

492
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,020
Yeah, Taylor.

493
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,020
Oh dear God.

494
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,020
That'd be normal because that's what you do.

495
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
Because that's what I do.

496
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,020
Burn on me.

497
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,020
Burn myself.

498
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,020
I did it first.

499
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,020
So it's a joke.

500
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
We don't do that anymore.

501
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,020
That's so earlier in the episode.

502
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,020
Yeah, that's so.

503
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,020
That's so last episode.

504
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,020
That's so pre throw up Taylor.

505
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,020
Oh yeah.

506
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,860
Taylor, do you want to talk about what happened the first time we sat down to record?

507
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,860
You know how like when your friends just like relentlessly make fun of you so hard that

508
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,860
you start coughing and then you throw up in your hand and then you run to the bathroom

509
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,860
and then you throw up your guts for like five straight minutes while your friends sort of

510
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,860
laugh and awkwardly sit in a room?

511
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,860
What was I supposed to do if I went in there and I would throw up?

512
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
Same.

513
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,860
You could have thrown up with me.

514
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,860
It's a pretty big toilet.

515
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,700
It's pretty big.

516
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,700
Farts is just a joke toilet for farts.

517
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
For farts.

518
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,700
It just has a joke hole for farts?

519
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,700
You're not a part of turbo team.

520
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Alright, let's hop right on back in.

521
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:25,200
You guys were in the parking lot and you were talking to Woodrow, the state ranger who is

522
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,020
now looking over the contention woods and he jumped out at you and said boo because

523
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,460
it's spoopy time as we said it's fall and he wants you to come to the shack and fill

524
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,780
out some forms.

525
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,700
Yeah, so if you don't mind just grab your camping gear, everything that you're gonna

526
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,680
bring on in with you and we can talk about what you brought with you that way we have

527
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,140
a slight inventory of what you have on your persons and then you can fill out some forms,

528
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,980
I'll take some pictures of you and then you'll head on into the woods.

529
00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:00,280
This has never been protocol when Gary, I mean Jeb, used to do this.

530
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Well Gary, I mean Jeb is missing currently and we're looking for him but state sent

531
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:11,040
me down here because there's about 18 missing people and I've got pictures and information

532
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,760
on all of them and so if you see any of them in their woods then you need to let me know.

533
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,440
We can get Officer Cox down here and take care of business.

534
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,640
I don't think so.

535
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,420
I don't know if you know my dad but he's like a lawyer and he really prefers when pictures

536
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,940
aren't taken of me and I don't fill out forms and I don't show you what's inside my bag

537
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
normally when I go places.

538
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,320
Oh, I don't need to look inside your bag, I just need to look at your face and take

539
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,540
a picture of it and then you can just tell me everything that you got now come on down

540
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,540
to the shack.

541
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
Whatever, can we just do this?

542
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,540
Let's just do this so we can just go.

543
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,940
I'm actually, I'm in witness protection program and so like my face can't be like photographed.

544
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,220
Young lady, if you're in witness protection program then you have given yourself up.

545
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,500
Okay, maybe I'm not in witness protection program but like, okay, fine, let's just do it.

546
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:05,180
Um, Shadow, like if this guy is asking to take our picture because if in case we go

547
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:11,340
missing then we should probably let him do it so the cops could find us if ever we were

548
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,980
still missing like those other 18 people maybe.

549
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,980
You hear, as he's walking away, he hollers back, he goes, that's exactly why we do it.

550
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,460
Judy, why is your mom's car even here?

551
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,740
Oh my gosh, oh no!

552
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:33,660
What if my mom is one of the 18 people that is missing maybe in the woods?

553
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,300
I wasn't implying that but like probably, but like what if it's not your mom?

554
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,700
Right, what if it's just someone else that also drives the same car as my mom and has

555
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,420
a bumper sticker on it that says world's greatest son?

556
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:52,300
You're right, it's probably someone else.

557
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,340
You're right, you're right, it's not my mom, it's not.

558
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,540
Everyone loves their son.

559
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
Calm down.

560
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,700
There's that same scratch on the side from probably some other kid that she had that

561
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,740
also accidentally ran their key onto it but it wasn't me, it was probably another kid.

562
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,980
Someone probably just stole your mom's van, so calm down.

563
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,460
Oh you're right, someone probably just stole it, it was totally fine.

564
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,340
They live in a gated community though, like is that possible to steal from the gated community?

565
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,540
It's possible, right?

566
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:22,220
It's totally fine.

567
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,740
Jeremy Pettymore, you are standing in front of this man.

568
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,180
Correction, I am kneeling, I'm trying to get on his eye level.

569
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,340
I'm letting him smell my hand.

570
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,560
Uh-huh.

571
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,100
And I'm giving him smokies with the other.

572
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,460
Yeah, a hundred percent.

573
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,340
And as you're doing that, you hear...

574
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,980
What the fuck?

575
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,660
Jeremy, what the fuck is going on?

576
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,300
Oh hey man.

577
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,140
Sir, sir, can you hear me?

578
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,860
And I'm talking to the...

579
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,700
Hey, did you talk to the ranger at all?

580
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,140
Yeah.

581
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,540
Take your Polaroid, you see all them missing folks?

582
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,020
Uh-huh.

583
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,260
Look at this here Polaroid of them missing folks.

584
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,460
Hey, he's one of them, right?

585
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,420
See the top left?

586
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,780
Jeremy shows you a Polaroid that was taken of the board of the missing people,

587
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,100
and there are tiny little Polaroids inside of this picture showing the faces.

588
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,700
You can kind of make out the faces.

589
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,580
Gotcha.

590
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,540
One of them is that guy.

591
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,700
Yeah, Ken looks back and forth, back and forth, squinty eyed, squinty eyed.

592
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,260
I guess it kind of looks like him.

593
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,860
You found him.

594
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,300
Yeah, we saved him.

595
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,620
And we tied him up and only wrestled with him a little bit,

596
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:48,460
and so Ash is on his way to the ranger station to take him back to civilization,

597
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,220
and I'm trying to tame him with smokeless.

598
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,060
Why's he bleeding?

599
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,340
Oh, he was like that when we found him.

600
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,300
How'd you find him?

601
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,420
Naked in the woods, acting like a wild man.

602
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,020
Ken, roll intelligence for me real quick.

603
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,700
Not my strong suit, but I passed.

604
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,980
You just took a biology lesson.

605
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,940
I passed with a two on a 25.

606
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,900
Two on a 25 would let you know that what Jeremy just told you

607
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,060
is that Ash just went down the trail, and you also...

608
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,420
I didn't see Ash.

609
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,620
I just came from the trail.

610
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,740
He wasn't there.

611
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,220
I didn't see him.

612
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,420
I mean, he just went down.

613
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,380
He just went down there.

614
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,180
I didn't see him.

615
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,060
I just came from the trail.

616
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,280
Fuck.

617
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:32,960
Ash!

618
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,020
Ash!

619
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,940
All right, don't lose your head right away.

620
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,740
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

621
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,300
He's bloody!

622
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,020
He's bloody!

623
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,860
This is your first time seeing this man,

624
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,700
who is sniffing at Jeremy Pettymore's fingers.

625
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,060
Oh, damn.

626
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,140
It's a 36 on a 35.

627
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,980
Go ahead and make that a 34 for your current sanity as you lose one.

628
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,700
Jesus Christ.

629
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,740
Sanity loss really gets the indigestion going.

630
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,220
As that happens, Thomas, if you could plug your ears real quick.

631
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,820
Looking at this man, you no longer see humanity in his eyes,

632
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,220
and you can only see this animalistic intent

633
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,180
behind the eyes of this bloody, muddy, tied up human.

634
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,820
Okay.

635
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,620
You're good, Thomas.

636
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,580
I stuck my fingers in my ears and wiggled them around

637
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,340
so there was just a constant roar,

638
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,940
and any infection I might get tomorrow is on your conscience.

639
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,500
Non-existent, my dude.

640
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,460
What was on your fingers?

641
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,140
You know, just the day.

642
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,420
Also, I rubbed infection all over his fingers earlier.

643
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,980
That's what I call my pussy.

644
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,820
You get it tattooed, and the O is your clit.

645
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:06,540
It's a circle, and it says infection.

646
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,340
Like a teardrop.

647
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:07,660
All right.

648
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,220
So, no, no, no.

649
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,900
A circle tattoo above the clit.

650
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,740
All right, well.

651
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,540
You see Ken get startled and start backing up away from you both.

652
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,040
What the?

653
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,600
What the?

654
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,360
What's?

655
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,740
That's not a person.

656
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,420
Of course it's a person.

657
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,100
Look at his eyes.

658
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,260
He's like feral or some shit, Jeremy.

659
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,420
Okay, but he's still a man.

660
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,880
Jeez.

661
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,060
Did you think the fucking hunt for old Madge was just all gonna be like

662
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,500
civilized gentleman, and yes, yes, sir, and no, ma'am, and thank you, please?

663
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,060
No, it's wild fuckers in the woods.

664
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,220
We've never seen anything like this, Jeremy.

665
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,300
We were gonna roast marshmallows, and we were gonna tell ghost stories,

666
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,420
and we were gonna fall asleep way too early and wake up way too early.

667
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,340
Ken, he's real friendly.

668
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,540
Why don't you give him some fokies?

669
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,580
Give him some fokies.

670
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,700
Fuck no, I'm not going near him.

671
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,340
Give him some fokies.

672
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:13,840
Fuck no.

673
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,080
Ash!

674
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:17,920
Ash!

675
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,660
Ash!

676
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,160
I don't know why he's so scared of you, Rusty.

677
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,720
You named him?

678
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,360
Yeah, look at him.

679
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,640
He's a little rusty.

680
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,660
He got in that red dirt.

681
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,000
You're worse at getting a room noise than Luke.

682
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,880
Think about that.

683
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,080
Well, it's sort of, it's like you, uh, Mr. Rogers.

684
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,840
It's like a fucking nightmare trying to get a room noise with Luke.

685
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,720
Oh my God.

686
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,200
I mean, we're not doing this podcast anymore.

687
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,700
Yeah.

688
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,440
No, but it's like you, Mr. Rogers, us, where we just have to sit for one minute

689
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,200
and not make any noise, and you're like, what do I do?

690
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,520
You're going to want to have your mouth almost touching the microphone when you speak into it.

691
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:21,760
Okay.

692
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
But not farting into it like that other guy.

693
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,760
His name is Thomas.

694
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,120
His name is Thomas.

695
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,080
Right, Thomas.

696
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,960
Something petty more.

697
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,680
It's always something different.

698
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,200
It's always something petty more.

699
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,820
Gavin.

700
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,880
Gavin.

701
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,520
Gavin.

702
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,000
Gavin.

703
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,360
Gavin is such a little slut whore.

704
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,200
Frickin Gavin Pettymore.

705
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,700
Whoa.

706
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,120
We don't Gavin shame on this podcast.

707
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,760
All right.

708
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,080
Yeah.

709
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,760
Young ladies, if you want to come on down, we're trying to get this information.

710
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,800
You can get on into the woods and take care of business.

711
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,120
You hear from all the way in the shack.

712
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,360
Now he's all the way in there and there's a little like open window.

713
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,560
I don't know what you would call that.

714
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,720
Like, uh, that you would walk up to.

715
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,920
Like a concession window.

716
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,400
Exactly.

717
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Thank you so much, Lindsay.

718
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,120
That was Lindsay.

719
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,240
I don't know why, but I just don't trust this guy.

720
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,840
Yeah, I don't trust him either.

721
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,760
Like he seems pretty scary.

722
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,160
Whatever.

723
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,560
He's not going to let us go into the woods until we take a picture.

724
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,400
So just like, let him take a picture of us.

725
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,200
But like, what if he's taking our picture because then he's going to make us disappear

726
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,960
and then he can put our picture up.

727
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,520
Yeah.

728
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,000
And also Elizabeth, it's like always easy for you to take a picture because you always

729
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,200
look so beautiful and like we don't.

730
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,920
Judy, we've been friends for so long and you used to call me beautiful and you don't anymore.

731
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,440
And I just like, don't even know why.

732
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,160
Like you used to tell me how wonderful and cute and sweet and hilarious I am.

733
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,440
And excuse me, when did this turn into some kind of competition?

734
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,960
Can we just go into the woods please?

735
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,600
That was Lindsay's voice and it made the funniest noise.

736
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,560
Was that inside your throat?

737
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:07,920
It was like,

738
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:19,360
I can't burp.

739
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,560
Like your body isn't capable of burping.

740
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,720
My body isn't capable of burping so it does this.

741
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,360
GMing is pain.

742
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,600
Sorry.

743
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,760
Being Lindsay is pain.

744
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
Oh my God.

745
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,600
Okay, fine.

746
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,960
Let's just take the picture.

747
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,000
Okay.

748
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So when you guys walk up to the little shack at the entrance at the trailhead,

749
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,720
who has the best alertness?

750
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,680
I have 40.

751
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,480
I have 50.

752
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,200
I have 50.

753
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,800
Oh, two fifties.

754
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,120
All right.

755
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,160
Well, let's have both of you roll.

756
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,560
Why not?

757
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,280
I rolled a, wait, what's 30 and zero?

758
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,760
30.

759
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,640
I rolled a 30.

760
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,160
I rolled a 15.

761
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,600
What's 30 and zero?

762
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,200
30 plus zero is, hold on, let me do the numbers in my head.

763
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,120
Oh my God.

764
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,400
It was my first roll.

765
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,440
I'm so nervous.

766
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,000
Hey, that was both of your first rolls on this show and they both were successes.

767
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:32,980
Yes.

768
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,160
There's no way you won't die now.

769
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,040
Can you describe that face for our listeners?

770
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,760
It makes the exact same noise.

771
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,040
Who succeeded more is the thing.

772
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,120
So technically whoever got 15.

773
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,840
So Lindsay.

774
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,240
No.

775
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,920
So it's price is right rules.

776
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
Oh, so I win.

777
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,920
Judy wins the role.

778
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,400
Fuck you.

779
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,200
I'm more alert.

780
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,120
But you both see everything.

781
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,760
You both see everything.

782
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
So in this little shack, there are some clipboards hanging on the walls.

783
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,920
You've got one fire extinguisher.

784
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,200
There is one ax, one machete, one flashlight.

785
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,800
There's a giant thing of hand sanitizer that is sitting out on the like front, on the ledge.

786
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,240
What's a ledge of a window called?

787
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,040
A sill.

788
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,160
It's on the sill.

789
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,720
And there's, let's see what else.

790
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:46,800
Behind him, behind Woodrow is a bulletin board with many Polaroid pictures thumbtacked into

791
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,960
the bulletin board with a sheet of paper.

792
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,080
It's got information on it, like behind each picture.

793
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,280
And he says, yeah, no, these are all the people who have gone into the woods.

794
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,600
And then he like kind of points at one side of them are sectioned off.

795
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,760
And he's like, and those are the ones that are missing.

796
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,680
So obviously be careful in there.

797
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,520
Do I have something I can like take a picture of it with?

798
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,360
Probably not in the nineties.

799
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,720
Probably not in the time that we're in right now.

800
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,200
But I have a Polaroid that I can take a picture of you and it with.

801
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,320
I can give you a picture of that.

802
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,200
That way, you know what the pictures of the people look like who are in the pictures.

803
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,920
That way, when you're in the woods and if you see one of them, then you could let me

804
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,420
know.

805
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,600
So, and then he just snaps a picture of Liz.

806
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,000
I don't want to be counterproductive to what we're doing right now, but it sort of seems

807
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,160
weird that 18 people have gone missing in the woods and you're still letting us go into

808
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,160
the woods as female minors without any adult supervision.

809
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,760
Well, I don't see age or gender, but I do see three very capable young ladies who are

810
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,520
looking to have a good time in the woods this evening.

811
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,400
So Liz, I already know your name for some reason because you must have told me earlier.

812
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,480
So Liz Longley, he looks down at the piece of paper and he's like, let's see here.

813
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,880
What is your business in the woods this evening?

814
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,680
I just want to camp.

815
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,840
I just really want to camp.

816
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,160
Okay.

817
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,760
And did you bring anything?

818
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,680
And he's reading off the sheet.

819
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,920
Did you bring anything that is not camping gear?

820
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,560
No.

821
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,360
Okay.

822
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:21,920
And if you were to go missing, where would we look for you first in order to find you

823
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,400
quickest?

824
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,880
Are you sure you're not out here trying to paint your nose?

825
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Cause you're looking all higgly piggly and I'm just worried that y'all are going to be

826
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,080
out here raising sand.

827
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,120
And I guess, I don't know, like in a tree.

828
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,840
In a tree.

829
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,640
All right.

830
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
This one's got a cap and wumpus mind.

831
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,240
And I like that about you.

832
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,640
All right.

833
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,360
So, uh, he writes all that down and then he sticks the picture in the thumbtack and throws

834
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:53,200
it up on the board of the side of the non-missing and his attention turns to shadow and he picks

835
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,040
up the Polaroid and lifts it up and snaps a picture of you.

836
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,240
What's that picture look like?

837
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,720
Gaunt.

838
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,400
Kind of deadly.

839
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,760
And when I say deadly, I don't mean like the picture could kill.

840
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,680
I mean like the person in the picture was killed and looks a little dead.

841
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,080
Um, it's, it's my makeup.

842
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,040
It's, it's not like...

843
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,400
I just meant what face were you making, but that's fine.

844
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,900
Yeah.

845
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,400
I like this.

846
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,640
Deadly and gaunt.

847
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,360
Like dead-ish.

848
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,240
Not really deadly.

849
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,480
You know, like just like dead-like.

850
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,320
Similar to death.

851
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,080
And I think that's all that needs to be described.

852
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,080
Wow.

853
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,840
You were just barking on a knot out here.

854
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,800
What's your name?

855
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,680
Shadow.

856
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,560
All right.

857
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,360
That's it.

858
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,840
Is that a normal name for these times?

859
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,720
What year is it?

860
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,280
You don't know?

861
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:39,760
I don't know.

862
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,920
Let's leave it at that.

863
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:42,960
Yeah.

864
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,000
My name is Shadow.

865
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,160
That's what my parents wanted to call me.

866
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,480
Sure.

867
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,120
Of course.

868
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,960
And, uh, same question.

869
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,480
What are you doing out here in the woods?

870
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:59,440
We're just trying to find ourselves through the earth and the moon and everything that

871
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,960
crawls on the earth and the moon.

872
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,840
All right.

873
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,160
Well, and what else do we got here?

874
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,000
He's reading off the paper again.

875
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,480
Oh yeah.

876
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,560
Do you bring anything with you?

877
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,760
You seem like you might've brought something with you that's not camping gear.

878
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,000
What with your earthly moon activities?

879
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,320
I just brought some like crystals so that we could find our auras.

880
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,200
Yeah.

881
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,000
All right.

882
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,480
And lastly, but not leastly, if you were to go missing, where would I might find you?

883
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,560
I probably would go in like a tree that's like taller than the one Liz was in and like

884
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,480
stronger, but like a tree.

885
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:34,800
Bitch.

886
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,240
Y'all seem to have a real nice rapport.

887
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,840
And for you, what is your name?

888
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,480
Young Liz.

889
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,520
Miss.

890
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,040
My name's Judy.

891
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,000
And Judy is like far too busy furiously pumping the hand sanitizer in her hand.

892
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,320
She's just pumping the hand sanitizer into her hand.

893
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,120
Like it's falling out of her hand.

894
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,160
Liz is just staring at her like she's just so appalled.

895
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,200
Awesome.

896
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,680
Uh, any hand sanitizer for the other two?

897
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,800
Absolutely not.

898
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,600
I prefer to be like one with the germs that want to enter my body.

899
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,480
My mom always said sanitize saves lives.

900
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,440
I agree that the saving of lives can be easily attained by sanitizing.

901
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,760
And I would suggest that both of you take

902
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,680
Ashford into the initiative that your friend here did as well in order to have clean hands.

903
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,240
Could we save our lives with like that machete?

904
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,120
I hope not.

905
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,080
What does that mean?

906
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,120
I mean, like if something is out there killing people like maybe Judy's mom,

907
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,680
like I'm just wondering if we could like take the machete with us.

908
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,160
Why would you say that?

909
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,800
And Judy starts like licking the hand sanitizer.

910
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,440
Oh my God.

911
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,080
Jinx.

912
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,880
And what is your reason for being in the woods here?

913
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,800
My clean and new friend.

914
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,240
I'm just here with my friends.

915
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,120
Uh, we're just camping just for normal camping reasons.

916
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,880
And I'm just doing whatever they are doing.

917
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,920
And you don't seem like one to take initiative,

918
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,760
but did you bring anything with you that is not also for camping?

919
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,480
I don't have anything except the sanitizer.

920
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:12,960
I'm sorry.

921
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,760
I stole it.

922
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,720
It's not stealing.

923
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,400
I will now offer it to both of your friends.

924
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,280
That way, you know that I would have offered it to you as well.

925
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,280
And if you would like more, you can have some.

926
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,840
Thank you.

927
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,120
He like puts his hand on top of it and moves it toward you.

928
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,720
And he's like, do you want to pump?

929
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,560
I don't believe in sanitation.

930
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,840
I sort of think that like when people are supposed to die from germs,

931
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,440
they should just let it happen.

932
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,080
I put my hand out and as he pumps, I pull my hand away and let it fall on the floor.

933
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:40,960
Okay.

934
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
I need you to roll dexterity for me.

935
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,440
53.

936
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:46,960
53.

937
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,720
53.

938
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,640
53 on what?

939
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,840
What is your dexterity?

940
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,340
Oh.

941
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,140
Yeah, that would be a 50.

942
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,580
Oh, that's a fail.

943
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:04,180
So right before your hand gets out of the way, quite a bit of hand sanitizer glooshes

944
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,380
right onto those palms.

945
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,060
Right onto those pinchy boys.

946
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:16,020
And you get hand sanitizer and it's like too much that you couldn't even like wipe it like together.

947
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,340
I turn to Judy and I'm like, Judy, hold your hand out.

948
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,700
Okay.

949
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,700
Are you gonna touch my hand with your hand?

950
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,620
I put some hand sanitizer in my hand, please.

951
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,740
Well, I was going to, but now I'm not going to.

952
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,700
Okay, that's totally cool.

953
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,940
I don't even care that much, so it's fine.

954
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,220
So do you rub it in?

955
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,740
Yeah, you know.

956
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,260
This is what role playing is all about.

957
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,420
All right, cool.

958
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,340
And I've got another question here for this timid one.

959
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,940
What is your reason for not being here?

960
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,460
I've already filled out that one.

961
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,460
He's looking at the sheet and he's like, uh, yeah, you bring anything?

962
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,380
No, I already wrote that down as well.

963
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,940
Oh yes.

964
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,460
If you were to be hiding in the woods somewhere, where am I to re-find you?

965
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,180
Probably just like on the top of my head.

966
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,100
Probably just like whatever tree Liz is in.

967
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,220
It's probably where I'd be.

968
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,860
Whatever tree Liz is in.

969
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,580
Takes him a while to write it down, but he gets it done.

970
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,660
And the thumbtacks with the pictures go up on the board in the non-missing section.

971
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,980
And he looks back up and he says,

972
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,900
well, I think that each of you should have an excellent day.

973
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,460
And, uh, yeah.

974
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:33,220
And you notice as he turns around to post the thumbtacks into the bulletin board,

975
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:39,220
you see that there's a slight trickle of blood going down the back of his neck.

976
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,860
And it is starting to stain the uniform that he is wearing.

977
00:49:49,060 --> 00:50:04,340
Ash horn beam is looking around at the sun going down.

978
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:08,580
He's looking around at just trees surrounding him.

979
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,420
And then he hears a noise and looking in the direction of this noise,

980
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:22,100
you see that there's a tree that is emitting light from like a hollow point.

981
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,780
What are those called?

982
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,700
I know exactly what you're talking about.

983
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,380
They're like little round.

984
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,780
Yeah, I used to, there was one in my yard.

985
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,220
I used to put stuff in.

986
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:31,700
Exactly.

987
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,420
It's one of those.

988
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,100
It's like where you drop off.

989
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,540
It's like, put the money in the tree hole.

990
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,180
And, uh, with that in your mind, you think,

991
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,100
oh, there might be some loud money over here.

992
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,380
And you see that there is a bright light shining from inside this hole.

993
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:56,020
When I look around, am I in like a hollow or is it just trees all around?

994
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,460
Just trees all around.

995
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,540
Can I do a search to see if I've, is there anything else unusual around me?

996
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,180
Go ahead and roll.

997
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,580
21 on a 40.

998
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:15,940
There seems to be some sort of wire trip wire in between you and this bright light

999
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,380
shining tree that's making this noise.

1000
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:22,180
Okay, well I'm going to make my way over to the tree, carefully avoiding the trip wire.

1001
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,820
Carefully avoiding the trip wire and you're safe now.

1002
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,940
That is what I do.

1003
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,860
Stepping carefully over the trip wire.

1004
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,780
You feel this like great sense of pride in yourself.

1005
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,780
And I also, I turn back at the trip wire and I wink and I give it finger guns.

1006
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,460
The camera is pointed from up from the trip wire.

1007
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,140
That way you're looking directly into camera.

1008
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,580
Right directly into camera.

1009
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,220
And I go, not this time audience.

1010
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,380
It's good.

1011
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:49,780
Good.

1012
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,580
Break the fourth wall.

1013
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,140
It's important.

1014
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:58,420
So you are on the other side and you are right near this tree and you see that this light

1015
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:04,420
is emitting so brightly lit from inside the tree that you can't see what is inside this

1016
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,380
crevasse, this wooden crevice.

1017
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,940
But there's something inside.

1018
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,220
There's something deep in there.

1019
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,900
If I get like right up near it, it's not like blinding light, is it?

1020
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,140
No.

1021
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:19,060
If I get like right up near it, how big is the whole face sized?

1022
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,020
No, it's more like a forearm sized.

1023
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,740
Oh, okay.

1024
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:28,180
Well, I think how convenient is that?

1025
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,540
And I stick my hand into the hole and feel around up to my elbow.

1026
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,460
You stick your hand into the hole up to your elbow.

1027
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,820
Do I feel like the bottom or the sides of it up to my elbow?

1028
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,140
Yes.

1029
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:41,620
Okay.

1030
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,780
And inside you feel nothing.

1031
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,140
I'm going to sniff the hole.

1032
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:55,620
Well, your forearm is currently covering all the holes, so there's no more light emitting

1033
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,380
and your forearm seems to fit perfectly up to the elbow inside this hole.

1034
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,740
Okay, I pull my arm out after feeling nothing or do I?

1035
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:09,460
As you attempt to pull your arm out, you feel a great pain on your skin.

1036
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,420
Up to my elbow?

1037
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,300
All the way.

1038
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,380
Think of it like you have your arm inside of a catfish.

1039
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,180
I can actually vividly imagine that, yeah.

1040
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:28,900
Now imagine that the whole internal insides of a catfish are razor sharp all the way down

1041
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,660
from elbow to fingertip.

1042
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,740
Dang, so this is like noodling but in the woods instead of the water.

1043
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,900
Are you going to attempt to pull your arm out slowly?

1044
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,980
Very slowly because I'm thinking like if they're like pointed in to where like

1045
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,220
I don't hurt myself if I stay here but pulling out would be worse.

1046
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,900
Or like a finger trap.

1047
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:58,660
It is very similar to both of those ideas as you lose one hit point and the skin that

1048
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:05,540
makes its way out probably a centimeter's worth is not there anymore and it is just

1049
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:05,540


1050
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:09,300
Completely like not scratches or anything just completely raw.

1051
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:09,540
Yep.

1052
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,260
And you realize that you are trapped.

1053
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:26,820
Ash Hornbeam hasn't maybe ever felt this way before but he doesn't know what to do.

1054
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:58,820
She knows

1055
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,820
That the time has come

1056
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:12,820
To dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon

1057
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:38,820
She moves

1058
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,660
With the howling wind

1059
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:54,660
The sun has come again

1060
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:06,660
Her eyes have seen it all

1061
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:20,660
The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon
