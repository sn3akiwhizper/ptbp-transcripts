1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Hey, hey, hey, baby, baby.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,560
It's your surrogate uncle bringing all the funk.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,800
It's your big bad dad that is always so rad.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,200
Your mother that loves to smother.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,440
Your aunt that likes to use weird font.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,160
I'm all that and more, never an eyesore.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,440
It is I, Wolf the dog, and I am breaking through

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,440
all that mental fog to do what you ask.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,160
To broadcast live from 694.2 PTBP,

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,200
my various family members and or babies.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,160
Now, speaking of family,

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,480
we got a letter from someone very dear to us.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,640
This edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Taylor B,

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
who tagged that pretending pod over there on Twitter.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,720
They write, howdy wolf, the dog, not wolf's dog, wolf.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,800
Just wanted to drop a line and let you know

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
I've been greatly enjoying the radio show

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,920
you host every hour on the hour.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
Been listening to it nonstop

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,280
since I discovered it several days ago.

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,960
Or was it weeks ago?

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,320
I don't know anymore.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,720
I haven't turned the channel on my old radio

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,400
since I fixed it to 694.2 PTBP,

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,120
the only radio station my old box

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,240
even picks up anymore, I think.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,120
Anyway, I wanted to just send you a friendly reminder

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,960
that Mark Zuckerberg is absolutely the worst.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,360
However, I also wanted to remind you

30
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,400
he and his robot cronies are in charge of Instagram

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,240
as well as Facebook.

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,440
I mean, face foot.

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,320
I mean, ah, nevermind.

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,880
When you trust social media,

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,400
you're allowing your identity and your time

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,280
and your attention to be sold to the lowest bidder.

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,960
That's why I use my Twitter to pimp out cool shit

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,800
like pretending to be people.

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,640
You continue to haunt my dreams, wolfy boy.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,200
Keep it up.

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,280
You only listen every hour on the hour?

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
What about between the hours?

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,600
What about the infinite space between all of time?

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,960
The only social media wolf likes

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,360
was Craigslist Miss Connections.

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,960
Lot of folks think they see me skulking around

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,960
in the dead of night rummaging through a dumpster of three.

48
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
Lot of folks might be right.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,280
Remember, if you wanna write up something for your wolf

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,120
to have, tag us on the internet.

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,000
Fuck every billionaire.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Or write up a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.

53
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,040
All the links are in the show notes, my babies.

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,800
This here is part two of Scott Dorward's wretched

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,000
call a Cthulhu scenario bleak prospect,

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,360
run by another than the published author himself,

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
Scott Dorward.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,080
Don't step back because we're pushing forward.

59
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,480
Clench your rucksack,

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,520
because we're all cornered by Grady Philip drug

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,680
with real life.

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Life, surreal, in retrospect a dream.

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Easy times, feel less than serene.

64
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,760
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings.

65
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,120
So we long for days gone past us.

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,920
Grief and strife,

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,920
but even that's real life.

68
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Life.

69
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,760
Zach, will you make your bald head look like a cat again?

70
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,280
That's awesome.

71
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,880
It makes me think I'm like a Star Trek.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,320
I'm a Star Trek.

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,320
So, I mean, okay, so something that, you know,

74
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,880
when you see like bald cats that have those big folds,

75
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,600
something I did not realize is that cats that have

76
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,120
darker stripes on their heads, which is a lot of cats,

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,160
they just follow the pass of that fold.

78
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, wow.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,040
So all cats look fucking weird underneath their hair.

80
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,680
Oh, oh God.

81
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,160
Okay, well, I've got a tabby

82
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,400
and I'll never look at her the same way again now.

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,560
I know, I know.

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,560
Those are those weird like bald cat folds.

85
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,400
Oh, dear.

86
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,640
Dr. Coombs was feeling pretty good.

87
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Yes, so yeah, what actually happens with Dr. Coombs

88
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,400
is mechanically you gain seven points of pow

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,640
and six points of luck.

90
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,280
God's number and the devil's number back to back.

91
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,200
All I'm hearing is that I need to spend some luck

92
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,320
before I step on one of these things.

93
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,600
But yes, you are at the same time very aware

94
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,880
that this thing is moving around inside your foot.

95
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,280
You can't really feel it, but at the same time,

96
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,320
you can, you know, you just know it's there.

97
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,480
Do I maintain a sense of fear from it?

98
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Or does-

99
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,160
Well, it's up to you.

100
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,800
Is that okay with me?

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,680
When obviously you have a parasite

102
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,560
that has borrowed its way into your flesh.

103
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,760
So, I mean, that may not make you especially happy,

104
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,120
but on the flip side, you're feeling good.

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,960
You are a doctor,

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,760
so you might get to be more weary of it than most.

107
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,320
Yeah, if you don't want us to kill you

108
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,120
in the next 10 minutes of gameplay.

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
Doctor, where'd it go?

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,920
Guys, it's in, I think it's in my foot.

111
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,920
I can feel it.

112
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,080
I can feel it moving around in there.

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,920
It's a-

114
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,840
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

115
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,760
It's not the worst thing though.

116
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,600
What?

117
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,280
What's fucking worse?

118
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,520
It doesn't feel bad.

119
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
It doesn't feel bad.

120
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,960
It doesn't-

121
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
You are glowing, you're glowing.

122
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,680
You're positively fucking radiant.

123
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,360
Coombes kind of like straightens his back

124
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
higher than it's been in a long time.

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,720
Maybe like Crix's neck.

126
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,280
It's a-

127
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,120
It doesn't-

128
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,960
More confident.

129
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,920
It feels good.

130
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,760
It feels good.

131
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
It feels good.

132
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
You look good.

133
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,120
Doc, I'm just gonna say it, you're sexy.

134
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,040
We've all been thinking it.

135
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,680
Yeah, he kind of jogs in place a little.

136
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,920
Yeah, this is better than I felt in years.

137
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,600
This is, but I gotta get it out right though.

138
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,880
That I got, I mean, it's a parasite, right?

139
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,720
It's like-

140
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,680
Yes, yeah.

141
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,680
Put your foot up on the table, we're gonna chop it off.

142
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,400
We're gonna chop up your foot for sure.

143
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,240
Oh, hold on.

144
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,880
Let me see if I can wriggle around in there,

145
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,040
like that thing could.

146
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,920
Maybe it's still just flesh mush.

147
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,640
I mean, but I, yeah.

148
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,920
I grab the doctor's foot

149
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
and see if I can stick my fingers inside.

150
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,400
You certainly can.

151
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,520
Yeah, once you find the right spot in there,

152
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,840
your fingers just sink into the warm,

153
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
soft embrace of his flesh.

154
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, oh no.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,480
Oh, oh, doc, doc, yeah.

156
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm in your foot now.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
My fingers are in your foot.

158
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,160
Frederick Mellon I is jealous.

159
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,080
Does that cause me pain or is it just a thing?

160
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,880
It's just a thing, you barely feel it.

161
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,880
On the other hand, I think Thomas Dolan

162
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,960
needs to make a sand roll

163
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,040
because your finger is now deep within his foot.

164
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,080
That's a 15, he's fine with it.

165
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,120
It's just one of those things,

166
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,000
you know, life's been pretty kooky the last few years.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,320
Why would I let this, you know,

168
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,720
of all things get me down?

169
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,360
So Freddie, pass me those tongs.

170
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,800
Yeah, you go.

171
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
All right, doc,

172
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm gonna try to fish this thing out of you, all right?

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, if you can't, that's okay.

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,920
If you can't find it, that's fine too.

175
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,840
All right, yeah.

176
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,880
So if I keep, like,

177
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,040
does my hand just keep slipping up in there

178
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,360
without resistance, like?

179
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
Yeah.

180
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,680
What is the physical limitation of what I can get in there?

181
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,360
Sooner or later, I'm,

182
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,200
yeah, sooner or later you hit the barrier

183
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,880
of the edge of his foot

184
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,120
and your finger doesn't come out the other side.

185
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,360
So, you know, you get most of your finger into his foot.

186
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,480
Do I feel the little, do I feel the thing in there?

187
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,240
You absolutely do.

188
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,160
And it is quite spiky and there's a sharp moment of pain

189
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,400
as you can feel his little teeth biting into your flesh.

190
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,640
Freddie, there's no time for the tongs

191
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,400
and I'm gonna gingerly holding onto, like, two spikes,

192
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,160
just try to whip it out.

193
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Well, it's even easier than that

195
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,000
because its teeth have sunk into you.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
So as you pull your finger out,

197
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,280
it's just there clasped onto the edge

198
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,040
of your finger, wriggling.

199
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,960
Freddie, fucking step on it.

200
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,200
I don't care if you crush my finger,

201
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
you step on this motherfucker.

202
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,600
No, it went through his foot last time.

203
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
That's what we tried.

204
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,360
It's the same thing.

205
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,560
Right, okay.

206
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,040
We need another plan.

207
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,080
Frederick.

208
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,320
I didn't wanna do this.

209
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,120
And he just cocks the shotgun.

210
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,800
Hold on, hold on.

211
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,720
Who's got a lighter?

212
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,920
That's smarter.

213
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,360
I smoke, I've got a lighter.

214
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,440
Okay, yeah, you've got a Zippo lighter

215
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,520
with a little bit of fuel in it.

216
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,600
I flick it into the thing

217
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,720
and I put the flame to the bottom of it

218
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,640
and I see what happens.

219
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,440
Okay, yeah, I mean, it starts catching fire

220
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,560
and almost immediately drops off onto the ground,

221
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,800
screaming in pain.

222
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,720
There's a kind of purplish ooze coming out of it

223
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,160
as it's writhing on the ground in agony.

224
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm gonna bring the lighter to the ground

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,880
and try to torch the rest of the thing,

226
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,840
keep the flame to it and try to dispose of it.

227
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,360
Doctor, do you have anything flammable

228
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,840
you could dump on to make the flame bigger

229
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,960
but not too big to burn down your shack here?

230
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,080
Bit of rubbing alcohol.

231
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,680
I don't, yeah, I don't think I wanna start a fire.

232
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,760
Maybe we just keep doing the Zippo for a minute

233
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,600
and see if we can.

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,420
No, let's make it bigger.

235
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,120
No, let's get it really, really burning in here.

236
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,840
No, it looks like it's working.

237
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,000
It looks like the creature's dying.

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,080
Sorry, I can't see, my glasses are broken.

239
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,480
Maybe it was made by Bic,

240
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,520
but it does not like the Zippo, the Zippo interaction, so.

241
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,640
Yeah, and certainly after a few seconds

242
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,520
or 30 seconds or whatever of burning this thing,

243
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,320
it is very much dead.

244
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,720
What does my finger look like where it bit me?

245
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,760
Like it's had a small chunk of flesh bitten out of it.

246
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,640
But no spreading necrosis or?

247
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,880
Just blood and pain.

248
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,560
Ghostly voice emanating from it.

249
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,400
Okay.

250
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,920
Blood and pain, blood and pain.

251
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,780
I think it's gonna be all right.

252
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,780
So fire helps, fire helps against these things.

253
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,680
So we get some oily rags

254
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,720
and throw them on these fucking eggs

255
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
before they hatch into critters

256
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,840
that can pass through the walls of off-feet and mason jaws.

257
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,280
Yeah, well, I guess we're gonna have to do something.

258
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,880
We can't leave these here if they hatch.

259
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,120
Like you said, they'd run amok in this place.

260
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,920
Doc, I got a feeling there might be a few more people

261
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,500
in this camp with these eggs in them you could study.

262
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,680
So why don't we just burn these ones we got right now?

263
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,440
Yeah, I think that's what we gotta do.

264
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
I can't take the risk of this getting out of here.

265
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,160
Yeah, I mean, it's fairly simple.

266
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,360
You can just put a bit of surgical spirit in there

267
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,680
and light that and destroy the eggs

268
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,880
and the one that's hatched really easily.

269
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,160
Perfect, that's what we'll do.

270
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,880
Then you dispose of your specimens quickly,

271
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,960
simply, and without catastrophe.

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,900
Scott, you just saw us do the only smart thing

273
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,900
we've ever done in our entire role-playing careers.

274
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,440
I just kept my mouth shut the whole time.

275
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,760
I was like, just don't say anything and they'll fix it.

276
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,700
It'll be okay.

277
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,800
So, now what?

278
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,800
We gotta keep our eye on the prize at this point.

279
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,280
We gotta get Billy and Esther back.

280
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,460
I think we should head over to Hiram's old place.

281
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,500
So, Grillies or Greenleys?

282
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,600
Greenleys.

283
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,200
Greenleys, let's set out boys.

284
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
So, do you think they've been taking us

285
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,040
and putting the eggs inside of us

286
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,280
and then they hatch and then they go into other people

287
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,200
and that's how it's spreading?

288
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,440
You said something about a sacrifice earlier,

289
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,700
but I was thinking that maybe they just take us

290
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,260
to put the eggs inside of us.

291
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,380
Did Nancy, Nancy said something about them.

292
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,540
Did she say taken, they were taken people?

293
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,540
Did she say that?

294
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,940
No, she just said something about a puppet singing.

295
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,560
Before that though, she talked about people without faces.

296
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,940
Oh, that's right.

297
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,000
Maybe they were in masks

298
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,420
that don't have any designs on them.

299
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,060
Why don't we just worry about one spooky thing at a time?

300
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,860
But what if the spooky things are connected?

301
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,140
How likely is it that the spooky things are?

302
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,740
Park the car and have a job.

303
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,880
I'm sure they are.

304
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,340
I'm sure they are connected,

305
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,420
but let's just, you know, let's go to Greenleys.

306
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,300
We'll find out, we'll see what's going on.

307
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,820
You're operating under the assumption though

308
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,140
that maybe there's more of these things there.

309
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,900
Is that what you're saying, Frederick?

310
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,740
Should we take something?

311
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,560
Oh yeah, I think they're growing them.

312
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,620
I think they're breeding them.

313
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,620
Should we take something fiery with us?

314
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,180
Something we can use if we run into them?

315
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,500
Well, definitely, yeah.

316
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,560
I mean, we should, what do we got?

317
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
What do we got?

318
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,040
Probably we don't have access to a flamethrower.

319
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,280
I don't know if that's been invented yet.

320
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,600
In the medical shack, I mean,

321
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,720
you do have a little bit of surgical spirits

322
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
that you use for disinfecting wounds.

323
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
I'm not a whole hell of a lot, but you got some.

324
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,160
And you've also got maybe a pint of paraffin left

325
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,320
that you use for the heater.

326
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm gonna create little perfect,

327
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,160
little pocketable vials of flammable.

328
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,400
So mixing maybe the spirits and the paraffin if need be

329
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,520
and create like a little line of them

330
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,280
that I can hand out to the guys.

331
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,520
And then if we have lighters, each of us

332
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,920
or something like that, it's just, these are just like-

333
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,240
I pop one right behind my mouth

334
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,880
assuming it's a cyanide capsule.

335
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,880
I'm picturing them as like just little to-go fuel canisters.

336
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,920
Yeah.

337
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,160
Like you can pour them on something if you need to

338
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,240
to light it, but I don't think,

339
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,280
they're not like mini Molotovs, but like-

340
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,840
Glass vials of combustible.

341
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,240
Whatever.

342
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,080
Yep, okay.

343
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,000
It's definitely, it's awkward in his mouth.

344
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,840
But surprisingly tasty.

345
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,360
Dolan, drop it, drop it.

346
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,400
We all grab lighters

347
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,000
and I think we should head straight to Greenleys.

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,880
Okay.

349
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,640
Mr. Mellon, did you grab that shotgun?

350
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,480
Did that happen?

351
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,400
This one?

352
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,440
Oh yeah, I need to uncock it.

353
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,000
That's what it's called, right?

354
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,960
Depends on.

355
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,360
The kind of shotgun, I think.

356
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,400
It's this kind.

357
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,720
Yeah, it's a double barrel shotgun.

358
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,560
Yes.

359
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,240
So yeah, it's not a pump action one.

360
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,560
It's that kind, we say, pointing to what he's got.

361
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,400
Okay, it's kind of spooky, but let's go to Greenleys.

362
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,080
The back door was the idea, right?

363
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,920
Or the back window.

364
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,760
That's what Hiram said.

365
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,160
I'd say maybe even a mile before,

366
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,080
we're not gonna wanna be seen on the road heading there.

367
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,520
Or we're like a mile out, right?

368
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,200
Yeah, it's probably about 20 minutes walk

369
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,240
from where you are.

370
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,400
Maybe like a quarter mile.

371
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
We could get off the road.

372
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,480
I don't know why we gotta make it super hot on ourselves.

373
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Anyway, let's head out.

374
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Yeah, I mean, by this stage, it's probably early afternoon.

375
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,040
So you make your way up the road towards Greenleys.

376
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,200
And yeah, I mean, there are grounds to the house.

377
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,360
So you can make your way off the road earlier

378
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,640
than the driveway that goes up there

379
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,440
by perhaps forcing your way through a hedge.

380
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,280
And yeah, I mean, this is a fairly nice house.

381
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,800
It's got what you reckon are probably

382
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,040
several acres of ground, fairly well-tended.

383
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
The lawn's nicely manicured.

384
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,840
There's a few flower beds,

385
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,200
which obviously aren't in bloom at this time of year,

386
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,240
but are still in good condition.

387
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,840
I bet those are really nice when they're in season.

388
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Yeah, the house itself, it's a stone-built structure

389
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,040
in fair old size, probably no more than about 50 years old.

390
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,360
The thing that probably gets your attention

391
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,800
more than anything else is there are a number of cars

392
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,560
parked outside there.

393
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,400
It looks like Mr. Brink collects cars.

394
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,200
Can we get a sense of any activity from our vantage point?

395
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,080
Can we see maybe people in the windows

396
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,680
or if there's anybody working the grounds

397
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,840
or anything like that?

398
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,640
Sure, give me a spot hidden, Roll.

399
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,880
I failed a 57 on a 25.

400
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,720
Okay.

401
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,200
I rolled a 55 on a 55.

402
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,960
Yeah, certainly Freddy looking around

403
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,040
doesn't notice any gardeners or anything.

404
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,120
There don't seem to be any staff on site.

405
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,000
You can't really see any activity going onto the windows.

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
The place looks fairly quiet.

407
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,340
It looks good.

408
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,440
Do you wanna just move?

409
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,940
Hey guys, they should call him Mr. Cause, right?

410
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,480
They should call him Mr. Cause.

411
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,040
Does he come before an effect?

412
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,200
I'm confused, what are you talking about?

413
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,280
All the cause.

414
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,680
All his key, he's got a lot of, let's go to the back.

415
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,800
Did we see that big, Caddy?

416
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,720
Yeah, you do, there is a big black Cadillac

417
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,300
parked out the front.

418
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,580
Quiet, we gotta stay quiet as we're moving along

419
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,520
through the back, okay, because if anyone hears us

420
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,080
once we get within earshot,

421
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,920
they're not gonna take too kindly.

422
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,920
I'm afraid, you know, the face of a thief

423
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,960
is not one that people forget.

424
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Fred, are you saying you hit this place before?

425
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,760
If the servants here are the same as they were

426
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
when Hiram was here, then, hmm.

427
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,720
Wait, okay, well, but Hiram, he didn't really,

428
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,760
he doesn't know you robbed this place, right?

429
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,840
He also said he didn't have servants,

430
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,680
so who were those people there that night?

431
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,820
I don't know, okay, moving on.

432
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,860
Nevermind, we're good, no one's gonna recognize me,

433
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,500
not trying to make it harder for ourselves, that'd be silly.

434
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,040
Let's sneak into the back now.

435
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,120
All right, yeah.

436
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,840
Okay, well, you make your way around

437
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,480
to the back of the house, and sure enough,

438
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,000
there is a little, a small little wing

439
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,040
coming off the back of the house

440
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,500
that looks like it is probably the servants' quarters,

441
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,480
whereas the rest of the house is on two stories,

442
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,940
this is a one-story structure just out the back.

443
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,800
Okay, now, are we gonna try to sneak into the house

444
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,480
and kinda get a feel of what's going on,

445
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
or are we going straight down to the cellar?

446
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,640
Play it by ear, and a little bit of column A,

447
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,120
a little bit of column B,

448
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,760
we gotta get through that door first, though.

449
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,480
Yeah, our goal is to get through that,

450
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,240
it's the window that had the broken lock, right?

451
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,140
I think our goal should be the cellar,

452
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,320
but yeah, keeping an eye out on the lay of the house,

453
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
we're gonna have two kids,

454
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,260
we're dragging out with this, hopefully.

455
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,280
There's fucking dragons down there.

456
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,780
Fuckers call Cthulhu.

457
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,920
Dragons out!

458
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,600
Are you, what, just forcing the lock on the window?

459
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,840
Is your plan something else?

460
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna listen in

461
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
to try to look around through the window very stealthily

462
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
to get a lay to see if, obviously,

463
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,300
if there's someone right on the other side of the window,

464
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,800
I don't wanna try to break in.

465
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,060
Sure, you'd be able to see

466
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,600
if there was someone on the other side of the window,

467
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
there aren't any curtains up,

468
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,640
and looking in, there definitely isn't.

469
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,440
Then I'm gonna kinda cup my dirty,

470
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,880
my doidy hand around my ear,

471
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,400
and press it up against the glass,

472
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,420
and try to see if I can hear anything

473
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,800
going on inside the house.

474
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,100
Okay, give me a listen roll.

475
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,440
28 on a 50.

476
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,120
Yeah, you listen, and no,

477
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,740
you can't hear any activity at all.

478
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,760
It's dead silent inside.

479
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,960
So he's gonna go ahead and try to open up the window.

480
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,920
Well, I think you only need to give me a stealth roll here

481
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,120
because it's easy enough to force.

482
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,200
It's just a question of whether you can do so quietly.

483
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,560
43 on a 60.

484
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,840
I mean, sure enough, as per Hiram's words,

485
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,800
the lock on this is crap,

486
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,920
and so just with a bit of force, yeah, it cracks,

487
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,920
and you manage to avoid the noise of that being too loud,

488
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,480
and the window squeaking as you slide it up.

489
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,920
You have the window open,

490
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,280
and you can clamber inside should you wish.

491
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,360
Clamber indeed I do.

492
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,880
I'm gonna follow suit.

493
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,960
Frederick's kind of our guy who is breaky any,

494
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,640
and I trust that he has done his due diligence,

495
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,360
that this is an okay thing.

496
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,400
The coast is clear, so I just follow in his footsteps.

497
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,240
And as long as I don't hear anything

498
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,560
calamitous happen to them, I follow as well.

499
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,760
But I do pause for a moment

500
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,360
to make sure nothing calamitous happens to them.

501
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,560
If something calamitous is happening to them,

502
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,680
it's happening very quietly.

503
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,880
That's good enough for me to go on through.

504
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Okay, then yeah, the three of you clambering

505
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,880
through this window, and the room inside

506
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,640
is just a fairly simple bedroom.

507
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,600
There's an unmade bed.

508
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,120
Sorry, when I say unmade bed,

509
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,560
there are no sheets or anything on there.

510
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,200
It's just a mattress on the frame.

511
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,800
There's a wardrobe and a chest of drawers,

512
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,280
fairly simple looking furniture.

513
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,480
The whole place just looks unlived in.

514
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,400
You fellas know how long Hiram's not been here,

515
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,440
how long it's been since his partner bought this place?

516
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,680
Just at the start of it, you know,

517
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,640
all the recent troubles.

518
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,840
Enough time to have moved in.

519
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
Maybe he doesn't have enough people

520
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,680
to fill all these big, big house rooms.

521
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,400
Yeah, it just looks like there's no servants living here.

522
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,280
I say we press on into the house very quietly.

523
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,120
Agreed.

524
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,720
Yeah, the door from this room

525
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,840
opens out into a small corridor.

526
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,160
Down to the left, there's obviously a back door

527
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,040
that comes in this way.

528
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,920
Heading towards the right,

529
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,680
it seems to go towards the main house.

530
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,160
And you can see that, yeah, there is a door

531
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,520
that opens up into,

532
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,160
certainly it looks like it opens up into the main building.

533
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,240
There's also, off to your left,

534
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
a flight of stairs that seems to go down.

535
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,360
You know, if we go down first,

536
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,720
then we don't have to go into the big house.

537
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,360
Settlers are usually down.

538
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,680
I think we should go down.

539
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,320
We get, that's the direction, right?

540
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,440
I can only think of traps and pitfalls

541
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,960
existing in the rest of the house,

542
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,040
but we would figure out more of the fun mystery, so.

543
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,240
But let's go down.

544
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,360
You go down the stairs,

545
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,000
and as you reach the bottom, it opens up,

546
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,120
unsurprisingly, into some fairly large cellars.

547
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,160
It looks like it's broken up

548
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,840
into a number of different rooms.

549
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,080
But it goes into, you know,

550
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
initially one fairly large room

551
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,240
that's got shelves lining the walls,

552
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,400
most of which are empty.

553
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,840
There's obviously some old supplies,

554
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,520
or, you know, some old cleaning supplies

555
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,120
and a few jars sitting on the shelves

556
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,960
that look like they've probably been there for a long time.

557
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,720
There's spiders' webs.

558
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,760
There's an electric light you can turn on

559
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,520
so you can see what you're doing.

560
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,280
The only thing that stands out as being unusual

561
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,560
or worthy of note in this room

562
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,760
is there's a table towards the back

563
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,760
that has a metal cylinder or case,

564
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,560
or, you know, it looks like a large jar

565
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,840
or, you know, some kind of canister,

566
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,800
metal canister sitting there.

567
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,640
And next to it, there's a pair of heavy leather gloves

568
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,640
and a set of forceps.

569
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,880
What do you think, Doc?

570
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, it looks like there's something inside that canister

571
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
that needs leather gloves and forceps to be touched.

572
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,800
I don't know if I want to mess with that.

573
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,840
That usually means something's dangerous.

574
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,360
What if there was something in the canister,

575
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,000
something like what we've seen,

576
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,640
and that canister can hold it?

577
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,000
I think we need the canister and those gloves, yeah.

578
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah, I think 100% we should take it with us.

579
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,960
Seems like these dickheads down in the cellar

580
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
have found out the, you know,

581
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,240
the safe way to deal with these parasites, so.

582
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah, I think that's a good idea

583
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,280
that at the very least, if it is specimens,

584
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,760
that gives us another supply for me to test, yeah.

585
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,840
Yeah, I mean, the canister is,

586
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,320
I mean, it's about a foot in diameter.

587
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,440
Not that heavy, but as you pick it up,

588
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,080
you can feel liquid sloshing around inside.

589
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,640
If I shake it, can I feel anything other than liquid?

590
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,400
Can I feel anything hitting the sides?

591
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,200
Yeah, you can.

592
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,160
Yeah, there's definitely something suspended

593
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,000
in liquid in here.

594
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,520
But we can't see the liquid or anything in there, right?

595
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,440
It's a metal canister, no.

596
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,640
There's no glass in it.

597
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,800
I mean, it seems, you know,

598
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,800
maybe this is a thing for holding those fucking things.

599
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,040
If it's not, we got a cool canister, so.

600
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,840
I say that's what we put our money on.

601
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,320
We put our money on the fact that it's holding these things

602
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,640
and that this is where they start.

603
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,760
And we use it as a bargaining chip

604
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,700
as we head into the main house.

605
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,120
If we need to dump it out on the floor

606
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,720
or throw it on Casper, voice comes to voice.

607
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,640
Do you think there's any merit in opening it here now

608
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
just to see what's in it?

609
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,000
Absolutely not. On the grounds here?

610
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
No, no, I don't.

611
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,360
I don't think, no, no.

612
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,400
No.

613
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,840
All right, Mellon gets really close to Dr. Coombs

614
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,720
and puts his hand on his shoulder and says,

615
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,800
I could tell that you felt real good when it was inside you,

616
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,200
but we're gonna need you to stay.

617
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,760
Keep your fucking head on straight, you fucking nut.

618
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,720
Thank you.

619
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,840
Yeah, yeah, no, of course.

620
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,440
I just, if there was a place that we were going to open it,

621
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,400
it might be better here and not back at the town.

622
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,560
We're not gonna open it.

623
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,400
Where everybody is, but.

624
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,720
Yeah, we're not gonna open it here.

625
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,120
We're not gonna open it in the wolverville.

626
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,000
Fucking nowhere.

627
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,800
No, this is like worst comes to worst.

628
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,960
Like they come in and they say like,

629
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,920
we're gonna kill you.

630
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,880
We say, no, you're not.

631
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,040
We'll pour this on you or on the ground.

632
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,880
They probably don't want that either.

633
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,080
What if the guy who's got it says,

634
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,760
well, what, you're gonna hit me with my lunch pail?

635
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,960
And it turns out there's a sandwich

636
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,720
and a thermos of coffee in there.

637
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,480
Then it will turned out we will have been caught in a bluff.

638
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,600
But right now it seems like this is a good chip.

639
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,280
We got to roll with it and not let these parasites.

640
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,120
I'm with you.

641
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,360
Spread in the wolverville.

642
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,200
Yeah.

643
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,240
Doc, for all we know, these things are in you and me.

644
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,080
Well, actually, since we feel like shit

645
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,800
and my business partner started doing great,

646
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,760
maybe it's in him.

647
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,600
I don't know.

648
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,560
Maybe it feeds off two hosts simultaneously.

649
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,640
We got to figure it out though.

650
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,560
Yeah, there's a, you're right, you're right.

651
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,400
We shouldn't open it.

652
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,280
We shouldn't open it.

653
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,280
And, and, and we got to save those kids, QAnon.

654
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,960
Yeah, we, God.

655
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,800
Oh my God.

656
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,640
God.

657
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,160
Yeah, let's, let's keep going.

658
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,880
Let's see if, let's see if we can find anything down here.

659
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,040
I'm going to take that canister from you.

660
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
That's a good idea.

661
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,080
All right, here you go, here you go, Freddy.

662
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,760
You can, you can have the gloves.

663
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,800
Yeah, maybe put the gloves on your, on your feet.

664
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,680
Well, you poke around the rest of the cellars

665
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,040
and I mean, there's not really a lot else

666
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,520
of interest down here.

667
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,560
There is a bit of a wine cellar.

668
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,720
There's some fairly nice looking bottles of wine.

669
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,320
Should you know anything about wine?

670
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,360
Canonically, Thomas Dolan does

671
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,000
and he grabs a few nice bottles of wine

672
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,440
in case we have success.

673
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,280
Excellent.

674
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,240
What is that, a red?

675
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,600
I spent some time rubbing shoulders with, you know,

676
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,840
the Boston Brahmin and I can, I can tell you which,

677
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,920
a few of these bottles, you know, they're not,

678
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,200
they're not so bad.

679
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,120
Mm, tannins.

680
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,280
That's right.

681
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,920
That's right, Freddy, tannins.

682
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,680
Oh, it's got a floral bouquet.

683
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,520
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

684
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,800
Well, you poke around the rest of the cellars

685
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,600
and apart from your bottles of wine

686
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,360
and the canister of whatever the fuck it is you found,

687
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,600
you don't really find anything else of interest.

688
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,720
It looks like, it looks like they weren't keeping

689
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,680
anybody down here.

690
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,360
There's nothing, nothing, no signs of entrapment

691
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,600
or anything down here.

692
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,240
Catherine Zeta-Jones wasn't down here?

693
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,920
Catherine Zeta-Jones is not dancing beneath lasers

694
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,760
down here.

695
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,840
Before we head out, let me just quick poke around

696
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,080
just to make sure there's no like hidden doorways

697
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,120
or walls that aren't walls or nothing down here.

698
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,760
Okay, so you're having your poke around in the cellar.

699
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,720
You wanted to try to find any secret doors,

700
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,440
so give me a spot hidden roll.

701
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,840
Yes, 45 on a 55.

702
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Okay, you are fairly certain

703
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,200
that there are no secret doors down here.

704
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,440
There's no secret areas.

705
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,920
It is just a cellar.

706
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,840
Voic.

707
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,920
What do you think, Mr. Mellon?

708
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Did you see any doors?

709
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,760
Can we move on up?

710
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,080
No, I've been poking and prodding for all the two minutes

711
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,360
and there doesn't seem to be any stinking secret doors

712
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,680
down here, so I gotta keep my voice down.

713
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,400
Let's get back through into the main house

714
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,560
and then we'll get going.

715
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,960
All right, all right.

716
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,560
I'll keep this canister handy.

717
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,600
No offense, Mr. Mellon.

718
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,440
It's just that you were a snagglepuss there for a second.

719
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,160
My name's Frederick Mellon the First

720
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,120
and I don't understand the reference.

721
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,040
That makes sense.

722
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,960
It's 1932.

723
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,960
Let's go upstairs.

724
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Right, then yeah, you make your way back upstairs

725
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,280
and like I say, there is a door that looks like it goes

726
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,400
into the main house.

727
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,320
Freddie, you should do that ear thing

728
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,440
you were doing earlier.

729
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,120
Yeah, I'll squish my ear right up against the wall.

730
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,600
Okay, give me a listen roll.

731
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,600
Oh, that's a fail, 82 on a 50.

732
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,720
Yeah, there's no one there.

733
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,880
There's no one there.

734
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,600
It seems like the coast is clear.

735
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,440
Let's go on in.

736
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,000
Still be careful though.

737
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,360
Still be careful and quiet.

738
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,200
Why?

739
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,760
That's a good point.

740
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,600
There's no one there.

741
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,360
We don't have to worry now.

742
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,840
We should still be quiet.

743
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
I carefully cracked the door open about an inch

744
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,720
and I peep on through.

745
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,920
Yeah, you crack the door open

746
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,200
and it opens up into what looks like a fairly large kitchen.

747
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,200
There's a dining area there, a range cooker

748
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,320
and there's another doorway out from here.

749
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,720
Now that you're in the kitchen,

750
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,080
you can hear coming from upstairs

751
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,400
what sounds like someone snoring fairly loudly.

752
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,320
Boys, I don't want to be alarmist.

753
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,840
I don't want to jump to conclusions,

754
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,360
but it sounds like we might be dealing

755
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,000
with a fairytale troll or giant.

756
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,840
That's just my first read.

757
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,680
Let's move on further into the house

758
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,440
and see what we see.

759
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,600
Melon puts his finger up to his mouth

760
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,600
and like a shh motion points at like a butcher's knife

761
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,360
in this kitchen.

762
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,280
Dolan, put down your violin.

763
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,580
Yeah, that's been on my back this whole time.

764
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,560
Obviously since I haven't been playing it

765
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,340
and referencing it, it's not because I forgot.

766
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,960
I just assumed that you've been providing a soundtrack

767
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
all the way along.

768
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,360
As a rolling stealth check.

769
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,020
Tom has stolen his sneaky as fuck.

770
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,080
Yeah, so I'll grab that kitchen knife,

771
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,120
that big chef's knife and arm myself.

772
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,420
Good looking out, Freddie.

773
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,120
Are you moving en masse to the source of the snoring?

774
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,640
Are you doing something else?

775
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,600
What are you up to?

776
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,640
I'd like to look around remembering

777
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,840
that they were dragged through the shanty town.

778
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,120
I want to see if I can see any signs

779
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,480
of like dirty floors or more drag marks

780
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,960
or anything that would remind me

781
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,360
of those bodies being dragged through the dirt like that.

782
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,200
Sure, give me a spot heat and roll.

783
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,200
It's a fail, a 40 on a 25.

784
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,400
Oh, you don't see anything like that.

785
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,120
Fellas, I think we should just make our way

786
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,240
away from that snoring and find

787
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
what rooms we can cover down here.

788
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,480
And if we don't find the kids,

789
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,940
we'll have to go up there.

790
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,480
That is the exact opposite of what I was going to say,

791
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,080
but I say we go with your plan.

792
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,920
You wanted to go see who was snoring?

793
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,800
I thought maybe Dolan could put the knife

794
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,880
right against the snorer's throat.

795
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah, I mean, but what about your shotgun?

796
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,520
I mean, I could put it against his throat too,

797
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,080
but it's not very sharp.

798
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,300
Yeah, it's just more about the element of surprise

799
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,320
when you wake up, right?

800
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
Like if we're not going to kill him in his sleep,

801
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,520
getting gravelly again,

802
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,320
if you want to kill someone in the sleep,

803
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,260
a knife is a knife.

804
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,920
A knife in Harvard Yard is a perfect implement,

805
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,180
but if you just want to wake somebody up

806
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,520
and fucking scare them,

807
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,600
then let's go with a shotgun in their face, right?

808
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,200
Oh, man.

809
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,680
I don't mind the plan of,

810
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,880
that would actually cut out a lot of downtime of a search,

811
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,200
and if we just wanted to cut straight to the quick

812
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,800
and ask the people upstairs,

813
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,200
the person who's snoring upstairs,

814
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,520
where these kids are.

815
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,360
Hey, Sleepy, what the fuck?

816
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,160
Oh, good, so you already know what you're going to say.

817
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,680
So that's your plan, is it?

818
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,080
You're sneaking up the stairs.

819
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,320
Are all three of you going?

820
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,120
Are you sending one person up?

821
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,960
Let's do it.

822
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,720
All three.

823
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,560
Send it.

824
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,880
I think all three, yeah.

825
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Send it, bro.

826
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,320
Okay, so yeah, with three of you,

827
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
it's going to be pretty difficult to be stealthy,

828
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,920
but on the other hand, you're aided in this

829
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,760
by the fact that the person you're sneaking up on

830
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,960
is sound asleep.

831
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,120
So you make your way up the stairs,

832
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,320
which luckily are carpeted,

833
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,360
across the landing,

834
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,040
and the door to the master bedroom is open.

835
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,120
The whole place is fairly expensively furnished.

836
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,400
There's all sorts of object art

837
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,320
and expensive bits of furniture and so on,

838
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,160
but at the same time,

839
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,760
the whole place seems to be the best possible evidence

840
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,480
that money cannot buy taste

841
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,440
because everything just clashes with each other

842
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,360
and it all ends up looking a bit shit.

843
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,720
And you make your way through to the doorway

844
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,040
to the master bedroom,

845
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,880
and there is this really ostentatious four-poster bed there,

846
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,880
and there is a man lying there in maroon silk pajamas,

847
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,160
just lying sprawled across the bed,

848
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,120
snoring away at the top of his voice.

849
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,080
He's a middle-aged man, he's got graying temples,

850
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,360
he's fairly slim, fairly pale as well,

851
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,160
and yeah, he's out for the count.

852
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Melon hands the canister to Coombs.

853
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,160
I take it.

854
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
Raises the shotgun.

855
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,960
How's he laying?

856
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,800
Sprawled out, he's on his back,

857
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,280
he's sort of starfished out on the bed.

858
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,240
Gross.

859
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,920
Not a care in the world.

860
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,920
Yeah, I'll just aim the shotgun in between his eyes.

861
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,400
Okay.

862
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,880
Give him a gentle little nudge.

863
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,680
Hey, hey.

864
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,960
And yeah, he's sort of...

865
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,720
His eyes half open.

866
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,840
Hey, sleepyhead.

867
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,680
And he looks up to see three strange men

868
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,880
standing there holding weapons, and he just-

869
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,880
Don't move, there's a knife on your balls.

870
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,120
He just tenses up.

871
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,400
Look, fellas, I don't know what you want.

872
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,880
Look, take anything you want, okay?

873
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,120
Yeah, you want money?

874
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,760
Sure, sure, I got money.

875
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,520
Are you Hiram's old partner?

876
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,320
He looks really confused at this, and he says,

877
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,080
what, Melnick?

878
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,440
Yeah, I know Hiram.

879
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,840
Well, what's this got to do with Hiram?

880
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,840
Not much, except we come from the same Hooverville,

881
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,720
but we're the fuck of the kids.

882
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,080
Good God.

883
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,080
He looks confused for a moment, and...

884
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Look, what, the kids, the kids, yeah, okay, the kids.

885
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

886
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,320
You can see him thinking for a moment.

887
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the kids, the kids from last night.

888
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,840
Right, yeah, okay, all right.

889
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,160
Then if you want the kids,

890
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,640
yeah, I can tell you where to find them,

891
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,000
but I'll tell you what, you got to do something for me.

892
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Frederick Mellon I pulls back the thumb fellas

893
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,360
on his double-barreled shotgun.

894
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,720
Yeah, I'll do something for you.

895
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,480
I'll do something for you right now, and it's not kill you.

896
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,120
But unfortunately, what has not happened yet

897
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,200
is that I've not promised to cut off your balls,

898
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,640
so why don't you fucking stop talking?

899
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,640
He said, look, no, no, no, let's make a deal here, all right?

900
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,280
I know, I know who's got your kids.

901
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,760
The deal is that I don't cut off your balls.

902
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,480
I know who's got your kids.

903
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,240
I can make everything right for you,

904
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,240
but, but, but, and you can see gears

905
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,560
kind of clicking over in his head as he's saying this.

906
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,560
Yeah, all right, look, there's a guy who's got your kids.

907
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,840
He's got them in another house.

908
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,680
I'll tell you what, yeah, you let me phone him up.

909
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
I'll get him to go over there.

910
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,440
Yeah, he'll let the kids out for you.

911
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,320
But what you got to do for me is, yeah,

912
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,880
you look handy with those guns, with those knives, whatever.

913
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,120
Yeah, I mean, when he goes there to let your kids out,

914
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,960
you do whatever you want with him.

915
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,400
Yeah, I mean, you want to kill someone over this.

916
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,720
He's the one who took your kids.

917
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,480
You just shoot him.

918
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,440
Yeah, yeah, you do that.

919
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,120
Everything's fine, everything's great.

920
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,920
You're saying that this guy is behind the kidnapping.

921
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,280
He's the one that came into our camp and took our children.

922
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,120
Yeah.

923
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
And you had nothing to do with it.

924
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,840
They just came to your fucking house.

925
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,760
They just used your property.

926
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,240
What is this fucking canister?

927
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,080
Why don't you tell us what this fucking canister is

928
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,440
that we found in your basement?

929
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,800
He looks really alarmed as you're holding that up.

930
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,120
He says, yeah, you don't want to open that, all right?

931
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,960
What if we do though?

932
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,000
What if we open it right above your belly button?

933
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,840
Yeah, how about that?

934
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,160
What if it goes in right above your belly button?

935
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,400
Do you want to tell us what's going on?

936
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Or do we pour this canister in your fucking abdomen?

937
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,680
Does someone want to make an intimidate roll here?

938
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,800
Yeah, I think this is a very good opportunity

939
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,040
for an intimidate roll.

940
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,000
57 on a 50.

941
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,840
I'll tell you what,

942
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,440
as you are holding this canister above his belly button,

943
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,560
I will let you have a bonus die on that.

944
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,040
Okay, that's just another D10?

945
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,880
Yeah.

946
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,720
Or what is that?

947
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,760
Yeah, it's another D10

948
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,040
and you take that as your 10's result if it's better.

949
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,760
Is it lower than a five?

950
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,040
No, it's five.

951
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,880
Oh, okay.

952
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,120
Same thing.

953
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,440
So you can spend seven luck

954
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,720
and turn that into a success if you want.

955
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,000
I will absolutely do that.

956
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,840
Okay.

957
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,400
I will spend a seven of my 20 luck.

958
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,080
So I'm down to 13.

959
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,320
Fantastic.

960
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,640
Horrifying, that was horrifying.

961
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,520
He's looking really scared at this stage

962
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,160
and he says, look, fellas,

963
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,000
you don't know what you're doing with those things.

964
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,440
Just don't let them out of there, okay?

965
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,800
All right, I mean, I'll take you to your kids.

966
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,960
Why don't you tell us what we're doing with those things?

967
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,800
Why don't you tell us

968
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,600
what you're doing with those things?

969
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,160
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, all right?

970
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,240
Why don't you try us?

971
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,240
Do you believe that my knife is still on your balls?

972
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,000
Do you believe that my knife is still on your balls?

973
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,960
All right, look.

974
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,720
He says, look, all right,

975
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,680
I'll tell you what I know,

976
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,160
but look, you're not gonna believe any of this.

977
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,560
You guys ever hear of a guy called Aston Hawks?

978
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,200
Have we?

979
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,240
Actually, I think out of all the pre-gen characters,

980
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,720
no, no, you don't.

981
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,560
So no, I mean, you may have heard

982
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,440
a couple of the people around the camp,

983
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,440
maybe Maureen Frayne or Carl Rothstein mention him,

984
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,080
but yeah, I mean, you've heard the name.

985
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,160
Heard the name?

986
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,000
Why?

987
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,840
What of it?

988
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,880
Hawks, Hawks, he built a machine.

989
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,320
Don't ask me how it works.

990
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,400
Yeah, Sedgwick, he's the one who knows all that stuff.

991
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,160
I don't know, I know how to switch it on.

992
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
That's about it.

993
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,680
But there's this machine and you turn it on

994
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,680
and I don't know, he says something about higher realms,

995
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,920
higher dimensions, something like that.

996
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,920
All I know is that there are these things on the other side

997
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,960
these creatures and he points at the canister

998
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,960
and it's like we go fishing for them.

999
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,680
We get those, we get the good ones,

1000
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,280
we put them in the canister, those ones we can use.

1001
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,280
And when we use them, you put them inside someone

1002
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,600
and it's like they feed on them.

1003
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,360
They feed on something inside them.

1004
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,720
But if you're fast, if you're clever,

1005
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,480
if you get one that's just fed

1006
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,320
and then you put it inside yourself,

1007
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,760
it's like everything that it can't digest itself

1008
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,920
goes into you.

1009
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,600
Wow, so you're literally feeding on the poor.

1010
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,600
It sounds so sordid when you put it like that.

1011
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,760
After it feeds, does it leave the body by itself?

1012
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,520
Does it, is it full and then it leaves?

1013
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,080
No, you take it out again.

1014
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,480
With the forceps?

1015
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,520
Yeah, you don't want to touch those things with your hands.

1016
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,200
What happens if it gets out of control?

1017
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,240
Well, that's again, that's what the forceps are for.

1018
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,520
You don't want to lose control of these things.

1019
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,520
So you people did this to the Hooverville on purpose?

1020
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,880
Well, not you people, Sedgwick did all of this.

1021
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,360
I mean, yeah, it's not me.

1022
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,240
Oh, and you just benefited.

1023
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,080
Well, wouldn't you?

1024
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,920
No, we're trying to stop this fucking thing.

1025
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,920
The second we found out about this shit,

1026
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,440
we thought it was fucked up and we tried to stop it.

1027
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,760
That's the difference between us and you.

1028
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,600
Why were these kids in your basement?

1029
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,160
The kids aren't in my basement.

1030
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,760
No, but they were in your car.

1031
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,840
They were dragged here in your car, that's right.

1032
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,200
They were dragged here in the car to your yard.

1033
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,400
Like I said, it's Sedgwick,

1034
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,920
going Sedgwick just got me to drive them.

1035
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,000
Oh, you're just as fucking chauffeur now?

1036
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,840
Yeah.

1037
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,880
Did you get the bugs in your feet or whatever?

1038
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,840
They went in the doc's feet.

1039
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,520
He looks completely and comprehendingly at you.

1040
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,520
What I'm asking is have you had the bugs in you?

1041
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,280
Yeah.

1042
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,960
After they fed on people in the Hooverville?

1043
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,160
Look, like I say, you want Sedgwick,

1044
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,160
he's the mastermind behind all this.

1045
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,240
I've had enough to blow this guy's brains out.

1046
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,280
He seems to me like a willing participant.

1047
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,360
Yeah, I mean, unless he gives us the address

1048
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,240
in like three, two.

1049
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,360
Prospect, he says, prospect.

1050
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,320
Trigger pulled.

1051
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,800
Okay, and shall we leave the session there?

1052
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,360
Yeah, it's a good fight, yeah.

1053
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,480
As you blow Casper Brinks' brains out

1054
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,420
all over his expensive silk sheets.

1055
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,620
Oh, holy shit.

1056
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,980
Wow, that's awesome.

1057
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,780
Let's burn this fucking house down.

1058
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,620
We got so much information out of a person

1059
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,140
we were about to not disturb.

1060
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,340
Well, we don't want to be rude.

1061
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,100
He's sleeping.

1062
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,180
Shh.

1063
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,180
You very politely blew his head off.

1064
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,060
Yes.

1065
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,300
Wow.

1066
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,500
As the shotgun blasts, the upper body of Casper Brink

1067
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,660
gets shredded into just so much meat,

1068
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,860
bits of him splatter across the four-poster bed

1069
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,220
and blood pools into the sheets around

1070
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,620
as his carcass just gives its last few twitches on the bed.

1071
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,300
Let's have a sanity roll for this bit

1072
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,660
of cold blooded murder.

1073
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,500
What?

1074
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,820
I failed real bad, an 85 on a 37.

1075
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,060
Yeah, a 98 on a 75.

1076
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,380
Okay, and how about Mr. Dolan?

1077
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,380
I rolled an 81, I don't think I passed.

1078
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,300
Well, it sounds like each one of you has failed,

1079
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,020
in which case let's have a D6 sand roll

1080
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,060
for each one of you.

1081
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,100
Six.

1082
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,100
Ah, six.

1083
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,540
I got a five.

1084
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,620
Fucking hell, holy shit.

1085
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,220
Okay, can each one of you make intelligence rolls?

1086
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,460
33 on a 60.

1087
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,540
I got 17 on a 60.

1088
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,060
That's 15 on a 70.

1089
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,060
So you all passed.

1090
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,940
Well, it's not very often you have three characters,

1091
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,820
the only three player characters in the scene,

1092
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,700
go into a bout of badness at the same time.

1093
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,020
So what I'm going to say, I'll use the rules

1094
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,900
for what happens if a character on their own

1095
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,180
has a bout of madness,

1096
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,500
but just apply it to all three of you.

1097
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,140
So I think given the shock of what's happened there,

1098
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:52,700
and the fact that you perhaps didn't anticipate

1099
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,700
just what the consequence of this perhaps rash action was,

1100
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,620
a little while later, the three of you

1101
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:05,260
basically find yourself wandering through the Hooverville,

1102
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:10,220
just not really quite able to understand how you got there.

1103
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,660
You don't have the shotgun anymore.

1104
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,380
You don't know what the hell happened to that.

1105
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,780
It could be anywhere at this stage.

1106
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,700
The three of you are still covered with a spray of blood

1107
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,300
from Brink's exploding corpse.

1108
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,700
Your ears still have the echo

1109
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,580
of that shotgun blast going in them.

1110
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,580
And you perhaps don't really realize what's going on

1111
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,460
until, let's say, Professor Rothstein

1112
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,940
just sees these three figures come back into the camp.

1113
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,460
You're there by the campfire with a few others

1114
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:47,100
having what passes for coffee there.

1115
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,500
And you see, yeah, the three who went off earlier

1116
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,500
in search of the kids coming back.

1117
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,820
They are, like I say, covered in blood

1118
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,380
and some stuff that maybe isn't blood.

1119
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,100
There's some fleshy bits and fragments of what may be bone

1120
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,940
wedged in bits of their clothing.

1121
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,220
And each of them just has this vacant look

1122
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,820
about their faces.

1123
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,500
Hello, what is this?

1124
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,340
Come.

1125
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,100
I'm looking around at the other people sitting with me

1126
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,260
and like wide-eyed.

1127
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,780
Yeah, they're all looking at these three in alarm as well.

1128
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,580
As Dolan stands there, there's something

1129
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:32,620
that just falls off the lapel of his rather tattered coat

1130
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,300
and lands on the ground.

1131
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,660
Something kind of gray and spongy

1132
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,980
that just bounces on the ground

1133
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,140
that looks unpleasantly organic.

1134
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,940
Oh my God.

1135
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,420
I pour three cups of coffee into like little tins

1136
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,660
and just walk over and offer it to them.

1137
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,260
I think Nathaniel would like kind of eagerly

1138
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,820
grab it shaky-handed.

1139
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,620
Technically you're now an accessory.

1140
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,460
And he would cup it with two hands

1141
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,260
and gently try to suck down some coffee.

1142
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,860
Yeah, it tastes nasty enough

1143
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,700
that it starts rooting you back in reality.

1144
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,540
Are you okay?

1145
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,740
Sure, sure, sure, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1146
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,820
Is this blood?

1147
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,980
Can we talk in private, doc?

1148
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,820
Sure.

1149
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,220
And I don't move, I'm standing right by him.

1150
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,900
You mean like in your tent or something?

1151
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,260
Oh, yes.

1152
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,860
I like lead the way to my abode.

1153
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,740
Dolan makes a comment like,

1154
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:48,260
shouldn't have picked up that shift at the butchers

1155
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,420
to the people around the campfire.

1156
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,940
We're all probably gonna go vegetarian.

1157
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,660
Dr. Rothstein leads the three of you off

1158
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:04,060
towards his sort of lean-to shack

1159
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:07,340
where you can have a private conversation.

1160
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:11,020
I pull the tarp aside that I'm using for a door

1161
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,380
and like usher them inside.

1162
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,620
Nathaniel Coombs is gonna try and find

1163
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,260
just the nearest seat that he can sit in

1164
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,420
and contemplate his existence now

1165
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,460
as he looks into his cup of bad coffee.

1166
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,900
Frederick Mellon I hasn't come in yet

1167
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,100
and you just hear from the other side of the tarp

1168
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,540
this dry retching from outside

1169
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:36,060
and he kinda limps and slowly wiping at his mouth.

1170
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:44,580
And then you see his left index finger is just going wild.

1171
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,220
The rest of him is very, very steady almost,

1172
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,420
like not moving at all, scared to move

1173
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,860
but his left index finger just keeps moving.

1174
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,740
And how about Mr. Dolan, is he going into the shack?

1175
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,260
Dolan goes into the shack

1176
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:04,300
and he's just looking for any kind of water basin

1177
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:09,300
or tub, anything to start washing the viscera off with.

1178
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,980
If he can't find it, he just pours his coffee out

1179
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,820
on his hands and starts rubbing that.

1180
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,460
Yeah, I mean, you can start getting yourself a bit cleaner

1181
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,020
at least sort of get some of the bits out of your hair

1182
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,700
and beard and stuff like that.

1183
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,980
Come in, have a seat.

1184
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:28,980
Carl, we met somebody that they said a name

1185
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,700
and it's a name that I've heard you say before.

1186
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,540
Hawks and Frederick Mellon just runs over like quickly

1187
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:43,700
to Carl Rothstein, grabs just blood-soaked hand

1188
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:48,700
on your lapel and just holds on less aggressive

1189
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:54,020
than desperate and looks at you with pleading eyes.

1190
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,780
Hawks.

1191
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,620
Yes.

1192
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,940
What?

1193
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,220
Yeah, Carl Rothstein immediately thinks

1194
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,900
of Professor Hawks and snaps too.

1195
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,420
Well, that's good.

1196
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,420
Listen, doc, they're putting bugs in people's bellies,

1197
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,460
they're laying eggs, they're eating them,

1198
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,700
weird shit's going on.

1199
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,540
What do you know about it?

1200
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,540
Me.

1201
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,300
No, the other doc.

1202
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,140
Me?

1203
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,500
Yeah, you.

1204
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,900
Rothstein, it seems like you might be stalling.

1205
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,340
Stalling, no, I'm-

1206
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,220
Yeah, what did you just walk into the situation

1207
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,300
without any prior knowledge? I'm just very confused.

1208
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,660
Let me check my notes

1209
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,900
and see if I have anything about this.

1210
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,180
He walks over to a desk on the back.

1211
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,140
It's called a book called Memories

1212
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,660
and he clips through it.

1213
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,700
Austin Hawks, that's the name we heard

1214
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,380
and I've heard you mention it before.

1215
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,380
Who is he to you?

1216
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,940
I was friends with Professor Hawks,

1217
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,740
but he disappeared.

1218
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,380
This might sound like a funny question,

1219
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,100
but when he disappeared, did it feel like

1220
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,620
any of your greatness disappeared with him?

1221
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,060
I mean, look at me now, of course.

1222
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:14,020
Oh, but this was years before the depression

1223
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,900
that he disappeared.

1224
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,740
He disappeared something like eight years ago.

1225
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,260
A question retracted, doc.

1226
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,020
I'll forget you ever even asked it.

1227
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:21,860
Sustained.

1228
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,660
I mean, he disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

1229
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,660
I mean, he used to live in the Prospect Estate with Crawley

1230
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,980
and was last seen there.

1231
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,420
Yeah, just read from your book of memories over there.

1232
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,860
Nathaniel's eyes widen, prospect, prospect.

1233
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,500
And he's looking at his other guys.

1234
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:44,340
Have you men been to a different dimension?

1235
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,260
We suspect not, but that some kind of creature

1236
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,980
from a different dimension, you know, is like.

1237
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,300
The canister, where's the canister?

1238
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,340
Oh, fucking shit.

1239
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,180
Nice.

1240
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,580
Do we at least have the forceps?

1241
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,180
Nope.

1242
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,580
God.

1243
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,700
We must've left it all back there.

1244
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,540
Oh God.

1245
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:11,100
I don't know where we would've, why we would've, I don't.

1246
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:11,940
Well, I mean, it's not like

1247
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,180
he's over there futzing with it, you know.

1248
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,700
Frederick Mellon the first checks his pockets

1249
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,940
for keys to a big black Cadillac

1250
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,860
that he's really hoping that they took with him.

1251
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,540
Well, I'll tell you what, give me a luck roll

1252
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,780
to see whether you picked up the keys.

1253
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,180
I have 70 luck.

1254
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,860
And I, oh, I passed.

1255
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,260
I was really scared, I was gonna say that

1256
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,460
and then still fail, 50.

1257
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,340
Then yeah, you do check your pockets

1258
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,900
and you do find the keys to the Cadillac in there.

1259
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,300
And an ear.

1260
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,260
Yes.

1261
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,820
And he holds them both out in one hand.

1262
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,460
We were at Greenleys, we were at Greenleys

1263
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,780
and we followed that big black caddy out there.

1264
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,900
Ida told us at the Blue Star Diner,

1265
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,580
that's what led us all the way out there

1266
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,340
and then we decided we heard the man sleeping

1267
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,900
and we thought, oh no, forget it, you're home to Bel Air.

1268
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,020
And we said, let's go upstairs and maybe check on him.

1269
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,980
But then we killed him and now he took his car.

1270
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,540
Okay, so if we have his car,

1271
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,380
we'll be able to get back there pretty easily

1272
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,700
because we need that canister

1273
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,020
and we probably need the shotgun.

1274
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,340
Maybe he's got other stuff too.

1275
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,340
We can disguise ourselves with his clothes

1276
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,540
and maybe other guns that he might have,

1277
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,020
recheck his basement perhaps,

1278
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,140
but maybe we don't have time

1279
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,500
because we need to get the prospect.

1280
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,580
Oh, fuck Carl, are you gonna come with us?

1281
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,020
Please help.

1282
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:33,460
Carl is standing in his little shack

1283
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:37,740
surrounded by these men covered in goo and blood

1284
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:38,700
and who knows what.

1285
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,660
And he's wide-eyed the entire time

1286
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,620
that Frederick is saying that.

1287
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,580
If you need my help, I'll come.

1288
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:50,420
I'm not sure.

1289
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,180
He doesn't seem convinced yet, Carl.

1290
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,980
Dr. Coombs, please tell him about the creatures.

1291
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,900
Tell him about the creatures.

1292
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,100
Tell him how fucked up it was.

1293
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,380
The creatures, listen, Carl,

1294
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,140
the long and short of it is we've killed tonight

1295
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,140
and we'll kill again.

1296
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,220
Who did you kill?

1297
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,660
You if you don't come with us.

1298
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,620
Whoa, what?

1299
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,820
Are you serious?

1300
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,020
Carl, do you know where Prospect is?

1301
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,700
I want to say yes.

1302
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,020
Then do it, man, damn it.

1303
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,620
It's a couple of miles from here.

1304
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,820
It's a couple of miles down the road towards Arkham.

1305
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:29,300
Of course, I mean, are you going to hurt me?

1306
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,540
Not if you take us there, doc.

1307
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,740
Okay, how do you suppose we get there?

1308
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,620
Frederick holds up the ear.

1309
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,580
I mean the keys.

1310
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,260
Okay, yeah, if you drive, I can show you the way.

1311
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:47,060
Maybe you can fill me in on some stuff on the way.

1312
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:47,900
I doubt it.

1313
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,420
The car, which is parked at a crazy angle

1314
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,100
on some waste ground between the main road

1315
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,420
and the shanty town.

1316
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,660
As long as there's no cops around it,

1317
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,300
then Frederick turns back and is like,

1318
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,140
hey, and if we're super lucky, then maybe in the trunk,

1319
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:13,260
there's a shotgun and a canister of void fish.

1320
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,900
Of what?

1321
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,860
I was just calling them void fish.

1322
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,780
What a void fish.

1323
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,180
Well, they lay eggs.

1324
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,860
That's about all we know of their biology.

1325
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,340
I'm from a void and I'm a big adventure zone fan.

1326
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,180
All right.

1327
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,180
Okay, I'm going to sit in the passenger seat

1328
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,540
and you just tell me when you're ready.

1329
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:31,380
Oh, that's good.

1330
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,500
Cause I got that one all bloody on the way over here.

1331
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,340
So I'm going to sit in the back in the first seat.

1332
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:39,540
What I'd like at this stage then is a group luck roll.

1333
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:42,340
So whoever's got the lowest luck out of the four of you

1334
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,660
guests make a luck roll.

1335
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,940
I think that's Thomas.

1336
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,460
He spent seven on the 20 he had.

1337
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,100
Oh God. So he's got 13.

1338
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:51,940
Yeah.

1339
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,980
I'm not sure how much,

1340
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,940
cause I got a bonus for a little bit.

1341
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,500
Did that get taken away from me?

1342
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,180
No, no, you still have that.

1343
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,940
Okay. Then I've got 25.

1344
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,660
All right, Thomas, you got this.

1345
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,900
All right, here it goes.

1346
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,420
85.

1347
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,700
Hell yeah, dude.

1348
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,620
Okay.

1349
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,460
So as you're getting into the car,

1350
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,220
there's no sound of the shotgun,

1351
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:17,220
but you do see that the canister is there in the back seat.

1352
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,380
At some point.

1353
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,220
Is it open?

1354
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,740
At some point it seems to have got open.

1355
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:26,740
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1356
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,780
Is it, is it sitting open as we get in the car or is it?

1357
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,620
Oh yes.

1358
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,580
Is it resealed?

1359
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,420
It's sitting up.

1360
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,980
No, no, it's sitting there on its side in the footwell,

1361
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,500
the top of it off.

1362
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,340
Yeah.

1363
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:42,380
Can we do a search or spot hit and roll for any of these,

1364
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,860
these creatures in the car?

1365
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,860
You certainly can.

1366
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,140
Like lurking under the seat.

1367
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,420
Or inside of us.

1368
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,180
I pass 43 on a 55.

1369
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:55,580
You do see something gray

1370
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:59,260
as wriggling underneath one of the seats.

1371
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:04,260
You also notice a trail going through the undergrowth

1372
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,420
away from where the car is parked,

1373
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:10,020
heading in the direction of the camp.

1374
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,860
Oh shit.

1375
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,380
That is very, very not good.

1376
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,620
Well, look on the bright side fellas,

1377
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,940
we let it escape, but we do have the canister,

1378
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,420
so we can't recontain it.

1379
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,980
Are there forceps there?

1380
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:23,820
No.

1381
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,900
Doc, you took a Hippocratic oath,

1382
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:29,220
so I nominate you to grab the creature when we find it.

1383
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,700
Yeah, just scoop it.

1384
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,900
I'm sitting in the passenger seat.

1385
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,580
I'm finally like soaking in some blood that was on it

1386
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,180
and like feeling wet.

1387
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,220
And I hear that.

1388
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,340
Whatever you need, just.

1389
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,580
That's wicked good of you, Doc.

1390
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,820
It's for mankind.

1391
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,140
Okay.

1392
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,540
Keep in mind when we say Doc,

1393
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:51,380
we're talking to both Doc Combs and Doc Rothstein

1394
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:52,220
at the same time.

1395
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,420
I felt like I dodged a bullet there, yeah.

1396
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,260
Thanks.

1397
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,180
I'm not gonna go around thinking of two names for doctors.

1398
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,100
I mean, you were obviously out of it for a while.

1399
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,300
At this stage, it is beginning to get dark.

1400
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,020
So are you following the trail of this thing

1401
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,180
back towards the camp?

1402
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,940
Are you staying in the car

1403
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:20,540
and trying to deal with the thing that's loose there?

1404
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:23,580
Are you finding another way of getting into prospect?

1405
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,900
What's your plan?

1406
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:29,260
This Austin Hawks guy, we were told he built some machine.

1407
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,460
I think it's this thing that brings these creatures in.

1408
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,460
He might have more sophisticated ways of capturing them.

1409
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:37,220
When you got a problem, you gotta root it out at its source.

1410
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,060
Otherwise, the little fingers that go out in the toes

1411
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:43,620
that spread their little wormy ways into the world around it

1412
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,220
will just continue to grow and grow.

1413
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:49,300
If you cut off one finger, then you got nine left.

1414
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,980
But if you cut off two hands at the same time,

1415
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,340
then you got no fingers.

1416
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,980
I think we should find this thing

1417
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,420
before it infects the camp.

1418
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,940
I think we should probably help the people.

1419
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,340
It doesn't seem like a finger.

1420
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,980
It seems more like its own thing

1421
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,540
that can operate independently of a hand.

1422
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,980
Maybe we should help the people real quick.

1423
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:15,500
Because the big fancy place, that's not going nowhere.

1424
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,220
But this thing's on the move.

1425
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,260
How would we begin to find it?

1426
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,660
It seems to have left a pretty clear trail, right?

1427
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,500
Yeah.

1428
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,380
You've noticed, certainly,

1429
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,380
there's some of the undergrowth that's been disturbed

1430
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:30,460
and it is leaving a fairly subtle trail of slime,

1431
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,940
which you've managed to spot.

1432
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,820
Like I say, it is beginning to get dark at this stage.

1433
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,380
You're gonna have to try to find it fairly quickly.

1434
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:42,580
Otherwise, you're going to lose it in the dark.

1435
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,940
I thought my analogy was great,

1436
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,300
but I'm easily persuadable.

1437
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,980
Let's search for this thing.

1438
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,380
So you carry on following this trail

1439
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:53,300
and it goes up to one of the tents.

1440
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,940
And you realize, yeah, it's the tent that Nancy Carver

1441
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:01,260
was in earlier, the woman who'd seen the weird stuff

1442
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:06,260
last night and had gone into some kind of fugue stated

1443
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,340
as a result.

1444
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,940
And this thing just goes up to the fabric

1445
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,380
on the side of her tent.

1446
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:16,500
And then there's just this wet spot in the fabric

1447
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,860
of the tent as if it's moved through it.

1448
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:20,780
Yuck.

1449
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:22,900
Wicked yuck.

1450
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,700
That's a no from me, dog.

1451
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,180
Should we look around in the tent?

1452
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,180
Nancy, Nancy, you in there?

1453
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:36,660
You can hear the sound of someone breathing heavily

1454
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,580
as if they're sleeping.

1455
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:41,940
And as you shout her name, she stirs a little bit

1456
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,940
and her first reaction is a sort of whimpering sound.

1457
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,700
And then she says, who is it?

1458
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,580
We got faces, I'll tell you that much.

1459
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:57,100
It's Fredrick Mellon I, Carl Rothstein, Thomas Dolan,

1460
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,900
and Daniel Coombs.

1461
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,980
That's two doctors, we're very legitimate.

1462
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,260
We're here to check up on you, Nancy.

1463
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,460
We know you had quite a day yesterday.

1464
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,620
I just need to sleep.

1465
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,980
I need to sleep.

1466
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,900
Yeah, that makes sense.

1467
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,260
But we're worried about a situation

1468
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:15,940
that has come to become a present issue.

1469
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:19,220
If you could come on out, please, or allow us to come in.

1470
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,380
There's a bit of movement inside

1471
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,380
and she staggers up to the door of her tent

1472
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,060
and opens it up.

1473
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:35,020
And yeah, she's looking very pale in the fading light.

1474
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,020
Her eyes are a bit unfocused,

1475
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:41,460
her hands trembling as it's holding onto the tent flap.

1476
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,340
What is it?

1477
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,180
What do you want?

1478
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,420
Excuse us for one moment, Nats.

1479
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,980
Could we huddle real quick?

1480
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:55,700
So she's got it, right?

1481
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,780
She's, it's, that's-

1482
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,460
Yeah, it's inside of Lee.

1483
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,300
Yeah.

1484
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,420
What is inside of her?

1485
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,780
It's a void fish, if you like, a space bug.

1486
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,540
You can pick your own name for it.

1487
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,900
Okay, how do we get it out?

1488
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,300
They enter the body,

1489
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,260
but the problem is they don't leave a sign

1490
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,180
that they've entered the body.

1491
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:18,780
It's almost like it creates a camouflage of the wound.

1492
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,820
A wet door.

1493
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,420
How do you know she's got it?

1494
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,540
It makes you look like that.

1495
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,380
Look at her.

1496
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:29,380
Oh, okay, so do we kill her?

1497
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:34,820
No, I think we gotta take her with us to a place.

1498
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:35,660
Thank God.

1499
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,580
Thanks for asking, though.

1500
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,380
I did not want to do it.

1501
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,380
I know, but sometimes you just have to in these situations.

1502
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:51,380
I don't, I don't know about that.

1503
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,300
The thing here that we've learned is that

1504
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,060
they put these in and then take them out of people.

1505
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,700
So there's a way to do it safely.

1506
01:07:59,020 --> 01:07:59,980
Doink doink doink doink.

1507
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:04,580
Do either one of you have any forceps in your shanty tent?

1508
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,420
I probably do.

1509
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,140
Any sort of metal grabbers?

1510
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,940
I'm a physics professor, so no.

1511
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,620
So no physical objects then?

1512
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:15,420
Dr. Coombs would have something suitable

1513
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:16,940
in his medical shack.

1514
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,580
I've got some forceps.

1515
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,940
And I do, I run back and I also,

1516
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,340
if I can find a pair of gloves,

1517
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,660
I'd like to grab some gloves.

1518
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,060
Yeah, yeah, you can do that.

1519
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,220
As you go in, Maureen Frain is coming out of,

1520
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,740
well, she was obviously sleeping before

1521
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,700
and her eyes open up as you come into the shack.

1522
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,580
And she looks like, oh, Dr. Coombs, have you got news?

1523
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,660
Have you found Esther?

1524
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,900
We're working on it.

1525
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:46,740
We think we're on the right track.

1526
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,580
We don't have any reason to believe

1527
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:52,860
something bad has happened per se yet at all.

1528
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:57,060
And we're gonna find her.

1529
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,740
She starts trying to get out of her bunk

1530
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,140
as if to try to come and help you

1531
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,780
and then just collapses back into it.

1532
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:07,740
You need to get some more rest there, Maureen.

1533
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,620
That's what's gonna make you feel better eventually.

1534
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,500
All right, but do get her back safe, please, Doctor, please.

1535
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,260
We're on it.

1536
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,860
And yeah, I'm going for forceps and gloves.

1537
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,700
Yep, you can grab those and head back to Nancy's tent.

1538
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,660
When I get back to the tent, I say,

1539
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,340
there's a chance Maureen has it too back at my place.

1540
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:28,940
But I got the forceps and the gloves.

1541
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:30,940
So what, do we just start poking around on her

1542
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,020
and find the wet door?

1543
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,540
Yeah, I'm not sure how to go about this.

1544
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,740
We gotta go to the place

1545
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:40,540
and find the people who are doing this.

1546
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,140
What, no, Dolan, you just said

1547
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,580
that we needed to fix the situation here at home.

1548
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,780
And now as soon as we find the situation,

1549
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,340
you're trying to bail out? No, no, no, I said

1550
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,180
we need to track down the creature.

1551
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,140
We found where it is.

1552
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:53,980
We know exactly where it is.

1553
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,140
It could easily leave her once it gets full

1554
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,700
and then find another person.

1555
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,900
Then when we get back, it's somewhere else.

1556
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,020
Although I guess it would have given that person strength.

1557
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,940
I'm really not sure how to say it.

1558
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:07,580
Are you having this conversation in front of Nancy?

1559
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,980
Yeah.

1560
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,940
Probably actually.

1561
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,900
Yeah.

1562
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:16,180
Okay, her eyes are getting wider and wider and wider.

1563
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,420
I'm sitting down next to Nancy's,

1564
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,060
just kind of like holding her up

1565
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,260
and taking all of it in with her too.

1566
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,780
Carl, Carl, what are they talking about?

1567
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,380
What are they talking about?

1568
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,220
Everything you saw was real.

1569
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,660
Oh God, oh God.

1570
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:36,700
I think there's some kind of parasite in the camp.

1571
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,060
And do you think it's gotten to me?

1572
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:38,900
Yeah.

1573
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,140
Oh, I think I might have it too.

1574
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,140
You'll be okay.

1575
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,300
Yeah, I've got one too.

1576
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,940
It's just going around.

1577
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,540
We've all had it, Nance, and we survived,

1578
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:49,660
but we gotta figure out how to get it out of you.

1579
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,180
That's why I think, Freddie, that we need to go,

1580
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,740
you know, like you said earlier to the source.

1581
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,300
I hope you know this isn't a flip flop.

1582
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,020
This is a fluid situation is what they call it.

1583
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,020
Yeah, no, 100%, I agree.

1584
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,500
I was right at the beginning too.

1585
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,740
So what do I do if I've got this parasite inside me,

1586
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,780
what do I do about it?

1587
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:07,820
How do I get it out?

1588
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,100
Ah, just take a nap.

1589
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,740
We're working on how to get it out,

1590
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,580
but just so you know, you've got time.

1591
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,140
I've seen this before.

1592
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,460
There's no reason to think

1593
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,260
that you're in any immediate danger.

1594
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,140
We'll figure out how to get it out of you

1595
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,180
and then we'll get it out of you.

1596
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:24,500
It is imperative that you realize you will be fine.

1597
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:28,540
It just takes your potential and your ability and your joy

1598
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,260
and it gives it to somebody

1599
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,700
of a better social standing than you.

1600
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,540
Is this what-

1601
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,100
Harold Priestley lived for what, like a week or two?

1602
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:36,940
Yeah, is this what happened?

1603
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,140
Before he became Crumbly Dust?

1604
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,500
This is what happened to Harold.

1605
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,700
I heard, I heard-

1606
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,740
Yeah, 100%.

1607
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,580
I heard his face fell off.

1608
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,940
Oh yeah, it was gross.

1609
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,780
That wasn't the end stage though.

1610
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,940
We believe we've caught it.

1611
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,460
Yeah, we believe we've caught it pre-face crumble.

1612
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:54,260
So you just hold on tight, Matt,

1613
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,540
take a little nap and we're gonna get you fixed up.

1614
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,420
Be sure and drink lots and lots of water.

1615
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,100
That's what the crumbling was from a lack of water.

1616
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,260
So just make sure you're keeping the fluid intake.

1617
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:07,940
Oh, and by the way,

1618
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:11,380
if you see a little buggy crawl out of you-

1619
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,220
Stop that.

1620
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,180
Maybe don't-

1621
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:14,780
Don't stomp it, burn it.

1622
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,620
Right.

1623
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,420
Oh yeah, with fire, kill it with fire.

1624
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,780
None of this seems to be comforting her in the slightest.

1625
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:22,060
Really?

1626
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:22,900
Scott, really?

1627
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,260
Some people just can't be reasoned with,

1628
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:25,740
so it's not really my fault.

1629
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,820
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1630
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,740
It's like when you see a snake and it bites you,

1631
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:34,340
you grab it so that you can identify what snake bit you.

1632
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,780
It's the same thing.

1633
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:39,500
Well, doc, like we said, you don't wanna grab it.

1634
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,300
It can move through your skin.

1635
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:45,180
It will just in a you if you grab it, so.

1636
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,020
Then how do you-

1637
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,540
On stage, Nancy is just curled up on the pile of newspapers

1638
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:53,020
and old grags that she's using as a bed

1639
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,540
and is in the fetal position

1640
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,780
and is just curled up around herself, shaking.

1641
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,780
That's good, that's self-care.

1642
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,460
You're doing it right, Nancy, that's good.

1643
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,140
We'll be back as soon as we can

1644
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:04,580
and we'll get this figured out for you.

1645
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,260
Don't worry, you're in capable hands here with Dr. Coons.

1646
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,300
And Nancy, remember, you still owe me a can of beans,

1647
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,380
so when you get over this, don't forget.

1648
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:19,380
Doc, as a physician-

1649
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,460
Yes, that's what they call us.

1650
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,580
Yeah, don't demoralize the patient.

1651
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:29,340
Oh, I'm giving her a reason to live, to pay her debts.

1652
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,380
To feel good.

1653
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,420
That's what America's all about, baby.

1654
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,300
That's a very Teutonic perspective.

1655
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,860
I came to a capitalist country

1656
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:44,740
and, you know, it's treating me, you know, ill enough.

1657
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:51,580
He laughs and looks around like very sad.

1658
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:56,780
We should get to Prospect.

1659
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,700
Yeah, now that you've completely destroyed

1660
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,540
Nancy Carver's spirit,

1661
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:04,020
you're heading back off towards Prospect, are you?

1662
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,380
Yeah, you're right, Thomas Dolan.

1663
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,140
That was a very good idea.

1664
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,580
We isolated a variable.

1665
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:14,940
I'm not gonna apologize for demystifying the situation.

1666
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,260
I wasn't being sarcastic.

1667
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,540
Now she won't run away.

1668
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:22,020
There was still, last time you checked,

1669
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,260
one of these things loosened the car as well.

1670
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,580
You did see it wriggling under one of the seats.

1671
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,500
And we left it there.

1672
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,900
Oh yeah, whoops.

1673
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,740
All right.

1674
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,020
I think Carl agreed to try to scoop it.

1675
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:36,420
So when we get back to the car, is it still there?

1676
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,260
Well, let's have a group luck roll

1677
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,700
to see whether it's still there.

1678
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,060
So that's just Thomas.

1679
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:41,900
On me again?

1680
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:42,740
Yeah, all right.

1681
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:49,420
21, so I've been so close without that modifier.

1682
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,820
In which case, hmm, no.

1683
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:56,260
By the time you get back to the car,

1684
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,620
I think it is quite gloomy now,

1685
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,460
but you don't see any trace of it.

1686
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,260
And now I'm gloomy,

1687
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,300
because I just know I'm gonna sit on it.

1688
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,700
How big are these things?

1689
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,500
The one you saw wriggling under the seat

1690
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,500
was probably about the size of your forearm.

1691
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,340
Oh, Jesus.

1692
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,820
Okay, so not too small.

1693
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,180
I'm gonna get in the driver's seat this time.

1694
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,740
When you're ready, I will drive there.

1695
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:23,820
Frederick Mellon I tosses you in here.

1696
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,500
It disgusts me.

1697
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,340
Oh, whoopsie.

1698
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,580
It comes back to me that you were covered in blood and stuff

1699
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,820
and I'm scared, very scared again.

1700
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,260
Sorry about that.

1701
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,140
Toss me the keys.

1702
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:39,220
I'm like shaking and start the car.

1703
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:42,140
I feel like I'm being taken hostage almost.

1704
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:43,980
Yeah.

1705
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,620
I want to note that I still got forceps with me.

1706
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:50,020
So if anything goes down, I can still maybe help.

1707
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,180
Man, those are nice gloves.

1708
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,540
It doesn't take you very long

1709
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:57,700
for Dr. Rothstein to drive you to Prospect,

1710
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:58,740
because like I say,

1711
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:01,300
it is just a couple of miles down the road.

1712
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,660
As we're on our way,

1713
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,580
as we're passing Blue Star Diner,

1714
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:05,660
should we,

1715
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:09,900
boys, should we stop and grab that shotgun at Greenleys

1716
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,220
or are we completely fucked regardless?

1717
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:14,180
Well, from, I mean,

1718
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:15,340
from one point of view,

1719
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,260
it's already served its purpose in the story,

1720
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:18,220
but it could be,

1721
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,980
could still be useful, I don't know.

1722
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:26,620
After your experiences of the trauma

1723
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:29,460
after murdering Mr. Brink,

1724
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,900
are you really happy going back to the murder scene?

1725
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,740
Carl, can you get something for us?

1726
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:40,660
I would be afraid you'd use it on me, so no.

1727
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,340
You can hold it.

1728
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,500
I'd rather not.

1729
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,980
It's good you don't want your prints on there.

1730
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:47,820
That's smart.

1731
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:48,740
That's why I adopted.

1732
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,540
It seems like you may have done something horrible

1733
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,460
with it as well.

1734
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:54,980
So preferably not.

1735
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,060
I don't know about you guys,

1736
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,980
but I don't really remember what happened after all that.

1737
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:01,140
There's a chance that we left the shotgun in the woods

1738
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,140
somewhere on our way back.

1739
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:05,140
I don't know where it might even be in there.

1740
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,300
Let's not waste time.

1741
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:07,940
Let's just go get some answers.

1742
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:08,900
Yeah, it is.

1743
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,860
It is almost dark now

1744
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,100
and there are still two missing children.

1745
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:18,060
I hope we don't feel like we needed that shotgun later.

1746
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,340
I'm sure you'll be fine.

1747
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,700
Yeah, Prospect, huh?

1748
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,460
So yeah, you drive the couple of miles up the road

1749
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:29,820
towards Prospect.

1750
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:34,300
So this is another one of these estates like Greenlee's

1751
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,380
that's set back from the road.

1752
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:40,860
This one though does have a stone wall around the grounds.

1753
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,940
You pull the car up to the gates outside

1754
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:47,380
and the gates are a bit rusted.

1755
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:50,820
There is still in Gothic script written over the top

1756
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:55,140
of the metal gates in wrought iron, just the word Prospect.

1757
01:17:55,140 --> 01:18:00,140
And in the dying light, you can see the perhaps ruins

1758
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:05,420
or not quite ruins, but the abandoned house itself

1759
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,340
up at the top of the slope.

1760
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:12,060
The grounds in this light look incredibly overgrown.

1761
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,740
You can also just through the gates,

1762
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,100
make out some outbuildings,

1763
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,740
but you're not quite sure what they are.

1764
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:25,300
The gates themselves have got a chain

1765
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,380
and a padlock around them.

1766
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:31,020
While the gates are fairly rusty,

1767
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,700
the chain and padlock look quite new.

1768
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,380
Well, that's one of the new ones.

1769
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:40,380
And you know, ever since they got this new lock mechanism,

1770
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:44,420
gizmo technology, it takes maybe a second or third try

1771
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:47,180
here and there, but I'm pretty good with these

1772
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,060
and starts rooting around in his clothes,

1773
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:53,140
finding his like lock picking set.

1774
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,980
Okay, yeah, give me a locksmith roll

1775
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,180
to see what you can pop it easily.

1776
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:59,020
A 10 on a 70.

1777
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,220
Oh yeah, well, the chain looks solid.

1778
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,340
They clearly used a cheap lock here.

1779
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:07,220
So you pretty much just slide the picks in

1780
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,900
and the whole thing pops open.

1781
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,060
And he turns around and he's like,

1782
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:11,940
that's one of the most advanced locks

1783
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:15,300
that exists here in this time period.

1784
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,780
And your boy, Frederick Mellon, the voice,

1785
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,660
got it while winking at you, huh?

1786
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:20,500
And he winks.

1787
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,940
Thomas Dolan winks back with a little song on his fiddle.

1788
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:27,300
I forgot about that film.

1789
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,700
So did I, I just saw it on my character sheet.

1790
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:33,180
But yeah, you get the gates open.

1791
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,580
Are you leaving the car on the road?

1792
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:38,820
Are you driving it up towards the house?

1793
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,580
But do you want me to do drive it up?

1794
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,940
They'll think Casper's coming

1795
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:46,940
and Casper seemed to have an issue with Sedgwick.

1796
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,740
I think he wanted us to kill him, honestly.

1797
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:53,420
He seemed like he really would have been cool

1798
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,460
with us knocking him out.

1799
01:19:55,460 --> 01:20:00,460
So if I were Sedgwick and I saw Casper bring his car

1800
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:04,620
coming up, I would feel uneasy about that and negative.

1801
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:07,540
And then the fact that he's not even in the car,

1802
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:10,860
maybe we could play it off like we killed him for Sedgwick.

1803
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:13,100
Like we heard that they were having issues

1804
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,540
and we wanted to join in on the madness.

1805
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:17,260
I don't know.

1806
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,220
What do you guys think?

1807
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:20,740
We don't know for sure that Sedgwick is here, right?

1808
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,620
This is Austin Hawk's house.

1809
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:25,740
Maybe he's a live-in helper with the machine.

1810
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,580
That could be.

1811
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,500
With a machine like that,

1812
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,180
I don't think that the man who knows how it works

1813
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:31,820
would be too far away.

1814
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:34,980
I'm worried about the going in part,

1815
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,540
but it would be nice to have a going out ride.

1816
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:38,380
Does that make sense?

1817
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,900
I'm worried that it's really conspicuous

1818
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,260
for our car to go up the driveway,

1819
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:43,580
but I'd love to have a car ready to go down that driveway

1820
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,740
when we were trying to leave this place.

1821
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:46,940
It's a pretty nice car.

1822
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:48,100
It's the Depression.

1823
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:52,460
I think going up in this nice car gives us some good cover

1824
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:54,860
on the way up there and gives us an escape route.

1825
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:56,660
I think we take the car.

1826
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,980
We just back it in.

1827
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:02,260
Yeah, you make your way up the driveway.

1828
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:05,220
I mean, it's going to be quite difficult to back it in

1829
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,580
because this is a winding driveway

1830
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:09,620
and it's quite badly overgrown.

1831
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,900
The weeds are quite high on the other side.

1832
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:16,780
It's going to be tricky because with it getting dark,

1833
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,580
you probably want the headlights

1834
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,580
pointing in front of you at the moment

1835
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:24,420
to avoid crashing into a tree or a sapling or something.

1836
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:25,620
I mean, if you really want,

1837
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,140
I can give you a drive auto roll

1838
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,660
just to reverse it in there,

1839
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:31,940
but it is the harder way of doing it.

1840
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:34,540
I think we should just go in straight on.

1841
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,140
There's surely a roundabout it,

1842
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,940
but these estates all have those trees.

1843
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:39,820
I'm a good driver.

1844
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:41,340
I'll back it in.

1845
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,180
Okay.

1846
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,060
You give me a drive auto roll then.

1847
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,380
Okay, let me see what my drive auto is.

1848
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,460
God damn it, Luke.

1849
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:51,460
Yeah.

1850
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,340
Like surely he wouldn't just say that.

1851
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,860
It's not on my character sheet,

1852
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:02,060
so I think it's just a 20.

1853
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:04,220
Yeah, so that means it's 20.

1854
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:05,060
Yeah.

1855
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:05,900
Sweet.

1856
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:06,740
You dick.

1857
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:08,220
41.

1858
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:09,780
How much luck do you have?

1859
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,020
20.

1860
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:11,860
Fuck.

1861
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:16,900
So you reverse the car up and about halfway up,

1862
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:19,380
like I say, it's very badly overgrown

1863
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,860
and you just misjudge it slightly

1864
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:26,260
and you've gone off the path or at least off the driveway

1865
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:31,140
and you're reversed into some soft ground

1866
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:36,020
and the car is now sort of, yeah,

1867
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:40,900
stuck in this slightly marshy ground just to one side.

1868
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,020
Is this a good spot?

1869
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:46,940
Yeah, if we just like throw something

1870
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,540
under the back tires then, you know,

1871
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,780
it'll be ready for takeoff and we can head out.

1872
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:52,940
Something like you, Kyle.

1873
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,380
That was my plan.

1874
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:55,980
Not me though, no.

1875
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:56,820
Ha ha.

1876
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:57,660
Ha ha.

1877
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:59,860
So you're getting out to try to put something

1878
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:02,420
under the back tires so you can get out.

1879
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,420
It's now pretty dark.

1880
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:08,020
There's still a little bit of light, but not very much.

1881
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,740
It hasn't been raining today,

1882
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,620
but as you brush up against something undergrowth,

1883
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:17,620
some of it does feel uncomfortably moist

1884
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:21,620
and you can hear just the sounds

1885
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:25,300
of things rustling around in the undergrowth,

1886
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,620
things you can't see in the darkness.

1887
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,020
Boys, I think we should run.

1888
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:35,100
Thomas Dolan is just booking it for the house up the road.

1889
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:35,940
Okay.

1890
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,020
He starts running when he hears the Slytherin.

1891
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:38,900
I'm not giving up.

1892
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,900
We'll deal with Dolan in a moment

1893
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:43,900
as he's separated himself off from the others.

1894
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:47,220
The other three of you are still there at the car.

1895
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:51,340
So is it Frederick Mellon I and Dr. Coombs

1896
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:55,780
who are trying to help get the car out of the quagmire?

1897
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,260
Yeah, yes indeedy.

1898
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:59,660
Yeah, as you're kind of digging around,

1899
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,820
trying to find solid stuff to put under the tire,

1900
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:06,340
a couple of times, yeah, you can feel things

1901
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:09,260
in the darkness just kind of slithering

1902
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:11,660
across the back of your hand.

1903
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,780
You can't see what they are.

1904
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:16,340
Nathaniel, when one of those slithers

1905
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:19,300
perfectly across his hand, he jerks back.

1906
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:22,180
For Frederick, there's stuff out here.

1907
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:23,900
There's that crickling sound.

1908
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,140
That's not squirrels.

1909
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,100
It was slimy.

1910
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,820
Yeah, it's making my stomach hurt when I think about it,

1911
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:32,500
but eh, we got to keep going.

1912
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,220
We got to make sure the car gets out.

1913
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:37,940
That way we can bail effectively.

1914
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,460
In which case, yeah, if you're grabbing stuff

1915
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:44,100
to put under the tire, part of that is going to involve

1916
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:49,100
lifting the car up enough to get the stuff under the tire.

1917
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:55,100
What I suggest then is one of you give me a strength roll

1918
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,020
just to see whether you can pull this off.

1919
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,860
They look at each other.

1920
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,020
All right, young man, I think that's on you.

1921
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:08,540
I pass, a 19 on a 50.

1922
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:09,900
Yes.

1923
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:10,740
Oh, nice.

1924
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,660
Okay, so yeah, you think you've managed to get enough stuff

1925
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:16,780
under there and sure enough, when Dr. Rothstein starts up

1926
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:20,140
the car, it just pulls forward onto the track.

1927
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:23,300
Now, Mr. Dolan.

1928
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,140
Yes.

1929
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:28,420
Mr. Dolan was running up towards the house in the gloom.

1930
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,380
As you make your way towards the building,

1931
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:33,420
from the undergrowth, just after your right,

1932
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,020
you hear a sound.

1933
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,340
The sound, you're not quite sure what it is at first,

1934
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,260
but as you move past, you can hear a sort of

1935
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,260
a sound,

1936
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,980
and it's just going on and on.

1937
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,900
Can I see anything?

1938
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,540
No, it's coming from the undergrowth,

1939
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:07,940
and it's getting quite dark.

1940
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,180
Hello?

1941
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,140
Oh.

1942
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:19,820
Hey there, are you a missing child?

1943
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:29,300
I'd really like to find and comfort you if you are,

1944
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,940
but there's some freaky shit out here.

1945
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,020
Oh, God damn it, Thomas.

1946
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,460
All right, and he goes into the,

1947
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,780
he goes towards the sound.

1948
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:42,660
Nice.

1949
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:48,180
Okay, so just as the other three of you are heading up,

1950
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:52,460
you sort of just catch sight in the gloom

1951
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:57,060
of Thomas disappearing off the path into the undergrowth

1952
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,660
and disappearing out of sight.

1953
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:00,900
Oh, Thomas, there's stuff out there, I wouldn't...

1954
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,260
Yeah, that's why I ran,

1955
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:05,300
but I think one of the kids is over here.

1956
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,900
Can you give me a spot hidden, Roy?

1957
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:07,900
Wicked scared.

1958
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,020
23 on a 25.

1959
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,660
Oh!

1960
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:16,500
Nice.

1961
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,220
So the moon is beginning to come up at this stage,

1962
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,980
so you've got a bit of light.

1963
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:23,900
In the little bit of light you have,

1964
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:28,900
you see the form of someone lying just on the ground.

1965
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:32,740
You can just make out a human shape.

1966
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:35,580
It's too big to be one of the children.

1967
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:38,180
It looks like an adult, probably a man.

1968
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:42,140
He's lying on the ground and he seems to be trembling

1969
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:43,580
and he's still making that sound, that...

1970
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:48,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1971
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:50,740
I'd like to try to find a stick and poke him.

1972
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:53,100
You grab a stick off the ground.

1973
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:58,100
It's slightly moist and yeah, you poke him

1974
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:02,700
and he doesn't seem to react.

1975
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:05,140
I think he's still going, oh, oh, oh.

1976
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,980
In fact, actually, as you poke him,

1977
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:10,260
his head does turn slightly towards you.

1978
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,060
And as he arrives, we're adjusting to the moon

1979
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:15,620
that's now risen a bit more.

1980
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:19,340
You can make out some of the contours of his face.

1981
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:21,060
His face is quite wasted.

1982
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:25,380
He looks really drawn and sick.

1983
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,780
His eyes are absolutely wide.

1984
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,660
And as he's staring at you,

1985
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:34,660
you see his right eyelid bulge slightly.

1986
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:37,700
And then something crawls out from underneath it,

1987
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:42,060
something wriggling that's just glinting in the moonlight

1988
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:45,420
and crawls across his eyeball and across his face

1989
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:47,420
and then just disappears up his nose.

1990
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:52,620
I just throw the stick at him and run back to the path.

1991
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,460
Let's have a sanity roll first.

1992
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,620
We're gonna find a way to help y'all.

1993
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:58,740
So, yeah, sanity roll.

1994
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,700
Another 23.

1995
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:01,540
And your sanity is?

1996
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:03,780
On what was my sanity?

1997
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:05,740
No, my sanity is 40.

1998
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,900
And I took, I don't remember how much damage I took, six.

1999
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,580
So my sanity is 34.

2000
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:11,420
So I passed.

2001
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:13,420
And so, yeah, I mean, you still, like you say,

2002
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:16,060
throw the stick and sort of back off in horror,

2003
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,340
just almost tumbling over on the ground

2004
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,220
in your speed to get away.

2005
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:23,420
And yeah, as you run through the darkness,

2006
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:25,860
through the undergrowth, you can feel

2007
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,860
sort of the wetness of these strands of weeds

2008
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,180
as they brush against your face.

2009
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:36,460
And you think you can feel things wriggling on them

2010
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,100
as you brush past them.

2011
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:41,660
And then, yeah, you just stumble out onto the track again

2012
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:43,500
as the others are there.

2013
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
There's a guy on the trail, off the trail,

2014
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,540
he's real messed up.

2015
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:51,220
Let's get to prospect proper and solve this mystery.

2016
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,060
What do you think?

2017
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:53,180
Does he need medical attention?

2018
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:54,140
Do I need to?

2019
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:55,060
Not right now.

2020
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,140
I think we just gotta move on.

2021
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:00,140
He's got bugs coming out of his head.

2022
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:04,700
I think we gotta find a more holistic solution

2023
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,860
to this problem before we can help him at all.

2024
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:12,300
Well, prospect itself is just 20 yards

2025
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,300
further up the track from here.

2026
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:16,540
As I said, though, there in the moonlight,

2027
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:19,580
you can see that there are a couple of outbuildings.

2028
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,740
Well, first of all, let's just make clear,

2029
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:25,620
there is no artificial light here whatsoever.

2030
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:28,060
The only light you have is the moonlight.

2031
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:34,060
Prospect itself is a fairly big sort of neocolonial house.

2032
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,420
It looks like there's the remains of a sort of

2033
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:43,260
extensional wing on the far side of it from here.

2034
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:46,660
The front door looks like it's a jar,

2035
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:50,660
but off to the side, there are a few outbuildings.

2036
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:52,580
There are some things that look like sheds,

2037
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:54,660
albeit large sheds,

2038
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:57,340
but there's another building that's a bit odder than that.

2039
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:02,140
It's a stone building that is around

2040
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:05,700
maybe about 10 yards in diameter,

2041
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:09,220
maybe a bit larger, a one-story building

2042
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:12,780
that's just set back to the left of the main building.

2043
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:15,100
Are there any vehicles parked anywhere?

2044
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,380
Not that you can see.

2045
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:18,740
Would we have, like, our torches with us?

2046
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:19,860
Let's have a group luck roll

2047
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:22,220
to see whether you thought to bring them.

2048
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:24,980
I'm really sorry I joined back with you guys

2049
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:26,940
before you decided to check on that.

2050
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,340
LAUGHING

2051
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,060
Oh, no.

2052
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:33,900
80.

2053
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:38,660
So, no, to be fair,

2054
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:41,060
you weren't in your proper state of mind before.

2055
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:43,140
It's been a day full of shocks.

2056
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,980
At this stage, obviously it has occurred to you

2057
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:47,500
that it would be a really good idea to have light sources,

2058
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:51,340
but your mind just wasn't in that space earlier.

2059
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:52,500
Typical Freddy.

2060
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,660
So full of regret.

2061
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,220
All right, well...

2062
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,700
Oh, guys, by the way, this is the prospect.

2063
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,220
This is where we're going.

2064
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,140
I forgot to announce when we got here.

2065
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:05,940
Thank you so much, Karl Rothstein.

2066
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:06,780
Thank you for all your help.

2067
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,300
I'm so glad we brought you.

2068
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,220
Jesus fuck.

2069
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:10,460
Karl, do you have any idea

2070
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:13,660
what that weird round building there might be?

2071
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:16,700
Oh, let me think.

2072
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,620
You think it might be,

2073
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,780
and not that you ever saw it,

2074
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:24,020
but it was something that Dr. Hawkes had talked about,

2075
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:27,980
that he was going to build a separate laboratory,

2076
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:31,100
and you think that might be it?

2077
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:33,420
I mean, it still looks like a fairly unusual building.

2078
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,900
It doesn't necessarily look like what you'd think for a lab,

2079
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,740
but maybe that's it.

2080
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,580
It may be his lab.

2081
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:45,580
I remember him talking about building a lab.

2082
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:47,740
It looks like it could be that,

2083
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,460
but I'm turning Irish.

2084
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:50,300
I don't know.

2085
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:53,340
It's hot, man.

2086
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:54,340
It's wicked hot.

2087
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:58,060
Being from anywhere these days is difficult.

2088
01:32:58,060 --> 01:32:59,860
How do you keep a hold of your own identity

2089
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:01,100
in a world like this?

2090
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,980
Should we check out the lab?

2091
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:08,540
That might be where equipment is for this.

2092
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:10,100
Do you think we should start there?

2093
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:11,980
I feel like it's been presented.

2094
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,340
I think we start there.

2095
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,460
I think we figure out how to help

2096
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:21,140
and try to stop whatever's happening first,

2097
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,540
because if we find the children first,

2098
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:28,820
then we would just be carrying or bringing along children

2099
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:32,660
into whatever dangers we might be presented later on.

2100
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:33,580
Good point, good point.

2101
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:35,140
Speaking of carrying things,

2102
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:37,460
shouldn't we carry that guy to the lab?

2103
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:38,300
No.

2104
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:39,860
The guy from the woods back there?

2105
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:40,700
Yeah.

2106
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:41,540
No, man.

2107
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:42,380
My whole point-

2108
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:44,940
The whole idea is to find the shit to help him.

2109
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:46,940
And then not have dead weight with us.

2110
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:49,660
If it's in the lab, then it saves us a trip.

2111
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:50,620
Thanks, Thomas.

2112
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:53,140
No, Carl, I don't think we need to drag the guy

2113
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:55,580
full of bugs by hand back here.

2114
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:56,540
Okay.

2115
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,420
After we just fled from him and Tara.

2116
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,460
Let's check out this laboratory.

2117
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:01,300
What about you?

2118
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,380
You're a doctor, don't you have an oath?

2119
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,740
No, yeah, that's why I asked,

2120
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:06,860
but when you said the bugs thing,

2121
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:08,420
I've seen what those bugs can do.

2122
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:10,460
I'm not touching it until we figure out a way

2123
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:13,300
to contain those things more efficiently.

2124
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,140
Okay.

2125
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:16,100
And you're off existence, so.

2126
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:17,660
This has nothing to do with me.

2127
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:20,020
A phys-iks-ion.

2128
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:20,860
You're a doctor.

2129
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:21,700
Yeah, you said it right.

2130
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,380
You said you're a doctor, so.

2131
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:24,980
Okay, let's go to the lab.

2132
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:29,700
So you walk over to this stone building.

2133
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:33,540
Yeah, it's got a fairly heavy iron door on it,

2134
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:37,020
black iron door, that again is locked.

2135
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:39,780
You can also see that in the moonlight,

2136
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:44,780
there are some fairly heavy looking cables,

2137
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:47,980
half buried running across the ground,

2138
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:51,900
that are running over towards the two shanks.

2139
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,100
If only we had the shotgun,

2140
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,060
we could be blasting all these locks.

2141
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,620
Well, we don't need a shotgun for the locks,

2142
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:01,220
but it'd be nice to knock out some of these cables

2143
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:02,820
and people.

2144
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:06,100
All right, I'm gonna unlock the lock

2145
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:09,700
with a 16 on a 70.

2146
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:11,100
Oh yeah. Hard success.

2147
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,260
Okay, yeah, yeah.

2148
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:14,100
I mean, this is a bit more of a serious lock.

2149
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:15,980
It takes you a minute or two,

2150
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:20,980
but even then, you pop it open and yeah, the doors open

2151
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:24,780
and inside everything is completely dark.

2152
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:26,620
There's no light in here.

2153
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:31,020
You can hear towards the back, a sloshing of liquid.

2154
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,700
There's a strange smell in the air

2155
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:39,140
and you can see shapes just all around in the gloom.

2156
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:47,140
Life's surreal, in retrospect a dream.

2157
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:53,140
Easy times feel less than serene.

2158
01:35:53,140 --> 01:36:00,140
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings,

2159
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:07,140
so we long for days gone past us.

2160
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:16,140
Grief and strife, bloody, that's real life.
