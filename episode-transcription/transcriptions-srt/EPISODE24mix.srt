00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello, my friends.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,780
It's your pizza delivery driver, Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,440
And I'm here to deliver you a box

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,720
of hot, fresh, contention news pizza

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,200
in 30 minutes or less, or you get your money back.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,620
And y'all know we are delivering

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,080
that steamy, gooey, cheesy news

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,080
straight from 694.2 PTBP.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,360
Wolf the Dog's favorite kind of pizza

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,200
is mayonnaise pizza with anchovies on it.

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,640
I like my pizza to have some extra stink on it,

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,680
my babies.

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,840
Now, before y'all burn the roof of your mouth

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,080
on that hot delivery, we got an announcement.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,240
This week, Wolf is here to tell y'all

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,640
that we are going to have a special presentation

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,720
in a few weeks here on 694.2 PTBP,

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,160
contention's newest and only radio station.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,800
We are going to broadcast a recap episode

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,860
with listener Q&A from a podcast

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,000
called Pretending to be People.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,480
If you have questions for any of the fine people

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,240
on that show, send them to at Pretending Pod

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,140
on Twitter or Instagram, or post them

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,040
on our Facebook page or the subreddit,

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,100
or email them to pretendingpod at gmail.com,

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,300
or go all out.

28
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,000
Record audio of you asking your questions

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,280
and send them that so they can use it

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,300
in the episode, my babies.

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,120
Speaking of questions, I want answers.

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,440
It's time for the news.

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,600
Officer Keith Vigna convinced a woman

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,320
to murder Ferguson, his handsome and well-dressed brother.

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,800
He then murdered that woman and stole the watch

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,120
that was passed down from William Beanes

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,300
off of Fergie's corpse.

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,200
Currently, Keith is in bed at Hotel Motel.

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
Call him Ferguson, call him the Duke.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,640
Either way, he's a real motherfucker.

41
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,280
Currently, Officer John Lee Pettymore

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,640
and Drew Andrews are being held hostage

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,800
by the Fonzie lady who works for Marvin Glass

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,140
after she killed two of the Pettymore cousins.

45
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,760
I'm grieving all week with you, John P.

46
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,920
Officer Clark Bishop was inducted

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,240
into the Circle of Knowledge.

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,040
There, he ran into a mysterious woman from his past.

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,640
Currently, Clark is in a cab headed back

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,740
to contention from the mill on the other side of the city.

51
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,440
There's always something happening in contention,

52
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,480
and 100% of the time, it is Kudzu with no backbone.

53
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,680
I had a guy jump in front of my car today

54
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,040
and I thought I had killed him,

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,880
and in fact, I think he might have been a ghost

56
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
because I don't know how I didn't hit him.

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
Wait, what?

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
I was driving down town.

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Joe killed again, but he just kept going.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
That's exactly.

61
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,800
I was driving downtown right in front of Jimmy John's.

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
This guy was walking on the sidewalk,

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,900
and I don't know if he was fucking with me

64
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,920
or if he really was trying to commit suicide,

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,800
but he did this big, exaggerated

66
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,520
Oh, wow. leap in front of my car,

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,320
and I didn't adjust.

68
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,960
I mean, it was as if he wanted to slap my headlight.

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,940
He was that close when he jumped,

70
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,640
and I didn't feel a bump or anything,

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,760
and I looked in my rear-view mirror,

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,600
and he was just walking and looked at me

73
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,220
and just kept walking with headphones on.

74
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,440
I don't know what he was doing.

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,500
I think he was fucking with me,

76
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,780
but how I didn't hit him is still a mystery to me.

77
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,620
It was insane.

78
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,120
That's a dumb way to fuck with people.

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
Yeah.

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,480
My life in DJ.

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,140
I know a hilarious prank.

82
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,100
When I went to the movie today,

83
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,160
I picked the second row in the very middle

84
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
where no one else was sitting,

85
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,160
and then I sit down, and the waiter comes up,

86
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,000
and I look over,

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,540
and the woman that had come in behind me

88
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,640
with three very rowdy children comes and looks,

89
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,960
and she goes, oh, I didn't realize you were sitting here,

90
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,780
and sits right next to me with her three kids,

91
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,240
and I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,380
Hey, I'm your dad now, kids.

93
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,320
It wasn't a bunch of kids,

94
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,960
but that happened to me at LMO

95
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,040
where it was an empty theater,

96
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,340
and I'd got my tickets early,

97
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,020
and then one other guy had gotten the seat next to me.

98
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,540
I was like, why would you have picked that,

99
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,900
or why did they give you that seat?

100
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
I don't understand how this happened.

101
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,360
And she said something, she's like,

102
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,840
oh, I'm so sorry, blah, blah, blah,

103
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,700
and I was like, you know what?

104
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,820
I came to a children's movie.

105
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,920
I was kind of expecting kids to be here.

106
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,900
I was like, just didn't expect somebody

107
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,740
to sit right next to me,

108
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,300
and she goes, you look really familiar,

109
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,280
and it turns out I had served her at Jilardi's once,

110
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,020
and she added me on Facebook a long time ago,

111
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,820
but she can't be 30 years old, but like, yeah.

112
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,500
So she was talking to me,

113
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,340
but she was fucking talking to me the whole time,

114
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,160
the whole movie.

115
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, you want the movie?

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,260
Yeah, dude.

117
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,860
She did share her pizza and her popcorn with me though.

118
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,080
That's cool as fuck.

119
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,920
However.

120
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,860
She wants you to raise those kids.

121
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,380
No joke, she goes, you kind of look like the dad now,

122
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,340
and I was like, yep.

123
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,260
That was planned, that was a planned move.

124
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,460
That was an absolute planned move.

125
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,100
Jesus, she was going to the Alamo to get a hubby.

126
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,260
Yep.

127
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,560
And she would call you hubby too.

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm the dad now.

129
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,420
She was like, I'll hit you up on Facebook

130
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,740
next time I want to go see a movie.

131
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,780
I was like, yeah, sure.

132
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,940
Hold on just a second.

133
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,340
What would have happened if you would have written on a card

134
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,680
and told the people who work at Alamo

135
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,020
that the woman sitting next to you

136
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,300
won't stop talking to you?

137
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,540
But it's just escorted her out,

138
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,300
and you're like studiously not making eye contact.

139
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,540
Just looks at it and then looks up at her and is like,

140
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,300
ma'am, someone in the theater.

141
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,540
When we do the dream sequence thing,

142
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,020
is that going to be solo, red solo cup?

143
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,860
Solo, dolo.

144
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,140
Would you guys like to explain how this session is

145
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,860
going to start, or at least what I told you

146
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,980
and what you had to do?

147
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,740
Oh, yeah.

148
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,100
So you asked us.

149
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,260
Gearing up to this session.

150
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,460
You asked us to ask one yes or no question about the campaign

151
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,460
that you would answer truthfully in the form of a dream.

152
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,300
Wow, that was really succinct.

153
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,580
But I don't remember my dream I had last night,

154
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,420
so you might have to do it in real life.

155
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,500
Can you tell us the dreams you gave us?

156
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
What?

157
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,260
With your minds.

158
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,620
Luke's joke was that you were putting dreams in our head.

159
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,780
Which I do.

160
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,500
Which is like, you do that.

161
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,580
Yeah, you do pop up in my dreams a lot.

162
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,500
That makes sense.

163
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,320
Theoretically.

164
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,240
Oh, that makes sense.

165
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,080
Oh.

166
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,900
That makes sense.

167
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,740
Oh.

168
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
I'm coming.

169
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,420
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I'm coming.

170
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,020
Oh, boy.

171
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,300
You know, it's good to practice.

172
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,940
My panties are wet.

173
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,660
Same voice.

174
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,820
Well, with that, we'll start with Luke.

175
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,660
So do you remember the last thing

176
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,580
that happened to Keith Wigner?

177
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,860
I killed my brother.

178
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,700
Yeah, basically.

179
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,860
I orchestrated a plan to have my brother killed.

180
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,100
Yeah, and then pulled it off pretty well.

181
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,380
Also, yeah, I ended up, there's a little collateral damage.

182
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,980
Not that Keith cares, but yeah.

183
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,820
Jesus.

184
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,980
What was her name, Joan?

185
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,820
Joan.

186
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,600
Joan and Fergie are both.

187
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,860
Joan Robin.

188
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,740
And the last thing I believe that you did

189
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,700
was you made it back to Hotel Motel

190
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,700
and you put the watch that Ferguson had been wearing

191
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,640
within the handkerchief into your hotel safe.

192
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,480
Yes.

193
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,980
The motel's safe.

194
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,740
And your room, and then you went to sleep.

195
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,420
Keith Wigner, you are standing at a bar.

196
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,620
It is empty, except for yourself and the bartender.

197
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,140
The place smells like piss and vomit.

198
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,880
It looks like people left in a hurry.

199
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,320
The man behind the bar, he's like wearing clothes

200
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,280
that they look like they're from the Gilded Age,

201
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,140
you know, late 1800s.

202
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,940
He looks at you with a fearful smile.

203
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,700
What can I get you, sir?

204
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,120
Answers?

205
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
Cocaine?

206
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,100
The prior, what's that, what do you say?

207
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,340
The previous one, the first one.

208
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,000
Not the latter.

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,840
As soon as you.

210
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,660
I got enough of that.

211
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,780
As soon as you stumble over all of those words,

212
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,020
the saloon-style doors of this wooden floor joint

213
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,180
fling open as a woman that you recognize

214
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,260
struts toward your side, carrying with her a massive trunk.

215
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,620
She heaves it onto the bar and opens it up,

216
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,400
revealing a few familiar items.

217
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,180
The camera, the gun, and the radio

218
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,300
are sitting there in the trunk.

219
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,540
The camera's light is red, as is the light on the gun,

220
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,100
but the light on the radio is green,

221
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,880
and you hear yourself say,

222
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,820
well, fuck, Mary, the camera won't be ready until one,

223
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,900
and you know these other two take a few days.

224
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,260
What if they came for me?

225
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,620
What if they come for me?

226
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,140
Immediately, she's gone, and Lloyd, the barkeep,

227
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,620
pulls a corkscrew out of his pocket and holds it out,

228
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,660
and holds it on the bar in front of you, pointy-side up.

229
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,260
Abruptly, he slams his fucking head into the corkscrew

230
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,580
and stares at you as he begins twisting the corkscrew,

231
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,380
little bits of cocaine falling out of the hole in his head.

232
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,940
You look down, and the coke has fallen into perfect lines,

233
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,260
forming a little stick figure family of uppers.

234
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,420
You pull out a $100 bill that has Abraham Lincoln on it,

235
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,860
and you roll it up real tight.

236
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,600
As you inhale the powder bumper sticker family,

237
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,540
Lloyd steps backward, phasing through the wall of the bar,

238
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,680
and disappearing from sight completely.

239
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,580
You are pulling into the police department parking lot

240
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,940
in your police cruiser, and you have that weird feeling,

241
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,020
like you were on autopilot the whole drive.

242
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,300
You were just remembering your dream from last night.

243
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,980
That's not the only thing on your mind, though.

244
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,740
You see yourself grabbing the revolver with your handkerchief,

245
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,380
putting it in her hands, and pulling the trigger.

246
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,060
You see the flash.

247
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,980
You see her blood spill out onto the duvet cover.

248
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,020
You're parked in the contention police department parking lot.

249
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,860
Damn.

250
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:34,340
John Lee.

251
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,260
The ground is hard, wet, and cold.

252
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,980
You are rolling across it with relative ease,

253
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,380
avoiding the sight of the older man in the fancy suit

254
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,460
mopping the floor and singing mouth trumpet,

255
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,820
along with Louis Armstrong.

256
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,220
Looking up out the window,

257
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,300
you notice it is dark and stormy outside.

258
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,180
The door that reads open from your side swings in,

259
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,140
and the bell atop the door rings,

260
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,500
queuing the owner of this establishment

261
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,860
to stop his portable music player and holler,

262
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,940
We're closed for the night, bud.

263
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,780
You look up to the figure standing in the doorway,

264
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,820
their black cloak shielding their identity,

265
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,180
just as they drop a massive book on the ground

266
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,980
and stumble back out into the night.

267
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,220
Your vision blurs and distorts, disorienting you,

268
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,460
and it feels like the world is upside down.

269
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,900
You look around, and you are sitting on the floor

270
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,580
in the back of clinkers.

271
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,020
The sound of some children's television program

272
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,980
being blared over pool balls and drunken conversation

273
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,180
is immediately nostalgic.

274
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,620
A young Gary Daley, an oversized sweater

275
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,340
and tall white socks,

276
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,340
walks in and pulls a large leather book out of his bag.

277
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,580
He looks over his shoulder as he opens the book,

278
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,300
and he winces as he rips a page from the big old tome.

279
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,860
He pauses, listens, quickly puts the book back in his bag

280
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,100
as he moves directly toward you with his torn sheet in hand.

281
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,540
Pulling out a knife, Gary Daley begins chanting,

282
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,860
reading from this paper.

283
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,980
The script seems to catch little sparks

284
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,740
as he mutters each phrase like a karaoke situation,

285
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,060
but with paper and fire.

286
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,660
He continues to chant as he presses the blade of the knife

287
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,380
against his thumb, the elasticity of his skin

288
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,060
gaining more and more tension

289
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,140
until finally breaking under enough pressure

290
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,020
and releasing the blood necessary to complete this spell.

291
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,020
Gary Daley clenches his fist and holds it above your head,

292
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,100
letting a few drops fall onto your bald baby head.

293
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,620
The sparks ignite what remains of the paper

294
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,700
and the flames begin to float and dance in the air.

295
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,260
These tiny bits of flame do a little synchronized jig

296
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,300
around your head, bathing your body in warm light.

297
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,740
The flames disappear and Gary quickly grabs a rag

298
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,940
and washes the blood off of your baby head

299
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,300
while he talks to himself.

300
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,460
Grandpa, you kooky old wizard.

301
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,980
I hope this does him good.

302
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,060
Well, two down, one to go.

303
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,620
Hey, hey John, what are you thinking about?

304
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,420
You realize you have pulled into the parking lot

305
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,180
of the contention police department

306
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,180
in Drew's cherry red Mini Cooper with black stripes.

307
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,020
A terrified Drew Andrews is sitting silently next to you.

308
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,780
A woman who fashions herself

309
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,900
to look like Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli

310
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,940
from the 1970s television program Happy Days

311
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,780
is sitting in the back seat holding both of your guns.

312
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,220
Now she still has the guns.

313
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,620
Every move you make, every bond you break,

314
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,740
every step you take, I'll be watching you.

315
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,700
I'll be watching you.

316
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,860
Oh, right.

317
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,900
Joe, you remember the last thing

318
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,060
that happened to Clark Bishop?

319
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,580
Kinda.

320
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,180
I think you kinda blacked out in an odd place

321
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,060
and came to for a second in a taxi.

322
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,780
Oh, you mean at the end, yeah, yeah.

323
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,500
And you turned back and you were leaving the middle.

324
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,060
Which is probably just a Quinkadink.

325
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,020
Can't mean anything.

326
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,980
Nope.

327
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,780
You realize how close you are and so you begin to run.

328
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,660
You do not stop, you do not slow, you run.

329
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,140
It is imperative that you get there, that you stop them.

330
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,780
Fuck, you're on the highway, you dodge the traffic,

331
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,900
you can make it, you jump off the bridge.

332
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,660
There's no way you're going to hit the water,

333
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,300
you brace for impact.

334
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,740
You've seen a lot of fucked up shit

335
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,980
but you can't remember a time when your shin bone

336
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,980
was shooting through your kneecap.

337
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,540
Fuck, your pain tolerance is incredible.

338
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,700
You keep running.

339
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,780
It doesn't really look like running anymore

340
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,460
but you fight through the awkwardness.

341
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,540
The blood loss is massive.

342
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,500
Then you see it, your old nemesis, your old buddy old pal.

343
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,700
You remember why these animals are filling the creeks.

344
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,860
You get the fuck in the creek too.

345
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,540
Blood is trailing behind

346
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,900
and the pain in your knee is searing.

347
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,820
Your favorite black mass is following you

348
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,620
along the shoreline and that's when you see it.

349
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,780
You're just there in the window.

350
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,780
Think fuck what happened stance.

351
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,340
You keep hobbling down the creek

352
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,540
trying to outpace your enemies before you're gone.

353
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,820
At the closest point to your backyard,

354
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,980
you muster everything in your reserves

355
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,540
and leap out of the creek,

356
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,340
waving your arms violently and shouting.

357
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,420
You desperately attempt to get your attention.

358
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,180
Run, run, get the fuck out of there.

359
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,900
You can get it right this time.

360
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,860
You wake up in the back of the cab

361
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,180
as it makes a sharp turn and hits a curb.

362
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,660
Looking out the window, you see that you have just arrived

363
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,460
at the contention police department.

364
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,980
Yeah, like a horse walks into a bar, yeah.

365
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,020
Except it was not, he wasn't there for drinks.

366
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,580
He was there for a fight.

367
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,460
I was trying to think what I would do in that situation.

368
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,020
You yell, why the long face?

369
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,380
You get out of the way.

370
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,860
Yeah, it's a horsey run.

371
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,740
No, that's what I mean though,

372
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,100
is the video, it's a really skinny room.

373
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,460
No, yeah, it's a narrow, all along this long bar.

374
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,100
One of the guys looks like he's about

375
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,340
to get kicked in the face.

376
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,540
I know, he looks resigned to it.

377
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,100
He's like, I'm not gonna be able to outrun it,

378
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,580
and I'm not gonna be able to get across its path.

379
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,900
Is it jumping and stuff?

380
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,580
Yeah, it's freakin' like,

381
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,980
yeah, it's saddle broke or something,

382
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,820
and it's freaking the fuck out.

383
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,140
Oh, like a horse would in a restaurant?

384
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,980
Yeah, exactly.

385
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,660
Yeah, just kind of like that.

386
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,100
It looks like a bucking Bronco

387
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,980
going one way through this restaurant

388
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,380
and then coming back the other way

389
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,020
as people just fucking scatter.

390
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,740
It made everyone a rodeo clown that day.

391
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,700
It was kicking tables and chairs and shit.

392
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,060
You could have had collateral damage either.

393
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,380
It was kicking that shit so hard.

394
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,580
It was like a cartoon flinging a chair back behind it.

395
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,780
This was a terrified horse.

396
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,100
On the news, it was like,

397
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,180
they interviewed the owner,

398
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,060
and it says, he likes to run away a lot.

399
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,180
This isn't surprising.

400
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,360
It's like, well, that's not good.

401
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,340
Yeah, it's not.

402
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,220
I brought it to this parade in the middle of town.

403
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,620
Your horse is in my bar.

404
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,300
Classic, classic Seabiscuit.

405
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,180
I always thought that might happen someday.

406
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,380
Did you at least get a cool video of it?

407
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,980
Well, you got to look out for those chairs that are flying

408
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,860
because they're flying at approximately one horsepower.

409
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,340
Whoa.

410
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,180
That was good.

411
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,420
That was science.

412
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,260
No, not boo.

413
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,100
No, it's just true.

414
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,940
Nay.

415
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Hey.

416
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,020
The town of-

417
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,300
Hey is for horse and strength.

418
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,220
So close.

419
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,820
So close to a seamless transition.

420
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,780
Can I ask you an equestrian?

421
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,780
Oh my God.

422
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,060
Can we ask one more question?

423
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,780
No, not bound by the truth.

424
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,980
Yes, no restraints.

425
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,740
Yeah, yeah, just shoot.

426
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,580
Who did it?

427
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,420
Who did it?

428
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,100
He just doesn't have to tell us the truth.

429
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,180
Here's the goo.

430
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,940
Thomas's first question that he tried to send me was,

431
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,860
who-

432
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,780
No, what were the final hours of Maggie's,

433
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,860
Chief Maggie's life?

434
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,700
Nice.

435
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,540
I was like, reveal that to me in a dream.

436
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,740
Who killed her?

437
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,860
Tell me who killed her.

438
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,060
Art galore, dude.

439
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,620
I will say, you told us a while ago

440
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,060
that you might give us a chance to ask a question.

441
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,620
So for a while now I've been thinking about

442
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,660
really good heart of the issue questions

443
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,500
that you would have to elaborate on.

444
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,740
And when you gave us the yes or no right at the end there,

445
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,860
I was like, fuck.

446
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,580
Yeah, and I only gave you like 10 hours to think about it.

447
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,020
I think mine was pretty good.

448
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,540
The town of contention is draped in a thin layer of fog

449
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,540
on this sharp blustery not yet morning of December 5th.

450
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,660
There is an old Husky, a dirty shade of white,

451
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,100
walking slowly down the middle of the road.

452
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,500
The ancient dog's paw pauses mid-step

453
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,780
when it hears the humming of car engines approaching,

454
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,220
the only sound cutting through the dormant town

455
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,980
aside from the howling of the wind.

456
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,020
Through the arthritic pain pulsating through her joints,

457
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,420
this old Husky bounds off the street

458
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,180
and down an alley has three cars,

459
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,540
a yellow taxi cab, a cherry red Mini Cooper

460
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,420
with black stripes, and a contention police cruiser

461
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,500
pull into the contention police department parking lot.

462
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,820
John, do you wanna, or Thomas, do you wanna describe

463
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,780
what they see in the Mini Cooper?

464
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,180
Yeah, they see me, shit, sorry, I'm not Thomas.

465
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,540
I'm John Leapa anymore, oh, fuck it.

466
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,780
You can tell it's in Thomas.

467
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,620
Yeah, they see.

468
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,660
They see John Lee Pettymore, they see Drew driving his car,

469
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,260
which they would recognize as his,

470
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,380
and they see the Fonzie lady in the backseat.

471
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,220
Okay.

472
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,180
Does Clark have his wallet on him?

473
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,460
Do we all get there at the same time?

474
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,340
You all get there at the exact same time.

475
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,460
Clark, you.

476
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,460
Okay, so then they would also see John Lee Pettymore

477
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,540
like eyes super wide, like yanking his head

478
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,060
at the lady, like, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

479
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,180
Get a load of this.

480
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,580
Do I have everything on me?

481
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,620
You are wearing your pajamas,

482
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,540
and you don't have your cell phone, or your wallet,

483
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,340
or your gun on you.

484
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,180
Okay.

485
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,220
We're all in the parking lot.

486
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
You're all in the parking lot.

487
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,020
Okay, I get out of my cruiser.

488
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,460
I assume I am, I've got all my police uniform and everything.

489
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,300
Absolutely.

490
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,720
I get out, and I wait for them to get out.

491
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,060
So I say, what's her name?

492
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,860
You don't know yet, you've never asked her.

493
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,500
First of all, I say, all right,

494
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,060
we never got this out of the way.

495
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,180
First, I'm Officer John Lee Pettymore.

496
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,660
Yeah, I know.

497
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,500
What's your name?

498
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,780
Rosemary.

499
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,220
Rosemary, that's a very pretty name.

500
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,060
Thank you.

501
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,840
So check it out.

502
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,380
If you wanna get that gun.

503
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,420
Yeah, I do.

504
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,780
Yeah, you're gonna have to give us our guns back.

505
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,180
That's fine.

506
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,300
Just so you know, if I go missing or anything,

507
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
you're done, you're over.

508
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,180
You will be taken, you will be tortured.

509
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,460
Marvin Glass does not fuck around,

510
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,660
and he wants this gun, he wants it real bad,

511
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,460
and he's gonna get it.

512
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,780
Rosemary, I really hope you understand

513
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,160
that Marvin Glass is the least of my worries right now.

514
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,180
And he can send all of his goons,

515
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,180
but what we're dealing with is just a bit more stressful.

516
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,960
That's why I want you to help me.

517
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,140
So let's go get that gun.

518
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,540
All right, let's go get that gun.

519
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,340
Okay, my guns please though.

520
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,180
Okay.

521
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,220
All right, thank you.

522
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,300
And she hands your gun back to you,

523
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,460
and she hands the gun that you let Drew have back to him.

524
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,300
I take it.

525
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,020
Oh, okay.

526
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,420
Also, you guys would all notice

527
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,820
there's a car in the parking lot

528
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,540
that none of you recognize.

529
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,200
It is a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

530
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,040
Hell yeah.

531
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,400
I lean up to my cabbie.

532
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,980
I'm a little short, I don't have my wallet on me, my man.

533
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,300
Is there any chance I could get this right on the house,

534
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,620
pay it back next time I see you?

535
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,980
He turns and looks at you, and he's just like.

536
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,420
Nope.

537
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,220
Well, is this the Sesame Street taxi driver?

538
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,300
It's Oscar.

539
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,920
It's already been paid for.

540
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,340
Oh, I was linching.

541
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,500
Okay, you have a good night, and I get up.

542
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,700
He drives off as your first foot steps out of the door.

543
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,420
Clark, who was that spooky cab driver?

544
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,300
He was just giving me a ride to the station here.

545
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,780
Why don't you have, why are you in your pajamas?

546
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,900
I was sleepwalking.

547
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,740
Yeah?

548
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,820
I must've ended up here sleepwalking.

549
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,180
Well, you're a great liar, Clark.

550
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,860
Everybody, I want y'all to meet Rosemary.

551
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,700
Hey.

552
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,780
Rosemary, this is everyone.

553
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,620
Hey, I remember.

554
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,260
I immediately get freaked out.

555
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,100
Hey, it's okay.

556
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,140
Keith, Keith, get your gun on her.

557
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,500
No, no, no, no, guys, hold on, hold on.

558
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,160
She doesn't have a, I got my guns, it's all good.

559
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,300
How did you?

560
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,700
It's okay, it's fine, we're working together,

561
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,140
you guys are gonna give me the gun,

562
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,460
and then we're all gonna be friends,

563
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,620
everything's gonna be fine.

564
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,460
Well, what's gonna happen, Rosemary,

565
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,220
is that we're gonna go with you to the city with the gun.

566
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,660
Yeah, sure, whatever, fine.

567
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,920
We might give Marvin the gun

568
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,180
if he really decides he wants it at the end of things, but.

569
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,020
Okay.

570
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,840
Yeah, I think he wants it.

571
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,300
When did we decide all this?

572
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,980
You weren't really there.

573
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,500
You see, she had just executed two of my cousins

574
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,340
for no particular reason.

575
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,580
They were running away.

576
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,060
Keith, get your gun on her.

577
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,740
I've got two guns on her, and she's fine.

578
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,620
I do have, I have my hand on my gun,

579
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,340
but it's still holstered.

580
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,620
Anyway, y'all remember, y'all remember the Glass boys?

581
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,460
Oh, yeah.

582
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,660
Jermaine and Albert, is it?

583
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,480
Alfred.

584
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,380
Alfred, one of whom disappeared,

585
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,640
the other one wasn't, quit babbling about that gun.

586
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,480
Yep.

587
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,280
Well, so Rosemary here and Charles Donovan,

588
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,180
they're in our little town, trying to find those boys,

589
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,460
trying to find the gun that, Alfred, which one's around?

590
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,820
Which one's gone, which one's around?

591
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,860
Alfred's still around, but I mean, not really mentally.

592
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,380
Yeah, he won't shut up about the gun,

593
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,260
so Marvin Glass, that's Alfred's daddy.

594
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,500
He really wants that gun.

595
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,780
So we're gonna go talk to him?

596
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,300
Well, Marvin Glass is the head of the Glass crime family,

597
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,740
and I think if he wants his boy back,

598
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,640
he has some considerable resources

599
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,120
we might be able to call upon

600
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,440
to help us fight this unholy terror

601
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,060
that's descended upon our town.

602
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,620
So I kinda made an executive decision,

603
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,820
and I enlisted the mob to help us.

604
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,220
I'm here, I'm the mob,

605
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,620
and we're all gonna do great together, I think.

606
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,580
The contention police department and the Glass crime family

607
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,560
are going to be wonderful business partners

608
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,780
from here on out.

609
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,380
In temporary cahoots.

610
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,540
And she puts her hand on Clark Bishop's shoulder.

611
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,760
Yeah, Clark, you cool with that?

612
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,680
Good, good.

613
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,840
Keith, you cool with that?

614
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,680
Sure.

615
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,200
I elbow her and get away from the hand.

616
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,060
I turn directly to John, why does Marvin want the gun?

617
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,600
Well, okay, see, that's what's gonna happen,

618
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,860
is Marvin wants the gun

619
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,220
because he thinks he can turn his boy back around.

620
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,400
We have just seen the gun disappear, people,

621
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,060
so I don't think it doesn't really work that way,

622
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,300
but I think if we all put our heads together,

623
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,100
we can maybe bring some people back, like Tilly Bee.

624
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,420
Rosemary leans forward,

625
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,660
putting her head in the center of the group.

626
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,660
I push her back out.

627
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,940
Not Rosemary, this is.

628
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,540
And I kinda close off for that gap.

629
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,740
Oh, I thought we were putting our heads together.

630
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,420
No, Rosemary, this isn't about you, really.

631
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,540
So yeah, he wants that gun

632
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,220
because he thinks it'll help his boy,

633
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,740
or bring his boy back.

634
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,540
I think the only way to get the boy back

635
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,180
is to defeat this, you know,

636
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,660
ancient evil that's descended upon us,

637
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,860
and I think we might need more than just the three of us

638
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,140
to do that, so I thought maybe a bunch of mafia gins

639
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,180
would help things out,

640
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,700
like, and one very motivated mafia boss

641
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,160
trying to get his son back.

642
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah.

643
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,900
Do you see, I mean, because.

644
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,260
I don't have any better ideas.

645
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,860
Because they, like, the feds came by

646
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,700
and they weren't much help,

647
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,820
they're like, call this number

648
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,260
if you don't solve it in two days,

649
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,640
so I called the mob.

650
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,660
John, when would we be heading up to the city?

651
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,500
Right now.

652
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,340
You guys don't, I was gonna go,

653
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,540
me and Drew were gonna go,

654
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,420
y'all can go though, it might be helpful too,

655
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,780
but I don't know if we should leave,

656
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,900
you know what, I mean, it's an hour away.

657
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,100
Goo's not gonna eat the town in two hours, right?

658
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,020
Well, I hope not.

659
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,340
Did y'all see that dog on the way over here?

660
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,140
Why was it out of the water?

661
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,980
Oh.

662
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,260
Y'all seen any more, have we,

663
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,100
can I do a perception check or awareness check

664
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,920
to see if I've noticed other dogs

665
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,260
or animals wandering around like not.

666
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,100
You wouldn't need to roll to know

667
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,460
that it's been like this for a couple days now

668
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,320
or there have been any animals,

669
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,740
and this is absolutely the first animal you've seen

670
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,620
not in water in a couple days.

671
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,860
Okay, cool.

672
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,300
How far back was that dog?

673
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,660
It was right before we turned in, right?

674
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,060
Let's go catch it or talk to it or pet it.

675
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,300
Always thinking with your stomach.

676
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,140
Pet it.

677
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,980
Let's go pet it.

678
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,660
It wasn't a black lab, was it?

679
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,280
No, it was a husky, an old husky.

680
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,060
Why, you having weird dreams or something about black labs?

681
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,360
No, Kerry Page's dog's still missing.

682
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,960
Yeah, I think we know the creek to find that dog in.

683
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,180
It wasn't there when we passed it last night.

684
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,020
Fuck, maybe that dog needs more of it.

685
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,760
Well, maybe you should go get your clothes on.

686
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,600
That's a good idea.

687
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,900
One of you boys wanna give me a ride home real quick?

688
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,460
Don't you not have extras in the lockers right in there?

689
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,280
Do I?

690
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,120
Yeah, absolutely.

691
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,060
I'll go in and get changed.

692
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,900
Yeah.

693
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, Clark, honestly, you're disgracing the badge right now.

694
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,960
Just Clark going in?

695
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,800
Yeah.

696
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,920
Oh, no, I'm gonna go get that gun.

697
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,760
Ah, right.

698
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,660
I wanna stay out here and look at the dog,

699
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,660
look for the dog.

700
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,340
I wanna go inside with them.

701
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,960
I toss the handgun to Drew, and I'm like, Drew, guard her.

702
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,820
No, man, well, I guess we've got what she wants, so.

703
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,020
He finally catches it.

704
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,220
I'm like, all right, all right, all right.

705
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,060
Everybody come in.

706
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,900
You two come inside.

707
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,020
Yeah, I'll come in.

708
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,140
Follow us, Rosemary.

709
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:08,980
Yeah, okay.

710
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,760
As I'm heading toward the door, I notice that car.

711
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,600
Yeah.

712
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,260
And I don't open the door, and I look back at you guys.

713
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,640
You guys know whose car that is?

714
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,480
That red?

715
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,000
No, I've never seen that car before.

716
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,840
No idea.

717
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,980
I look through the glass of the police department.

718
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,420
Do I see anybody through the glass?

719
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,780
You don't see anybody through the glass,

720
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,900
but you do see that the desk that Drew uses

721
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,380
that is within sight of the doorway

722
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,340
has papers stacked super high on the desk

723
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,580
that weren't there the last time you were at the station.

724
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,820
And Drew normally keeps his desk pretty clean.

725
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,700
Drew, give me that gun.

726
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,780
Give it back, all right.

727
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,480
Now get down, get behind one of these cars, Drew.

728
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Okay.

729
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,820
A bigger one than your Mini Cooper.

730
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,660
Okay.

731
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,480
All right, be safe, buddy.

732
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,060
I wanna go look inside that car.

733
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,900
Okay.

734
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,380
I wanna kick the door down holding both those guns

735
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,820
and shout, freeze, motherfucker, contention PD.

736
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,620
Okay, let's take those one at a time.

737
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,060
So first, Keith, you walk over

738
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,380
to the red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

739
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,260
Freeze, motherfucker, contention PD.

740
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,780
I put my hands up.

741
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,380
And do you, what do you do?

742
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,500
You kick in the door?

743
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,420
I'll wait.

744
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,320
I'm about to, but I see him go over there,

745
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,660
so I pause with my foot just like inches away.

746
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,980
I put my finger up, I'm like, shh.

747
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,820
Oh, I've got two guns.

748
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,060
In case the car can hear us.

749
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,900
Totally.

750
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,100
You look inside of it and inside the car,

751
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,100
you see there's a big container of creatine powder

752
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,460
sitting in the floorboard of the shotgun seat.

753
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,620
That's like protein powder, right?

754
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,980
Protein powder, yes, sir.

755
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,980
And you also see two empty cans of Red Bull, the big ones.

756
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,580
The big ones.

757
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,580
You also see a pair of Oakleys sitting on the seat,

758
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,660
the shotgun seat.

759
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,340
Boys, it looks like we're dealing with a strong foe here.

760
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,180
A douchebag.

761
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,220
We got a real douchebag here.

762
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,380
Is this a two-door car?

763
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,000
I believe it is a two-door car.

764
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,780
All right, anything in the backseat?

765
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,620
No.

766
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,140
Okay, I turn around and I'm like, yeah, let's go inside.

767
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,620
Okay, so yeah, I kick open the door and I shout,

768
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,540
potential proof.

769
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,620
Potention PD, contention PD, freeze, douchebag.

770
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,620
And as you rush in, I assume, to the police department,

771
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,140
you see a young man who was just previously

772
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,780
walking furiously back and forth.

773
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,020
He's frozen solid, hands up in the air.

774
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,940
He's wearing a navy blue suit with a white shirt

775
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,460
and a red stripe tie.

776
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,220
And in one hand, he is holding a large can of Red Bull.

777
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,340
Drop it, party boy.

778
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,140
He drops the can of Red Bull and it hits the ground

779
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,740
and begins to spill onto the carpet,

780
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,660
the like very thin, shitty carpet

781
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,300
of the contention police department.

782
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,940
Oh look, you made a mess in my police department.

783
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,100
I come in behind John.

784
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,020
I'm not, I'm just literally at his back talking over him.

785
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,860
Who are you?

786
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,460
Men, it seems that I have found myself

787
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,100
the contention police officers that I am here to talk to.

788
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
If you would come on down

789
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,140
and reach into my jacket pocket here,

790
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,860
I think we won't have an issue

791
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,300
when you see, oh, it's a badge.

792
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,620
It's not a gun, it's a badge.

793
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,100
I do.

794
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,460
John, you keep your gun on him.

795
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,500
I also have my gun aimed at him.

796
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
I'm heading over there

797
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,180
and I'm reaching for the thing in my pocket

798
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,140
as I go for his penis.

799
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,180
The thing in your pocket?

800
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,020
Yeah.

801
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,860
The penis.

802
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,680
Okay, oh shit, yeah.

803
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,180
Okay, as you.

804
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,300
And I'm going, I wanna see his badge.

805
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,580
Okay, so you reach in just right there.

806
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,700
Yes, it's that one.

807
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
And you pull an FBI badge.

808
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,940
As soon as I see it, I point up

809
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,820
and shoot into the bottom neck area.

810
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,340
Okay.

811
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,060
All right, let's go ahead and roll.

812
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,260
If you could roll a firearms check for me.

813
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,780
Pass, 43 on an 80.

814
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,780
All right, and he rolled an aught four,

815
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,000
which means that you win.

816
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,500
So yours is higher and passed.

817
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,860
So describe what happened.

818
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,500
Real quick, what were you competing on there?

819
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,600
I used his alertness to see if he would recognize

820
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,820
that it was coming in order to even try

821
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,140
to resist the attack.

822
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,020
Gotcha, okay.

823
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,700
We don't talk about mechanics very much.

824
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,660
I typically just roll, but yes, ask that more often.

825
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,660
And I can always explain what I'm doing.

826
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,260
I don't think that was a listener thing.

827
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,100
That was just for me.

828
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,060
Yeah, absolutely.

829
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,500
I don't think anybody's gonna give a shit, but.

830
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,860
I don't think the people who listen to this will care.

831
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,900
If you give a shit, don't listen to us.

832
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,700
Yeah, we are barely playing by rules.

833
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,620
Oh, I am always cheating.

834
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,360
Yeah, I rolled a critical success every time.

835
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
High tension moment.

836
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,340
So what happens?

837
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,680
So I shoot and you guys see a little tranquilizer dart

838
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,520
hit him.

839
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,960
I hope it's really quick acting.

840
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,960
He goes, oh my God, what in the world is going on?

841
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,640
As he like starts to wobble and wobble

842
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,540
and then he looks at you and he's like,

843
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,440
hey, what's up?

844
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,280
I look at the badge.

845
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,120
What's the name on it?

846
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,260
Agent Chad, Trent Chad, Trent Chad.

847
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,400
Hey, hey, Chad, are you with me?

848
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm gonna need you to sit down

849
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,800
and I kind of help him sit in the nearby chair.

850
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,240
I love sitting.

851
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,360
I turn back to John.

852
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,520
I'll explain, but get Keith in here.

853
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,940
Okay, my gun is on you now, by the way.

854
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,360
Trust me, John, please.

855
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,760
I do, you're Clark.

856
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,240
Yeah, I will come in like, what are you doing?

857
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,840
Wait, you got one of those for Rosemary?

858
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,680
Do we need it?

859
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,760
Yeah, hold on, what's going on here?

860
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,600
How many you got?

861
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,400
I think just one more.

862
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,840
Is that just a trink or like what'd you just do?

863
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,200
I'll explain to you guys.

864
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,040
We can just shoot her.

865
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,520
Here's what's going on.

866
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,960
I had a, I hope you guys will respect my privacy.

867
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,780
You're pretty.

868
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,400
But I had some stuff happen last night

869
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,780
and I just want you to trust me

870
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,300
that I got it on good authority

871
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,320
that the FBI was gonna be here this morning

872
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,200
and that it was our job to make sure

873
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,180
they didn't report back about all the crazy shit

874
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,000
that was happening here in contention.

875
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,360
You said good authority.

876
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,160
They gave me this gun, these tranq darts,

877
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,600
and they said that these darts are special

878
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,400
and whoever we tranq them with,

879
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,320
they'll have to obey our orders for a while.

880
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,160
Okay.

881
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,660
Do you know how long a while is, mechanically speaking?

882
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,120
I don't know it in world or mechanically.

883
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,520
I guess we'll just find out.

884
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,220
I think our best bet though is to give them

885
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,040
a bunch of instructions right the fuck now.

886
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,200
Do we have to fry and pan them over the head?

887
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,480
Well, hey man, that's really cool.

888
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,920
It's a really cool gun you got there.

889
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,680
What are we gonna tell them to do?

890
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,140
My only thought is just to make sure

891
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,140
he leaves and doesn't come back

892
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,900
and whatever he tells his superiors

893
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
is something that doesn't make them wanna come back.

894
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,800
Okay, man, as much as I wanna send him

895
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,820
on some hypnotized shenanigans,

896
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,320
I think that's probably the best bet.

897
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,760
Do you think that we'd have time

898
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,240
for shenanigans afterward?

899
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,160
Sure.

900
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,200
That's true.

901
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,360
Yeah, I was right behind you guys the whole time.

902
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,120
I told, buddy, I told you to get the Honda car.

903
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,840
Oh, yeah, I snuck in here, I guess, after.

904
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,800
Did you get upset when you saw

905
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,760
that your paperwork was all disturbed?

906
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Well, you know how I like my desk to always be clean.

907
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,560
Hey, Drew, those papers over there,

908
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,280
are they all yours or some of them his?

909
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,600
Drew starts looking through.

910
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,820
He has pulled out tons of files

911
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,660
out of your filing cabinets and is sorting through them.

912
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,500
They're all ours, though.

913
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,320
Yeah.

914
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,400
So, hey, buddy, who sent you here?

915
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,320
Yeah, the FBI.

916
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,160
And what did they tell you you might find here?

917
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,400
Three of the worst police officers

918
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,880
in the history of the United States of America.

919
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,860
I guess that's, I guess that's you guys.

920
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,040
I wouldn't normally take immense offense to that,

921
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,720
but I understand that in today's law enforcement,

922
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,240
it's often more of a PR game than anything,

923
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,240
and frankly, we've been within' that pretty mightily.

924
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,700
So you might not know what we're doin'

925
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,160
to actually save the world.

926
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,280
I think we're probably the best police officers

927
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,920
in America, I would say.

928
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,000
Hey, Chad, you ever, certainly the bravest.

929
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Have you ever conducted a press conference?

930
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,840
You ever conducted a press conference for yourself?

931
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,120
Press conferences are my specialty.

932
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,780
Guys, what if we have him calm down?

933
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,620
The popular is awesome.

934
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,200
Yes, Chad.

935
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,880
I'm very good with public relations.

936
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,480
Everyone loves me all the time, mostly.

937
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,600
Why wouldn't they?

938
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,440
Yep.

939
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,160
Yeah, so can you relate to the public for us?

940
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,080
What should we tell him that is goin' on, then?

941
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,240
What if we, oh, shit.

942
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,000
Well, what we'll tell him is that there has been,

943
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
well, it's super dark, but here's a possible,

944
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,260
here's a possible cover story.

945
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,280
All right, we tell them that contention

946
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,080
is a crossroads for human trafficking,

947
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,920
and that all their children and people

948
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,280
that then disappeared are in slavery.

949
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,720
Yeah, so what he's gonna say is that the FBI

950
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,200
has a task force on the way.

951
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,400
The meager resources of the contention PD were overwhelmed,

952
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,200
despite the brave efforts of all the officers here,

953
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,080
and that if you see anything, like black goo-related,

954
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,560
why don't you just call on in to Drew down here

955
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,380
at the hotline and let him know?

956
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,600
Maybe not the black goo.

957
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,960
Maybe not the black goo.

958
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,120
Maybe just the stuff flattering us.

959
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,960
We could tell him to give the contention PD

960
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,200
as wide a berth as possible,

961
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
that they are still part of the task force

962
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,400
and are the feet on the ground.

963
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,040
Don't interfere with us.

964
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,900
We should also say we're working closely

965
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,560
with the first church of contention.

966
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,400
I had a wiper.

967
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,840
I was thinking we might have a conference at the church.

968
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah.

969
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,080
Clark, you are.

970
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,920
That's good.

971
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,880
You're a genius.

972
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,640
Clark is a, he's kinda rocking back on his heels,

973
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,720
a little bit proud of that.

974
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,560
So do we wanna have that untelevised event that he does

975
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,300
and then send him on his way back and say,

976
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,160
they got it under control,

977
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,120
or actually have the FBI come out here

978
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,480
and no, we don't want them to come.

979
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,440
No, I think we have them do the press conference

980
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,400
and then get the fuck out of town

981
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,680
and don't ever come back.

982
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,520
Don't ever come back.

983
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,760
Tell his superiors that it must have been a false alarm

984
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,920
that contention PD's got everything under control

985
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,760
in that town.

986
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,100
Bizarre internet hoax.

987
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,940
There you go.

988
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,280
It's just a attack on small town America.

989
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,260
What time do you guys wanna have this conference?

990
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,100
Cause we're gonna need to.

991
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,920
We should do it today.

992
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,760
What time is it right now?

993
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,600
Early.

994
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,700
It is super early.

995
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,600
It's like five in the morning, 4.30 in the morning.

996
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,440
You know what?

997
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,120
We don't know how much longer

998
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,220
these truth serum darts are gonna work.

999
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,060
Let's hold it.

1000
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,880
Whatever you wanna call it.

1001
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,220
A 10 a.m. press conference.

1002
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,060
I'm hoping.

1003
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,880
No, no, no, no.

1004
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,920
What we gotta do is go down to that church

1005
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,120
right the fuck now, get up on the auditorium,

1006
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,520
film one of them on our smartphones

1007
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,320
and get him out of here.

1008
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,160
And then go back to business.

1009
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,720
I don't think it should be filmed though.

1010
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,040
That's not a bad idea if we film it

1011
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,960
and just give it to the local television station

1012
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,040
on the morning news.

1013
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,900
We can pose in front all Mr. Science theater style,

1014
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,520
just silhouetted acting like reporters.

1015
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,840
Hank, question.

1016
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,060
Clark is already heading toward the evidence locker

1017
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,100
to find the camera that we always use for filming things.

1018
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,920
Okay.

1019
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,760
Absolutely.

1020
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,580
I like that.

1021
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,420
And then we'll send it into.

1022
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,260
When you go back there.

1023
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,460
What is the local news channel?

1024
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,240
We probably just get the city news out here.

1025
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,600
Yeah, that's right.

1026
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,720
We're only an hour away.

1027
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,640
Probably the only news around is the city.

1028
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,080
Well, there's probably a couple radio.

1029
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,800
I mean, of course there's a couple radio stations

1030
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,080
that we all listen to and love.

1031
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,180
Local talk radio.

1032
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,540
Oh, let's do that.

1033
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,020
Let's do a public service announcement on the radio.

1034
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,700
You could even have Wolf the dog post it.

1035
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,540
Yeah.

1036
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,260
Well, everybody in town loves Wolf the dog.

1037
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,340
That's true.

1038
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,620
Okay, I like the idea.

1039
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,140
All right, let's get this done quick.

1040
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,580
We can just record it right here then.

1041
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,420
Yep.

1042
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,380
All right, say this idiot.

1043
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,220
What?

1044
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,220
Drew, top up something pretty for this dumb ass to say.

1045
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,540
Okay, what the fuck?

1046
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,740
I have to do it all.

1047
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,580
No, you have to do it all.

1048
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,540
I don't know if it's necessary that we even say anything

1049
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,300
because we've said what he's gonna say.

1050
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,180
The bullet points that we wanna hit are everything's okay,

1051
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,580
let the contention PD do whatever the fuck they want.

1052
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,500
And don't worry, everything's gonna be all right.

1053
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,620
And that everything the contention PD has been doing

1054
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,560
has been a-okay, what we needed them to do.

1055
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,740
Above and beyond.

1056
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
Don't worry, but be careful out there.

1057
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,220
Yep.

1058
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,480
So we have him say that.

1059
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,320
Yeah.

1060
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,140
Awesome.

1061
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,100
We can have Drew email it over to Wolf the dog.

1062
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,020
For immediate release.

1063
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,140
Yeah, for immediate release.

1064
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,980
Yeah.

1065
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,380
Haven't played a couple times over the course of the day.

1066
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,220
Perfect.

1067
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,040
Well, cause that's the thing,

1068
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,860
this is gonna be a big news.

1069
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,780
They're gonna want this.

1070
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,620
They're not gonna want it.

1071
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,440
This is hot shit.

1072
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,280
They're not gonna want it.

1073
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,120
Hot shit.

1074
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,780
Well, they've been waiting to hear something from you guys.

1075
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,740
That was mostly Drew's fault.

1076
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,460
Oh, and tell them to repeat it.

1077
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,420
Oh, hey, yeah.

1078
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,280
Should we have somebody else besides Drew email him?

1079
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,420
Remember when he didn't tell us

1080
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,760
about those 30 missing people?

1081
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,840
I think his heart's in the right place, but.

1082
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,860
Well, you guys are right here.

1083
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,700
You can watch me.

1084
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,560
We can all email them together.

1085
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,760
Drew, the whole point of your job

1086
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,180
is that you're supposed to be able to do it

1087
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,400
while we're not watching you.

1088
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Yes, and that was an excellent opportunity for this story.

1089
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,760
Well, you can prove yourself to us by doing it correctly.

1090
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,600
And how about you get dressed?

1091
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,440
Yeah, buddy.

1092
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,840
And let's do the next thing.

1093
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,680
Retroactively.

1094
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,200
As soon as agent is done recording.

1095
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,040
Can we start over?

1096
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,880
Can we start over?

1097
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,480
As soon as the agent is done recording

1098
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,600
and maybe those two are getting the emails sent off,

1099
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,120
I'm telling them about.

1100
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,440
And now I'm gonna need you to go back to your superiors

1101
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,780
and tell them kind of what you said on that news broadcast,

1102
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,560
that everything's okay here in the contention area.

1103
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,400
Yeah.

1104
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,580
And that there's no reason to send anybody else down here

1105
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,720
for a while at least,

1106
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,580
but you probably never need them again.

1107
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,880
It's just an internet hoax.

1108
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,920
So I did it?

1109
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,960
I did it right?

1110
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,840
I just solved the case, buddy.

1111
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
I pat him on the back.

1112
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,660
You did.

1113
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,500
You did.

1114
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,340
You killed him.

1115
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,160
And he was your boss.

1116
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,000
I'd give you a promotion.

1117
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,360
You look strong and energized.

1118
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,000
You look swole, buddy.

1119
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,200
Thank you.

1120
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,280
Look at them wings.

1121
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,880
I appreciate it.

1122
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,880
I'll just go get in my car.

1123
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,840
Hey, wait, real quick.

1124
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,920
Before you fucking go,

1125
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,640
could you mop up that Red Bull you spilled?

1126
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,880
Yeah, of course.

1127
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,440
All right, thanks, you dumb piece of shit.

1128
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,880
And then I shoot him dead.

1129
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,360
Oh no, we're gonna have to lure another FBI agent down here

1130
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,040
and hypnotize him all over again.

1131
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,720
And he's gonna have to clean up this mess.

1132
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,360
No, I don't shoot him.

1133
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,880
I failed my firearm, shit.

1134
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,440
Clark, when you go to the back of the police station

1135
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,980
to grab your change of clothes,

1136
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:42,060
you have a habit of peeking in on the cells.

1137
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,680
There's no one in the cells.

1138
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,040
Dr. Murray Jacobs is gone.

1139
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,820
Dr. Murray Jacobs and the body of Doug Jacobs

1140
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,440
are no longer in the cells.

1141
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,180
Are all our artifacts still there?

1142
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,940
The cell doors are locked.

1143
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,220
I do the cartoon walk by and then slowly walk back.

1144
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,420
And you confirm.

1145
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,260
No one's there.

1146
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,220
Hey, boys, I'm still gonna get changed,

1147
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,480
but cells are empty, God fucking damn it.

1148
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,900
I go back and get changed.

1149
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,780
But just the people are gone, not our stuff.

1150
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,740
The stuff is in a locker.

1151
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,740
The stuff is in the evidence room, I think.

1152
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,580
None of us let them out.

1153
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,560
Just look for yourself as I kind of motion

1154
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,740
with a hand over toward them.

1155
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,860
Okay, we go check it out.

1156
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,460
Hey, Clark, did you notice that everybody's gone?

1157
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,040
I don't respond.

1158
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,820
Put my clothes on.

1159
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,820
What the fuck?

1160
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,260
I check the doors to make sure that they're actually locked.

1161
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,540
They're locked and secured.

1162
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,140
Well, this is a quandary.

1163
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,000
I come back into the room fully dressed.

1164
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,080
Oh, hey, I check the locks.

1165
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,540
I tried Murray Jacobs' cell phone number,

1166
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,340
which I assume we acquired during routine police paperwork.

1167
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,620
Yeah, that flies.

1168
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,380
It goes to voicemail immediately, it doesn't ring.

1169
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,220
I turn to Drew.

1170
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,380
Hey, Drew, when was the last time you noticed them in there?

1171
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,540
Well, they were in there last night.

1172
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,420
Isn't it last night right now?

1173
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,980
Well, they were in there like seven hours ago, for sure.

1174
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,980
Well, it's a good thing we're in a police station

1175
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,260
with cameras, let's go check those.

1176
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,100
Nice.

1177
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,280
A fist bump, Keith.

1178
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,520
Watching the security footage of the last couple of hours

1179
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,200
fast forwarding through, you see the cat in your police station

1180
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,960
running all over the place, constantly jumping, jumping,

1181
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,120
jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping from spot to spot

1182
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,760
to spot, hiding, running, running.

1183
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,520
And when you are watching the footage of the cells,

1184
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,280
you see both Dr. Murray Jacobs and the body

1185
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:46,520
of Doug Jacobs silently just get really scared

1186
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,480
and move back up against the wall,

1187
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,360
and they start kind of moving away.

1188
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,000
And then all of a sudden, you see their bodies picked up

1189
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,760
off the ground and slammed into the ground

1190
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,820
and slammed into the ground.

1191
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,520
And then as if they were never there, they are gone.

1192
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,600
What the hell could that have been?

1193
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,120
If you guys could go ahead and roll sanity.

1194
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,400
Do we need to?

1195
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,360
That's a really good point, because you have seen this

1196
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,960
happen a lot of times.

1197
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,360
We just know what it is, but I pass anyway.

1198
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,000
And especially because it was also on camera,

1199
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,880
I won't call for a sanity roll there.

1200
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,200
I want to rewind the tape and get to the very moment

1201
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,480
that the cat started freaking out and see if I can tell

1202
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,120
which direction it was looking when it started freaking out.

1203
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,200
Interesting.

1204
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,000
Did the cat get gooed too?

1205
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,120
You didn't see the cat disappear.

1206
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,120
As you're finding the spot where the cat got freaked out,

1207
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,260
it was looking up.

1208
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,520
I look up.

1209
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,120
You see the paneled ceiling of the police department.

1210
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,280
You know, the kind of ceiling that they have in classrooms

1211
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,600
that you can throw pencils into.

1212
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,440
Drop ceiling.

1213
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,280
Drop ceiling.

1214
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,100
Drop ceiling.

1215
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,600
So, hey, y'all remember when the body of John Peters

1216
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,800
fell from the sky onto my cop cruiser?

1217
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,640
Do you think?

1218
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,480
Oh, yeah.

1219
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,320
Mm-hmm.

1220
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,160
I don't know.

1221
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,920
That happened up, you know what I mean?

1222
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
The sky opened.

1223
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,320
Well, I mean, that happened.

1224
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,720
Cat was looking up.

1225
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,360
Happened in the junkyard body.

1226
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,640
Happened.

1227
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,900
We're not talking about the slamming.

1228
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,600
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1229
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,040
Is that, yeah, the falling from the sky is.

1230
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,480
Yeah, the falling from the sky.

1231
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,560
Is different, but they got smashed repeatedly

1232
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,920
into the ground and then disappeared.

1233
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,320
Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston.

1234
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,120
Got smashed into the ground and then disappeared.

1235
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,960
John Peters.

1236
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,280
John Peters fell from the sky and did not disappear.

1237
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,360
The first body fell and didn't disappear.

1238
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,400
Good work, yep.

1239
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,520
Very succinctly put, Keith.

1240
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,360
Thank you.

1241
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,000
Seems like we might be dealing with the same.

1242
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,640
Do you think it's all the same goo?

1243
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,240
Probably all the same goo.

1244
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,840
And we, did we figure out,

1245
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,400
we think that the animals can see the goo?

1246
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,240
Well, they can sense it.

1247
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,280
Animals have a pretty natural awareness.

1248
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,800
What if we all turn into cats?

1249
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,360
Clark, right now, I think that's best case scenario.

1250
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,600
And then we could just run free, John.

1251
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,560
Well, I think we're gonna have to wait

1252
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,920
till the radio turns back on.

1253
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,960
We're gonna have to wait till the radio turns back on

1254
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,400
to test that theory out.

1255
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,600
I kind of do a sheepish laugh.

1256
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,360
We can't do that.

1257
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,240
Real quick, I don't know how any of this all works,

1258
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,440
but I was thinking about, I think at some point,

1259
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,320
one of us is probably gonna have to shoot ourselves

1260
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,200
with that gun to go to this other place

1261
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,760
where all this weird shit and those photographs

1262
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,960
are coming from.

1263
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,200
And then maybe the radio, or the helmet.

1264
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,120
One of them, I think there's a sequence maybe

1265
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,600
that takes you there and brings you back.

1266
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,200
But I'm not sure what swapping bodies has to do with it.

1267
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,040
Maybe one of us has to die.

1268
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,720
Well, we'll be able to take a picture again today.

1269
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,920
Why?

1270
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,520
I don't know why.

1271
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,280
So, you think it's on a daily timer?

1272
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
Why did you say that?

1273
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,360
Did you have some kind of weird dream about that?

1274
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,040
I don't know, I just, it was,

1275
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,660
I felt like that was just in my mind.

1276
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,340
I don't know how I knew that.

1277
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,940
So, something I was thinking about is the last time.

1278
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,660
I think maybe around one o'clock today,

1279
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,480
we'll be able to take that picture.

1280
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,140
That's specific, Keith.

1281
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,820
It's just, it's in my mind, it's a hunch.

1282
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,060
I don't know how I know it, though.

1283
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,060
Yeah, all right, what the hell do you know, buddy?

1284
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,980
Hey, Keith rolled to be a better liar.

1285
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,780
Keith rolled to lie to us right now.

1286
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,620
Is it weird shit?

1287
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,060
I don't know, I just, it popped into my head.

1288
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,120
I put my hand on Keith's shoulder.

1289
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,900
Weird shit is all around us, man.

1290
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,120
If you just happen to know this, I fucking believe you, man.

1291
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,380
I just knew it.

1292
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,520
I don't know, I can't remember how or what.

1293
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,640
Did we not all know that?

1294
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,120
Can I do a hument to see if he's lying about

1295
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,120
just knowing that?

1296
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,760
I don't like to play where you can roll hument

1297
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,400
against other players.

1298
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,260
Oh, so Luke just gets the bullshit.

1299
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,400
We've also, so early on, there was a time I played

1300
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,200
with a different group and somebody had an incredibly

1301
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,480
high Persuade and they just forced Dean's player

1302
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,700
to keep doing stupid stuff by rolling Persuade against him.

1303
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,640
Yeah, that doesn't sound fun.

1304
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,480
I mean, it sounds fun.

1305
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,520
No, it's objectively the worst scenario.

1306
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,440
That's a really good point about, yeah.

1307
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,120
It was really funny for everyone except for Dean.

1308
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,800
Which is annoying, I'd be like, okay, well,

1309
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,320
you can just play my character then.

1310
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,040
Yeah, so I don't like it.

1311
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,040
What are the recourses for discovering

1312
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,460
if a player is lying to you?

1313
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,300
What do you think?

1314
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,680
Well, I was about to say, if you want to play it out.

1315
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,180
I've kind of just said that I believe him.

1316
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,960
Yeah, so let's role play it.

1317
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,400
You can not believe me if you don't want.

1318
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,080
I don't believe that you just don't.

1319
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,200
I think you got more you're not telling us.

1320
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,040
Well, that's-

1321
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,320
Is there any reason why you're not telling us?

1322
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,880
Honestly, it just popped in my head.

1323
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,080
I thought maybe, did we not already know?

1324
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,920
You know, I might be wrong even, let's just see.

1325
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,920
Let me go check and see, is it red still?

1326
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,840
You guys walk into the evidence locker

1327
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,400
and you see the helmet and it's light is red.

1328
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,120
You see the camera, it's light is red.

1329
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,680
You see the gun, it's light is red.

1330
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,320
And you see the radio and it's light is green.

1331
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,480
Oh!

1332
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,360
Oh!

1333
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,320
Oh!

1334
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,320
Oh!
