1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
What's up my spooky skeletons, it's your bone pappy wolf the dog, and I'm back from the past

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,620
clapping that ass and lapping up trash here on

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,700
694.2 PTBP

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,440
contentions most coherent and easy to follow radio station

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:24,540
But on the off chance you disagree with that objective sentiment. We're dropping a very special

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,520
Recapulation of the entire situation going down here in contention seems like a good time for it

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,160
You know your Wolfie might take a couple notes

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,760
Even though I am a all-seeing all-knowing being and all that this week's howling with wolf is from Sinbad

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,500
Yeah, that Sinbad the mailman and jingle all the way the genie and Shazam

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,680
Wait what for real like the Berenstain Bears thing?

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,600
Fuck

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,520
Okay, what the fuck is going on around here Sinbad wasn't a genie in a movie called Shazam

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,460
How the way Sinbad how the way?

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,560
Zack the wolf what's up? This is Sinbad man understand you having a hard time with the Mandela effect man

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,560
It's not Zack told me Zack Reeves. Got me here with this. He said you having some issues man

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,440
And look I've dealt with the phenomena. It's a real phenomena. They see this a movie Shazam that I never did

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,880
But they didn't do a can we do a part two who knows they might put me in that one

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,780
So you never know, but uh, no, I never did Shazam

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,120
Never I just read the comic books and watched the TV show when I was a kid coming up. So, uh,

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,360
I'm the height. I don't know what kind of Mandela effect you going through

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,960
All I can say is this man if you're going through the Mandela effect man is messing with you mess with your mind

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Not weed CBD

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,800
Not weed less weed more CBD. All right now

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Listen to me

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,840
Sinbad more like sin great. Am I right folks?

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
I hope y'all were laughing because otherwise I'm gonna be crying

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,160

It is kudzu with no backbone

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,920
Unseasonably warm December 1st in a small town called

49
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,760
Contention a thin mist could be seen under the streetlights on an empty

50
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,880
Country road the inside of the contention police department

51
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,960
However was cozy warm and bright at the front desk every morning and every evening

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,920
Drew Andrews sat determined small teeth and big gums showing answering the phone and taking messages

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,760
in the bullpen sat our three PCs or

54
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,600
Protagonist cops though neither of those words seemed to factually describe these player characters

55
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,380
Clark Bishop was the oldest by the book officer dead set on doing his best in this dead-end job

56
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,220
Still living in the house. His parents left him when they died

57
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,060
He had never cooked and he watched Wheel of Fortune every night

58
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,900
Keith Vigna was raised just outside

59
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,660
Contention but soon moved to the city where he trained to become a police officer

60
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:23,540
His stint in the city was short-lived. He's not a bad cop. He's just a bad cop

61
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,540
His pants are too big

62
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,140
John Lee petty more the fourth was one of the few petty Moore's to stay on the right side of the law or at least

63
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,380
The petty Moore version of that his mustache tight pants substance abuse issues and

64
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:46,500
Inability to keep bullets in his clip aligned perfectly with both his family values and love of

65
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,620
Smokey and the bandit on this evening December 1st

66
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,260
Drew Andrews top lip receding gums akimbo received a bevy of calls complaints

67
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,340
Regarding the abundance of howling coming from the dogs in the old neighborhood

68
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,660
This neighborhood west of downtown was home to John Peters Mildred Mitchell Tildi B

69
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,500
Mitchell councilwoman Carrie pages and the boss of the contention police department chief

70
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:22,700
Maggie cook and it just so happened that December 1st this night when everything began was the Chiefs birthday

71
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,880
Drew presented chief cook with a yellow journal

72
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,820
Noting she already had this same notebook in both red and blue

73
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,700
Clark got her the same thing. He got her the year before and every year before that

74
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,860
He's been on the force a box of chocolates

75
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,020
John pulled a bottle of cheap bourbon from his desk

76
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:51,400
It was open and a third of it was gone, but he tried Keith panicked. He didn't realize it was the Chiefs birthday

77
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,500
However, there was a mysterious package wrapped nicely sitting on Drew's desk

78
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Keith claimed it as his gift

79
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,260
But when Maggie cook opened this present and saw its contents

80
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:11,100
She began weeping walked into her office and slammed the door leaving Clark drew and John

81
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,860
staring and bewilderment at the new kid in town Keith vigna

82
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,540
chief Maggie cook distraught and determined left the contention police station without saying a word and

83
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:30,940
The box were three items a single red rose a white hardhat and a black silk bowtie

84
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:39,180
Before they could react drew Andrews received the phone call that set all of the preceding events in motion

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,620
Julie Maxwell reported a dead body at the piston junkyard the chief list

86
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,700
CPD headed out to investigate the scene on the way there

87
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,240
They spotted Julie Maxwell driving chaotically and well above the speed limit back toward town

88
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:02,940
John Lee Pettymore the fourth peeled off to pull her over just in time to see her near fatal car accident

89
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,820
She was thrown clear of the vehicle face smashed

90
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,340
crying out into the night

91
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,600
John called an ambulance and investigated the crash in her car

92
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,200
He found an open bottle of brandy gas cans lighters an unusual

93
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:26,360
Camera with strange glass tubes a red light lit and a green light unlit as well as a Polaroid

94
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,320
That showed the base of a tall building and a group crowding the entrance with fists raised

95
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:42,480
Everything in this picture was lit by torches and some of the people's hands in the building was a slightly shiny pitch black

96
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,200
Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop carried on to the piston junkyard where they found a body

97
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,740
splattered on the ground face first face

98
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,760
Smashed the body was wearing thick hand-stitched clothing and leather boots a small note in the pocket read

99
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,600
We is striking when the land gets darkness

100
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,320
readying torches

101
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,720
Hesitate not

102
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:15,560
Most peculiar however was the skin on this body's back a fresh wound. It was branded with the words

103
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
This is a fool

104
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,920
This corpse was determined to be a woman and the officers called in their fourth musketeer the only other

105
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,460
contention police officer Ray

106
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,080
To take the corpse over to County for testing

107
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,500
They also called the city hospital to check on Julie Maxwell's condition

108
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,620
She had been declared deceased

109
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,580
after some light discussion of smashed faces and blunt force trauma

110
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,680
Clark Bishop headed home to his TV dinner and Wheel of Fortune

111
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,940
Keith Vigna went back to his temporary home hotel motel where his golden retriever bean

112
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:02,100
Waited patiently and John Lee Pettymore the fourth shot some pool by himself at clinkers the local watering hole and daycare

113
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,940
The next day on December 2nd three assignments awaited the three officers

114
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,620
Councilwoman Carrie pages dog was missing and she was distraught

115
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:19,220
The councilwoman suggested Tyler may have been eaten by a person as contention had just seen a rise in

116
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,020
Homelessness Clark printed posters and walk the neighborhood all to no avail

117
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:32,440
Jimmy Sanders an uncle of sorts to John Lee Pettymore called in an oil spill across a country road in the southeast

118
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,460
Sometime around 4 a.m

119
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:41,820
John checked it out found no oil spill and Jimmy admitted he was tripping on mushrooms during the incident

120
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,420
Mildred Mitchell

121
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,700
contentions kooky pothead grandma

122
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,860
Wanted someone to know her neighbor's door was open and this neighbor this John Peters

123
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Hadn't been around in a few days

124
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:01,780
Keith found out she saw a bright flash of light from Peters's place a few nights previous and he's been missing ever since

125
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:08,260
He checked it out and found John's mail overflowing his car in the driveway and his front door

126
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,420
Smashed into the drywall in the house were broken pictures and clear signs that John was a heavy drinker

127
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,140
There was also a trunk in the living room

128
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,440
Burned into the top of this trunk were the words

129
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:29,100
Do not open if you want to live the trunk was empty save some foam padding that held four

130
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,380
specifically shaped items one large to medium and one small

131
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,020
There were betting stubs on John's nightstand. He bet on long shots and mostly lost

132
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,540
John's keychain had his house keys a bottle opener his car keys a few small keys that said

133
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,660
G10

134
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,340
G11 and G12 and a key fob for a rewards program at dirty dog

135
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,380
grooming a pet salon franchise in the city

136
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,060
However, John didn't seem to have a dog

137
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:08,820
According to Drew Andrews John Peters wasn't very interesting though. He did have a long stay in the hospital a couple years ago

138
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,980
After meeting back up the three officers decided to look further into John Peters starting again at his home

139
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:23,140
When they arrived his car was no longer in the driveway and the empty trunk was missing from inside the residence

140
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,800
Mildred Mitchell came by to let them know two people came packed up the trunk into their white Toyota and took off

141
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,640
One in their car and the other in John Peters maroon vehicle

142
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:40,100
The officers headed to chief Maggie cooks house next her cruiser wasn't there. She wasn't there

143
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,340
They hit up clinkers

144
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,620
The only information from Harry clinker was that Keith liked to cut up hot dogs on white bread when he was a kid

145
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,900
continuing this tour of

146
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:57,340
Contention the cops went out to harass Leo piston the owner of the piston junkyard who had a restraining order placed against him by

147
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:03,460
Julie Maxwell 15 years before after Leo was accused of killing Julie's sister Ashley

148
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,780
Clark set up a meeting with Leo and George the piston brothers for the following day

149
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,480
Keith stayed behind to keep a hidden eye on the piston pig farm back at the police station

150
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,860
John found the Chiefs blue notebook full of work appointments and notes

151
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,940
But her red notebook and the newly gifted yellow notebook weren't in her office

152
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:31,100
That's about the time when contention received a chilling phone call the city hospital had fucked up

153
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,100
They heard screaming from inside a drawer in the morgue

154
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:43,020
Julie Maxwell was alive. John Lee pettymore took off for the city hospital to get some answers

155
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,460
Clark came into the office to an equally confusing message from County

156
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,140
Apparently that body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died 200 years ago

157
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,420
But the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday

158
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:08,140
Then Charles a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters came to the station to figure out what was going on

159
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,260
Before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash in the parking lot

160
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:21,680
Out of the piston pig farm Kathy piston shot the encroaching and trespassing Keith vigna in the foot

161
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,120
Recognizing him though

162
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,440
She bandaged his wound and offered her apologies for the incident after Keith claimed to have a warrant

163
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,880
She offered him coffee Keith snooped around her property

164
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:40,880
Failing to find anything of interest until he eventually stowed away on Kathy piston school bus full of homeless people

165
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:49,320
Afraid of being caught though. He bailed out of the emergency hatch in the back further hurting his shot and bandaged foot in

166
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,600
In the parking lot of the city hospital a creepy figure obscured by a black cloak and hood

167
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:05,180
Approached John Lee pettymore the fourth this mysterious man handed John a note written in binary and croaked

168
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Say hello to me

169
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,180
Before softly cackling and disappearing into the rows of parked cars

170
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,140
John texted drew a picture of the binary note to translate and he radioed the only other

171
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:28,420
Contention police officer Tim to do a search for storage facilities and contention with G units

172
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,820
John didn't find Julie Maxwell at the hospital because she dipped stole a black SUV and made a beeline for contention

173
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:43,640
This was of course the same black SUV that just t-boned George Pistons truck in the parking lot of the contention

174
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,420
police station now helmed at gunpoint by a kidnapped Leo

175
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Piston the three officers pursued Julie Maxwell and Leo piston in the stolen black SUV out to splashylvania

176
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:03,200
The abandoned vampire themed waterpark Ashley Maxwell was heading to 15 years ago when her life ended

177
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,380
Bishop pettymore and hobbling vigna found their targets at the top of the two-fanged plunge

178
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Maxwell with a pistol to the back of the kneeling Leo pistons torso

179
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,460
She cried out into the night

180
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:29,580
Except for the black shiny devil and the underground temple from which it shall rise

181
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,080
But if there's a tiny chance that justice matters, then my sister deserves this

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
To bleed out and die

183
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,880
With that she fired a shot through Leo's body

184
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,560
Clark immediately pulled his pistol and put a bullet through one of Julie Maxwell's eyes the two limp

185
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,000
bodies slid slowly down the two opposing slides

186
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:01,920
Wet for the first time in a decade and a half with the blood of these opposing contention residents

187
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
But at the bottom of the ride

188
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,480
Something incomprehensible happened

189
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:15,420
the bodies of Julie Maxwell and Leo piston were picked up and slammed into the ground repeatedly and at an

190
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,320
Absurd rate by some unseen force and then as if they were never there at all

191
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Both bodies were gone

192
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,400
Keith saw

193
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,800
Covering the ground where the two bodies just were a black shiny viscous sludge

194
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:39,520
Seemingly inside this muck were the thrashing bodies of Julie Maxwell and Leo piston their hands reached out

195
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,600
Trying to escape this thing that had them trapped with their limbs soon seemed to fold

196
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,480
Into this ooze becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that began sliding across the ground toward Keith who?

197
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,400
Promptly Wile E. Coyote the fuck out of there

198
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,400
Back in the splashylvania parking lot the strange camera's green light was lit

199
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,980
John took a picture causing a blindingly bright flash of light and he instantly saw black

200
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,480
Viscous goo dripping from the camera all over his hands, and then it was gone

201
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,560
The picture was of a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose

202
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,320
He was bent over head and hands and stocks made of a shiny black material and the word

203
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,520
Fool was branded into his forehead

204
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,460
Clark recognized this man as they're missing John Peters

205
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,360
Drew Andrews texted John back with the translation of the mysterious man's binary message it read

206
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,720
I killed the Chiefs pops John

207
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,120
Before they called it a day Keith went to the clinic and acquired a wheelchair

208
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,640
That night these three contentioned police officers had some strange dreams

209
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
John Lee petty more the fourth

210
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,640
You're reliving the moment when you saw the black sludge on your hands and dripping from the odd camera and picture

211
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:21,400
Your perception changes and you're out of your body looking at yourself staring intently at your own hands

212
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:29,000
You see there's the same viscous muck dripping from your eyes and nostrils

213
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
As you wake up in bed

214
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,460
Keith vigna, you see a woman standing before you in your bedroom

215
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,220
She's wearing old-timey clothing and she stares angrily at you

216
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,980
She lunges toward you picking you up and throwing you into the ground and you fall

217
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,080
Into the floor of your bedroom and then wake up in bed

218
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,200
Clark Bishop

219
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
You see a man underneath you

220
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:04,660
Struggling to breathe as you tighten your grip around his neck you look up after the life leaves his eyes

221
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:11,960
And see an empty dark alleyway as you wake up on the couch with infomercials playing on your TV

222
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,780
The next day was December 3rd

223
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:22,260
The officers broke into g10 g11 and g12 John Peters storage units at a plus storage

224
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:30,440
G10 was filled with crates stacked three high each crate was wooden and stamped US military on the side

225
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,020
Inside these crates were guns ammunition and heavy weaponry

226
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,860
This included pistols shotguns rifles a shoulder-mounted

227
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,460
anti-aircraft weapon an EMP rifle a grappling gun a small gun that shoots tracers

228
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,660
Lots of grenades a sniper rifle a very tiny but very powerful gun and a drone

229
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,980
There was also a pallet on which was sitting a large cube-shaped

230
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,020
Object covered in so much plastic wrap that its contents were obfuscated

231
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,180
The large cube-shaped object was in fact bricks upon bricks of cocaine

232
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,460
precisely

233
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,840
479 bricks of cocaine worth around 12 million dollars John took a brick

234
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,460
Immediately inside g11 was a burlap sack containing

235
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,640
$50,000 in shredded blue dye stained banknotes a piece of notebook paper with poorly drawn

236
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,400
diagrams and nearly illegible writing

237
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,720
225 pound bags of potatoes a ziplock bag

238
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,600
containing five bulbs of garlic a garlic crusher an empty test tube and a syringe a small

239
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,240
drawstring Nike bag a 3 million candlepower

240
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,260
handheld spotlight a well-filled toolbox a black leather backpack

241
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:57,040
containing a set of lock picks wire cutters wire strippers a crimping tool flat and Phillips head screwdrivers and a

242
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:04,640
lockout tool a bottle of caffeine pills a carton of cigarettes three shovels a small digital scale a syringe labeled morphine a

243
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,120
handful of ski masks walkie-talkies and a burned CD labeled

244
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
monster mash mash

245
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,600
Inside g12 was a four-wheeler with dried dirt and clay

246
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,080
Caked all over the thing as well as a couple of plastic trunks near the door was a small chunk of paper that had been

247
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,480
Folded into the size of a business card against the back wall was a small table with some more papers on it

248
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:37,680
The small chunk of paper on the floor was a bedding guide and inside were some more ripped up bedding stubs

249
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
someone lost

250
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,720
$5,000 on October 31st the three names to bet on were Oz mayhem wolf miles

251
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,500
Detonator Carver and Carl blitzkrieg Anderson at the bottom it said

252
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,000
Tonight versus planet juggernaut

253
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:04,540
The stubs were all losers a five-to-one bet then a six-to-one bet then finally a thirty-to-one bet

254
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:11,620
Inside one of the trunks was a box of assorted batteries spools of electrical wiring three

255
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:18,020
disassembled handguns and an impossibly clean machete sitting atop three full suits

256
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,460
Including shirt tie and shoes all covered in dirt clay and black stains

257
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,540
That look to be blood there was a note handwritten on a scrap piece of paper that read

258
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:37,380
The cabin is in the woods stark west from the end of the trail about 2.5 miles

259
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,260
Dash-k we took care of nine of them as well as the leader

260
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,060
There was also a sheet that seemed to be ripped out of a notebook

261
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,700
It was handwritten as well, but in different handwriting and it said

262
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,440
The work is difficult in particular, but I've had 12 successes

263
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,580
Life isn't as complex as they believe they are quite simple

264
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:09,660
It will be their downfall and the last piece of paper was a cutout from the contention Chronicle from 25 years ago an

265
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,100
ad that read Kohl's orphanage new school under modern etiquette

266
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,220
We are here to serve the beautiful community of contention

267
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,260
None of the rogue police officers remembered the name of that orphanage though. The coal name was familiar

268
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,340
Silas Cole was one of the founders of this town and he was the owner of the mine for a couple of years

269
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,540
His wife Mary Cole did a lot of good in the town and the library was named after her

270
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:43,000
The school was called Silas Cole K through 12 and there was a Cole's Creek as well as the three

271
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,720
Approached the other plastic trunk in g12 this one with the lid fastened. The stench was nearly

272
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:57,500
Unbearable it was decided they would wait to open this trunk back at the office after having a u-haul delivered

273
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:05,000
Pettimore Bishop and vigna packed up everything contained in these storage units and brought it all back to the police station

274
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,640
the awfully pungent trunk was clear and

275
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,520
Before opening the lid they could only see a dried black crust which was painted on every bit of the trunk sides

276
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:25,840
When they opened it the rancid smell of old metal hit their nostrils and atop this pile of what looked like a messily

277
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
chopped up human body

278
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,680
Sat a woman's head split down the middle and pulled apart with a small silver sphere

279
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:42,040
Sitting in between the two halves Keith took a picture John pocketed this small silver sphere

280
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,920
Before heading out to the woods drew was tasked with looking into finding information about Cole's

281
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,760
Orphanage and also finding someone who could understand the machinery in the diagram out in the woods the contention

282
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,200
Police officers found a patch of land that had been burned to the ground

283
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:07,120
Realized they were being watched freaked out wrecked the four-wheeler ran into trees and overall just super fucked up

284
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,520
Topped off by Clark flying a drone into himself after their failed nature excursion

285
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:20,940
They went to Julie Maxwell's wore her taxidermy and found a circled the yellow pages ad for dr

286
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:26,260
Marie Jacobs as well as a receipt from Forgotten Treasures a local flea market

287
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:33,300
Aftergotten Treasures they learned that the camera Julie Maxwell purchased was from Mildred Mitchell's booth

288
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,820
But Mildred was unaware of any items recently sold at her booth

289
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,060
She told the boys it must have been her granddaughter till DB who came downstairs at that exact moment

290
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,600
But the sight of cops spooked her and she bolted back upstairs and into her room

291
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,660
When Clark busted until DB Mitchell had a crazed look in her eyes

292
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:57,500
She slammed a large bullet into the chamber and squeezed the trigger on this odd-looking

293
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,960
Revolver there was an almost blinding flash of light

294
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,540
Illuminating everything and then as if she had never been there the girl was gone

295
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,420
Clark just saw an odd gun fall to the floor confused

296
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,620
He checked the closet and under the bed for the missing girl unsurprisingly with no luck

297
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,540
The very anti

298
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,980
antiheroes of this story then went to Forgotten Treasures to ask more questions and they

299
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:33,300
Eventually bullied the nice lady there until she put her own life in danger by telling these cops about the drunk man who threatened her

300
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:39,700
They left after they got what they wanted and the white Toyota they had been searching for was right outside

301
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:47,600
It peeled out onto the road after a short dangerous pursuit. The white Toyota was bested tireless and boxed in

302
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,100
Bullets were whizzing past him. So Keith Vigna attempted to fire a warning shot with his shotgun

303
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,420
However, this warning shot promptly killed the driver Charles Donovan

304
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:06,320
John Lee Pettymore fired shots into the air to disperse the growing crowd and a few stray bullets also hit Clark's tires

305
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,580
Inside the white Toyota they found two guns a wallet with ID for Billy Harrison a

306
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,180
Rifle and keys with a Dodge logo on the deceased man's person

307
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:25,020
They found ID from the city for Charles Donovan and a piece of paper with the addresses of both

308
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,260
John Peters's house and the piston pig farm

309
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,460
The keys in the ignition included a key to a room at Hotel Motel and a key fob for the rewards

310
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:42,380
Program at dirty dog grooming the dead driver's body had scratches all over the arm's hand

311
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,900
Legs and face they were not claw marks

312
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:54,020
They were not from brush John recognized these scratches as the pattern of human hands and the trunk was a

313
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,900
Tied-up and unconscious man who matched the picture in the ID for Billy Harrison

314
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,740
Additionally, there was a police uniform a set of scrubs in a black suit in these clothes

315
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,860
They found a contention badge for an officer

316
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,900
Kissel an ID in the scrubs that said dr

317
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:18,840
Zebrowski and inside a pocket of the black suit or FBI credentials for an agent parks

318
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,940
They called an ambulance and Keith asked the medics to look at his foot first

319
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:31,080
Still worried about his recovery Keith took the ambulance to the contention clinic with the unconscious bald man

320
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,140
Clark's final words to Keith before the ambulance doors shut

321
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
Keep him cuffed

322
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,060
Officers Bishop and petty more headed to the suburbs to chat with dr

323
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:47,740
Marie Jacobs when they saw an unkempt man James the mill worker in rubber waders

324
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,460
Frantically vacuuming his lawn from across the street two children stared

325
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,380
unblinking

326
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,140
Horrified as the unkempt James began to float up into the air

327
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:07,060
Clark and John each grabbed a leg but the man continued to rise John called the two kids into action one holding

328
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:13,620
Desperately onto the vacuum as the other sucked up this unknown substance with the hose their plans seemed to work

329
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:19,340
All feet were now grounded in this oily sludge poured itself away down into the sewage drain

330
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,180
but then the vacuum

331
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,660
exploded engulfing the twin children in its contents this viscous ichor

332
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,260
As the fourth graders folded into the writhing mass

333
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:38,540
James the mill worker lost his shit and wriggled free from Clark's helping grasp turned restraint

334
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,660
when John pulled up next to the on-the-run unkempt man in rubber waders James looked the

335
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,380
mustachioed copper in the face and then broke

336
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:56,780
Completely the mill worker sprinted back home on the same street leaving Clark Bishop and John Lee petty more the fourth right outside their initial

337
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,360
destination the home of dr. Marie Jacobs

338
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,560
At the contention clinic Billy Harrison finally woke up

339
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,120
He had a concussion and had been unconscious for some time

340
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,400
Cuffed to the bed with officer Keith Vigna asking him a bunch of questions Billy answered slowly

341
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,660
He didn't remember some things. He was 31 years old. He remembered going to John Peters's house

342
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:26,560
John John was an old friend who hadn't responded to his messages or answered the phone in a couple days

343
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,460
They played video games together Billy remembered looking in the window and John didn't answer the door

344
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:40,100
Billy didn't know a Charles Donovan Keith told Billy he was tied up in the back of this Charles person's car

345
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,840
Billy said he drove a white van to John's house earlier that day Billy said he's on leave from the army

346
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,780
Billy said he doesn't know any dog groomers

347
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,560
Then Billy asked to be uncuffed since he was the victim of a crime

348
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,320
Now do you think Keith Vigna a

349
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
reacted rationally or

350
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,800
B

351
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:09,840
Escalated the situation became hostile and tried to handcuff Billy's other hand if you answered B

352
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Congratulations, that's exactly right

353
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,080
And because it's Keith Vigna when he went to handcuff Billy's free hand the one-handed concussed

354
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,320
Probable victim of kidnapping got the drop on the officer pulled Keith's gun from its holster and threatened to shoot

355
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,620
Keith understood in this moment that Billy was willing to pull the trigger and so Keith surrendered

356
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:39,780
Officer beans unlocked Billy Harrison's handcuff and turned around which allowed the bald fit man to not Keith the fuck out

357
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,760
Back in the suburbs Clark Bishop and John Lee petty more the fourth had a rough go trying to get any information from dr

358
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,720
Marie Jacobs who did not want to open the front door

359
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,400
She asked if they had a warrant Clark remembering she bought the radio asked about it

360
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,700
And she told them the radio wasn't even there anymore

361
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,840
Apparently a tall drunk man came and took it by force

362
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,080
With a gun John decided they had reasonable suspicion for search and seizure

363
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,500
So he knocked down the door gun

364
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,840
Obviously drawn the Jacobs house was a wreck and there was a haze in the air

365
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,880
Clark and John could hear Marie talking down in the basement in this mad

366
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Scientists house there was something covering every piece of counter space jars and beakers were sitting everywhere

367
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
It smelled absolutely

368
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
terrible kind of like shit

369
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,880
John found a litter box, but the fecal matter inside looked

370
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,840
Human

371
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,000
This was the moment John decided dr

372
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,800
Jacobs was for sure a witch Clark and John heard a man's voice meow in the basement

373
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,560
Quite the sight in comparison to her usual state. Dr. Jacobs had mascara all over her face and was wearing white coveralls and

374
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,720
neoprene gloves

375
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:04,760
After making eye contact with John for the first time the incredulous and crazed doctor invited him to join her in the kitchen

376
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:11,720
John and Clark having seen enough arrested and handcuffed dr. Marie Jacobs, but then she hollered

377
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
she hollered

378
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,640
And a glumping sound could be heard of something or someone

379
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:28,240
Bounding up the stairs on the evening of December 3rd officer Keith Vigna

380
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,300
Woke up wearing a thin gown with both of his wrists

381
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,920
Handcuffed to the sides of the hospital bed where Billy Harrison was recently confined

382
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,480
Keith's uniform Keith's gear and Billy Harrison were nowhere to be seen

383
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,080
However, the door to this room was now open and a decent amount of the clinic staff was standing around just outside

384
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,240
Some of them were pointing their phones at Keith

385
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,200
All of them were laughing a few phrases murmured loud enough to make out included

386
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,040
No wonder William was so embarrassed by him and oh isn't that Keith beans?

387
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,080
What's he calling himself now when they actually noticed Keith waking up

388
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,040
They awkwardly shuffled away and a young woman came into the room with bolt cutters and broke the links on the cuffs leaving officer Keith

389
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,720
Vigna with a pair of nice iron bracelets after collecting himself Keith checked the security footage and

390
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,880
Watched Billy Harrison walk right out the front door wearing his uniform

391
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,680
Back in the suburbs John had handcuffed. Dr

392
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,520
Marie Jacobs and something was running up the stairs that something was a bloody man wearing only

393
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,680
Briefs and a collar and he galloped up the stairs on all fours before tackling Clark into the ground

394
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,260
John kicked the man off Clark who recognized. Dr.

395
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:53,240
Marie Jacobs's husband Doug Jacobs from the family portraits around the house that included the couple and their black cat Salem

396
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:00,920
After they handcuffed Doug John asked dr. Jacobs why her husband is a cat man named Salem and Marie was like

397
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Oh, so, you know

398
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:09,420
When asked why the officers arrived John said it was illegal to have a cat in a man's body. Dr

399
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,420
Jacobs argued there were no laws

400
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,480
Disallowing this sort of activity and preferring the current situation. She asked the cops to leave her be they claimed they just wanted information

401
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,360
So she told them she believed the radio did it the radio she purchased at Forgotten Treasures the officers wanted the radio

402
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,180
But like she said it was stolen a tall drunk man broke in punched poor Salem in the face and stole the radio

403
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,680
With coercion and a cat toy Clark and John got dr

404
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,960
Marie Jacobs and the cat Salem and the body of Doug Jacobs into the back of their police cruiser took them into the station

405
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:51,860
Made a human-sized cat bed in one of the cells and locked up the pair in the only cell not full of contraband from John

406
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,480
Peters's units at a plus storage

407
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:02,440
John went to pick Keith up at the clinic and found him standing outside in a hospital gown wearing handcuffs with the chain cut

408
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,240
Back at the station Clark forced drew to come to terms with Doug Jacobs being a cat man

409
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,320
After everyone reconvene drew had a word with John alone

410
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,800
Apparently Lauren the fourth and only other member of the contingent police department was

411
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,440
Confused about the amount of blood and gore at splashylvania

412
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,000
Drew said he told her a deer fell off a water slide and

413
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,880
Then he asked if it had something to do with all the cocaine locked up in the jail cell

414
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,840
He continued figuring John might be interested in unloading the whole pallet for around

415
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,260
Ten million dollars drew had a contact in the city called the Duke

416
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,860
They walked back in to talk to Clark and Keith and John said he had good news

417
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,040
Drew had fixed the four-wheeler

418
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,120
Following the lead of the room key from Hotel Motel found in Charles Donovan's possession

419
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,760
The three officers busted into the deceased man's room at Hotel Motel

420
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,080
guns drawn and without a warrant

421
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,800
There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character the Fonz

422
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:21,120
This woman we now know as Rosemary flinged a knife at officer Vigna and hid on the other side of the bed

423
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,380
Keith ran up and engaged her in hand-to-hand combat which resulted in a hostage situation

424
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,060
Knife to his throat officer Vigna proceeded to brag about killing her coworker

425
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:41,300
Thankfully for his throat though the level-headed and highly persuasive officer Bishop managed to keep Rosemary from killing him there on the spot

426
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,340
By getting her talking Clark asked if she knew Charles they had worked together

427
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:53,060
Rosemary laughed and asked if they know who they're fucking with because they were fucking with Marvin Glass

428
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,020
the mob kingpin in the city

429
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,940
When asked about the radio she thought maybe the thing in the bathroom was a radio

430
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Charles had brought it back but more importantly

431
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:11,980
Marvin sent them there to find out what happened to Jermaine Glass and Alfred Glass when they came to collect money from John Peters

432
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:20,180
Only Alfred came back, but he came back a blubbering idiot. He wouldn't shut up about some gun. He sounded like a lunatic

433
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:28,380
The wiry old lady made a run for it and leapt over the railing and into the Hotel Motel parking lot all three officers

434
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,480
Unloaded their weapons from the second floor corridor bringing her down

435
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,060
Barely before she could get into her vehicle

436
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:43,580
The boys in blue patched her up called an ambulance and sent her to the city hospital with Lauren the fourth and only other

437
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:51,640
Contention police officer with that they planned a sting operation based around a false radio call to catch Billy

438
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,520
Harrison the stranger running around contention in an official police uniform

439
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,040
They figured he like everyone else wanted John Peters

440
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,760
Unfortunately for the CPD the FBI was watching and also wanted to talk to John Peters

441
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:15,960
Strangely though agents Kennedy and McKinley a young woman with an erratic accent and an old man with empty eyes

442
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,760
Were in town looking for a black Nike bag with nothing in it

443
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,880
They thought John Peters would know where this bag was

444
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,240
They were correct in this line of thinking as there was indeed a black Nike bag in unit

445
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,360
G11 at a plus storage to which John Peters held the key

446
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:41,080
After some verbal dancing the federal agents agreed to meet the contention squad the following morning

447
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:48,160
December 4th at the police department when the officers met back up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures

448
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,120
Drew was uncommonly not at his desk

449
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
Replaced instead by a note telling them he went to the chief's house

450
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,160
officers Bishop and Pettymore hauled off the

451
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,520
Undocumented loot to their individual residences while Keith went to the chief's house to check on drew in the entrance of chief

452
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,060
Maggie cooks home Keith found two

453
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:16,280
Unconscious men drew Andrews and an unknown with ID for a Harold Dorsey from the city in the living room

454
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,480
He saw chief Maggie cooks body in full uniform

455
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:27,280
Slumped against the wall a large chef's knife rested in her left hand her face had been stabbed

456
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,960
Repeatedly and her left foot was missing

457
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,720
That's when he noticed the smell

458
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,120
gasoline and natural gas in the kitchen an

459
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,520
unkempt man was at the table hunched over with a fork in one hand and a pistol in the other a

460
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:50,520
Bullet hole in his head had left him face down in a plate of meat his left foot was also missing

461
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,480
Gas cans sat all over the place and the contents had clearly been poured on

462
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:03,360
Everything the range had all four burners turned all the way up and a skillet sat atop

463
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,500
Inside were the leftovers of two feet that had the meat pulled from them

464
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,940
He threw up and fell to his hands and knees his hand hit a wire

465
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,220
He heard a click and saw a fire near the front door and a path of gasoline

466
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:27,580
Heading back toward the kitchen with just enough time to save one person Keith dragged drew Andrews out the front door as the entire

467
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,620
house

468
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:34,420
Exploded knocking Keith into the front yard and rendering him unconscious

469
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,180
Keith

470
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,540
Standing in your childhood home

471
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,980
It's your birthday

472
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,660
And your friends are standing around this table waiting for you to blow out the candles on your cake

473
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,500
You look up and see your parents in the corner talking to your little brother

474
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:58,300
You squeeze your eyes tightly as you blow out your candles and as you do you see that black shiny viscous sludge

475
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:06,080
Inside this muck are two thrashing bodies their hands reach out trying to escape this thing that has trapped them

476
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:14,140
But the struggle does not last long their limbs seem to fold into this ooze becoming one with the sentient mass of goop

477
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,240
That is now sliding across the ground toward you opening your eyes

478
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,120
You see all of your peers around your childhood kitchen table laughing at you

479
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:30,520
The candles are still lit you look up your parents are poorly attempting to hold back laughter. You look at the cake

480
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,240
It's gone

481
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,560
You have a plate that is clean and you look around and see everyone else is eating a piece of cake

482
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,620
They're all laughing and begin to chant while pointing at you beans beans Keith beans his only friends are

483
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,000
figurines beans beans keys beans will blow your friends to smithereens

484
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,640
Your parents look at you

485
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,960
Disgusted and turn and walk out of the room you run to follow them

486
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,440
But looking ahead you only see that woman dressed in old-timey clothing looking down you fall

487
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,640
Fall into a black hole in the ground and you're standing in a cold

488
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:15,380
Dark room the lights begin to flicker on and you see massive tanks the size of grain silos

489
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,780
Standing right before you is yourself. You walk up to you the face of the other you begins to age

490
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:31,100
Rapidly and then just as rapidly ages in reverse you walk up to one of the massive tanks in this dank dimly lit room

491
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,680
You press your face against it to see its contents and something

492
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:42,140
Creeps toward you and as it's about to come into focus you wake up to the sound of sirens

493
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:48,820
officers Bishop and petty more were soon called to the Chiefs house after it had exploded leaving behind

494
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:56,580
The burned bodies of Harold Dorsey chief Maggie cook and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head

495
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,540
And his face in a pile of foot meat that man

496
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:06,240
We now know was James the mill worker the three cops decided they needed to go to dr

497
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,780
Millar the dentist and contention to verify and match the dental records of the three deceased folks

498
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:20,040
Clark looked in the Chiefs car and it was clean the glove box was empty the dashcam been unplugged

499
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:27,700
Clark checked the GPS history chief Maggie Cook's cruiser had been at the mill on the other side of the city

500
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,340
since the evening of December 1st

501
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,380
That night the strange dreams

502
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,780
continued John Lee petty more the fourth

503
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,540
The sky is dark

504
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,460
But the ground begins to give light to the world

505
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:50,060
You see a man in the distance with his head and hands and stocks that sit on an inky black

506
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:58,380
Stage as you walk toward this man the ground becomes wider and wider like a screens brightness level being gradually turned up

507
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:03,740
You hear a holler from behind you and when you turn around you see your mother she looks

508
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,100
She looks like she did when she was about your age and she's crying

509
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:15,220
She looks past you and the door appears in between you but you can hear her say I'm so sorry

510
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:21,620
He's just so beautiful. You don't have to do this. We can leave we can run

511
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:28,780
The door floats up into the sky and sitting behind it is that trunk you locked up in the police department with the woman

512
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,940
split head atop the black

513
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,540
Putrid hacked-up

514
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,860
Anatomy you turn around and you're face to face with a man in the stocks

515
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:42,220
John Peters his forehead burned and peeling with the word fool

516
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,380
Desperate his eyes widen and he whispers, please

517
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,140
It's coming

518
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:55,260
They are playing the roles of greater men. You have to save everyone

519
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,140
It is coming

520
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,940
You

521
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,460
Clark Bishop

522
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,180
You're walking through a parking lot you look down

523
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:14,580
You see you're carrying a piece of old parchments rolled up with a neat little string tied tightly around it

524
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,460
Looking up you hand it to the cashier at your local grocery store. You like this guy

525
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,260
Starting to scan the scroll, but it's not beeping. He looks at you and chuckles

526
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,700
This is going to cost you greatly

527
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,700
as you walk out of the grocery store you step into the sanctuary of a church during a funeral a

528
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:40,060
young boy with an enormous forehead in the darkest eyes you've ever seen is walking up to you and tears are

529
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:46,660
streaming down his face as he stares into your eyes you hear a small voice inside you that says

530
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:53,700
Please sir as the crying boy holds out his hands as you hand the scroll to the young boy

531
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,620
You begin to hear cries throughout the sanctuary

532
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,440
You're standing in as you look around the congregation is trying to run away

533
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,380
But they're melting into the floor you look down and you two are melting into the floor when you look up

534
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:12,100
The boy has been replaced by Tildi B Mitchell who looks down at you with her finger pointed at you like a gun

535
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:18,740
She disappears and reappears over and over again as you slowly sink into the floor as your eyes

536
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,940
Look to the ceiling of the chapel you hear a voice

537
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,580
Inside you say let go as you wake up in bed

538
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,620
John awoke to a text from Drew Andrews it reads

539
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:39,700
Clark came by last night when no one was at the station. He warned me not to go to the cheese house

540
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:46,320
He was limping, but he wasn't limping later. What is going on and where is all the cake?

541
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,920
There was also a text from Keith explicitly asking John for drugs

542
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:58,220
He rolled out of bed bagged up some coke and headed into the police station for work and a meeting with the FBI

543
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,420
Without a reply from officer petty more confirming he would bring some of the cocaine officer vigna

544
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,400
Drove up and broke into John Lee petty Moore's house to find it. This was cocaine

545
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,040
They stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of a missing person

546
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,520
At the station a news report played over the radio a

547
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,300
Fire at the city hospital had claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals

548
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,560
The names of the deceased are not being released yet more importantly to the officers

549
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,680
However was the decision of what to order for breakfast

550
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,160
Finally deciding on bishops big bean breakfast from beans on beans

551
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,040
Drew remembered that two children were reported missing from the suburbs

552
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,160
Aiden and Alice little John and Clark shot each other

553
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,440
Glance and then John changed the subject to the matter of a second Clark Bishop

554
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,760
Drew explained what happened on his end Clark came in around 1 a.m

555
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:03,260
Limping wearing a hoodie and jeans and told drew not to go to chief Maggie Cook's house

556
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,180
But Clark was attempting the sting operation with John and Keith at 1 a.m

557
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,500
The security footage showed Clark Bishop limping in and out the door in street clothes

558
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:19,720
So they decided moving forward. They would use a code word to assure each other

559
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,740
They were each dealing with the real version of themselves that code word

560
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,620
bubble gum tree as Keith vigna pulled back into the parking lot with breakfast a blacked-out SUV

561
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:38,780
Parked in agents Kennedy and McKinley hopped out from the passenger and back seats and headed in

562
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,220
Keith grabbed the food and Nike bag and followed them into the police station

563
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:50,860
Agent McKinley the old dead-eyed man scanned the office saw John started freaking out turning and sprinting away

564
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,980
Passing Keith as he ran back out into the lot

565
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:59,460
Agent Kennedy apologized for him saying their last mission went poorly and he's lost it a bit

566
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:07,500
Agent Kennedy also said she's from Minnesota with a weird Irish accent. The officers said they wanted answers

567
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,620
She promised to give information

568
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,700
After she put something in that bag

569
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,900
John asked if it was something strange

570
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,000
Yes

571
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,820
Agent Kennedy pulled out a small lockbox two inches by two inches with a combination lock on it

572
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,540
Inside was a small metal sphere with a diameter of one inch

573
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,780
She dropped the sphere into the bag and immediately breathed a sigh of relief

574
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,380
Clark looked into the bag

575
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,540
Nothing. He asked about the ball

576
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,820
She said it's why agent McKinley is so unintelligible now

577
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:50,020
So John called agent Kennedy to the back of the station to look at their cat man when she was more intrigued than confused

578
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:57,260
John freaked out and told the agent that there's a weird gun and a weird radio and a weird camera and the weird radio made

579
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:02,780
That guy into a cat man. Plus there's oil all over the place agent Kennedy side

580
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,480
She guessed that meant that they were in

581
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,540
She'd be right back

582
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,620
She walked out of the station

583
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,780
And walked back in with Billy Harrison

584
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,500
Billy Harrison

585
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
the bald fit man

586
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,180
Holding Keith's gun and belt atop his nicely folded uniform

587
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,460
Keith grabbed his shit and walked back to his desk and Billy said he hoped Keith was feeling better

588
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:36,260
Agent Kennedy dropped the bad accent and told Harrison all three officers had seen a lot of shit

589
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,460
She knew he wanted to get home. So maybe they should just leave the number and the bag and bail

590
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,580
He nodded Kennedy turned to the three cops and drew Andrews

591
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,620
You're completely fucked

592
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:56,300
Luckily for you all though. I'm gonna leave this bag here with you anything you put in it disappears. That's all we know about it

593
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,740
It's a myth even within this community who have seen the unnatural at work

594
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:06,160
But we have seen today all of us here that agent Victor's Nike bag is real

595
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:14,460
Guys, the world does not work the way we all grew up knowing it to be you're all charged now with understanding that

596
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,500
That understanding of the world will cause your lies to crumble

597
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:26,660
But the thing that keeps us going is that daily we are saving the human race from being wiped out of existence

598
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:32,420
I'm gonna leave this here with you all and you'll be given a secure location to drop it when the job is done

599
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,140
Your job is to stop the incursion

600
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:42,020
Minimize exposure save lives and cover the whole thing up to save others from being exposed

601
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,140
We're gonna give you the same information that all newcomers game which is a phone number

602
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:53,360
You give them a call when the situation is taken care of or if things get completely out of hand or they'll call in

603
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,260
48 hours if you don't

604
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,260
Good luck

605
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:02,620
Let's go back now to the past to a young Clark Bishop in his childhood home

606
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:10,520
The same home he lives in now back then the plastic was on the couch. There were angel wings and pictures of Jesus

607
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,340
Clark is playing in the living room

608
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,680
His parents are in the kitchen cooking and Wheel of Fortune is on like always in the background

609
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:24,080
Clark's mom pulls him close to repeat her go-to motto life is like the bonus round

610
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:29,880
We were already given the best letters and then she sends little Clark off to see mr

611
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,820
Gerald fingers in at the Mary Cole library contentions public book depository

612
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:41,500
With lemon poppy seed muffins in hand the library smells musty it's rarely used by the community

613
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:47,500
Gary Daly owner and operator of the daily fuzz having a loud conversation with mr.

614
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:55,540
Fingers and about occult books and currently open in front of him is the true and horrifying confessions of the st. Osseith witches

615
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:04,220
Clark presents the poppy seed muffins and fingers and puts the baked goods with the other batches due to his gluten intolerance

616
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,820
the phone rings

617
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,260
Gerald answers

618
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:20,220
Gerald says it was for Clark. He says the voice on the other line said that Clark has the best letters

619
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,020
the voice sounded panicked and

620
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,820
screamed a little

621
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,940
Outside the sky turns dark

622
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,100
The immediate lack of sunlight is noticed inside the Mary Cole library

623
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:40,460
Strange forms of tall gaunt men begin moving around outside the library a

624
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:48,320
Figure in the darkness wearing a cloak is locking the doors of the library from the outside with a massive chain

625
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:52,300
He turns and runs and out of one of the windows

626
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:57,940
You see a massive flash of light a gigantic shadow moves out of frame

627
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:03,780
It's an enormous but thin man in a black suit sprinting away from the cloaked figure

628
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:11,140
Drawed opens a window light comes back into the world and everything seems as it once was

629
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:18,500
Clark looks at mr. Daly who's staring at his book Gary looks up and asks if there was a big cloud mr.

630
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:25,380
Fingers and thinks the occult books must have something to do with this so Daly reads aloud what he'd been reading when it went dark

631
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,660
And

632
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,020
Casting her eyes aside

633
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:35,740
She saw a spirit lift up a cloth line over a pot looking much like a ferret and it being asked of this

634
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,700
Examine it why the spirit did look upon her

635
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,900
She said it was hungry this

636
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:48,220
Examine it being asked how she knew the names of mother Bennett spirits say if the Tiffin her spirit did tell this

637
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:55,180
Examine it that she had two spirits the one of them like a black dog and the other red like a lion and that their

638
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:01,020
Names were sucking and layered and sayeth that sucking did plague by its wife on to death and the other

639
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,780
Plagued three of his beasts where of two of them died

640
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:11,220
But before he could finish the three decide to not speak of this again when Clark arrives home

641
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:17,500
When he turns the corner his mind can't quite handle what it's seeing and it begins to fragment

642
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,940
One scene then another first he sees his house in perfect condition

643
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:27,940
His consciousness changes channels and he sees police officers everywhere it flips again

644
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:32,380
Everything's normal it flips again and two black sedans are outside the house

645
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:37,340
Flips again. Everything's normal as he walks into the house. There's a flash

646
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,940
He sees his parents have been lifted off the ground and are half

647
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:49,340
Inside the walls of the home their faces are frozen and cold and white with the lack of blood it flips again

648
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,100
Everything looks normal

649
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,940
But he hears voices it flips he sees people someone says yeah

650
00:57:54,940 --> 00:58:00,100
We well we couldn't find the artifact and we had to get the fuck out of there cuz Karen did her goddamn

651
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:06,500
Magic trick again, and then everything is normal. Then he hears whispers. Then he sees a man wearing a suit

652
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:14,020
Oh shit, it's a fucking kid man Clark is sitting in a courtroom in contention and he's trying to think back on that day

653
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:18,520
But he can't remember anything except for how normal it all was

654
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,420
How his house just looked normal

655
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,660
But empty it just weren't there anymore

656
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,300
But here there's a woman

657
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:35,340
She's on trial. She's being convicted right now for the death of Clark's parents. Her name is Anne love

658
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:43,540
She's cold and vacant, but she's always smiling and her asymmetrical bangs cover one of her eyes

659
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,940
on the stand she says

660
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,880
Yes, I did it and I'd do it again

661
00:58:53,860 --> 00:59:01,800
Back in current times the officers went to the Daily Fuh after Gary Daly called in to report information about the Chiefs disappearance

662
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:08,260
Gary Daly was the longtime partner of Harry Klinker and the owner operator of the Daily Fuh a

663
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,780
Contention staple that had been around for generations

664
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,580
Gary Daly was an older man

665
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:21,560
He wore jeans cuffed halfway up his calves and a nice short sleeve button-down with tiny cartoon bean sprouts printed all over it

666
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:28,300
He asked if the officers remembered when he would help watch them down at Klinker's when they were but wee little fellas and

667
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,980
Invited them back to his office some of the art hanging in the walls of the Daily Fuh

668
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,980
However caught the boys attention

669
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:41,140
One was a circle with a star inside of it inside that star was another star and there were a couple

670
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:47,540
Triangles curved lines and tiny circles as well a fun take on the chaoticness of the universe

671
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:54,200
Another was a tree branch with three twigs growing on one side and two twigs growing on the other

672
00:59:54,540 --> 01:00:01,540
It was in a bunch of old texts that Gary had seen at different museums and libraries from various cultures and eras

673
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:05,780
Another print was a black circle with six black dots

674
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:12,900
Surrounding it an ancient sign for a group that might have existed called the circle of knowledge

675
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,220
They tried to keep the world together

676
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:21,980
The last was a wonky question mark with two additional lines one curved and one straight

677
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,780
jutting down from the question marks dot a

678
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,340
symbol of a land unknown

679
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:36,360
Anyway, Gary had heard Harold Dorsey was in town and wanted a blog post at what's behind Dorsey dot blogspot.com written about the

680
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,500
Daily Fuh

681
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,500
So he was kind of sort of stalking Harold Dorsey

682
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:46,740
He followed Dorsey to the Chiefs house and saw a guy holding the chief and James at gunpoint

683
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:53,340
The guy with the gun was overweight wearing all black and had a big scar over his right eye

684
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:58,820
James was wearing rubber waders and the chief seemed off

685
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:03,740
She didn't stand up straight the way chief cook would in the phone book

686
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:11,440
They found an address for James Keith remembered the hunched over unkempt guy at the Chiefs house was wearing rubber

687
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,260
waders John

688
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:19,500
Remembered the unkempt man with the vacuum was wearing rubber waders and the address for James matched

689
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,900
Just down the street from dr. Marie Jacobs house

690
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:31,620
Let's go once again into the past to a young John Lee Pettymore the fourth just after the moment that ended his sprint car

691
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,520
racing career

692
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,980
John Lee Pettymore the fourth and Don D Pettymore John's dad's cousin

693
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:44,580
Are sitting in the back of an ambulance and the EMT is checking out John. She tells the young Pettymore

694
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,700
There's just no way he'll ever race again

695
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:53,460
Don grabs John's face and tells him he's got to give up on this dream now and they hug

696
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:57,540
Don pushes John in a wheelchair out to the parking lot

697
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:01,560
But from the rear Don sees two figures begin approaching

698
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,700
They're both extremely tall with large gaunt frames

699
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:11,880
They begin walking faster and faster toward the two Don starts running with the wheelchair

700
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:18,720
But the two figures are catching up there's no one else around they're both wearing black suits and their skin is weirdly

701
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,640
Translucent one of them starts screaming John hollers get at the fanciest men

702
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:30,520
He's ever seen and the Pettymore boys make it to the parking lot just in time to see their car

703
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:37,280
Now being flipped over by large Eddie and his pit crew John yells at large Eddie and large Eddie

704
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,700
Approaches the two petty Moore's Eddie swings

705
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,480
Don catches large Eddie's hand

706
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,120
Mudders under his breath and large Eddie's hand starts sizzling like a country fried steak on a Sunday morning

707
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:58,240
Smoke starts coming out of there Eddie screams Don holds on before dropping it and hitting him once more in the face

708
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,760
Eddie runs off hollering

709
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:05,320
Don helps the concussed John Lee Pettymore the fourth into their car

710
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:14,160
Back in the current timeline the officers went to the first Church of Contingent on the way there

711
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,120
They noticed a strange occurrence the creek though

712
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:24,560
It was a chilly December day was filled to the brim with animals of all sorts dogs cats possums

713
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:32,680
Raccoons town creatures of all kinds the FCC was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it made by the pastor's wife and children

714
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,920
And served by the youth group

715
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:42,840
Keith vigna impatient and rude broke into pastor Adam Kane's office and stole the old motorcycle helmet from off his desk

716
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:50,260
The helmet had some tubes on either side with one green and one red light and the red light was lit

717
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:50,980
But hey

718
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:57,540
It turns out maybe Keith is a monster to be around because his dad was a dick who clearly preferred Keith's older brother Ferguson

719
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,300
Way back when they were children while playing on their family's sprawling estate

720
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:09,820
Keith and Ferguson heard the alarm sirens blaring as strange gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky

721
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:18,300
However, they were promptly shot down by the beans security personnel that night William being sat the boys down and told them

722
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:24,020
What happened is exactly why they have security and he added the most important thing is

723
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:30,100
Ferguson safety William took Ferguson to his workshop leaving Keith to hide an eavesdrop

724
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:33,640
That's when he told Ferguson why he was so important

725
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,100
He said he didn't know how much longer he'd be around

726
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:42,980
He had hoped that he would be the one to fulfill the prophecy, but it is not him. It is Ferguson

727
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:47,740
Ferguson is the anointed when the time is right

728
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:54,100
he must go back and save the world and with that he handed Ferguson a watch and

729
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,780
Promised that it would fit when the time was right

730
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:07,500
Back in whatever year it is now the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station and locked it up in the evidence room

731
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:14,300
Along with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures the gun camera and radio all in separate lockers

732
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:19,260
They were all showing a red light except for the camera green light lit

733
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,320
Outside the station John took a picture of Keith with this glass

734
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:31,440
Two-blind camera and there was a massive flash of bright light and an inky black substance was all over John's hands and

735
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:38,560
Dripping down from the camera and the picture it was pooling on the ground and they could swear it was moving

736
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,620
Then they blinked and the substance was gone

737
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:47,400
John's hands were clean and he was just holding this odd device and even odder

738
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:54,800
Picture the camera's light was red again and the picture showed two men in a room made of darkness

739
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,760
They could barely make out the two figures in the picture

740
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:03,240
Thanks to the light from a small candle also made out of a substance without color

741
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,040
The candle was sitting on a table made of the same

742
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,240
unbelievably black texture of the two men one was a slender muscular man in a black t-shirt

743
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:18,840
Revealing tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down his hands to his fingertips

744
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:24,840
He was kneeling before the other man who looked like a no bullshit actual cowboy

745
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,600
This man this cowboy seemed to be looking into the camera

746
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:34,520
Holding his hand up to block his face from the cameras flash and sight on

747
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:41,480
their way to the mill on the other side of the city the officers drove on a bridge over a creek and there were loads

748
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,360
Of animals in the water at this part of the creek as well

749
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:51,200
John threw his lights on to get ahead of Clark and as he passed he saw the sky ahead begin to swirl

750
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:57,240
About 30 feet above the ground a flat oval began to form the sky around it

751
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:02,040
Spiraled like cloth making folds as it gathered and bunched in places

752
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:07,680
The oval was black but this technicolor energy was erupting from its darkness

753
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:14,600
And then just as swiftly the sky was just as it was but something was falling

754
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:21,940
Suddenly the windshield of John's vehicle shattered and tiny shards of glass covered everything

755
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:30,360
Slumped across officer petty Moore's dashboard was the lifeless body of a grown man and blood was splattered

756
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:34,680
Everywhere he lost control of the vehicle and swerved into oncoming traffic

757
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:42,040
Hearing the sound of a horn blaring as it roared closer and closer before the cruiser jerked to a stop

758
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,440
all three officers saw the flash of a car fly by and then they heard a

759
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,640
deafening crash and the rumble of fire in

760
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,520
the chaos it was hard to understand what all had happened a

761
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,660
minivan was run off the road by officer petty Moore the former teen sprint car racer who was banned from the circuit after an

762
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,380
accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized

763
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,860
Officer Bishop slammed into the back of petty Moore's cruiser and there was fluid leaking

764
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:20,120
Everywhere the minivan that narrowly avoided the head-on collision with John it flipped and caught fire

765
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:28,560
Petty Moore worked diligently to keep the two police cruisers from exploding which likely would have killed officer vigna who couldn't handle the

766
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,660
situation and fell unconscious

767
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:36,260
Thrust into the memories of a particularly traumatic childhood Christmas

768
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:42,980
Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage of the minivan, but it might have already been too late

769
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:50,700
Before he could go back to save the woman trapped behind the wheel as well as the other passenger the minivan combusted

770
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,700
Looking at the body on John's windshield

771
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,420
They'd finally found their missing John Peters

772
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:08,180
Just hadn't expected him to fall out of the sky the balding man with large eyes and a small nose was wearing a pair of

773
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,260
Jeans and a button-down shirt and on his forehead

774
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:15,100
Recently branded into the skin was the word

775
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,420
fool

776
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:25,120
The ambulance arrived and firemen were seen pulling a woman's charred remains from the driver's seat of the minivan

777
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,640
Two others from the back of the van pulled out the body of a small girl

778
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:37,080
Drew pulled up in Keith's Cruiser because he got a call from the estate salesman at James's house

779
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:45,400
Apparently he found some unsettling writing and blood and many many guns after accidentally triggering some secret

780
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:50,280
Door trap the salesman was wondering if he could sell the guns in the estate sale

781
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,120
Drew had told him the police needed to look at the scene first

782
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:58,980
Drew and John then very subtly walked over to the ditch off the side of the road to speak privately

783
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:05,960
Drew said he received a message from the Duke the deal was going down that night at 2 a.m.

784
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:12,680
John offered drew 5% to convince the Duke to do the deal out at the Pettymore farm

785
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:20,060
Drew and John then walked back up and they all saw a wet black cat running toward them from off the road

786
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:25,420
The cat seemingly panicked jumped on to John's leg and meowed like crazy

787
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,300
John held the cat up and told Doug they were gonna get him the help

788
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:36,120
He needed at this point a small but vocal group of the contention population began

789
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,420
Protesting and letting these officers know how they felt

790
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:46,900
Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like the calls about missing persons

791
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:51,820
Animals in the ponds and creeks as well as a voicemail from the feds

792
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:57,320
Doug dr. Marie Jacob's husband who is inhabiting the body of their cat Salem

793
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:04,940
Conveyed to the officers that the animals were hiding in the water because the oily substance could not get them in the ponds and creeks

794
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:11,420
And at James the mill workers house the estate salesman Randy angst dressed in a fancy blue

795
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:18,080
Three-piece suit holding a cane with a big tooth on the top handed the cops a card when he greeted them

796
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:23,460
The card said mr. Angst is the dentist and the estate salesman in town

797
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:31,600
He also founded the contention historical society when asked about the picture from the odd camera John found in Julie Maxwell's car

798
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:38,860
angst noted that a few of the folks were dressed in clothes about a hundred years off from the rest when questioned about Cole's

799
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:45,220
Orphanage the dentist slash estate salesman recalled an orphanage by that name opening about

800
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:51,580
25 years prior though it did close down within a year in James the mill workers house

801
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,800
They found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table

802
01:11:55,260 --> 01:12:01,740
Riding in blood where one of the guns should be that read stop her and a large plastic tube all

803
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,980
Revealed after touching the bow tie of a statue of a man wearing a tuxedo

804
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:14,940
There are a bunch of cleaning supplies random materials and a handwritten list hidden in a small enclave

805
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:23,860
behind an oil painting of a rose all the liquids had been crossed out including the three listed types of water tap

806
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:29,420
distilled and boiling and all of the materials had been crossed out except

807
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:37,740
Neoprene a kind of synthetic rubber when Clark tapped the white hard hat atop the suit of armor in the foyer

808
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:45,580
He found a trapdoor and fell into a 12 foot deep pit with two corpses a man and a woman in

809
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:54,020
One of their pockets was a paper with a hand-drawn symbol a circle encircled by six circles in the front room

810
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:57,700
There was a grand piano without strings and in the kitchen

811
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:04,380
there are a few loose tiles where something heavy metal and buried had been dragged out as

812
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:12,960
The place was being searched a heavy artillery weapon began firing into the house from the front yard a looming

813
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,460
Overweight man wearing an all-black

814
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:21,520
Combat uniform with a large scar over his right eye blasted the door from its frame

815
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:27,800
Almost cut officer Bishop's arm off froze at the command of officer petty more and

816
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:36,280
Eventually after a brutal combat between the contingent boys and the massive metal man flew out of the window bottomless

817
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,720
Gripping the throat of officer vigna. Thank beans

818
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:47,080
He poked that terminator top in the eye just in time to escape falling to the ground before the metal fella

819
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,800
exploded like fireworks

820
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:57,280
The officers cleaned themselves up after fighting this large robot man seemed to perhaps have feelings

821
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,800
Continuing the investigation of James the mill workers house Keith vigna found a single piece of music

822
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:09,560
entitled the rise of the end in the bench of the stringless piano

823
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,200
Clark Bishop found in the large plastic tube

824
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,600
blueprints for calm comfy campground a

825
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:24,480
Suspiciously planned out set of seven buildings six encircling a large one in the center on an island

826
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,920
sitting on Lake calm

827
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:31,180
They all stood there in James the mill workers house and the officers

828
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:37,520
Remembered he died in chief Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head face down in a plate of foot me

829
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,560
They remembered the contents of the present

830
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,160
She received from an unknown source the night

831
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:50,020
She took off a red rose a white hardhat and a black silk bowtie all of which

832
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:57,560
present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by a statue respectively

833
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:05,360
They called Florence the fourth and only other contention police officer, but it went to voicemail immediately

834
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:13,420
After undressing the bottom half of the still standing robot man's legs the gang found a logo on the smooth

835
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:19,320
Pelvic area an M made of four double helices

836
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:29,700
Late on the night of December 4th after the weirdest dinner and wheel of fortune session Clark Bishop had ever been subject to

837
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:36,300
Due to his super fucking weird new co-worker Keith Vigna left the Bishop home headed back to Hotel Motel

838
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,720
And was approached by his niece Francis beans

839
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:47,340
She offered her uncle officer Vigna one million dollars from her inheritance to kill her father

840
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:49,680
Keith's brother

841
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:56,260
Ferguson beans upon accepting her proposal the two began driving east away from contention

842
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:02,820
John got home to find his place had been turned over his smoky and the bandit DVDs had been knocked and

843
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:09,180
Stepped on among the mess was a Burgatory rewards card for Keith Vigna

844
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:16,340
John vowed to kill Keith, but first he smoked a bowl and put on smoky

845
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:19,240
Drew eventually showed up holding a pistol

846
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:24,380
But by the top so John showed drew how to use the safety on his pistol

847
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:27,900
And they went out to the shooting tree to practice aiming and firing

848
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:35,060
With final preparations for the coke deal with the Duke in place John made a bird call and another call

849
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:37,380
replied from the woods

850
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,820
At 2 a.m.

851
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:47,140
technically the morning of December 5th a white 15 passenger van pulled up to the Pettymore property with the words

852
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:52,780
Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side filled with children

853
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:58,020
Pulling a white trailer that also said Jesus Christ Ministries

854
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:03,100
The most handsome man John had ever seen hopped out of this van

855
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:06,960
Perfect hair perfect teeth a perfect jawline

856
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:13,380
And he was wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel

857
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:19,460
Coke was buried in two holes and John would point out where to dig when he received half the money

858
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:24,660
Same plan for the second half a bunch of children ran out of the van all carrying

859
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:31,220
Shovels in the same way and they lined up waiting for the Duke on his command the children began digging

860
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:36,740
John asked if the kids all have the same mom. Yeah, you could you could say that

861
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:45,320
After the children loaded the cocaine into the trailer behind the van the Duke handed John the briefcase with

862
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:51,840
$5,000,000 in it same thing happened behind the woodpile as it did beneath the big tree the

863
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:59,360
Transaction went smoothly and John offered the Duke a thousand dollars for information about Marvin Glass

864
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,060
The Duke doesn't like Marvin Glass see glass is a competitor

865
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:09,640
But also a customer Marvin Glass buys in bulk when the Duke was asked about his rose

866
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,600
He said he liked the smell

867
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:19,260
Laughed and admitted he had no sense of smell when John asked about the kids the Duke said goodbye to Drew got back in the van

868
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,680
Drove down the long driveway and out onto the country road

869
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:28,000
John whistled and eight petty more cousins came walking out from the woods received their payment

870
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:35,640
Ten grand and a 24 pack of Keystone light each and they all fired their guns into the air in celebration

871
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:41,280
Back at the Bishop abode Clark heard Keith leave got up and locked the front door

872
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,320
Walking back to bed though

873
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:48,500
He looked out the window to Coles Creek which flows down south from the lake at Centennial Park

874
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:54,760
The whole thing was packed with animals a fair few people had been out there earlier looking for their pets

875
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,200
But not at this late hour too dark too cold

876
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:04,180
And they saw a humanoid figure hobbling down the frigid waterway in his direction

877
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:10,680
It was running but it seemed to be fighting through a limp and when it reached the point in the creek

878
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:17,580
Closest to Clark's house. He leapt from the water and began screaming and waving his arms all while looking directly

879
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,380
toward Clark's window

880
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:27,900
Clark's brain had a hard time comprehending what it was. He was seeing but this man this man running towards him

881
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:30,580
It was him

882
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:33,740
And then a warm pinch on the back of the neck

883
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:36,740
and Clark's vision tunneled to a close

884
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:43,420
Clark came to as a black bag was being snatched off his head

885
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:47,340
He felt hung over and his chest was weird and tight

886
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:54,500
It smelled damp and earthy and there was a haze around the torch above shedding partial light from the middle of the small

887
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,900
stonewalled room

888
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:03,900
Clark was sitting in a chair across a stone table from a man with gray hair under a white hard hat and a charcoal suit

889
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:10,100
With a bolo tie the man looked relaxed as he tossed the black bag onto the table and began to speak

890
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,440
After Richard the third's coronation

891
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,720
He was visited by a seer from Leichster who called himself the overseer

892
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,940
The seer claimed that the now king was to hold some very important knowledge

893
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:28,340
But would need to have the restraint to not abuse this power Richard was given this knowledge

894
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,300
But he couldn't handle it

895
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:33,140
He lost his mind and killed his two nephews

896
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:37,500
The overseer disappointed eventually passed the same knowledge to Henry Tudor

897
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,500
So he could whoop Richard at Bosworth

898
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:44,580
Henry the seventh held this power and eventually passed it down to a reliable and trusted confidant

899
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:46,840
Thankfully not his piece of shit son

900
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:55,140
This knowledge was passed down repeatedly abused and respected respected and abused until it made its way over the Atlantic to the colonies

901
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:01,640
Eventually landing with a high order of masons a select few held this information for generations

902
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,100
But a grand purpose was never found

903
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:09,980
Until Paul Simon the politician not the singer soon after being elected to the Senate

904
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:14,440
He was walking near his home when he came across the first known xenon imitode

905
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:20,540
He sought out Robert Byrd the Senate minority leader at the time to share his newfound understanding of the world

906
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:26,580
Thankfully for the world Byrd was among those carrying the knowledge of the overseer from centuries before

907
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:32,140
Together they formed a small circle of men to hold the weight of this realization

908
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,260
Today we carry on their tradition by keeping the darkness out of this world

909
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:43,820
We are the opaque rampart delaying the destruction of life as we know it

910
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,720
Welcome to the circle of knowledge

911
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:52,200
You have questions, I'm sure and I know this sounds hypocritical after that lengthy oration

912
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:58,640
But as my high school English teacher would always say show don't tell he reached under the table

913
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:03,180
And as he stood up he held up an unspeakable worm like

914
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:11,520
Abomination with one hand away from his body the thing was two feet long and tube like covered in a squamous black

915
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,360
partially translucent

916
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,360
membrane its body

917
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,600
Segmented and toxically green

918
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:23,700
Pulsating arteries and veins could be seen through its thin looking exterior. It had no

919
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,920
Identifiable eyes or nose its cavernous

920
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:34,640
Circular mouths one sitting just inside the other were lined with hooked teeth and it spit out a saliva

921
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,400
That was somehow darker than black

922
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,400
You

923
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:49,720
Keith vigna sat in the car of his niece Francis beans a Chrysler Sebring

924
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:54,880
She'd offered him 1 million dollars to kill her father his brother Ferguson beans

925
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:00,680
After some back roads through the woods she pulled up to a black iron fence

926
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:06,640
Francis hopped out in motion for teeth to follow her she opened a hatch in the ground and jumped inside

927
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,640
Disappearing from view

928
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:16,820
Keith followed down the hatch into a dark underground tunnel lit by red lights on the walls every 15 feet

929
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:23,500
France told him he'll pop up on the estate in a sweet spot with no security and he'll have a straight shot to the house

930
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:27,880
Keith went up followed her directions and made his way into Ferguson's house

931
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,480
undetected

932
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:34,120
Keith searched for and found bleach ammonia and a towel

933
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:41,080
But when Keith walked into Ferguson's room the lights were out there were candles on either side of the bed and lit by

934
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:46,040
Candlelight was a woman on top of the sheets in bedware, but not Stacy

935
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:52,640
Not Ferguson's wife. This was an older woman a generation older than Ferguson and Keith

936
01:23:53,160 --> 01:24:00,400
She freaked out Keith calmed her down said he's a contention police officer and that he got a call that someone had broke in

937
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,620
She claimed she was there to meet Ferguson

938
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:08,840
This was Joan Robin the mother of Ferguson's business partner

939
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,960
Bruce Joan explained that Ferguson offered her a million dollars to sleep with him

940
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,920
So he could make your mom jokes to his business partner

941
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,020
Keith told her she had two options

942
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,420
She could leave or she could shoot Ferguson when he came into the room

943
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:32,560
Joan realized with Ferguson gone her son would take control of the company Keith offered her half a million dollars

944
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:41,120
And she accepted Keith found Ferguson's revolver handed it to Joan and a car could be heard pulling up to the house a

945
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:48,080
white 15 passenger van with the words Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side pulled into the

946
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:55,040
pristine Circle Drive the van pulled a white trailer that also said Jesus Christ Ministries a

947
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:02,220
Beautiful man got out of the passenger side of the van. He had perfect hair perfect teeth a perfect jawline

948
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:08,960
And he was wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel

949
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,960
It was Keith's brother

950
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,080
Ferguson beans

951
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:20,360
He clicked a button on his keys and as he walked toward his home the ground around the van and trailer began to move

952
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:26,840
And shift the entire vehicular ensemble was transported below ground on some crazy

953
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:34,000
Futuristic elevator of sorts as the driveway closed back up with no evidence the van or trailer had ever

954
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:41,280
Sat there Keith hid in the closet with the ammonia bleach and towel the door opened shut

955
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,080
and

956
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,080
Ferguson hollered upstairs

957
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:49,160
Joan the power out scared Joan yelled back

958
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
It must have been the storm

959
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:59,080
The door to the room opened and Keith heard a shot then a scream then another shot then a different scream then another shot

960
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:02,640
And another shot and another shot, and then Keith heard crying

961
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:09,800
It sounded like Joan Keith opened the door of the closet to see Ferguson on the floor in a white suit with a rose on

962
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,340
His lapel riddled with holes from his own gun

963
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:20,800
Joan ran to Keith and hugged him Keith started crying Joan was crying Keith told Joan to calm down and

964
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,560
Lay on the bed so he could clean up the scene

965
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:28,000
Joan sat at the end of the bed with her head in her hands and Keith

966
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,520
Keith grabbed the bleach

967
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:37,720
Ammonia mixed it up on the rag he walked over to Joan and tried to lock his arm behind her head and forced the rag

968
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:42,880
Over her mouth, but Joan got her hand in between her mouth and the towel Keith attacked again violently

969
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,080
He held her down on the bed until she passed out

970
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:50,380
Officer Keith Vigna grabbed the revolver with his handkerchief

971
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:55,200
Put it in Joan's hand held the gun to her head and pulled the trigger

972
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:02,280
Leaving the room to look like Joan shot Ferguson five times before turning the gun on herself

973
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:07,220
Walking away Keith saw the watch on Ferguson's wrist

974
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:12,360
It was the same watch their dad William given Ferguson when they were kids

975
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,800
Keith took the watch

976
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,800
Noticing there's nothing on the face

977
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:24,300
And slipped in in his pocket when all the sudden his consciousness began changing like changing the channel

978
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:27,840
He began to phase out of his reality seems to be somewhere else

979
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,040
entirely

980
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,880
Keith felt wet grass and dirt on his fingers

981
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:39,920
He was looking at a door in the ground like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried and on the door was an inscription

982
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,120
It read here lies the beans

983
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:48,640
Scientists beyond measure saviors of the world

984
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:56,200
Keith walked back through the tunnel under the ground with the red lights with glazed eyes

985
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:04,700
Keith back at the hotel stuck the watch in the handkerchief into the room safe and laid down flat on his bed

986
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:13,060
John Lee Pettymore just successfully made five million dollars by selling cocaine to a random handsome

987
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:19,660
Stranger named the Duke paid him a grand to know that Marvin Glass buys from him in bulk and paid eight

988
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:25,060
Cousins ten grand in a 24 pack of Keystone light each to which they took a Pettymore

989
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:29,860
Sky-shot and headed off into the night drew walked up and said, thank you

990
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:34,260
Thank you for making all this money for showing him how to shoot a gun

991
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:39,460
With all the money drew planned on donating his house to Boys and Girls Club

992
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:47,340
And then it's probably just gonna bail and then drew drove off down the long driveway to the country road home alone

993
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:50,180
John wanted to kill Keith vigna

994
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:57,260
but he opted for leaving Keith drunk voicemails slamming three more beers snorting another line brushing his teeth and

995
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:01,060
Sending Keith a text that just says I

996
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:03,060
know

997
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:09,460
John then swept up his smoky DVDs put in the director's cut and fell asleep smoking and join on his couch

998
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:12,220
dreaming of his millions but also of

999
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:14,660
terrible monsters

1000
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:17,460
He woke up to the sound of two gunshots

1001
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:22,980
Rose Mary was holding six Pettymores and drew hostage outside

1002
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:27,060
Two Pettymores were faced down in the dirt and she called out for John

1003
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:34,040
He came out on his front porch with his hands up. She told him her boss Marvin Glass wants the gun

1004
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:40,620
John John thinks they can help each other glass wants his boys back right John wants his town back, right?

1005
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:47,340
She said she was sent to collect this gun and John asked if he could deliver it. She agreed first

1006
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,460
She let the cousins all go free

1007
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:54,740
Then she got John and drew into the front of Drew's Mini Cooper hopped in the back and held their own

1008
01:29:54,940 --> 01:30:00,260
Guns at them while they drove back into town to the contention police department

1009
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:08,120
Clark was in the circular stone room with the stone table lit by a torch

1010
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:13,780
The man sat across from him put down the creature into a container between his legs and closed the lid

1011
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:20,060
Before introducing himself as Leon Simpson, he welcomed Clark into the circle of knowledge

1012
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:28,020
Clark's first task began forthwith Leon pulled out a small plastic container and slid it toward Clark

1013
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:34,380
He took a gun out of his pockets a tranquilizer and in the plastic container were a pair of needles

1014
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,660
Leon told Clark these darts were filled with a particular

1015
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:43,140
Toxin to make anyone obey for some time

1016
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:50,540
The job was this an FBI agent was on his way to contention to take over the missing persons cases as

1017
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:54,020
This would be bad for Clark and for the circle of knowledge

1018
01:30:54,620 --> 01:31:00,140
Clark needed to tranq this FBI agent and make sure he didn't see anything funny going on

1019
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:06,820
Leon Simpson asked Clark what exactly had been going on that was so funny in contention and Clark

1020
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:10,180
Clark spilt those beans

1021
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:17,540
Leon was impressed by the sheer amount of strange information coming from Clark and so reiterated his current mission

1022
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:22,860
Keep the FBI agent away from any of the strangeness any of the goo or ooze or whatever

1023
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:25,140
They're calling it. This next part was important

1024
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:32,360
Clark had 24 hours and then Leon needed him to report back so they could make sure that he'd be okay

1025
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:37,600
Clark asked about the creature. Leon told them it's a xenonema toad

1026
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:44,480
Currently they believe these things are a vector either from another time another place or another reality. They're not quite positive

1027
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:50,620
However, they're the things Paul Simon found that connected the dots to the knowledge of the overseer

1028
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:54,160
These creatures are not of this place

1029
01:31:54,160 --> 01:32:01,500
They have certain abilities the circle of knowledge has found a way to exploit and they are necessary kept around for a very

1030
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,940
specific purpose

1031
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:11,680
Again, Leon decided to show not tell he opened the one door in this room into another circular stone room

1032
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:13,680
This one was much bigger

1033
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:21,520
20 yards across with a domed ceiling the walls were stone and there were a handful of torches mounted to light the room

1034
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:28,660
There were six large slabs of stone each with a couple of people laying on them circling a single

1035
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:34,560
Unoccupied stone slab in the center of the space each person laying down had one of those giant

1036
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:42,180
Fucked up worm things attached to them and many of them seemed to have dead skin covering one or multiple limbs

1037
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:48,980
There's also a woman an electric blue slacks and a bright yellow cardigan walking

1038
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:56,060
Deliberately around each slab checking on each group and checking her watch. She smiled when she saw Clark Bishop

1039
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:58,660
Leon explained that these brave men and women

1040
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:02,900
Motioning to the people on the slabs who all looked very down on their luck

1041
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:08,300
These fine individuals have dedicated their lives to the survival of humanity

1042
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:14,560
Clark questioned their willingness and Leon argued that things around here were much better than they used to be

1043
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,060
Anyway, Clark needed to get going

1044
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:22,260
the timer had already started and Leon said he'd hate for the 24 hours to pass as

1045
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:29,020
They'd hate to lose Clark so soon as he walked Clark out of the room the woman said goodbye to Leon

1046
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:33,660
Clark turned back and and looked he recognized this woman

1047
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:38,240
She was cold and vacant with a big smile on her face

1048
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:43,180
her asymmetrical hair was covering one of her eyes and

1049
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:49,020
Love the woman who killed Clark's parents smiled and calmly said

1050
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:56,860
Bye Clark as he rushed toward her officer bishop felt another warm pinch in his neck and

1051
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:01,220
Love began laughing as he slowly crumbled to the ground

1052
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:05,700
Clark Bishop woke up in a cab and looking behind

1053
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:08,060
He saw

1054
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:11,660
He was leaving the mill on the other side of the city

1055
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:22,020
I

1056
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:27,940
What's up, it's Zach

1057
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:32,740
I'm Zach here to give you an idea of what's going on and whatnot

1058
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:40,460
so I decided it would be really helpful and nice to write a recap of season 1 so far and

1059
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:46,180
Record it. So everyone is nice and caught up before we dive into the final arc of the story

1060
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:51,980
I thought this would be a pretty simple task and I I thought I could encapsulate it all in in one episode

1061
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:59,860
Boy howdy was was I super super wrong first I forgot how stupid I am

1062
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:05,420
Second I forgot how detail oriented I can be so it's looking like this

1063
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:11,320
Project has turned into a more work than I intended or have time for

1064
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:15,280
But that's okay. I still think it'll be fun for everyone

1065
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:21,280
Especially the players to really have a grasp on what's going down before we hit the end

1066
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,240
So here's the deal. I I need some help

1067
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:29,300
Writing this transcript. It was a massive undertaking again

1068
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:32,520
Duh should have known better going in but oh well

1069
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:39,660
So there is a link in the show notes and on Twitter and Facebook fuck Mark Zuckerberg to a Google Doc

1070
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:45,040
We can all share it will have the transcript for this episode

1071
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:52,880
Which covered episodes 1 through 23 now if you write up a few succinct but thorough

1072
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:59,100
paragraphs recapping an episode of this show you will be entered to win a

1073
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,400
PTBP t-shirt

1074
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:06,520
Now if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

1075
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:13,840
Recapping three or more episodes you will be entered to win one of five

1076
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,920
PTBP t-shirts

1077
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,160
So if only five people write up three or more episodes boom

1078
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:25,760
You got a shirt and finally finally if you really if you go above and beyond if you write up a few succinct

1079
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:31,280

1081
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:42,400

1084
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:58,780
This contest slash giveaway slash help Zack out project does have a deadline and that deadline is Tuesday

1085
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,920
October 13th at midnight

1086
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:08,860
Central time please note that the recap focused on in character action

1087
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:15,460
There unfortunately just isn't enough time to include all the dice rolling and meta goofs in class

1088
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:21,680
Be wary of grammatical issues wolf the dog hates grammatical issues

1089
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:25,380
He learned them all just so he would know how to break them

1090
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:33,760
Now I'll get these recap episodes out as quickly as possible so we can dumpster dive into the finale of season one guys

1091
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:40,040
I'm so fucking stoked y'all may the wolf bless each and every one of you

1092
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,760
Oh

1093
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,760
