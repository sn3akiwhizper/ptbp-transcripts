Hello, garbage people. It's your trash truck driver, Wolf the Dog.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,260
And this junkyard dog is here to dump some non-biodegradable news in your mine's landfills.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,260
We are coming at you live from the most delicious trash-filled radio station,

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,380
Contentions' own 694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:28,040
Remember, leave those trash cans open for your old buddy Wolf, so I can get me a late-night snack.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,120
Hope y'all threw something tasty away.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,240
What am I even saying? It's all tasty to me, my babies.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,640
Mmmmmm.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,840
We got us a new Howlin' with Wolf entry that comes from

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,480
at Unclear Gamer on Twitter.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,000
They tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,520
If you want to write a message for Wolf to read on air, follow the lead.

At Unclear Gamer writes,

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,600
Title, Trouble on the Force.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Dear Wolf,

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,160
After the absolute mess my other officers have made of Condention PD,

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,560
I have decided to leave my post here and move to the city PD.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,880
A lovely woman has replaced me, and she seems blissfully unaware of the wreck she is about to walk into.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,120
How can I warn her of her current predicament without shit-talking my former co-workers too much?

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,880
Thanks, Officer Lauren, which is poorly crossed out, followed by Disgruntled Deputy.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,480
Listeners, this is some real spooky shit.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,480
I've never heard of an officer in Contention named Lauren.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,680
But you know, I went back and listened to some of our programming,

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,680
and I found a clip of myself, Wolf the Dog, talking about Officer Lauren.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,280
What the extra-dimensional fuck is going on around here, y'all?

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,120
When it comes to advice about the Contention Police Force, I suggest a wide berth.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Those boys' minds and moods change about as quickly and as often as my entire reality.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,480
Speaking of an unstable existence, it's time for the news.

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,480
The officers use the radio to put Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad,

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,800
relegating Agent Chad to a cat body.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,960
Rosemary, one of the Glass Crime family bruisers,

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,840
grabbed a briefcase out of Drew's trunk she claimed has $5 million in it.

35
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,160
She was adamant about getting her hands on the gun the officers first found in the possession of Tildy B. Mitchell.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Doug saw the ooze inside the police station and everyone freaked out,

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,000
busting pipes and spraying water everywhere, effectively flooding the station.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,600
Doug really lost it when he exclaimed that the water wasn't stopping the oily goop.

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,320
Jan Manstein, the grieving mother of Ari Manstein,

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,520
the Contention officer tragically killed in the fire at the city hospital,

41
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,360
came by to pick up Ari's things and asked the officers to relay the news to Ari's father Stan,

42
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,080
who has been in the city asylum for the past 20 years.

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,440
Wolf the dog would acquiesce to being locked up in a sanatorium,

44
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,720
as long as I can always listen to kudzu with no backbone.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:50,720
I didn't know it could... I was hunting a female and then this buck just came out of the fucking...

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,560
A doe. A deer. A female deer. Ray. A drop of golden sun.

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,280
I hope we're not recording so there's not just an audio of me going,

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,600
I was hunting a female. There is now.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,120
But yeah, the buck just came out of the bushes right here and knocked me on my ass.

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,840
I got killed by a dog today.

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,440
Oh yeah, he got torn apart by an Australian Shepherd.

52
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,200
Because I rode it onto this guy's farm. I was shooting birds out of the sky

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,000
and just accidentally wandered onto this guy's farm and he came up to me and started shooting me.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,720
I thought he was a bounty hunter or something so I killed him and then all the other farmhands were witnesses

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,520
so I had to kill them and then the dog came and comes up.

56
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,760
So I was like, oh, okay, and I got off my horse and I didn't want to shoot the dog.

57
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,720
So yeah, it chased me and then just like ripped my throat out.

58
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,680
Holy shit. Do you find yourself dying a lot?

59
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,560
Yeah, I try not to as much as... like not as much anymore.

60
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,760
Like I've really tried... I try to be a lot more careful now and I try not to get bounties and shit.

61
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,240
I found that if I get jumped, if I get... if like there's a few random encounters

62
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,600
where like a cart will pull in front of you and then he's like, get them boys!

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,440
And it's like five guys come at me and almost every time I die to them.

64
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,920
Yeah, bounty hunters almost like... it seems like every time I'm fighting bounty hunters

65
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,600
I get to like the last one and I miss and he shoots me dead.

66
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
Oh, they finally... they released the Call of Cthulhu game.

67
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,080
Yeah, I was watching the guy stream it a little bit today.

68
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,880
Was it the one that we watched the...

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,000
No, it was a different one than that trailer.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
Have you read the reviews?

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,560
So the first review I read basically started with, what the fuck?

72
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,880
In a bad way?

73
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,720
Yeah, apparently it's cool. Like it's a very cool game.

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,000
Reddit always... on the Reddit games, they always aggregate all the scores in a thread

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,840
and it was sixes and sevens the entire way through.

76
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,480
Yeah, so apparently the game is cool. However, it took them years to put this together.

77
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,840
Yeah, and it is eight hours of gameplay.

78
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,440
Yeah, and I think that's generous. Yeah, the thing I saw said six to seven.

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,480
What do you do in it?

80
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,520
Holy shit, that's dumb.

81
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,680
But, all that being said, the comments on that Reddit thread were like,

82
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,160
for what it's worth, I've played about four hours and I'm loving it.

83
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,320
Like it's apparently a lot of fun being Cthulhu-y.

84
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,240
And I love it, not being a gamer, that I can sit down with that game and play it in a day.

85
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Yeah, right, sure.

86
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
That's actually a plus for me.

87
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,800
Call of Cthulhu is the rare bad game that's still worth playing.

88
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,440
Hell yeah, just like this campaign.

89
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,120
Hell yeah.

90
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:34,560
So, I wanted to talk a little bit at the top about sanity loss and rolling for sanity.

91
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,360
The example I'm going to use is, you guys saw the security footage of Dr. Marie Jacobs

92
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,480
and the body of Doug Jacobs get smashed in the ground and I asked you to roll sanity

93
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,480
and you said, but we've already seen that, why would that affect us?

94
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
But I was thinking about it and I was like, well maybe not,

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,040
like it would affect you still, but less so.

96
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,680
I like, yeah, I agree, because that's a fucked up thing to see.

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,280
Exactly, it's a super fucked up thing and I was thinking about it,

98
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,040
I was like, okay, so if you pass the sanity loss,

99
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,280
A, it's on security footage, you can think whatever you want to think about

100
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,000
that being tampered with or whatever, but if you lose on the sanity check,

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,320
A, it happened somewhere new, it happened in the police station,

102
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,200
you didn't know it could happen in the police, you just may have thought that it was...

103
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,120
Exactly, or also you realized that last time was real,

104
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,520
like you now have proof on footage of what you saw

105
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,520
and were probably trying to convince yourself it wasn't real.

106
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,600
I don't know about you guys, you guys are pretty dead set on just like...

107
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,200
I hope we see it again, I hope we see it again.

108
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,360
Yeah, so we're not going to retcon any sand loss.

109
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Cool, because I ain't got much.

110
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,360
But in the future, let's try to like come up with reasons why the sand loss happened,

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,040
like why the fail is more interesting or different than a success on a sanity check.

112
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,680
Hey, can the next campaign be set like 20 years in the future and I'll be Rosemary's baby?

113
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,400
What about way in the future and it's Rosemary's granddaughter,

114
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,400
spitting image of my father, you know that old song?

115
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,520
Yeah, what is that song?

116
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,400
Jessica Andrews called Who I Am.

117
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,600
I think I had a crush on her, is she super pretty?

118
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
Uh, we're about to find out.

119
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,560
Who I Am!

120
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Rock me like a hurricane!

121
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Yeah!

122
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Oh!

123
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,560
As you head toward the highway, you notice what Drew mentioned in his phone call.

124
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
A severe lack of traffic.

125
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,560
It's 9am, but the dearth of other cars on the roads is reminiscent of 4am.

126
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Sitting at a red light with no one in sight, the feeling is amplified.

127
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,560
The turning weather must have pushed much of the population in contention to stay cozied up at home.

128
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,560
The beggars on the corners of the intersections, the runners on their morning route,

129
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,560
the loitering teenagers on pot, they were all just not around.

130
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,560
The protesters, so riled up and determined, have dispersed and are nowhere to be seen.

131
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,560
You can vaguely hear the sounds of other cars' life in contention over a heartbreaking, steady roar.

132
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,560
It would be so weirdly quiet if it weren't for the many animals still cohabiting in the ponds and creeks.

133
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,560
There are fewer than there were even yesterday, but the ones left are growing more vocal,

134
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,560
with the cold and lack of food seemingly abandoned by their owners.

135
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,560
You pull onto the highway, heading for the city with the sun at your back,

136
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,560
in whichever cars and bringing whichever stuff we decide during this next conversation.

137
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Oh, well we had all the cars and all the stuff, including some stuff we didn't have before.

138
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
We took three semis.

139
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
We found it on the lookout.

140
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,560
We've got the whole Fast and Furious crew backing us up.

141
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Maybe Glass's crew is pretty good with cars.

142
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
We'll find out.

143
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Maybe they are.

144
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Maybe one of them is named Vince.

145
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,560
I'm going all original and only the friends.

146
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Vince Petrol.

147
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
What are we doing?

148
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Well, before we leave town, well, while we're leaving town, I guess, I kind of want to call.

149
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Phone calls is what I was thinking for the hour that you have in the cars on the way to the city.

150
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Tight.

151
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
So, what are you driving?

152
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
How are you getting to the city?

153
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Who's in what cars?

154
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Five of us?

155
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Does Rosemary have a car?

156
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,560
She does have a car in contention.

157
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,560
However, the three of you drove to the police station in Drew's Mini Cooper.

158
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Okay.

159
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Maybe we should make Rosemary drive to the city in her own car if she'll accept that.

160
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
And then we can take two cruisers or one cruiser.

161
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Let's take one cruiser and then we can play 20 questions.

162
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
Yeah.

163
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
I like that idea.

164
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Whereas two cruisers is better.

165
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I just feel like two would give us some options.

166
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,560
We could always steal someone's car, like hijack a car, once we get there if we need it.

167
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
My cruiser is not at the station.

168
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
It's okay.

169
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
We're police from a very small town an hour and a half away.

170
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I think my cruiser is there, right?

171
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
It is.

172
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Is my cruiser there?

173
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
No.

174
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
We can take my cruiser.

175
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,560
I believe your cruisers are both in the impound lot.

176
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
They're totaled.

177
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Yeah.

178
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
I guess we're taking one cruiser.

179
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Cool.

180
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Is mine totaled?

181
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
I thought I just left it at home from last night.

182
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Was yours involved in the wreck at all?

183
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
I don't remember.

184
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Mine got crushed by John Peters.

185
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
I did run into the back of his car, didn't I?

186
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Yes.

187
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Both of your cars were totaled in that wreck.

188
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
You're right.

189
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
How did I get home last night?

190
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
I guess you took me.

191
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Probably.

192
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
For a long couple of days.

193
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Yes.

194
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I guess, realistically, we would only be taking yours.

195
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Okay.

196
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,560
So, the three of you in the body of Agent Trent Chad, Agent Chad Trent, Agent Chad,

197
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Agent Trent Chad.

198
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
You got it?

199
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Are in the cruiser, and you have Rosemary driving her own car behind you?

200
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,560
We'll probably follow her, yeah, because we don't really know where we're going.

201
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
You know what?

202
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
That makes even more sense.

203
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Hey, just follow us to your gang's hideout.

204
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Okay.

205
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
What should we bring with us?

206
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Weapons?

207
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
We've got all the weapons.

208
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Yeah, my trunk's full of weapons.

209
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,560
So, you stop by Clark's house and pick up some heavy weaponry.

210
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
Hey, don't go inside.

211
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
What did we find at the robot house?

212
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,560
We found some cool weapons there, right?

213
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Oh.

214
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
I had a list of them.

215
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
We had a sniper rifle that we gave to the old man.

216
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Oh, I forgot about that sniper.

217
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Yeah, wasn't there something else cool there?

218
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,560
There were machine guns, too, I think, or assault rifles.

219
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Assault.

220
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Did we find those after our fight with the giant?

221
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,560
No, because we gave the sniper to the dude while it was happening.

222
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Yeah.

223
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,560
So, in the wooden crates marked US military that are now hidden in Clark Bishop's garage.

224
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Garage?

225
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Those crates included pistol, shotguns, rifles, a shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft weapon, an

226
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,560
EMP rifle, a grappling gun, a small gun that shoots tracers, lots of grenades, a sniper

227
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,560
rifle, a very, very tiny but powerful gun.

228
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
We load all of that into the truck.

229
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Should we take it all?

230
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Real quick, what is Clark's garage like?

231
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
Very clean.

232
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Very clean.

233
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Got a tool bench over on the side there with a lot of tools all hung in their places.

234
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Everything.

235
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,560
And then these weapons are all just kind of haphazardly in a corner.

236
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,560
That one gun that you said shoots tracers, we clarify that you meant that they shot tracking

237
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
things, is that right?

238
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Yeah.

239
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Like a home-in device?

240
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Like a GPS?

241
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Like a GPS.

242
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Oh, cool.

243
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Should we take all this stuff?

244
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
I don't see why not.

245
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
I think we should take the EMP gun for sure since we fought a robot recently.

246
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Yep.

247
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
And I think we should take those tracers since we'll be messing with the mob.

248
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,560
We might need to make sure we know where somebody goes.

249
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
I'd like the anti-aircraft gun too.

250
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Yeah, in case of an emergency.

251
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,560
And the grappling gun because then we can climb stuff.

252
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
And all the grenades just in case.

253
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,560
I want to take my small but very powerful pistol as well.

254
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Sniper too?

255
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh yeah.

256
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,560
So yeah, let's pretty much take it all.

257
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I'll take an assault rifle for myself as well.

258
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
And a shotgun.

259
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Clark wants an assault rifle.

260
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
I think we all got our assault rifles.

261
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Yeah.

262
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,560
And I got a pretty big trunk so we can fit it all back here.

263
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Okay, that all sounds good.

264
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:35,560
And you also have at James the mill worker's house there was also a stash of weapons there.

265
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Good ones?

266
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Yeah, I don't remember what was there.

267
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
That's the house we're talking about, right?

268
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Well no, so the military crates were from the storage units.

269
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Oh, okay.

270
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
That's what I was talking about the one and what did we find there?

271
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:56,560
There you just found a bunch of pistols, silencers, shotguns, an assault rifle, and a sniper.

272
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
And body armor.

273
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Oh, yeah.

274
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Who has the body armor?

275
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Was there more than one set?

276
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
You could each have body armor.

277
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
Let's strap one body armor please.

278
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Yeah, one body armor.

279
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Hey, you want to take it now?

280
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Strap it on big boy.

281
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Okay, so you strapped it on big boy.

282
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,560
And I think we are good to go.

283
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,560
You're going to have to take Rosemary in the cruiser with you to John's house to get her car.

284
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Sure.

285
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,560
And so you pull up to the turn for John's house where you would then have to go down his long gravel driveway.

286
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,560
And sitting by the road is Rosemary's car and she'll get out.

287
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Who has the best drive?

288
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,560
I believe it's John.

289
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Yeah, you should be driving.

290
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,560
I was a professional waste car driver briefly.

291
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Real fast, does that body armor have anything mechanically that we add to anything for us?

292
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Yeah.

293
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Cool.

294
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
I guess we'll find out.

295
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,560
Does it give you willpower points?

296
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,560
So I still have a negative 20 if I'm at two?

297
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Yes.

298
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Do we have any?

299
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
I want to bring cocaine with us.

300
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Yeah, we got a little bit.

301
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Yeah, I want to have a little baggie of coke on me to, you know, get through the day.

302
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,560
I don't want to do it yet since we're not really going to be rolling for, well, I don't know that.

303
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Can I sleep in the car on the way to the city and regain willpower?

304
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
No, it's just an hour drive to the city.

305
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
There's no power nap mechanic?

306
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
My reasoning is that there's no power nap mechanic.

307
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Thank you, Thomas.

308
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:33,560
And you can write down for your tactical body armor, you are going to have a five hit point buffer.

309
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Tight.

310
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
What does that mean exactly?

311
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,560
I'm writing plus five next to my current hit points and I'll take from there as I get hit.

312
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Sounds good to me.

313
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
That gets me all the way up to 13.

314
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take naps.

315
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Okay, so you guys are in the car.

316
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Yeah, I want to call, fuck, what are their names?

317
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
The Glass Brothers.

318
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,560
No, our bros, they own the Daily Fuh and the Skeeters, or Clinkers.

319
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
I want to call Gary.

320
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Gary, is it?

321
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Harry and Gary.

322
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Harry and Gary.

323
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Harry and Gary.

324
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Harry Clinker and Gary Daily.

325
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Okay, yeah, I want to call Harry Clinker.

326
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,560
He's got an old fashioned phone.

327
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,560
I have a quick question for you.

328
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Did you take the cell phone jammer with you that you found?

329
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Yes, of course.

330
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
But we didn't turn it on.

331
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
See, it was already-

332
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
No, we didn't take it.

333
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
Turned on.

334
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Okay, we turned it off.

335
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Wait, where did we get a cell phone jammer?

336
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
It was in Chad's briefcase.

337
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Oh, yeah.

338
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
I forgot about it.

339
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
What else was in his briefcase?

340
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Was there anything else important?

341
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
It was the stuff on the table.

342
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
It's the map in front of you.

343
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Oh, right, right, right.

344
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
And the list of-

345
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Places.

346
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
Places in contention.

347
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Cool.

348
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Yeah, let's turn that cell phone jammer off.

349
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,560
See how many missed calls we have.

350
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Okay, so you turn it off and then you call Harry Clinker.

351
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,560
And as you make this phone call, Luke, Keith's phone starts to buzz.

352
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
I answer it.

353
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,560
It is a couple voicemails and a text.

354
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,560
And let's cut to the phone call with John Pettymore and Harry Clinker.

355
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Bring, bring.

356
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Bring, bring.

357
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Hey.

358
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Hey, Harry.

359
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
How you doing today?

360
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Slow day.

361
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Well, I can imagine.

362
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Do you know where all the people went?

363
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Yeah, we've been talking about that.

364
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Yeah, you know, it's crazy.

365
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,560
It's just like maybe it got cold and everybody went on holiday and people can't take the

366
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
cold anymore.

367
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,560
Well, sure, of course everybody leaves contention in mass droves once a year when it gets cold,

368
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,560
but usually that's mid-January after the holidays have died down.

369
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Yeah, it's almost like everybody went a month early.

370
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,560
I don't find that to be a very satisfactory conclusion.

371
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Oh, same.

372
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,560
You got any other working theories?

373
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Well, you know, it could be a gang of disease, you know, it could be a gang disease or, you

374
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,560
know, it, I don't know.

375
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,560
To be honest, buddy, I was kind of hoping maybe you told people to get out of town.

376
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Well, no, I was trying to get people to come down to Clinker's and have a Bud Light.

377
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
That sounds pretty good right about now, Harry.

378
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Doesn't it?

379
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Come on down.

380
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
We'll serve you up real good.

381
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Is that Harry?

382
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Is that him?

383
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
That's Harry.

384
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Tell him I said hey.

385
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Hey, Clark says hi.

386
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Hey, tell Clark I, yeah, nice.

387
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Does he say hi back?

388
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Clark, yeah, he said nice.

389
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Ah, I love Harry.

390
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Yeah, he's a good guy.

391
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Thank you.

392
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
What have you guys been doing?

393
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Because I know, you know, a lot of the people around here were giving it to you pretty good

394
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,560
and, you know, I always stood up for you but, again, I keep my head down.

395
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
I don't really know what's going on.

396
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Harry, honestly, we're only responsible for two or three of these disappearances.

397
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
The rest are not on us.

398
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
That's a really low percentage.

399
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Right?

400
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
That's what I'm saying.

401
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Those kids, that's bad.

402
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
That was, that was me and Clark.

403
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
We didn't mean nothing by it.

404
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
It was the goo.

405
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
I mean, but through our negligence.

406
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I'm hitting John on the shoulder.

407
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
No, hey, hi.

408
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Harry, Harry's.

409
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Keith is learning.

410
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Harry's our confidant, I think.

411
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Harry, we fought a robot man.

412
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,560
A guy was eating his own foot.

413
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
I'm just giving wide eyes to John.

414
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Who else is giving wide eyes to John?

415
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Oh, it's Doug in the agent's body staring at John Lee anymore.

416
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Yeah, I mean, on top of that, we put a man in a cat's body and then, no, we took a man

417
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,560
out of a cat's body into another man's body and put that man into a cat.

418
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
And look at Chad.

419
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I'm like, this is how he and Harry talk.

420
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
It's just jokes.

421
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
They, it's one of their things.

422
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Yeah, this is a long running bit, Chad.

423
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Don't worry about it.

424
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Chad knows that he is in a different.

425
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
What have you been up to?

426
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Oh, wow.

427
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Anything?

428
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Well, I mean, just on all that, you know, that, John, that, that makes me worry about

429
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,560
you, you know, you know, if you're, if you're seeing all that kind of stuff, you, you may

430
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,560
want to talk to someone, you know, maybe a, you know, not to get too frank, but maybe

431
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:30,560
a spiritualist of some sort could, could assist you if, if you're dealing with, with people

432
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
and other people's bodies and stuff.

433
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,560
If you need a, if you need a medium, you know, you can always talk to Gary.

434
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Yeah.

435
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Is he around?

436
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Well, I haven't seen him actually at all today.

437
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,560
He didn't come home last night, but he's always around.

438
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,560
He's probably just at his restaurant.

439
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Right on.

440
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,560
I mean, well, don't leave plinkers, but you maybe should be concerned.

441
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,560
No, I don't, I don't say that.

442
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Your husband may be dead.

443
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Your husband's probably disappeared to the upside down.

444
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Has Gary been acting weird at all lately?

445
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Well, yeah, but, uh, you know, Gary's, uh, he's a weird bird.

446
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,560
But weirder.

447
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Anything out of, out of the usual?

448
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,560
No, I mean, he's been meeting with his, uh, with his like group more often than usual,

449
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
but what group?

450
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Oh, his old group of, uh, you know, spiritualists and, uh, you know, meta metaphysics thinkers.

451
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
Right.

452
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
Yeah.

453
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Uh, you know, it's, uh, him, uh, Dr. Marie Jacobs, what's a, what's a lady's name?

454
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Mildred Mitchell.

455
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Yeah, the three of them, uh, meet up and talk about their, uh, eccentric books that

456
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
they read and such.

457
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Well, that's, that's very good to know, Harry.

458
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Well, he's always been into, you know, the occult and, uh, books of that nature.

459
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Everybody knows that.

460
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Yeah.

461
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,560
I think actually he's, he's who I meant to call, but this has been a good conversation.

462
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
It's crazy.

463
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
It's crazy.

464
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,560
It's like you ever think about like, maybe if you would've called Gary, you'd be talking

465
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,560
to him right now and, uh, he'd be saying that he hadn't seen me all morning.

466
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Ain't it funny how life is and you'd be learning so many more things and you'd have more things

467
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
to go on.

468
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Yeah.

469
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Okay.

470
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Yeah, I get your, I get, I get your point.

471
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,560
I mean, I'm not saying that you can't call Gary, you know, he's a good man to talk to.

472
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
I think he could help you.

473
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
I think I'm through some of these issues.

474
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
I think I'm going to do that.

475
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm going to have to let you go.

476
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Oh yeah, no, that's fine.

477
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
Uh, God, I'm bored.

478
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
All right.

479
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Uh, have fun with your bar with the town to yourself.

480
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,560
It's uh, it's 9am so I guess I shouldn't have expected to be too busy yet.

481
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
You never know in contention.

482
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Uh, okay.

483
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Well, I really got to go, Harry.

484
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Yeah, it seems like you're in a rush.

485
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Okay.

486
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
You hang up first.

487
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,560
Did you, did you hang up?

488
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Harry?

489
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Harry, you hang up first.

490
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Yeah, all right.

491
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
And then he clicks.

492
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Quality role playing.

493
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Harry's a goofball.

494
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
All right.

495
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
What did my texts say?

496
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Uh, well, it's weird.

497
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,560
You just have a one text that you can read pretty quickly.

498
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Uh, as you open your phone, it just says, I know.

499
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
And it's from John Lee Pettymore.

500
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
I...

501
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,560
It's four voicemails all from late at night this past evening from John Lee Pettymore.

502
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Oh yeah.

503
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,560
It seems like weeks ago that I made those calls.

504
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Uh, are there voicemails?

505
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
There are four voicemails.

506
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:57,560
I try to like hide my phone so that he doesn't know that I'm looking at him and I play the

507
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
first one.

508
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,560
I don't remember at all what I said to you in these voicemails.

509
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:12,560
I killed your brother.

510
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,560
He was a has bean.

511
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
God damn it.

512
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Did you come up with a list?

513
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Um, Keith, when you listen to the voicemails, Keith, it's John Lee Pettymore.

514
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,560
I got $5 million now, motherfucker, and I'm going to kick your ass.

515
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Stupid piece of shit messing with my smokey DVDs.

516
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
You got damn bandit.

517
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
I'm the richest man in the world.

518
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,560
I'm going to stick a boot up your ass and then I'm going to fucking marry the turd that

519
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,560
comes out of that ass.

520
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
I put my phone away.

521
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Get some text messages there, buddy.

522
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Oh, just one.

523
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Not important.

524
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Let's focus on the matter at hand.

525
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Guys, I'm sorry.

526
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,560
I know we just got underway, but I got to pee.

527
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Let's not play a gas station.

528
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Okay.

529
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Vroom, vroom.

530
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Basically, do you want to call anybody else on the way to the city?

531
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
I guess we should gather information.

532
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,560
We should tell Drew to just keep us posted, send him a text.

533
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Hey buddy, keep, keep an eye on the town for us and let us know what your peepers peep.

534
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,560
If we did need to retcon, now would be the time before we get into the city.

535
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
So is there anything we are forgetting to bring with us?

536
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
We got weapons.

537
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,560
We got, did we bring the gun?

538
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Retcon.

539
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Oh, it might be way more fun to show up to the city without the gun.

540
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,560
I think we'd have to roll new characters if we walk into Marvin Glass's office without the gun.

541
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
I was so excited.

542
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
It wouldn't have left your purse in any reason.

543
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
We have the gun with us?

544
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Yeah.

545
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Oh, what else?

546
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Is that the only thing with tubes, that you brought object with tubes?

547
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Yeah, I don't think we feel comfortable.

548
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Oh, well actually some of us might've dreamed how to use them.

549
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Oh, I bet maybe let's bring the camera with us.

550
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Oh, fuck.

551
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,560
If people have made it this far in the podcast, they're just like screaming.

552
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Yeah, right.

553
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Dumb motherfuckers.

554
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
No joke.

555
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Yeah, well bring the gun and the camera, all the weapons.

556
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,560
There was a thread on the Critical Role subreddit and it was somebody who had posted all the loose ends that they've left.

557
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,560
And it was only like 10 and I was like, oh fuck, if you did that for us.

558
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Everything makes sense.

559
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Oh, I'm sure.

560
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
No, I just mean that.

561
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:58,560
We're not questioning your mystery, we're questioning our mystery tackling abilities.

562
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Our ability to delegate and find conclusion.

563
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:13,560
I feel like the three of you are jugglers and instead of letting you get good at juggling the balls that you have, I just keep throwing more balls.

564
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
That's true.

565
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
More balls.

566
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,560
You're the worst audience for a juggler.

567
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
So.

568
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Okay.

569
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,560
I don't want to have another 20 minute conversation with Gary.

570
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Why?

571
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
No, no, no.

572
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,560
I mean for the listeners.

573
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Okay, most of this episode is just Thomas talking to Zach on an imaginary cell phone.

574
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
It's a good one, guys.

575
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Buckle up.

576
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Luke doesn't seem bored at all, so I think we're good.

577
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,560
He's literally cleaning out his ear with a mechanical pencil.

578
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
It's fucking nasty, dude.

579
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Yeah, who knows where your ear's been?

580
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
I put those pencils in my mouth.

581
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,560
I put them in my ear.

582
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Hey guys.

583
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Doug looks over at you wide-eyed.

584
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:14,560
I am here so that we can figure this out so that I can get back into my body.

585
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
Correct.

586
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Yes.

587
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
I just want to make that clear.

588
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Unless you like an upgrade.

589
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
I am...

590
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Younger model.

591
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,560
...interested if this is...

592
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,560
He like rubs his fingers together symbolizing money.

593
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Mm-hmm.

594
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I will help you in any way I possibly can.

595
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Oh, yeah.

596
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
I think we could probably work something out.

597
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,560
We happen to have $5 million sitting down at the station.

598
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,560
I shouldn't have told you the amount that really hinders my negotiating.

599
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
I forget I said anything.

600
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Clark, do you want to take...

601
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Clark starts pulling out his wallet.

602
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
I got a...

603
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Looks like a 20.

604
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,560
That's a good start.

605
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,560
So, just figured I'd let you know.

606
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,560
If you want to have another phone call with this other person,

607
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
you can go ahead and throw it on speakerphone.

608
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,560
That way all three of you can talk to the man on the other end.

609
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,560
What a smart idea.

610
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
God damn.

611
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Doug, this is why we pay you.

612
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Chad is the embodiment of everything Zach has wanted to say to us,

613
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,560
but couldn't because he didn't have a character voice to do it in.

614
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
My name is Doug.

615
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Oh, yeah. Chad Doug.

616
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Okay, let's call up Gary.

617
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Ring it.

618
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,560
You hear a click on the other line as the phone is answered,

619
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,560
and you hear Gary Daley saying,

620
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,560
I told you, you old witch, you're just going crazy.

621
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,560
That's all and that's fine.

622
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
And we can deal with that hello.

623
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Hey, Gary. Gary Daley.

624
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Yes, John Lee Pettymore. Speak of the devil.

625
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Yeah. Well, funny you should say that.

626
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Hey, I've actually got us all here on speaker.

627
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Boys, you want to say hi?

628
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Hey, Gary.

629
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Hey, what's going on?

630
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Oh, hello, Clark. Hello, Keith.

631
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,560
There's also a man named Doug here, but that's just more...

632
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
You didn't really need to know that.

633
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Well, hello, Doug. How are you?

634
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Doug, talk to the man.

635
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Oh, I'd really rather not do this.

636
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
That's fair. Gary.

637
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,560
So, first of all, Harry, I think, is a little worried about you.

638
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
You might just shoot him a text.

639
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Oh, gosh.

640
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
You know what, actually, Harry wasn't...

641
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Well, I shouldn't tell you that.

642
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
I was worried about you.

643
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
I wasn't sure we'd get a hold of you.

644
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Well, I just... Oh, gosh, yeah.

645
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Just seeing the time now, it completely slipped my mind.

646
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
I'll absolutely text him.

647
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
I'll put you on speaker while I do it.

648
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Gary, where are you?

649
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Yeah. What'd you say about a witch?

650
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,560
What? Oh, no, I'm just hanging out with a friend.

651
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Where at?

652
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Oh, at her house.

653
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Yeah.

654
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Do you know Mildred Mitchell?

655
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
We sure do.

656
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Yeah, I'm over...

657
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Is she there?

658
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Yeah, she's here. I'm over at Mildred's house.

659
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Are we on speakerphone now?

660
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
God, no.

661
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
No, she's actually... She's having a bit of a breakdown.

662
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I'm over here trying to work her through it.

663
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Real quick.

664
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Who was Mildred Mitchell?

665
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
She lived across the street from John Peters.

666
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
She was one of the first NPCs we ever talked with.

667
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Pot smoking.

668
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Oh, and it's her daughter who used the gun and went crazy.

669
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Right.

670
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Tilly D?

671
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Granddaughter.

672
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Granddaughter.

673
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Tilly B.

674
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Tilly B.

675
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
Tilly D.

676
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Hey.

677
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Hello?

678
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Yeah, hey, so kind of...

679
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
You were on mute there for a second.

680
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Gary, Harry kind of spilled the beans about your coven or whatever it is.

681
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Oh, well, I mean, it's not much of a secret.

682
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
I don't know.

683
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
It's a book club of sorts.

684
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Of sorts seems to be the operative word.

685
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Yeah, we're a sorcerer's guild.

686
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Yeah.

687
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
Wow.

688
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Interesting.

689
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Wait, have you tortured anything recently?

690
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Oh, God, no.

691
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,560
No, it's been years.

692
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Well, all right, Gary, you might have noticed the world's gone to shit.

693
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Yeah, yeah.

694
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
People are not around.

695
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Yeah, and obviously something supernatural seems to be involved.

696
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,560
I couldn't agree more.

697
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
You got any theories on that?

698
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Well, I have five.

699
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Let me run them down for you.

700
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Fuck, I said five.

701
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
You can say three.

702
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Three.

703
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
I have three theories.

704
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Let me run them down for you.

705
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:25,560
My first theory, the strongest in my opinion, is that Jesus came back, right?

706
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Now, don't get me wrong.

707
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,060
He's not like the normal Jesus.

708
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,560
No, this is like a cool Jesus.

709
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,560
And he came back and he took care of all of the weird people, the normies.

710
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
You know what I mean?

711
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
Yeah, I think he just knocked them out.

712
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Now, that's my first theory.

713
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Now, my second theory is that they all left.

714
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
They all just moved.

715
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,560
You know, I think a lot of them were really upset with the police work around here.

716
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:52,560
The jobs had been drying up for some time, so maybe everyone just decided to leave at

717
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
the same time.

718
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
I don't know.

719
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Who knows?

720
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,560
And then my third theory is that, you know, cults.

721
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,560
So, probably a cult.

722
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
So that's the thing.

723
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,560
We're not overly familiar with cults, but it seems like you are.

724
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Have you seen any in the area or signs of cult activity?

725
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Have you been to the first Church of Contingent?

726
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,560
That's pretty pithy, but this is a Christian town.

727
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I'll ask you to mind your tongue.

728
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
Okay, you know what I mean though.

729
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,560
They all repeat each other and stuff.

730
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
It's fucking weird.

731
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Alright, alright, alright.

732
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
Let's not rock a boat.

733
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Whatever.

734
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Jesus freak.

735
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Well, John Lee Pettymore is not going to apologize for his faith.

736
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Should we just tell him what we think is going on?

737
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Well, yeah.

738
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Why are you asking, I mean, me about these things?

739
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,560
Because it's kind of your bag, man.

740
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
You seem like a spooky boy.

741
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Well, I've read a lot of books, but none of them seem to have been true for a while.

742
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
So, uh.

743
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Okay, but back to the cult thing.

744
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
Sure.

745
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Besides the church, what cults have you seen?

746
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Oh, I don't know.

747
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,560
I mean, honestly, that woman Carrie Pages who had the protesters all riled up against you.

748
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,560
I think, you know, she might have had something going on.

749
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,560
She had a lot of power, you know, with her seat on the city council.

750
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:15,560
And, uh, she was really getting people angry about your lack of attention to detail of the police work and contention.

751
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
This is all my fault. I couldn't find her dog.

752
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
You know what, you're probably right, Clark.

753
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
But we'll deal with that later.

754
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,560
For now, just shoulder the burden of your shame.

755
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
It's the goddamn case I couldn't close.

756
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
And get on with the job.

757
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,560
The one case I couldn't crack is that fucking dog.

758
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Okay, well, Gary, you've been about as much help as Harry.

759
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Well, actually, you did give us that Carrie Pages lead. That was pretty good.

760
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Hey, Gary, how's Mildred doing?

761
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Oh, I don't. She, you know, she keeps staring at this picture that she has and she thinks that it changed somehow.

762
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
I don't know. It's crazy.

763
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,560
She, like, believes that her histories have been split somehow.

764
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Does that make sense?

765
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,560
She doesn't understand. She thinks that she's a part of a different reality.

766
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm sorry, Keith. Did I cut you off there?

767
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
What was the picture of and what is it of now?

768
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Oh, well, it's just a picture of the founders of the town.

769
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:16,560
And she is dead certain that Silas Cole looks different than he did before.

770
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:26,560
And I, you know, if you're asking my opinion, I think he looks pretty similar and maybe the exact same.

771
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Probably the exact same.

772
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,560
But she also is claiming that, you know, did you hear about her granddaughter going missing?

773
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Yeah, we knew about that.

774
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
So she's yeah.

775
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Can you can you if she's willing to come to the phone, that'd be great.

776
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,560
But you could ask her if you want to describe the difference between the two people.

777
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Sure. Yeah, no, she's pretty distraught.

778
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:55,560
But so I can't remember exactly what her voice sounds like right now.

779
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:02,560
She's crying a lot and she just keeps saying that he's not as attractive as he used to be used to be far more attractive.

780
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,560
And now he's a bit dumber looking, but similar, but stupider.

781
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:18,560
And and then she's claiming that there in the reflection of a glass part in the picture is her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell.

782
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,560
But, you know, that's just crazy because there's no way, obviously, and she's just losing her shit.

783
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Yeah, Gary, it sounds like she's pretty distraught.

784
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
I'm going to take you off speaker for just one second.

785
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Beep. This sounds like something sounds like we're getting real close to this.

786
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Yeah. People like this has some sort of connection with people are being Ray and back in time.

787
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Ray and who's the girl that died?

788
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Ari Ari and Ray and all the other names potentially.

789
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,560
I might have to do with the split timelines, but it seems like we kind of know where these people are going now.

790
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,560
Go ahead and roll sanity for me. Wow. It's really hard to pass sanity when you have.

791
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Can you give me that blue set or just, yeah, whatever.

792
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,560
Fifty three on a twenty six. I fail. I fail. I fail with a sixty nine. Sixty two. I fail as well.

793
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Oh, nice. Clark, you don't lose. I'm not as sexually as Joe. You're all sixty nine.

794
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,560
You gain sanity. Dude, honestly, you're back to full sanity.

795
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,560
If you rolled like it doesn't have to be a positive, but if you roll sixty nine, nothing bad can happen.

796
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,560
It's like a fluke sick, like half success.

797
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,560
That's really interesting, though, because when you do sixty nine, something very bad could happen.

798
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,560
It's true. It never does. It's just always unsatisfying for both parties.

799
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Clark, you lose no sanity. The other two, you lose one sanity each.

800
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,560
And having this realization, you were both, I think, good to go.

801
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Right. I mean, we can talk about what you think that means, but it seems like you believe these people are going back in time.

802
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,560
I think that's going to make you question reality.

803
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,560
Definitely. I question reality.

804
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,560
I do. I do have one more question for Gary before we let him go.

805
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,560
Are you still on mute? You hear vaguely.

806
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,560
I'll switch him back. Hey, Gary, can you tell me a little bit about your grandfather?

807
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Well, yeah, he's a quiet man. He sang a lot.

808
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,560
Would you ever use the word wizard to describe him?

809
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Oh, yeah. I had a little dream last night and the boys.

810
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
Tell me about it. The boys can hear it.

811
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Well, I seem to have a memory from my past, but from a time before I could have memories, it was me.

812
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,560
And I think Clark is little babies in clinkers.

813
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,560
And you were putting some kind of protection on us. And you said your your grandpa was a wizard who had told you about it.

814
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,560
And you'd hope you hoped it would work. Did that happen, Gary?

815
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Well, yeah. How did you see that?

816
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:59,560
I have the second sight, Gary. It's become plain to me over the past two days, but that's neither here nor there.

817
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,560
John, I've never told you this. Keith Clark, you're on the phone as well.

818
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
I'm here.

819
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
Yeah?

820
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,560
I was always too afraid to actually let you know because I thought maybe it would have some sort of reaction.

821
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
You're all of our father? Are you our daddy?

822
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:23,560
But my grandfather, he gave me this book and it had three pages left in it.

823
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:30,560
And I was to read those pages after tearing them out of the book and then spill blood upon your heads.

824
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:38,560
Now, I know that sounds crazy, but when I did that, the words dance like magic on the page.

825
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,560
And they came off like sparks. And it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

826
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,560
And it surrounded you in this light, this bathe of light.

827
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:58,560
And I did it because my grandpa told me that the three of you, the three of you are the key to everything.

828
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Now, I know that sounds extreme, but I did my part.

829
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,560
I don't know what your part is, but it's time for you to take care of it. Seems like to me.

830
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,560
Wow, Gary. That's heavy.

831
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Gary, did your grandpa tell you what that did?

832
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,560
He just said fortune would be on your side.

833
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,560
It's a spell to give you 100 luck.

834
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,560
Well, thank you for telling us that.

835
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,560
He also mentioned it was a spell to give you 100 luck.

836
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
My mind is blown right now.

837
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
You finally have been for a 100-inch cop.

838
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
But anyway, Gary.

839
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,560
I don't know what kind of jokes John Lee Fadymore makes, but I think they're probably like that.

840
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,560
Better ones.

841
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,560
He does, yeah. He's smarter than that.

842
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,560
All right, well, good luck to y'all. I really need to get Mildred calmed down here.

843
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,560
You do that.

844
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,560
She does not like you all. Let me tell you, you need to stay away from her, I'm guessing.

845
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,560
All right, thanks for the heads up on that. And thank you for everything else, Gary.

846
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
You boys, thanks for blessing us.

847
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,560
Yeah, thanks for the magic.

848
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
Those children.

849
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

850
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,560
I don't know if I would have been able to handle it any earlier than this.

851
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Yeah, three days ago I wouldn't have believed you, Gary, so.

852
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Well, sounds like this is the time.

853
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Yeah.

854
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
He's still on the phone, isn't he? Or did we hang up?

855
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
Let's do a hang up just in case we haven't.

856
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,560
Click.

857
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Perfect.

858
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Keith reaches over and turns off your phone as he's saying bye.

859
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Wow.

860
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,560
We know we're all protected by a wizard's magic.

861
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
From what, though?

862
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,560
Which is nice.

863
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
Evil, presumably.

864
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Okay, I like that.

865
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Can you guys roll sanity for me?

866
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
Ninety-one.

867
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,560
I pass.

868
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
With a four.

869
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,560
Nice.

870
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
Clark, you lose no sanity.

871
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Nice.

872
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,560
Jon, you lose one more sanity.

873
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
I rolled an 18 on a 17.

874
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,560
Oh, fuck, that's so brutal.

875
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,560
You lose another sanity and you're down to 16.

876
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,560
That's the point I'm getting to, though.

877
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,560
Where are you guys at right now?

878
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Twenty-four.

879
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,560
Like, there's no fucking way to roll on this.

880
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
I've got a 26.

881
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Actually, there's literally a one in four chance, but there's not literally a one in four chance, but there's so nearly.

882
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
So close.

883
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:14,560
Well, I don't know what to think about having blood poured on me as a baby, but if it helps me not get attacked by evil spirits.

884
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
I like the part about the words dancing off the page.

885
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

886
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
It's like a Disney movie.

887
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,560
Are you guys buying that shit?

888
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,560
That he saw light around us and dancing and words?

889
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
There's no way.

890
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,560
I have seen stranger shit happen these past few days.

891
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,560
Yeah, I'll give you that.

892
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Okay, well, all I can tell you is they seem real sincere about it in the dream.

893
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:41,560
I didn't dream the part about the magic words, but I did see him put the blood on our heads and he seemed to be pretty into what he was doing.

894
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Would we know his grandpa's name?

895
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Is he somebody in our maybe town's history that we would know or anything like that?

896
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
Or just because we know Gary so well?

897
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
Yeah, of course.

898
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,560
I've changed Gary's grandpa's diapers.

899
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Gingerfrid daily.

900
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
Gingerfrid?

901
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Gingerfrid.

902
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,560
Gingerfrid, I like it.

903
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,560
We called him Fred.

904
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,560
Those who knew him.

905
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,560
Well, is there anything else we need to do before we head?

906
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
I guess we're heading there already.

907
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Yeah, we are on the highway.

908
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,560
This whole fucking episode is just...

909
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,560
The filter on the colorization changes as you drive into the city.

910
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Everything is drab and gray with a sickly green tint to it.

911
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,560
The streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids.

912
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,560
There is a scent in the air like someone left out cheese in a colostomy bag on every corner.

913
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:40,560
The faces of the buildings are slathered in billboards and the faces of the people bumbling about are bloated and lifeless.

914
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:48,560
In a strange opposition to all this depressive scenery, there are beautiful flowers in every shade and shape,

915
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:55,560
growing in every otherwise empty alleyway and out of many cracks in the sidewalks and roads.

916
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:04,560
Rosemary and her runner car leads you downtown to one of the tallest buildings scraping the putrid sky.

917
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,560
This towering building has a granite finish and the reflections wave as you approach,

918
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,560
turning down into a small parking garage below this massive stone high rise.

919
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Down in this parking garage, there are women in suits touching their earpieces like cliche security guards standing against the wall near the entrance.

920
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:34,560
There's an elevator door in a nearby corner and Rosemary parks, gets out, walks over, and presses the button and it lights up green.

921
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,560
Hey Rosemary, I know we're about to do some important stuff, but is the city always this floral?

922
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,560
Yeah, I asked an answer.

923
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,560
Okay, I get out of the car once we park. I guess we're already out of the car.

924
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,560
Yeah, we're on the way up the elevator. Or we're waiting for the elevator.

925
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,560
So what floor are we going to?

926
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
Eh, it'll take you.

927
00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:03,560
The door opens and the elevator's interior walls, floor, and ceiling are this like beautiful onyx and it's very reflective.

928
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,560
Nice elevator you got here.

929
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Doug is standing next to you guys.

930
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Should I come with you?

931
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
Yeah, you might as well.

932
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,560
Should I wait? It's up to you guys. I'll do whatever you want.

933
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:23,560
Hey Chad, you might look through all your pockets and if there's anything that says you're an FBI agent, leave it in the car?

934
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,560
Or should we bring them with us?

935
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,560
Let's bring them with us for protection, for power.

936
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:35,560
Yeah, we've got, we'll say we're not just a small town PD. We're working with the feds, you know?

937
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,560
Oh yeah, I think they'd probably give you leverage.

938
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,560
I dig it. Thanks Rosemary.

939
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,560
Also, I've got, I have the very tiny but very powerful gun like hidden away in my pants.

940
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Nice.

941
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,560
What about your weapons?

942
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:53,560
I've got like my pistol on my hip, but just in case I like try to take stuff away from me.

943
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,560
Okay.

944
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,560
What?

945
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,560
Thomas made a dick joke.

946
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,560
My weapons? Is that what you said?

947
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,560
You're like, I have a very tiny but very powerful thing in my pants.

948
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,560
I didn't catch it either.

949
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,560
That's good though.

950
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:19,560
We don't know what kind of jokes John Lee Pettymore makes, but we know what kind of jokes Thomas makes.

951
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,560
All right, so the four of you get in and the door closes.

952
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,560
As it's closing, I'll see you when you're finished, I guess.

953
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:39,560
In this elevator, there are no buttons, no numbers, no emergency phone, just this shimmering black mirror on all sides.

954
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,560
I hope it works.

955
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,560
Wait, so Rosemary didn't get in the elevator with us?

956
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,560
That is correct.

957
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Okay.

958
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,560
So it's just the four of us.

959
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,560
Okay.

960
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Are we moving up?

961
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
Nope.

962
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,560
Are we moving at all?

963
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,560
Nope.

964
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,560
I touched the wall.

965
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,560
It's cold.

966
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,560
It's a cold wall, guys.

967
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:00,560
John Clark says, elevator up.

968
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
Engage.

969
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
Engage.

970
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Elevator go.

971
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,560
Elevator skyward.

972
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,560
Clark jumps up and down.

973
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,560
Do I feel a give?

974
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,560
It doesn't move at all.

975
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,560
It's just all black walls, right?

976
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,560
Yep.

977
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,560
So I hold the gun up to where cameras might be.

978
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,560
I'm like, hey, we got what you're seeking.

979
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,560
We seek an audience.

980
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,560
One of the walls opens up.

981
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,560
What do we see?

982
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,560
You see a small room and a spotlight coming down on a figure behind a desk.

983
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,560
I walk in.

984
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,560
He's really killing it with the atmosphere.

985
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,560
Do you all walk in?

986
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,560
All things considered.

987
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,560
Yeah, I walk in.

988
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,560
How small a room?

989
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,560
12 by 8.

990
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,560
Nice.

991
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,560
What happens when you walk in?

992
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,560
Yeah, I go in.

993
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,560
The door closes behind you.

994
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,560
In front of you, there is a figure with a massive frame.

995
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,560
It is completely gaunt.

996
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,560
No muscle or fat.

997
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,560
You can just imagine skin stretched across long bones.

998
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:07,560
They're dressed in a fitted black tuxedo, and the spotlight shows off a bright red bowtie,

999
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,560
but only reaches to illuminate the lower half of this person's face.

1000
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,560
The skin on the chin is almost translucent.

1001
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,560
No hair.

1002
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:24,560
Not even a slight shadow of facial hair can be seen on either side of two thin, bright red lips.

1003
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,560
Actually, there's really no lips at all.

1004
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:34,560
Just this candy red lipstick messily encircling a round hole above the sharp see-through chin

1005
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,560
when the orifice begins to move.

1006
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,560
Hello?

1007
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,560
I am Marvin Glass.

1008
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,560
I know who you are.

1009
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,560
Do you know why you are here?

1010
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Kind of.

1011
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Not particularly.

1012
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
We think so?

1013
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,560
Why do you think we're here?

1014
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:02,560
Ferguson Fucking Beans was trying to buy my lost cocaine off a contention police officer.

1015
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,560
I wasn't going to let it get stolen again.

1016
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,560
That's why I sent Rosemary to take the money back.

1017
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,560
Money that is rightfully mine.

1018
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,560
Oh, we kind of thought you sent Rosemary after your boys.

1019
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,560
You know they're a missing rat.

1020
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,560
Or one of them is.

1021
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,560
And the other one's a lunatic now.

1022
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,560
I am fully aware of my son's condition.

1023
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,560
Yeah, I don't know anything about that cocaine deal.

1024
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,560
Who stole the cocaine from you originally?

1025
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:35,560
You don't know anything about the cocaine deal that you were one half of?

1026
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,560
Nope.

1027
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,560
I sure don't.

1028
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,560
Who stole the cocaine originally from you?

1029
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,560
That's not what we're here to discuss.

1030
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,560
Yeah, we're not here about the cocaine period.

1031
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,560
We're here about the gun.

1032
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:59,560
No, I specifically sent Rosemary to take the money from the deal and bring it back to me.

1033
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,560
I thought that is why you were here is to bring my money back and pay your pendants.

1034
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,560
I step up next to John.

1035
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,560
Rosemary definitely told her she was looking for the gun.

1036
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,560
Yeah, she was pretty obsessed with that gun.

1037
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,560
Doug.

1038
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,560
Yes.

1039
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,560
Doug, come on.

1040
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,560
I need to talk to you real quick.

1041
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,560
Okay, so I guess you guys walk into the corner of this dark room.

1042
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,560
Alright, Doug.

1043
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,560
What we need you to say is that the FBI has taken that money.

1044
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,560
They confiscated it all.

1045
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,560
If he asks you any details, we'll interrupt, alright?

1046
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:37,560
If you get in over your head, but I need you to say that that money is gone so we can get this conversation on the gun.

1047
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,560
Okay, yeah, sure.

1048
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,560
Alright, and you guys walk back.

1049
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:57,560
Sir, ma'am, I do believe that that money that you are speaking of is currently part of an ongoing investigation with the FBI and we have confiscated that money.

1050
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,560
Yeah, what he said.

1051
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,560
Yeah.

1052
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,560
That is not what Rosemary has told me.

1053
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,560
She said that you guys have the money.

1054
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,560
You brought it here for me.

1055
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Rosemary didn't say anything to us about some money.

1056
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,560
She said you really wanted that gun.

1057
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,560
That's what we brought.

1058
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,560
We're not here to talk about financial matters.

1059
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,560
We're here to talk about your son.

1060
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,560
Yeah.

1061
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,560
Oh, no, no, no.

1062
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,560
I am sorry.

1063
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,560
What I meant to say was...

1064
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:47,560
I am saddened by poor Alfred's condition that he must babble on about this gun, but that is not why you are here.

1065
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,560
Sir, we're not actually here about Alfred and the gun necessarily.

1066
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,560
We're here about getting Jermaine back.

1067
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,560
From what, the dead?

1068
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,560
From the past.

1069
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Go on.

1070
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,560
We have a theory.

1071
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,560
Yeah, well, it probably requires some backstories.

1072
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,560
Something's descended upon contention, the town we're from.

1073
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,560
And it seems to be spreading and it's not going to be long before it gets to the city.

1074
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,560
It took your boy.

1075
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,560
We think we can get him back, but we need your help.

1076
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:25,560
We shouldn't be asking for the resources of a criminal organization, I know that.

1077
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,560
But we don't have any other options.

1078
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:35,560
The FBI, you know, Doug here, Chad here is taking us seriously, but his higher-ups aren't.

1079
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,560
So they're not providing us with resources.

1080
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,560
What's happened to your boy has happened to a lot of people in our town and we're trying to get him back.

1081
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,560
If you can help us out, we can get your boy back to you.

1082
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:54,560
I believe that you underestimate my love of money.

1083
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:04,560
And overestimate my love for my pitiful son.

1084
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,560
Well, that is precisely the miscalculation we've made here, yeah.

1085
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,560
We have made a horrible mistake.

1086
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,560
Right. Rosemary really harped up that gun thing.

1087
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,560
It seemed like the one thing you wanted in the world, so we thought we could offer that to you.

1088
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:22,560
It seems that Rosemary must be taken care of in a different light.

1089
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,560
Yeah, she just walked away from five million dollars, by the way.

1090
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
I'm sorry.

1091
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,560
Just set it down when I asked her to. She could have brought you some of that money.

1092
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,560
He is visually agitated by you saying that.

1093
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,560
Clark wants to scan the room, are we alone?

1094
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,560
It seems to be just the four of you and this man.

1095
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,560
Do you have any more lights you could turn on?

1096
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:49,560
Good to see you, Keith. You know, I didn't expect you to be so effective when I hired you,

1097
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,560
everyone's favorite fuck-up, to murder your own brother.

1098
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,560
What are you talking about?

1099
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:01,560
It's a very good murder, Keith. You know, we fully expected your niece to have to finish the job.

1100
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:06,560
And out of the darkness, a teenage girl approaches and stands next to Marvin Glass.

1101
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,560
Keith, she flips you double birds and smiles as Marvin continues.

1102
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,560
She is being trained by a woman for the history books.

1103
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,560
And a third figure comes into the light.

1104
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:25,560
This woman is shaped like a football with spiky white hair frantically flopping atop a pointy head.

1105
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:32,560
She is wearing a large white lab coat and those big chunky evil scientist goggles that evil scientists wear.

1106
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:39,560
This pair is wonky, one goggle pointing down and away to accommodate the odd head shape of the wearer.

1107
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:50,560
This mad scientist stands tall behind Francis Beans, slowly tapping her long, wobbly fingers against Keith Sneese's collarbones.

1108
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,560
Keith, you didn't tell us you were involved in some series of unfortunate events shit.

1109
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,560
I don't have any idea what they're talking about.

1110
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,560
Me neither, with my thang.

1111
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,560
Francis, it's nice to see you.

1112
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,560
Francis and the woman behind her back away slowly.

1113
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,560
And once again, all you can see is the front half of the figure standing before you.

1114
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,560
Keith, if you're lying to us, god damn it.

1115
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,560
I look at the... Is this a woman or a man?

1116
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,560
It's Marvin.

1117
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:26,560
Okay, I look at Marvin, I look at both my co-police officers and I look at Marvin and I go, I think you owe me some money.

1118
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:32,560
Your winnings will be collected if you prove yourself worthy.

1119
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:39,560
John, I will help you if you prove yourself capable.

1120
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,560
Clark, I'm sorry you had to be here.

1121
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:56,560
The room begins to fill with a noxious gas.

1122
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,560
Clark is running back to where the door was, at least.

1123
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,560
It is closed.

1124
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,560
He's pulling and pushing and doing whatever.

1125
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,560
It's an elevator door, so you're fingering at the seams.

1126
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,560
Okay.

1127
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,560
Well, I mean...

1128
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,560
That's a bad word.

1129
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,560
I'm fingering the fuck out of the seams.

1130
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,560
We are really earning that explicit tag.

1131
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:28,560
Okay, so with my last bit of consciousness, I turned to Keith and I said, did you sell us out, you dirty son of a bitch?

1132
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,560
I would never.

1133
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,560
And then I pass out.

1134
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,560
How convenient.

1135
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:40,560
Congratulations on making the mob boss way fucking scarier than I thought it would be.

1136
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,560
Yeah, that was fucking dope.

1137
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,560
Yeah, very cool.

1138
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,560
You wake up to the feeling of cold metal awkwardly pressing against your skin.

1139
00:57:52,560 --> 00:58:01,560
It is abrasively loud, both from jubilant hollering and pulsing bass that shakes your chest and ribcage with each boom.

1140
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:07,560
You have each been crammed into individual cages made entirely of metal bars.

1141
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:13,560
These cages are hanging from the ceiling and outline this smoky, dimly lit room.

1142
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,560
There are three other cages next to your own.

1143
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:23,560
They are each inhabited by a person who has also been stripped down to their underwear, just as you have.

1144
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:34,560
There is one adult man that you do not recognize, one child, a boy, and also Doug in the body of Agent Chad.

1145
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:39,560
The man is massive and barely fits. His muscles bulge and press against the inside of the cage.

1146
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:47,560
And the child, the boy, he looks like he could slip right between the metal bars because he is so underfed and sickly looking.

1147
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,560
Fifteen feet below, you see the crowd.

1148
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:59,560
About twenty or so fancily clad individuals, each partaking in some sort of vice, be it drinking, smoking, snorting, or all of the above.

1149
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:07,560
The crowd is gathered in the middle of the room where there are recliners and couches, papasans and pallets of blankets and pillows.

1150
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,560
They lounge about and look up at the spectacle hanging above them in the middle of the room.

1151
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,560
Hanging above the middle of the room is another cage.

1152
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,560
It is made entirely of plexiglass.

1153
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,560
Inside, there are two teenagers viciously wrestling.

1154
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,560
One of them gets the upper hand and moves on top of their opponent.

1155
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,560
This kid starts beating the absolute shit out of the other.

1156
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,560
Both hands wailing directly into their face.

1157
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:38,560
Blood is spraying down onto the crowd below and they fucking love it.

1158
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:47,560
You notice that the floor of the fighting cage has little holes everywhere to allow anything to drip down onto the spectators.

1159
00:59:47,560 --> 01:00:00,560
I check in my underwear and see if my gun is still there, my tiny gun.

1160
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,560
It's always there, baby.

1161
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:42,560
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

1162
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:53,560
How can you have enough drowning out all the noise?

1163
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:57,560
There's no light at all.

1164
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:02,560
No light at all.

1165
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,560
No light at all.
