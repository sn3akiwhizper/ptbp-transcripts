00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Greetings my baby chickens. It's your mother hen wolf the dog

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,120
And I'm here to nest upon all of the eggs of contention hatching them into my own personal chicken army

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,280
I'm clucking at you live from

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,600
694.2 PTBP as always my chickadees

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:28,000
Real quick before we get up and started the boys from pretended to be people wanted me to let you know they are accepting

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Questions for a third Q&A

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,840
Episode so if you have questions for any of the monsters that make that show tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,960
There will also be a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions or post them on our Facebook page

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,920
Fuck you mark fucker burg or email them to pretending pod at gmail.com

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,140
Or and seriously y'all should go do this go all out record audio of you asking your questions

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,320
And send that so they can use it in the episode much like the second Q&A episode

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,920
This one will be for our honorary police officers over on patreon who keep this show alive five bucks a month at a time

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,160
Speaking of things my producer forces me to read each week

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,440
We got a new howling at wolf for y'all

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,060
This week's is from at mad under dash seed who tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:35,060
It reads as follows if you're not sure what kind of officer you're dealing with from contention PD

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,340
Just check the fit of the pants and listen to pretending to be people for one of the best actual play

18
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,420
Podcast out there love the podcast and wish there was a higher donor tear smiles

19
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,300
Madeline man, I miss seeing those officers in the future

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:59,020
You would think an entity could never truly miss a despicable being such as Keith Vigna and you'd be right

21
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,620
Don't worry Madeline

22
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,980
There may be more questionable content for you to throw even more of your hard-earned money at in the future

23
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Sometimes when looking forward it is important to glance behind and remind your mind that

24
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,860
Mankind is designed inclined and resigned to die

25
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,220
It's time for the news

26
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,900
Last time Ken Krenkelhoff Liz

27
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,180
Longlin and Jeremy Pettymore came across a large frame hanging in the woods

28
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:36,060
Can realized an old memory was closer to reality than he had hoped but he was able to disable a trap that otherwise

29
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:44,260
would have put a giant wooden spear through someone's mouth and out the back of the head through the broken canvas in the frame the

30
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,020
three see a cabin in the woods Ken

31
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
susceptible to being scared of cliches

32
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,200
Freaked out grabbed the spear and charged toward the cabin and then he disappeared into a pile of leaves

33
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,420
Ash hornbeam was down on hope and hit points

34
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,500
But a man in a black suit with a bolo tie came out of nowhere to interrogate him

35
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:13,120
After agent Kevin got the information ash had to think quickly in order to not become just another missing person in the woods

36
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,220
Thankfully his quick wit and false reputation was enough to convince agent Kevin to spare him for now

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,040
Now this next sentence may sound a bit kooky

38
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:32,100
But agent Kevin came back with a woman named agent Karen who chanted over a machete and then in one swift motion

39
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,580
Took off ashes arm in the middle of his forearm

40
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,340
Stranger still the wound immediately cauterized and flesh grew to form a nub

41
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,080
They took ash to a black car hidden in thick brush where they are set up to stake out a cabin in the woods

42
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,420
Sharon shadow Berryman somewhere between unaware and

43
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:01,500
Purposefully oblivious followed Krista Kringlehoff off the path into the darkness and directly into a skip bow trap

44
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,580
Right around the ankle it then became clear that perhaps Krista Kringlehoff isn't quite herself

45
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,740
Judy Kringlehoff having seen the body of the state ranger ed buzz

46
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,320
Woodrow all spineless and shit walked back out into the darkness the rain

47
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,020
The parking lot of the contention woods and then she made a terrible decision

48
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:30,020
Taking us from here in the warm glow and comfort of Wolf's secret hideout

49
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,020
That is definitely not a trash can to that moment in the shivering wet

50
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,940
Darkness lit only by strikes of lightning in the distance. It's blue false

51
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,420
indigo with

52
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,020
Oh

53
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,940
Time has come

54
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,020
to

55
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,900
Dance beneath a dance beneath the shadow of the moon

56
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,180
a lightning bolt flashes in the distance and it's just enough to light up a

57
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,300
blood-covered

58
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Krista Kringlehoff

59
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Who is walking?

60
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Directly toward you

61
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,580
The raccoon at your side

62
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,420
Shivers something fierce and is like

63
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,420
Right

64
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:29,580
Tugs at your arm and then just fucking takes off running backwards like back towards no like crab walking. Yeah. No it runs

65
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:37,060
Like into the parking lot trying to get to the street, okay, but not running back towards the shack hell no

66
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,140
Okay, running as far away from these woods here as possible. Okay, I don't follow him

67
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,700
I state I stay there cuz I'm first of all

68
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,380
Freaking out from the body and I am not sure what to think of my mom. So I I stand there Judy

69
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,940
Judy Judy

70
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,980
That girl that girl that you were with is she is no good

71
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,260
She was not trying to help look for Liz at all

72
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,940
in fact, she she told me she told me that she wanted to just run back to the woods with her and

73
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,620
And and told me to come back out here

74
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
I'm so scared for you

75
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,540
Maybe we should go back up to the shack and I'll see if I can find some band-aids in your purse to help fix

76
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:29,020
You up that is an excellent idea. Thank you so much. Okay, so I guide her back up to the shack

77
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,800
I'm like holding on to her and helping her walk and then as soon as we get to the shack

78
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,460
I want to get her in the shack and close the door you do so

79
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,260
Okay, and then I can't find a lock or anything. So at this point I just close the door and I'm just holding it

80
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,180
Okay, well my mother is inside. Yeah, absolutely and as you're holding the door. Oh

81
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
Shit

82
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,020
You feel a pinch on the back of your neck and

83
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,860
when you turn around you see that your

84
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,860
mom's body has crumpled to the ground and

85
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:18,740
Standing in front of you its metallic arms shoved into the ground and the ceiling and the walls of the shack in

86
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,460
The middle of which is a small one inch in diameter metal sphere

87
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,740
One of these tendrils reaches around

88
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,140
with another tendril it snaps Judy Krenkelhoff's neck forward and

89
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,780
rips out her spine

90
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,980
shoving itself

91
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,700
Into the spinal column and filling it and

92
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,300
You Allie are now playing this entity

93
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,260
Okay in which you remember all of these strange memories

94
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,980
All of these details, but you are an objective based

95
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,100
Entity and your objective is to collect as many

96
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,860
Bodies as possible

97
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:16,860
So your goal Allie is to get one-on-one with one of the other players and pass off this entity

98
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:23,500
That way it can collect more bodies. Okay, and you will also know what has recently happened

99
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
So, you know that you came to the woods as Judy Krenkelhoff

100
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:34,980
With shadow and Liz and you know that you were out there to do a spell or a ritual

101
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:41,300
But that is all the information from Judy Krenkelhoff that you know, everything else will just have to be

102
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
hog shit and horse lies

103
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,540
Makes improv easier. I

104
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,520
Told my parents about this podcast. My dad was like, so you just lie quick

105
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,300
It's like yep. He's like you're gonna be good at that

106
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
Life

107
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,980
Do we know any of the other words to that song cuz I don't yeah, I think it's a lot of bad

108
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,180
I think it's a lot of bus. What if it was just that the whole time?

109
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,260
Alright, Joe

110
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,060
You're sliding on your back and you can feel the

111
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,380
Mud and sludge is making this slide a bit more

112
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:50,300
Liquid and thick viscous. However still enough to slide you down and you are sliding for some time

113
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,940
before you land

114
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,300
Eventually in a pit of dirt and pitch blackness. Can I get a sense of how much lateral movement I had

115
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,780
So much lateral movement, so I'm like underground yeah, you might think that with all that lateral movement you've slid

116
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,620
underneath this cabin

117
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:17,380
That far perfect fuck you are on your back scared out of your gourd because it's spooky time. Everything's a

118
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,280
And you you're scared out of your coconut this Halloween

119
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Oh

120
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,680
Patreon listeners will remember our episode in Hawaii

121
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:38,440
Coconuts were the gourds of that game. All right, so you feel dirt and rock

122
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:46,120
Underneath your hands. I want to try and stand up. Can I almost all the way before your head hits a piece of wood? Oh

123
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,080
Shit, it's wood. Can I look up back? What if I had said stone? I know I wasn't sure

124
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,560
Can I look back up the slide? I just came down. Can I see any daylight or I mean moonlight?

125
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,440
There's no daylight or moonlight coming down from where you came from. You know, it kind of would have been cool

126
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
If it had been daylight

127
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,040
You can tell it's the Sun making this light it's a different color

128
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,840
Is there any light in this area that I know you are in perfect Vin Diesel darkness?

129
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Did I hang on to my spear on my way through? Oh

130
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Go ahead and roll

131
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,080
dexterity

132
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,760
Okay

133
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,000
Can crinkle Hoff so good at sport? I'm a sport sports boy

134
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,040
32 on a

135
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,760
75 so good at holding on to his giant spear and it is

136
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,800
Horizontal with where you are. It would not be able to stand up as you remember it being longer than you

137
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,080
Can I okay, you know how long you are as a human?

138
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
If

139
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,620
I look up I've deduced that I'm maybe under the cabin. Is it floorboards above me?

140
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,120
Is it maybe slats of wood? It's not no because there's no light coming down this I said it was yeah

141
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,520
So therefore there's no slats of wood of you

142
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:09,540
Can I want to just lightly push and see if it maybe is hopefully a door that I'm under you do not seem to be

143
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,160
under a door

144
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,640
Do you have anything on you that could make a light of any kind

145
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,520
Yeah, he doesn't have a lighter because he's such a good boy. I mean I was out camping

146
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,840
Maybe I have a flashlight on me. Is there a role to determine if I had a flashlight on me? Yeah, absolutely

147
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,460
Let's just roll an up and down 50% look if you roll under you succeed if you roll over you fail

148
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,280
They're rolled over oh, but it's a 69 our house rule makes that a

149
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
You

150
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,600
Have whatever light source you want one of those ones that lights it up like daylight

151
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,380
It'll burn the wood. It's so bright. I

152
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,040
Just got a nice big mag light. Yeah, you absolutely do

153
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,040
I flipped that bad boy on when you flip it on you see that you are in the crawl space

154
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,740
But this doesn't seem like a place that is often used

155
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,660
However, you do see what looks like maybe floor supports

156
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,500
However, they are tube like in nature and as you flash the flashlight

157
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,360
Over them you see that they are

158
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,220
translucent tubes that are filled

159
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:29,300
With this squeamish black ooze that seems to be traveling downward

160
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,600
from above into the ground below

161
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,100
My god Zach, you're the coolest

162
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,740
You also see on the far side away from you there's a door that leads up

163
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,060
I mean, I think Ken would for sure maybe try back the slidey way

164
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,680
Can he get any purchase to get back up the slide that he came down? Oh interesting

165
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,100
I don't think he would want to be going into the house if he could help it. Yeah, that makes sense

166
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,300
Go ahead and give it a go with an

167
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,700
Athletics check are you bringing the spear or no? Yeah, that's not gonna leave my side

168
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,620
Okay, if at all possible go ahead and take a negative 20 on the athletics check

169
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,180
And it's a fail

170
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:24,420
70 on what would be a 30 you continue to try and try but there's so much

171
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,500
Sludge in this area that it's like the Japanese game show slippery stairs. That's what I was picturing and

172
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,240
You're not green. Dang. Yeah should have bet on blue

173
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Okay, then I am going to

174
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,540
cautiously approach the

175
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,420
Cautiously approach the door and I want to put my ear to it. Do I hear any sounds on the other side?

176
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,420
We'll find out after we

177
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
You

178
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,180
Luke

179
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:17,840
Ashhorn beam walks to this black sedan and this four-wheeler that are out in the middle of these woods in this thick of brush

180
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
of trees and

181
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,160
Agent Kevin looks at you. All right

182
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,640
Get on get on in we're staking up this this cabin

183
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:33,200
I'll tell you more and and he opens up the back door for you ash kind of hesitantly

184
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,400
He looks at the FBI agents and for one moment he thinks about just taking off

185
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,340
It's raining. It's dark, but he doesn't it takes him about three seconds

186
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:53,220
Which seems like five minutes and he hops into the back of the car and when you hop into the back of this black

187
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,580
Sedan sitting in the back seat on the other side is a man who is quite tall

188
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,300
it's wearing the same black suit white shirt black tie and

189
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,420
he's blonde but his hair is like buzzed and he's in his early 30s and

190
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,980
He looks at you and immediately flashes you a FBI badge and it's like agent Kyle

191
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,460
Nice to meet you ash looks over at him doesn't say anything

192
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,980
Buckles his seat belt and looks straight at the ground or the floor of the car

193
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:32,780
I suppose agent Karen gets in the shotgun seat and agent Kevin gets in the driver's seat and

194
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,280
Looking at the floorboards you see that there's a bunch of electrical spool wiring

195
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,440
Yeah, we got some we got some pretty cool explosives in the back man. Yeah, I'm gonna blow this thing the fuck up, right?

196
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry

197
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,720
It's gonna be tight man. Ash is super cool. Ash looks at him and

198
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
He's immediately intrigued

199
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,600
he starts looking at the spool on the floorboard and he's immediately reminded of

200
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,240
The time that him and his father set up

201
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,240
fireworks display for the town for contention and

202
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,560
Ash gets super excited. He looks at the FBI agent opens up his jacket a little bit to reveal

203
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,520
what I called water dynamite sure and then I

204
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:35,000
show him the other side of my jacket, which is two sticks of actual dynamite and I

205
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
wink and finger gun

206
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,360
Well young sir, that's dino might and hopefully we don't die tonight. I

207
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,520
Look back at the floor and I just kind of pick up the piece of the wire

208
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:57,380
Like look at him and look at the wire. It's like just smile. What's your name young sir? Um, my name's ash hornbeam

209
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And you've always sounded like that

210
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So

211
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,840
As you guys ash hornbeam that's that's more like it my name's I ash hornbeam my name's ash hornbeam I

212
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
think I kind of

213
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,480
Really steered into this is the way names of that thick southern Malayas

214
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,080
I was trying to do a port of relaxing

215
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,000
As you're looking out ahead of you you see this cabin that's sitting out in this small clearing and

216
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,360
Outside the cabin you see that there is sack is scrolling on his computer

217
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm I'm

218
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,960
Intrigued and worried there seems to be some sort of outdoor building almost like a pod, you know

219
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,120
Like a storage locker kind of unit thing. Yeah

220
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:57,320
There's one of those and there's also a big yellow excavator sitting outside and you had our pillar

221
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
yeah, exactly and

222
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,320
You would also notice that there is a moat that surrounds this cabin

223
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,240
You can't tell how wide it is or how deep it is because you're still pretty far away

224
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,800
But you can see glinting off the surface of this water is the moonlight and that's how you kind of catch that

225
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,040
There's water there and then you see to the left of the cabin

226
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,920
movement outside the moat or yes, yeah about 25 yards out and

227
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,480
You see Liz lonklin is with your two friends

228
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,040
Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krenkelhoff and they are like

229
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,880
Walking around this kind of thing and then they all stop and they're talking to each other and then Ken picks up this small log

230
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,080
And throws it on the ground and you see this wooden spear seven feet long

231
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,100
Just like flies in their direction and then hits a tree

232
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
immediately

233
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,320
Ken

234
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,640
Crabs this giant wooden spear out of the tree and takes off running and as he takes off running

235
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,720
Towards the cabin still like 20 yards away from the moat at this point. He just disappears

236
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:18,820
He like falls into the ground running away or towards and he falls into the ground and is completely out of sight

237
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Dude I'm trying to describe my

238
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,180
What I looked like just then just I could not Luke look like a possum in headlights

239
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,700
Deer in the headlights, but or just a possum a possum in a flashlight

240
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,860
Kevin looks in the rearview mirror and he's like, oh, do you uh, do you know them and he looks back and he's like

241
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,820
We were looking around this place is just chock full of traps. Well, what is this place?

242
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,900
You know that mad you were talking about? Yeah, I don't know if that's her name or if that's her name now, but

243
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,860
Is she?

244
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,740
She's real. Oh, she's real. I always kind of thought

245
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,940
Kind of just a reason to get us out here, but overall sanity for me

246
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,060
The 99 is good, right? Oh

247
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,100
Yes, yes it is Luke it is very good what does that mean

248
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,860
Well, it means you take max damage, which was gonna be a d4 plus one. So you lose five sanity

249
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,300
I don't get to roll my d4. No, you do not you automatically take maximum

250
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,720
Sanity hit. So what was your sanity at? I was at I think 38. Let me see

251
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,940
37 so I'm down to 32 32 and also we're doing bouts of insanity

252
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,820
For this game here

253
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,740
And so when you lose five or more sanity in a single loss

254
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:56,020
My breaking point is also 32. Well, then that happens to work out fucking perfectly because you're gonna lose your shit. So

255
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,540
You remember in the old?

256
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,220
Campaigns we ran when you lost five or more sanity. We did fight flight or faint, right?

257
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,140
So did we do that on the podcast or was that not yet? Oh, man

258
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,420
All right

259
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:14,140
So Luke basically you're given the option fight flight or faint you need to rank them and most likely to least likely

260
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,660
Her ashes reaction for ash fight is number one. Sure

261
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,340
Faint is number two flight is the last one

262
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,460
He doesn't run away from anything unless he has to if you roll one two or three

263
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,980
You're gonna fight if you roll a four or five you're gonna faint and if you roll a six you're gonna flight

264
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,340
Am I rolling a d6 d6 for me?

265
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,820
This is the first time I've used the d6 that Joe gave us. Oh nice and heavy

266
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:46,020
When did Joe give us these he gave you and I those for Thomas's birthday

267
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,180
Which is that is listener

268
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:56,300
very indicative of Joe Terry is to give lots of people gifts for

269
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:04,180
Someone's birthday. He's the nicest person. He just knows that you and I are those kids like the kids birthday party

270
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:10,340
Why did he get presents? I want something too. If Thomas gets a treat

271
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,020
I want it too. I just had terribly vivid memories of La Croix boy. Oh

272
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
Jesus we did

273
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,860
We had fun

274
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,340
Roll that d6 formula

275
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,980
What do you think I got I think you got a six I got a six on your slump the slump in your shoulders

276
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:35,220
Yeah, I got a six. So I think that's a flight. That is a flight. Damn it

277
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,480
That works out really well for me personally. I'm sure I'd leave the room. Yeah, get the fuck out of here. Okay. Bye. Bye

278
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,340
You

279
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,300
Thomas Lindsay who what that's fair Jeremy Pettymore and Liz lonklin are

280
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:09,260
Standing in the dark of the woods is and you see working a body of Ken Krenkelhoff

281
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:15,340
What just fucking disappear into the ground ahead of you and it begins to rain

282
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,700
It's like pouring starts light, but you hear in the distance a storm is coming

283
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,460
Oh shit Liz, it sounds like a storms coming. He's gonna drown in that hole. I need you

284
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,140
I need you both through all sanity. I need it

285
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,740
27 on

286
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,220
75 damn he has good sanity. That's like the one good thing of all these characters

287
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,780
So you will not lose any sanity and you're like, yeah, you fell into a hole. He's just playing. Yeah

288
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,860
A 62 on wait, I'm confused. So you've got current and max. Okay. I think it's a 32

289
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,980
Yes, that would make sense and you rolled far above that. So you're gonna just lose one sanity putting your current at 31 and

290
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,520
Liz is gonna start to freak out a little bit. You're out here. You don't know what part of the woods you're in

291
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
You've never seen this cabin before

292
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Ken Krenkelhoff

293
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:22,220
Prominent player in the stylus Cole K through 12 community just disappeared not only into the ground

294
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,140
But also off of your list of suitable bachelors

295
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,140
Wait, you mean you was considering freshman only one

296
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,460
Jeremy falls into a hole

297
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,460
Of

298
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,900
His own making

299
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,900
Okay, so where we are I'm going and see yeah a little bit

300
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:57,620
Do you guys want to move toward the cabin or move away from the cabin or I want to move towards the hole

301
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,020
Yeah, we saw okay

302
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,980
So moving up to the hole you would see that he slid into like a pile of leaves

303
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,540
That turned into a mudslide pit

304
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,220
It looks like the top of a slide that's made out of sludge that

305
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,420
Disappears at an angle into the ground and then looking forward you see the cabin

306
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:26,860
It's far more well lit. Now. The lights are on inside so you can see it from you know, the window lights

307
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:34,720
I suppose however, you can also see in the moonlight that outside there is a storage container seemingly like a small

308
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,040
rectangular box separate from the cabin itself as well as

309
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,920
Big yellow excavator sitting outside the cabin and about

310
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,640
ten yards away from the cabin encircling it is a moat and

311
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,800
The moonlight is reflecting off of the water of this moat

312
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,440
Both of you roll an alertness check for me. Actually, whoever's got a better alertness will count

313
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,160
50 same I rolled a 31 beautiful

314
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,280
We'll use that as you also notice that there are some fish flopping up out of the water

315
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,000
Strange for a moat size size of fish. Do we get to see them? Yeah, what was the size small mouth?

316
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
base

317
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,120
base bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb wow wow, you guys know how

318
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Look in the moat

319
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,240
All right, I'm done all right, so you guys are

320
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,800
In the pale fish light wrong freshman and so you guys

321
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,600
It's a popular 90s how the song goes popular 90s song that I wasn't role-playing

322
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,040
I don't give a fuck. So you see that

323
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,740
What do you guys do does anyone want to take the slide or you're gonna approach the cabin this reminds me of that fish song

324
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,080
Not the band fish, but that song about the fish in the moonlight. I don't know. It's weird. What where did Ken go?

325
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,800
What what's going on? I mean, I've told people before but my buddies didn't believe me

326
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,980
But I've I've seen madge in these woods. Do you believe in old mange? What the hell is madge?

327
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,960
Oh man, just the witch that haunts these woods

328
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,080
And I think she might be the witch playing tricks on us tonight. Does she live in that house?

329
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,520
There's only one way to find out let's go

330
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,520
Approaching the moat you see that it is about five feet across to the other side. It's absurdly large moat for

331
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
a cabin in the woods

332
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,800
It's useful. Is there is the shed or any other thing on the other side of the moat?

333
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,520
Everything is inside the moat. You want to try to throw me across?

334
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:20,480
I like that you went to me throwing you and not you throw me throw me Liz Liz is so much smaller boy

335
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,440
Wait, we do we still have the other guy with him? No, he fell down the mud hole. No the other she lost sanity. Oh

336
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,660
Yeah, we were supposed to be finding him but good fucking look

337
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,240
Did you completely forget about your dog man, listen the way Zach is running this we're going in and out of this room

338
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,680
It's been a while. Yeah, we got rusty here

339
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,720
Can we throw rusty rusty

340
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,880
Why don't you make a human rusty is easily six foot three and I want him to make a human bridge

341
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,960
Across this river. Yes do it. I'm gonna throw so I'm gonna scatter some smokies like on the other side

342
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,720
And I like kind of like demonstrate with motions like what I want him to do to share the Smokies hold his feet

343
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Make sure he doesn't jump and yeah pretty much

344
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,080
That's that's actually what I'll just do

345
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,400
I'll just like I'll toss some Smokies to the other like sure and I'll hold his feet as he leaps across for them

346
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Okay, good idea Liz

347
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Thanks, I

348
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,760
That happens and we eagerly run across his back

349
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Which is Kevin, okay

350
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,560
Eagerly run across his back to a witch's cabin is a little too long for the episode title, but it's

351
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,360
It's close. So I need you whoever has the worst dexterity to roll dexterity. Probably me

352
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,800
I have 25 50. Yeah, Liz lonklin makes it across

353
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,480
Very easily. Oh shit. You better make it. I didn't 63. I

354
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
step on his balls

355
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,760
Rusty has his ankles on one shore being held by Jeremy petty more and he reaches out for the

356
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,960
tiny meat fingers on the other side of the moat and he

357
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,680
Grasps onto the ground on the other side and as soon as he makes that bridge connection

358
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,840
you know like when two grandmas become friends Liz lonklin just

359
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,720
Rushes across the body and rusty and Jeremy

360
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:42,360
following shortly after all people play bridge this is toe stuck right in the crotch of all rusty and

361
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
You know when you stub your toe on a taint

362
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,600
Everyone knows that sensation and so you fall and you hit rusty and you both fall into the moat

363
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Well, I didn't put any points to swim

364
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,340
But I did put points into survival. So I'm gonna use my survival instincts to remember how to swim

365
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,680
What's your survival at 50 go ahead and roll on a 30

366
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
Really negative 20

367
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,680
21 that is a success. I that is a success

368
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,960
Can't wrinkle off no fuck sorry, Jeremy petty more just like

369
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,220
Hazardly throws his arms about thrashing in this fish filled water

370
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,220
Oh

371
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Wait, I'm fine. I'm sorry and he crawls still think I'm cool on to the other side rolling my eyes a wet mess

372
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,220
Hi Liz

373
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,420
Rusty crawls out on the other side away from you on the other side. Yeah, do you run away?

374
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,640
He looks at Jeremy petty more and holds out his hand

375
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
for more flesh pencils

376
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,500
Okay, I like I drop a couple on this side of the river but I move on

377
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,820
Okay, as soon as you turn around and move on you hear him snacking behind you. He's cleared

378
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,340
Jumping over this five-foot wide moat and he is with okay

379
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:19,420
I want to leave Smokies like a like a little just a little trail the whole way I go

380
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:25,060
All right, and you guys are approaching this cabin where I so you've got two buildings and a giant excavator

381
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:33,140
One of the buildings is much smaller and is the size of like a small storage pod that you see sometimes in people's

382
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,580
driveways like before or after a move and

383
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:42,660
Then you have the cabin which has a front porch and a single door window on either side of the door

384
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,440
Can we choose to look in the window before pursuing?

385
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,300
Absolutely. All right, go ahead and roll stealth for me

386
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,700
Jeremy petty more. What are you doing? I'm

387
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,300
Edging my way towards the storage unit, okay

388
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,280
I rolled an 85 so you stumble up the

389
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,840
Stairs to the front porch of this cabin and like slam your hands down on the wooden porch

390
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:14,040
And then you walk up and you stick your head up in the window and looking inside

391
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:22,500
You see a lot of equipment that you have never seen in your entire life before this is not a home

392
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
this is a lab and

393
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,380
You see there are I'm having flashbacks to the OA

394
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,140
Translucent tubes. That's your fucking sock. I

395
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,780
Was just waiting for him to say that I

396
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,380
We're not talking about the OA. Okay, at the end they stop a school shooting with their

397
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,140
All right, the worst episode of television

398
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
You can just cut this watch the whole thing

399
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,980
First season. All right. Did you know?

400
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,940
Okay, moving on not after the first season. I

401
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,380
Heard it was good, but I can't imagine now. That's true

402
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,780
There's the edit point

403
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,980
Looking inside all of this equipment is completely outside your grasp. However, you see these

404
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:18,140
translucent tubes that are running all over the place up the walls along the ceiling and

405
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,620
Then they're going down into the floorboard

406
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,420
underneath and they are all filled with a

407
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,860
squeamish black

408
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:34,140
Viscous goo that is making its way below the cabin around on the other sides

409
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:41,320
You see a desk littered with papers so many papers strewn about there's like a cork board with a bunch of more papers

410
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:47,460
Thumb tacked up to it and you see in the corner of the room. There is a

411
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,140
large wooden trunk

412
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,900
Jeremy petty more you are edging

413
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:03,100
Go on your way make you wait for it. Yeah, you think so and

414
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,900
You don't come across the storage yet

415
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,780
But you you make your way over to the storage, you know

416
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:26,020
Okay, there's a daily Jeremy petty more wants to know if our actions in the past can affect the future you're in your present

417
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,460
I know so everything you do affects the future. Mm-hmm. What would you like to do Jeremy petty more?

418
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:36,380
I'd like to try to get into the storage shed. All right, Lindsay. I'm gonna have you leave the room. All right

419
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
You

420
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,940
Jeremy petty more you open up the door to this

421
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,780
small

422
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,740
Rectangular room as you do so a light comes on inside

423
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,660
It's dimly lit

424
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,420
But as you walk in or poke your head in

425
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:15,760
You see one side is a closet full of outfits on the other side of the room

426
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,160
You

427
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,880
Lined up hanging up against the wall

428
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Are the bodies of?

429
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
roughly 15 people

430
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,800
they are all hanging on hooks from a hole in the back of their neck and

431
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,040
The way they are slumped makes you think that none of them have a spinal cord

432
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,740
Jeremy anymore turns to the door and he screams

433
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Oh

434
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Roll sanity

435
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Yeah, then that was a great reaction

436
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
You

437
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,440
Lindsay I think you probably heard from the kitchen Thomas scream

438
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,920
And you see Jeremy petty more fucking book it out of this small external room

439
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,400
You're up on the porch, what do you do I run run towards the guy that helped us over the moat

440
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,680
He's just like on the ground eating smokies. You gotta toss some smokies. Fuck. I call them

441
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,920
I'm gonna like push him down and cross him over the bridge, but also leave some smokies behind me. So he doesn't totally hit us

442
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,560
But like I am in panic mode. I am fucking bolting. I am making my rusty bridge

443
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,120
I'm not even gonna worry about what's behind me. I'm just running for my life

444
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:01,000
I need both of you to roll an alertness or survival

445
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,040
Whichever one is higher for you. I passed both 30 on a 50 for both of those

446
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,240
56 on a 50 56 on a 50. All right, this will basically be

447
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Lethality rule so

448
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,680
Oh

449
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,800
The two of you take off running you throw down rusty across the moat you make it to the other side you leave some

450
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,680
micro rusty run

451
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Micro pains on the other side and as you dip into the woods Liz you hear a click underneath your foot

452
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,060
Can I immediately stop sure without pulling my foot up? Yeah, absolutely

453
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,220
And before you can let the breath out

454
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,520
a

455
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
giant metal claw

456
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:01,320
Swings down from the branch on the tree above you and takes your head clean off as blood begins

457
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:10,120
Burt out of the body above you and blood is literally showering like Vegas water feature style

458
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,480
out of the space in between your shoulders and

459
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,880
You fall to your knees like shooting a guy in the dick and double-oh-seven you like hit your knees and then you hit your

460
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
shoulders on the ground

461
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,340
Jeremy petty more roll a sanity check Jeremy petty more doesn't see any of Jeremy petty more didn't see

462
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,900
Okay, actually roll alertness and see if you saw it you can do either one he's fine

463
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,200
He sees it he knows that he's the survivor and he keeps going

464
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
He got a 29

465
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,460
He's like well that was the cool older punk girl had a crush on but better her than me

466
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
Oh

467
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,840
That the time has come

468
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:41,240
To dance beneath a dance beneath the shadow of the moon

469
00:42:44,480 --> 00:43:04,040
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

470
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,640
She moves, she moves, she moves

471
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,640
With the howling wind

472
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,440
The sun, the sun, the sun

473
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,640
Has come again, come again

474
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:31,240
Her eyes, her eyes

475
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,240
Have seen it all

476
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,240
The wonders of, the wonders of

477
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,240
The shadow of the moon

478
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:09,040
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
