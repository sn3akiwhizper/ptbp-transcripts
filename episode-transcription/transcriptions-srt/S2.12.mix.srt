1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Salutations and vibrations, my faithful listenership.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,520
It's your large and in-charge DJ Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,040
I am sending vibrations of various lengths to you

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,760
live from 694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,480
The only radio station.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,960
It's the only one, folks.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,800
Do not attempt to listen to any others.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,480
They do not exist.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,280
Hands off that dial.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,280
Do not turn your ears away from Wolf or else.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,320
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jared

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,440
in Houston, Texas, who tweeted about the show

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,000
and tagged at Pretending Pod.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
And now he gets to send this wolfy memorandum

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
to Oliver in Mishawaka, Indiana.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,420
Jared writes, to Oliver Chestnut,

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,820
you are my greatest and best friend.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,460
We have shared laughter and love,

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,780
memories that will last until the stars are right,

20
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,780
and most importantly, comedy TTRPG podcasts.

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,060
The journey may be long and the old ones may be near,

22
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,820
but so long as I walk the path with you,

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,060
it will be a road worth taking.

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,500
Whether we are vampire cops datin' their partner,

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,940
archimites checkin' out the cold Corbett house,

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,380
or Delta Green agents vibin' on reverb,

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,460
I'm glad that it was us who took those journeys.

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,460
Well, technically you took those journeys.

29
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,940
I was busy playin' God and found it a game worthy of me.

30
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,940
May your smile shine and your hair always be anime colored.

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,100
Love, Jared.

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,620
PS, Fuck Mark Zuckerberg and Fuck Jack Dorsey.

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,620
PPS, love and energy to those pretending pod fellas,

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,740
and to the original phantom of truth, Wolf the dog.

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,460
Jared, thank you for this internet mail.

36
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,500
I appreciate all forms of mail.

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,780
The internet kind, those ones are good.

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,940
You mainly said a lot of things about Oliver,

39
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,420
and that's good stuff.

40
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,060
We love to see it, and I hope Oliver appreciates

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,220
all the weird stuff you made me say out loud.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,660
But the it that I love to see

43
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,980
is you sayin' that good, good stuff about little old me.

44
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,740
Smiles and kisses to you, dear Jared.

45
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,620
If you wanna write up somethin' for your Wolf the howl,

46
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,060
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

47
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,700
tag pretendin' to be people on Facebook,

48
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,460
or write up a five star review

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,060
on the podcast app of your choice.

50
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,340
Screenshot them aromatic and intimate words,

51
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,740
and pass it along to your vibratin' Wolf the dog.

52
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,260
But Wolf, how am I supposed to know

53
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,540
where to find the 34 bonus episodes on Patreon,

54
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,820
or the grace drippin' swag in the merch store,

55
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,900
or the rowdy conversations in the Discord,

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,180
or the comments from Luke in the subreddit,

57
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,140
or the songs from Wave's soundtrack on YouTube,

58
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,860
or the download for R.I. Peter's Cruisin'.

59
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,060
Now listen, you, and listen good.

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,140
Say it with me, everyone.

61
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,980
The links are in the show notes.

62
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,260
And now, it's time for two quick announcements

63
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,900
from my producer, who scrawled this on my mirror

64
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,860
and waited under the sink until I found it.

65
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,620
No spoilies, but this is the final episode

66
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,820
of the four part prequel art, The Death of a Salesman.

67
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,940
Pretending to be people will be back in two weeks,

68
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,860
on October 7th.

69
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,980
Bloodily pickin' back up where they left off,

70
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,980
in Grover's gorge.

71
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,260
And for those of you blessed listeners

72
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,860
who support us on Patreon and await new bonus episodes,

73
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,300
we will have two new episodes for you in the comin' weeks.

74
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,500
The first is a Luke run game with our dear bud Jake,

75
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,660
joinin' to play the one page RPG, Witness Me,

76
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,460
based on Mad Max Fury Road.

77
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,460
And the second is a Zac run game of subway runners,

78
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,540
a forged in the dark game where a rainbow haired gang

79
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,900
went to repair subway lines under the city.

80
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,860
Oh, and it's set in a cyberpunk future

81
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,660
where everyone is immortal.

82
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,460
Speaking of, they had so much fun with it

83
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,220
that Zac is runnin' part two of that subway runners game

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,220
live in the Dennison this comin' Tuesday at 7.37 p.m.

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,140
Central time.

86
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,020
All right, that's enough announcements.

87
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,900
Gimme the news.

88
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,540
Actually, the boys do a pretty decent recap

89
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,340
at the beginnin' of this one.

90
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,220
So for its final bow, put your hands and cheeks together

91
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,900
for R.I. Peter with Cruisin'.

92
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,740
Cruisin'.

93
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,900
My archetype, I know this isn't right,

94
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,780
but I'm a beefy boy.

95
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,940
It's somethin' very similar to that, but you know.

96
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,660
It's a beefcake.

97
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,580
Also, every time we do, beefcake, there we go.

98
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,780
Every time we do the 30 seconds of silence,

99
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,460
you know, in a horror movie where they're trying

100
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,700
not to breathe hard so that the killer doesn't find him,

101
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,260
that's exactly how I feel.

102
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,580
I saw that you put both hands over your mouth and nose.

103
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,420
You can breathe.

104
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,460
I was crying. Eyes wide.

105
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,300
I start crying.

106
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,380
Dude, you can breathe.

107
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,180
Just lean back from the microphone.

108
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,780
No one said hold your breath for 30 seconds.

109
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,980
It's hard to do.

110
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Wait, let's see how old we can hold our breath.

111
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,820
I think you can hold your breath.

112
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,260
I'm not gonna try, but you guys get it.

113
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,100
Oh, right.

114
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,420
I didn't even start trying.

115
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,260
I'm not.

116
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,460
There's nothing better for a podcast.

117
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,420
Yeah, I think we're onto something.

118
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,980
Oh, Luke won, if he was ever playing.

119
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,020
You look like you won.

120
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,220
I was playing, but then I wasn't counting,

121
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,180
and I was like, I don't wanna do this.

122
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,060
I'm glad you didn't waste time counting

123
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,980
because I would have never accepted your count.

124
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,180
It was 69.

125
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,020
Oh, nice.

126
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,540
So, I know we literally just stopped recording

127
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,220
the last episode and we're recording the second episode now.

128
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,620
It's nine weeks later.

129
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,460
Sure.

130
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,980
So we know what's going on.

131
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,660
For the audience who may have skipped,

132
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,180
just forgot to listen to this episode,

133
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,740
and be like, what did happen in that last episode?

134
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,100
Yeah, in your own words,

135
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,260
I'm curious to hear what's happened so far.

136
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,220
Well, so far, you wanna recap of the whole pink-a-boo?

137
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,420
No, just where we're at.

138
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,500
Our doctor, Dr. Shark, got eaten by Quicksand and died.

139
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,700
Well, no, no, no.

140
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,620
Whose body do we have?

141
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,460
We have Dr. Shark's body.

142
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,660
No, you left Dr. Shark's body in the pool of water.

143
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,340
But we took it from the Quicksand.

145
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,380
We're weakened at Bernie's zine, Dr. Shark.

146
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,780
Yep, you did that for a while.

147
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,820
And then we replaced Dr. Shark with a...

148
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,420
With a doctor from the neckbeards.

149
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,580
That's right, whose captain died.

150
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,300
His captain did die, Captain Neckbeard.

151
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,920
Yeah, and you changed his name.

152
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,760
We did?

153
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,580
Yeah.

154
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,660
His name wasn't Captain Neckbeard,

155
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,500
or we changed the doctor's name.

156
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,940
No, no, no, the doctor, you changed his name.

157
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,140
You asked him what his name was, I think he told you,

158
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,800
and then he changed it.

159
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,640
To what, do you remember?

160
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,500
So you're more than welcome to change it again,

161
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,340
obviously.

162
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,180
Yay.

163
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,700
I think he talked like this.

164
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,140
Yeah, he was scared, for sure.

165
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,520
He was a bit scared, and he talked like this.

166
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,500
Once we put him on board, we started calling him

167
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,880
Dr. Pisspants, because he pissed his pants in fear.

168
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,300
Dr. Pisspants.

169
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,140
Dr. Pisspants.

170
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,960
All right.

171
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,800
I think that's what it was.

172
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,080
And then we got on our ship, right?

173
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,920
You headed back out to start the race.

174
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,740
Oh, we stole Neckbeard's ship.

175
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,580
You stole Neckbeard's ship.

176
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,640
I think we just told their crew, like,

177
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,380
hey, you're with us now, right?

178
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,460
And you sent the...

179
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,660
Jesus H., Jesus Christ, and...

180
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,500
Yeah, we sent one of your golden...

181
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,320
Mrs. Knife.

182
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
And Mrs. Knife.

183
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,560
We sent my Emperor Tamarin monkey, Jesus Christ,

184
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,800
along with Dr. Shark's parrot.

185
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,640
That's the one.

186
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,460
Mrs. Knife.

187
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,300
Uh-huh.

188
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,120
Mrs. Knife.

189
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
To go run the ship.

190
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,840
And the mother of Mitch to recite the all-important word.

191
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,760
Mrs. Diggory is on her way there to recite the ship.

192
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,720
And then who do we have?

193
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,240
We have our cool friend we made.

194
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,540
Zach, pause, pause, pause.

195
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,380
Yeah, what's up?

196
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,160
Are you writing fucking Harry Potter fan fiction

197
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,200
this whole season?

198
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,840
Like, is that what you call the Diggory,

199
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,720
so this can all kind of fit canon into your, like,

200
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,380
wait till you meet Umbridge.

201
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,540
I take her with that.

202
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,720
Nice.

203
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,040
Okay, Mitch is the guy that we have.

204
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,880
Yeah.

205
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, Mitch is on the back of the ship alongside.

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,360
Oh, yeah, Edward Spitz, the cold-blooded butler.

207
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,720
He's not really a butler,

208
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,080
but he likes to think of himself like that.

209
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,920
Yeah.

210
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,640
That's my pulp Cthulhu occupation.

211
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,480
I love that.

212
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,520
And Joe, you're playing?

213
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,040
Waverly.

214
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,880
That's right.

215
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,960
They call me Wavy.

216
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
Wavy Adler.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,940
Wavy Adler, and he kind of has taken the charge

218
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,080
of, like, steering the ship in what is looking

219
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,900
to be some sort of eldritch ritual race.

220
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,340
Yep.

221
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,500
And we have to, we're pouring oil?

222
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,180
No, we're pouring blood, baby.

223
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,660
We're pouring blood out of the back in a big circle.

224
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,120
Okay, yeah, that's right.

225
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
That was kind of the reveal at the very end.

226
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,740
My very single last note is that the barrel

227
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,020
started gushing blood, and Mitch quote-unquote begins.

228
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,780
And he continues to chant.

229
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,980
I got a solicitor today who was saying

230
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,820
that to me on the phone.

231
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,700
Yeah, I was just about to say that sounds exactly

232
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,540
like the phone call.

233
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,100
Making a call, Joe, yeah.

234
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,940
Wow.

235
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,720
Do you want to explain that?

236
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,000
I got a call, Zach was setting up,

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,620
and he told us all to take off our headphones,

238
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,180
and as he told us that, I got a phone call

239
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,860
from my internet service,

240
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,220
because I had just recently disconnected,

241
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,460
and they wanted to give me a survey.

242
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,940
But as soon as I answered the phone,

243
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,700
he played that sound.

244
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,620
So loud.

245
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,660
And he played so loud out of the headphones.

246
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,020
And I looked at Joe like eyes wide open.

247
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,900
It was disorienting for everyone,

248
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,540
because we thought my phone was making that noise.

249
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,300
I watched you three idiots grapple with that.

250
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,860
I kind of got it right away.

251
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,700
Yeah, that's right.

252
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,820
I played it, and I was still like,

253
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,560
what the fuck, Joe?

254
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,660
To be fair, I was not sitting on the couch

255
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,520
with your phone, and it was blasting super loud

256
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,300
out of my own headphones, so I might have had

257
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,220
some more context clues for it.

258
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,420
Yeah, I was right here, and I was watching it

259
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,540
come out of your phone, and I was like,

260
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,100
hang up, Joe, hang up.

261
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,940
Hang up.

262
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,740
Like, don't keep letting that play.

263
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,100
So you hear that echoing from the back of this ship.

264
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,380
As the race begins, the smoke in the center

265
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,700
of the island turned from dark to white,

266
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,860
and the race began.

267
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,560
As the race began, you noticed the closest ship

268
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,960
to the shore of the island, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy,

269
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,200
took off at a wild rate.

270
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,120
They rolled a critical success on their sailing,

271
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,120
and they literally shoot ahead, basically completing

272
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,120
one third of the entire circle around the island

273
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,760
in this first push.

274
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Also, in the same round, they succeeded on taking out

275
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,080
one of the masts on the Swing Sing Brothers two mast ship.

276
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,440
Now, they were the ones with the best guns.

277
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,520
Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy indeed are the ones

278
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,800
with the best guns, that is correct.

279
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,920
Where are the swing boys?

280
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,040
Next, closest to you would be the Swing Sing Brothers

281
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,160
from Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy, who's the furthest away.

282
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,240
The Swing Sing Brothers are next up.

283
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,560
You saw one of their giant pillars of wood

284
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,680
that holds up the bedsheets that make ships go fast.

285
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,960
That whole shit fell into the water.

286
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,720
That is a fun fact, they do just use bedsheets.

287
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,880
I just assumed, I've never seen cloth so big besides that.

288
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,320
Yeah, hey.

289
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,960
They haven't invented parachutes yet, have they?

290
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,780
Big sailing ship is gonna tell you

291
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,480
that they're not just bedsheets, but buddy, they are.

292
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,400
The crew that you have sort of taken under your wing

293
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,480
and as your second ship in this race could not get moving.

294
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,960
And you notice that they actually messed up their cannons,

295
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,320
they fell over, their cannons are not operational

296
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,080
and they were not able to move forward.

297
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,240
The group next to you, the Port Deserters,

298
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,840
these are the Union Jack flag with the bottle

299
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,520
sewn into the middle of it, triple X across the bottle.

300
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,180
I would remind my fellow pirates

301
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,240
that they were seen drinking heavily before the race.

302
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,200
Yes, and you took advantage of that.

303
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,200
And I do believe that Alabaster Al Chernabog,

304
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,120
we talked about the other two characters,

305
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,080
but we didn't talk about Alabaster Al.

306
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,880
What is he like when he's running these guns

307
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,880
that you laid off to just lay absolute blows

308
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,760
to this massive ship of the Port Deserters?

309
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,960
You see that it doesn't all get through

310
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,440
their extremely sturdy, girthy ship,

311
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,440
but enough of it does because of you.

312
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,600
You know, the ship isn't the longest, but.

313
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,600
This might start out a little rough, but here we go.

314
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,160
The way that, oh, it's gonna start out real.

315
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,360
No, it's nice, it's nice.

316
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,640
The way that he likes to run the ship,

317
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,960
he's very excited the whole time that he's doing it.

318
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,520
He cannot wait to fire that next round

319
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,060
until they've won the game.

320
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,060
So he excitedly has told them to fire off the shots

321
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,840
and he got so excited he forgot to tell

322
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,720
the rest of the crew to start reloading

323
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,280
because he just went and started reloading them.

324
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,880
But they see, they're paying attention.

325
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,100
What does it sound like when,

326
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,920
and you lead by example clearly,

327
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,560
so what does it sound like as you lead by example

328
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,120
remembering in that moment,

329
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,600
oh shit, I have to tell the crew?

330
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,440
Oi!

331
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,440
They all immediately look over.

332
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,680
Well, that's the code word that we have set up

333
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,980
that means reload, just.

334
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,120
Oi! Oi!

335
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,760
And bombs away, you were able to knock a fair amount

336
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,000
of damage onto and off of that poor deserter's ship.

337
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,240
And off we go to the top of round two.

338
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
We're gonna start with Joe as the rope man

339
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,760
and the wheel man for this large ship,

340
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,840
the death of a salesman.

341
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,440
Death of a salesman.

342
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,600
Do you want me to roll?

343
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,280
I would love for you to roll.

344
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,680
Just doing my ship driving?

345
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,080
Yeah, we're all gonna, I'm gonna roll too.

346
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,000
What's a sail?

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,720
Like when they have a discount.

348
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,600
Oh my God.

349
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,160
So that's a fail, it's an 80 on a 70,

350
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,520
but I'm gonna use one of my three luck.

351
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,040
Ooh, very smart man.

352
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,780
It's only so smart because it only makes it an eight,

353
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,080
which isn't great if I'm in a competition,

354
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,240
but it's still a success either way.

355
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,640
Fantastic, so that is a success.

356
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,600
The port deserters actually rolled a critical fail

357
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,840
and yet they were able to use a bonus dice to avoid that,

358
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,520
but they rolled a 98 instead of an 88,

359
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,960
which is still a failure.

360
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,680
The neckbeard ship finally takes off

361
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,120
into the waters ahead of itself

362
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,600
as the Swing Sing brothers do the same.

363
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,720
Up in the lead, you see far in the distance

364
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,560
away from your ship, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea,

365
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,880
once again succeeds and continues

366
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,140
towards the end of this circle.

367
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,400
They're almost out of your view at this point.

368
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,240
Yikes.

369
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,360
Are we not moving at all?

370
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,600
I can tell you cause it'll give you a good idea

371
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,020
of how fucked you are.

372
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,840
You have made it 20%, they have made it 50%.

373
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,680
Shit.

374
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,500
Wow.

375
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,340
Yeah.

376
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,220
But that's with like two crits in a row.

377
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,440
Crit and then a success,

378
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,740
but they started much closer to the shore than you,

379
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,520
so they're gonna be able to complete their circle

380
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,600
much sooner.

381
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,320
I thought the slowest ship was on the inside

382
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,480
and the fastest ship was on the outside.

383
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,200
The slowest ship is on the inside,

384
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,840
they just crit it and succeeded.

385
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,080
I don't think we need to worry about this

386
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,920
that much right now.

387
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,180
And so like distance wise,

388
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,800
you said we can barely see them.

389
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,240
Yeah, you can barely see them,

390
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,880
but just through the distance there,

391
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,800
you see that they absolutely wreck shop

392
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,880
on the Swing Sing brothers.

393
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,900
Oh shit.

394
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,280
Just, oh shit, move it till it's,

395
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,920
oh girl, light it up and let me see y'all.

396
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,760
Swing.

397
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,200
Ship swing.

398
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,920
And the Swing Sing brothers ship is moving forward

399
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,560
in space, obviously.

400
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,880
We're in space now?

401
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,160
Hell yeah, dude.

402
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,960
In between you and the Swing Sing brothers

403
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,960
is the neck beard ship.

404
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,080
And that's what they're all saying.

405
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,280
As the Swing Sing brothers ship moves forward,

406
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,360
you see it disappear behind neck beard ship.

407
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,640
And then when it passes through on the other side,

408
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,200
you see that it is basically emaciated.

409
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
It is the skeleton of a ship.

410
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,720
It has been absolutely ripped apart by cannons

411
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,640
and those wire things with the balls,

412
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,800
connecting with the wire,

413
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,640
just like taking out everyone.

414
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,480
Chain shot.

415
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,320
Benoit balls.

416
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,480
It's called chain shot.

417
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,760
Benoit balls, I'm pretty sure.

418
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,600
Also not to pile on,

419
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
but that's not what emaciated means.

420
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,600
Emaciated means.

421
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,160
Would be like very skinny.

422
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah, they're all really hungry.

423
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,060
Be hungry and starved.

424
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,900
Yeah.

425
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,720
That ship looks so hungry.

426
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,320
I would say this has been hacked to bits.

427
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,200
Yeah, like to the points where you can see its ribs.

428
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving.

429
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,640
I'm gonna stick with it.

430
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,640
This emaciated ship crawls across the ocean.

431
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,480
Ship Akimbo passed the other ship in the distance.

432
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,940
That was something I saw on the Discord.

433
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,480
You don't actually use Akimbo wrong.

434
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,400
People just didn't know how it could be used.

435
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,380
Fuck yeah.

436
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,760
Thanks for sticking up for me now.

437
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,080
Jesus.

438
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,840
Oh yeah, you mean where thousands of people will hear it

439
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,640
instead of like the two dozen on the spoilers chat?

440
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,900
The Sweeting Brothers.

441
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,740
They're dunzo beans.

442
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,560
They're dunzoed?

443
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,940
Absolutely dunzo beans.

444
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,100
And with that, we move on to the gunning phase

445
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,240
for Death of a Salesman.

446
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,240
You have one ship within your sights.

447
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,640
It is the Port Deserters.

448
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,460
The Port Deserters were the fast guys

449
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,660
that we were worried about.

450
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,300
And they failed their second check, yeah.

451
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,460
You are ahead of them.

452
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,220
Then yeah, we've reloaded.

453
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,060
We've reloaded.

454
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,660
And oi oi!

455
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,820
That means reload.

456
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,340
No, oi means reload.

457
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,180
Oi oi means fire.

458
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,100
Go ahead and roll.

459
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,340
A third of the crew is confused

460
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,300
and just start packing more rounds in.

461
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,660
Two round shot.

462
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,540
You're not a confederate.

463
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,380
You did that again.

464
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,200
That's a goner.

465
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,040
Oh, there it is.

466
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,880
That's a goner.

467
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,940
It felt like it went down in the catch.

468
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,180
It's a 42 on 80.

469
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,020
Yeah, that'll do it.

470
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,720
Go ahead and roll a D4 and a D8.

471
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,300
We've got a two on the D4.

472
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,400
A two and a five.

473
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,540
And a five on the D8.

474
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,700
Makes for seven points of damage.

475
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,220
Again, you do a little bit more damage this time

476
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,160
than you did last time to the Port Deserters.

477
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,500
And they have finally noticed.

478
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,620
Oh, okay.

479
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,820
You hit them hard enough on this one

480
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,180
to where some heads are actually popping up

481
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,480
on the top deck.

482
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,320
And they're looking about.

483
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,960
What if their heads were popping off?

484
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,900
Oh yeah, actually you see one guy in the back

485
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,600
whose head pops out just in time

486
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,100
as that last cannon ball just heads him off.

487
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,020
You fucking patriot.

488
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,100
He gets absolutely

489
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,940
patriotic.

490
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,020
That seems rad.

491
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,780
I had not seen that movie in years.

492
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,200
I forgot that fucking Mel Gibson is the head

493
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,700
of a family of benevolent slave owners.

494
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,060
Yeah.

495
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,140
I did not, yeah.

496
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,660
And it's like, it's weird.

497
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,260
It's patriotic as hell as well.

498
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,840
It is, it is, yeah.

499
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,860
It's very American.

500
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,080
It's just such a choice.

501
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,260
Could have easily.

502
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,220
Dude, that guy makes a lot of those, huh?

503
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,500
Been from Boston.

504
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,780
I watched that in third grade.

505
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,820
Didn't pick up on that.

506
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,360
Did pick up on the hatchet that goes

507
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,480
to the guy's skull.

508
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,320
That's stuck with me ever since.

509
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,520
Yeah, that part's rad.

510
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,480
The guy getting fucking his head blown off

511
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,320
by the cannon.

512
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,800
Not blown off, just like flick.

513
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,220
Yeah, as if God's, as if God's finger came down.

514
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Luke, oh, Alabaster Alshernabog's cannon

515
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,920
flicks this man's head off.

516
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,760
And then.

517
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,600
Patriot style.

518
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,320
The, over the intercom of this.

519
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,300
His head is emancipated from his body.

520
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,540
Team Slayer.

521
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,180
Thomas, next to you, Mitch Diggory is continuing

522
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,180
with his Er-wah-doh-nyeh-nyeh.

523
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,700
I used to think, made out like his words

524
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,740
were complicated, but it's just a fucking Little John song.

525
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,820
What?

526
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,780
Thank you, Joe.

527
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,780
I thought you said Elton John.

528
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,620
And then he's like.

529
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,460
And I was.

530
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,660
You were like racking your brain.

531
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,980
I was trying so hard.

532
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,340
I'm like, it doesn't make any sense to me.

533
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,940
What?

534
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,700
Got the headlights on the.

535
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,540
What?

536
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,740
That's hard on the throat.

537
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,520
Yeah, so Edward just imagines it's like,

538
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,820
he's rapidly like thinking, what is the point of Mitch?

539
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,800
I could do this.

540
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,980
All them swinging bastards.

541
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,740
I got a ship all eat up.

542
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,340
It's emaciated.

543
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,820
Yeah.

544
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,700
Emaciated.

545
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,160
You're saying they're hungry?

546
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,680
No, all I'm trying to say is gone mostly.

547
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,780
Most of their ship is just gone.

548
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,140
Para-mancy on the damn sea, they show them all the shit.

549
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,720
There's none left.

550
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,540
None left was blenders anyway.

551
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,940
And then there were three.

552
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,700
They're out there dying in the water.

553
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,300
Look at the bastards drowning and feeding the sharks.

554
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,580
Boy, they're dunzo beans.

555
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,600
Reload, but fuck.

556
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,280
By dunzo beans, do you mean dunion rings?

557
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,820
It's exactly what I mean.

558
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,940
I thought so, because I made that playlist

559
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,700
after my last breakup and sent it to you.

560
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,700
In an attempt to be done with your ring around this island,

561
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,900
I need a roll for sailing from Sir Wavy Adler.

562
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,380
Can I use rope to help him?

563
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,340
You would not be able to fire if you use rope to help him.

564
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,180
I don't want to help him.

565
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,940
And what are sails?

566
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,860
I believe they are the fitted sheet specifically

567
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,420
so that it attaches easier to the mast,

568
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,100
which I learned in my head recently is the wood part.

569
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,940
Mask.

570
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,860
I got a seven.

571
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,700
You got a what?

572
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,520
Seven.

573
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,360
Oh, that is a success.

574
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,220
Yes, I believe that is a success.

575
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,140
I successfully did sailing.

576
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,020
You push even further than the port deserters

577
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,140
who, while lively, seem to be more concerned

578
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,060
about the damage you've done to their ship

579
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:52,000
than actually moving forward in any measurable way.

580
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,340
The neckbeards, however, do succeed and move forward.

581
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,220
They're actually about even with you now.

582
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,300
And you see that you are both catching up,

583
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,260
slowly but certainly surely,

584
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,380
to fancy pyromancy on the damn sea.

585
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,620
Attagah, way to go, boys.

586
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,660
We're catching on them.

587
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,500
But then.

588
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,180
Oh!

589
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,060
Through the side of the neckbeard ship,

590
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,340
you see a cannonball four times bigger

591
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,260
than you've seen on any ship you've been on

592
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,020
bust through your side of neckbeard ship.

593
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,860
So it's across from you in the water

594
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,420
and you just see that, and as it hits the water,

595
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,740
it splashes you.

596
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,500
They are desperately trying to patch the hole

597
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,420
as water is lapping up inside.

598
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,220
Can we see where that shot came from?

599
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,060
Was it the pyromancy?

600
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,900
It was the pyromancy, right.

601
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,780
Or did it come from the island?

602
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,340
You can certainly roll.

603
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,340
Can I do a spot hidden?

604
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,220
Yeah, we can call that spot hidden.

605
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,500
30 on an 80.

606
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,540
92 on a 70, but I've got that skill

607
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,220
that I can reroll the one thing.

608
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,040
Oh, 22!

609
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,880
Hell yeah.

610
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,380
That's a critical success.

611
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,180
Through the hole in the side of the ship,

612
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,340
you hold up.

613
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,060
My spyglass, yep.

614
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,780
And as you lengthen it out, you see,

615
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,980
through this hole.

616
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,060
And this burning blood from the guy

617
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,900
who got patrioted inside the ship.

618
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,420
Yeah.

619
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,780
Yeah, and you see a pair of legs walking around

620
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,880
without a top half, a walk past,

621
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,820
but just through the view,

622
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,460
you can make out the ship of fancy pyromancy

623
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,460
on the damn sea with its smoking, massive cannon

624
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,700
that they've dragged out.

625
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,260
They didn't even try to move forward this round.

626
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,840
No one was manning the sails.

627
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,020
They just dragged out this massive cannon

628
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,100
to take this shot.

629
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,620
They got the mother of all cannons

630
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,440
on that ship over there, boys!

631
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,480
Hey, Sheridu, but half the reason

632
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,020
we got them neckbeards is to be our sacrificial goat.

633
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,840
I say let them take that shot.

634
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,740
To distract the pyromancy,

635
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,540
we put everything we got next time into moving forward.

636
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,340
Well, let's keep their husk of a ship

637
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,540
between us and them as long as we can.

638
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,460
I pull out a whistle and blow on it,

639
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,500
and I know this isn't how monkeys hear,

640
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,480
but you don't hear any sounds coming out of the whistle.

641
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,120
It's my monkey whistle.

642
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,960
Exactly.

643
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
Oh, we didn't send, oh, sorry.

644
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,180
No, you wouldn't say, oh, sorry,

645
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,460
because you can't hear it.

646
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,960
Right, exactly, no, I didn't even.

647
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,180
I thought that was the introduction

648
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,000
of some new, mysterious, creepy sound effect.

649
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,920
What I was gonna say is,

650
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,180
I think we sent your Emperor Tamarind over,

651
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,580
but we had the, Mrs. Knife was gonna be the runner

652
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,660
between the ships, right?

653
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,220
Yes, yes, yes.

654
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,900
So that is a pretty good time

655
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,820
after we've decided to cut them off and move on.

656
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,980
I relay that to Mrs. Shark, who says.

657
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,500
Cut it off.

658
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,460
Moving on.

659
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,380
I didn't have a sick segue that time,

660
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,180
but I need another navigation roll.

661
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,740
And then is this where we could help?

662
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,540
Yeah, if you guys wanna take off

663
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,780
from firing at the port deserters,

664
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,100
then you can all really get in on pushing this ship forward.

665
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,940
I have something that I wanna do

666
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,980
to avoid being shot by that thing.

667
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,460
So let me ask you this before I waste time doing it.

668
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,020
You know how I like to mix chemicals and shit together?

669
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,820
You do know how you like to mix chemicals.

670
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,660
Does your character also do that?

671
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,260
Your character does that too, I think, yeah.

672
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,700
They say right what you know.

673
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,400
For the listeners, Luke is not a scientist.

674
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,620
I have a minor in biology.

675
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,460
Whoa, I didn't know that.

676
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,580
So you know what?

677
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,540
You're right.

678
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,680
Okay, so.

679
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,940
If you're a biologist, then what's wrong with me?

680
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,420
Oh, Joe just pulled down his pants.

681
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,300
Oh my God, there is.

682
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,340
There's too much of ya.

683
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,180
Look at that.

684
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,860
Oh, cool, there's way too much of ya.

685
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,820
Your blood's not flowing correctly.

686
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,460
If we were up in the Northeast, I'd call that a hoagie.

687
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,940
Here we call it a sub, I guess.

688
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,740
Are you a sub, Joe?

689
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,860
The people wanna know.

690
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,780
Hold on, real quick, I just need to let one lie

691
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,580
that went unaddressed be addressed.

692
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,620
When Luke says he has a minor in biology,

693
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,020
what he means is he fathered a child when he was 15

694
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,140
and that child themselves is now a freshman in high school

695
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,180
in Mrs. Atkinson's biology class.

696
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:32,180
I was definitely a virgin then, so you're wrong.

697
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,380
Speaking of.

698
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,340
Oh my God.

699
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,080
I've got very bad news, fellas.

700
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,920
Uh-oh.

701
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,860
It's at 88.

702
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,540
Can you re-roll one of them?

703
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,100
It's a dang old crit fail and no, Zach, I can't re-roll it.

704
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,940
That re-roll thing is going on.

705
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,500
And no, Zach, I don't wanna talk about it.

706
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,340
And no, Zach, I don't want any consequences.

707
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,900
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

708
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,820
And yet, as your hands are trembling,

709
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,520
unable to complete this task,

710
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,900
was Mr. Spitz able to save the day here?

711
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,980
With a sailing roll?

712
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,540
No, I didn't roll anything good.

713
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,540
Okay, is this a time where I could see

714
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,380
that things are going very wrong and now help?

715
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,100
Oh, I mean, I suppose.

716
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,180
Didn't you already roll?

717
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,020
He had not rolled yet.

718
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,580
No, I was not gonna help

719
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,980
because I had my own thing I was gonna do.

720
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,140
But now, this seems a whole lot more relevant

721
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,340
than what I was gonna do.

722
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,180
Good play.

723
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,740
What should I, anyway, I try to-

724
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,780
You have luck, man.

725
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,620
That's true.

726
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,440
What did you roll?

727
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,280
He rolled a 68.

728
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,700
I rolled a 68, which-

729
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,980
86 ain't gonna do it.

730
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,520
So, one luck won't work.

731
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,180
Okay, then I don't-

732
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,620
Do you spend the luck anyway?

733
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,740
I don't, I don't do that.

734
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,180
Make it more of a fail.

735
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,460
You wanted it to be, you know, more exciting.

736
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,060
I see that everything's going wrong

737
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,860
and I'm like, I don't think I can help.

738
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,660
That's how that works, right?

739
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,340
The port deserters are able to catch up a little bit.

740
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,660
They're not past you yet,

741
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,340
but they are catching up currently

742
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,580
and we are rolling again.

743
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,420
Joe, if I could get a rope use,

744
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,620
are you guys going to help him again?

745
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,100
What is the conversation happening

746
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,380
as you guys are failing at this sailing task?

747
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,500
Is the consequence of the crit fail

748
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,960
that we just don't move and don't fire for a round?

749
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,800
That is correct.

750
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Okay, so I was gonna say that Waverly's

751
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,900
probably just in awe of that giant hole

752
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,340
that has now been punctured.

753
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,820
Like, that cannon scared him.

754
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,300
So, he just stood there agape.

755
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,100
Well, and honestly, I bet a lot of the crew is.

756
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,900
So, while we're running around trying to whip them up,

757
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,460
a lot of them are just like awestruck

758
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,300
by what they've just seen.

759
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,860
Yeah, I saw the giant hole being made

760
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,620
and I was racking my brain for weapons on board

761
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,060
that measure up to that at all and I couldn't.

762
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,200
And then when I see that everybody's fucking up us moving,

763
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,460
I kind of grab a rope and pull it,

764
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,220
but I'm just staring at the hole in the hole.

765
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,340
The hole in the hole.

766
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,240
The hole in the hole.

767
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,880
We didn't get much of anywhere this time,

768
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,860
but the key to defeating that gun,

769
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,060
eventually, if we need to, we'll be getting close to it.

770
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,180
It can fire at us before we can fire at it.

771
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,860
Not all four of that distance, right?

772
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,060
I've got something whipped up

773
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,380
that I think might be able to help.

774
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,820
If Jesus Christ gets here soon

775
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,620
or if I can run down to the bottom, I can grab it for us.

776
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,980
It's a special powder that I've mixed together

777
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,980
that I can put on a cannon ball and shoot into their cannon.

778
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,880
Yeah, you told me your special powder would get herpes.

779
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,720
Your special powder doesn't do shit.

780
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,260
Lots of special powders.

781
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,860
I gotta go look and see what I have down there.

782
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm making this shit up.

783
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,380
I've got it all labeled.

784
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,220
That's what I'm saying.

785
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,140
I've got it all labeled down there.

786
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,700
Let me go take a peek.

787
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,760
Let me take a turn to take a peek.

788
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,600
Take a turnip.

789
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,380
He like pops a herpes sore at you in disgust.

790
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,780
Oh, God.

791
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,100
He's like, thank you, powder.

792
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,920
Wow.

793
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,940
We are pirates.

794
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,860
We are disgusting.

795
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,700
That's awful.

796
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,900
That's truly awful.

797
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,900
It goes into one of the three giant open sores on my face,

798
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,420
which is depicted on my character sheet.

799
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,260
Do you guys feel closer?

800
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,340
People don't know about history is that before that moment,

801
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,940
herpes was like totally curable, but that's great.

802
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,260
This is the moment where the super strain was developed.

803
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,500
And then eventually when I find that I have it,

804
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,060
I blame it on the damn monkey.

805
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,380
We're also both two weeks from dying from smallpox.

806
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,460
So it's like, this is our last hurrah.

807
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,100
Fancy pyromancy actually pushes forward

808
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,180
to where you can no longer see them.

809
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,720
They have turned the corner and they have disappeared

810
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,220
around the other side of the island,

811
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,180
which is thankful for the neckbeard ship

812
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,560
because they weren't able to fire at them this round.

813
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,540
However, the neckbeard ship failed miserably on their check

814
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,060
to combat the drowning.

815
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,260
What does a boat do?

816
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,300
Sinks.

817
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,140
Yep.

818
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,420
And so this drowning boat.

819
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,340
This boat is gasping for air.

820
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,980
This emaciated boat is drowning.

821
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,540
If I had to put it in terms of like math,

822
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,060
I'd say they started at yay 20 or so

823
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,780
and are down to three hit points on the ship.

824
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,020
Not going well.

825
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,540
And they critically failed and unable to help themselves

826
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,860
with an additional set of crew members.

827
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,100
They are actually moving backwards a little bit in space.

828
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,040
From what we can tell,

829
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,880
does it look like most of that damage

830
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,980
came from that one shot?

831
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,940
Oh yes.

832
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,780
Okay.

833
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,600
Horrifying.

834
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Truly, truly horrifying.

835
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,440
And the port deserters are actually picking up steam now.

836
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,800
They are now two successful sailing moves in a row

837
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,280
and it is on you guys to catch up in this moment.

838
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,440
That's a 37 on a 70.

839
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,280
We're good.

840
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,100
That'll do it.

841
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,460
And you move up forward ahead of them again.

842
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,900
You guys are inching ahead of each other at each time,

843
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,760
just pushing nose to nose in this race.

844
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,420
I wanna take this moment to call Mrs. Knife

845
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,380
and while she's flying over, say to you guys,

846
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,500
what do you think about evacuating some key personnel

847
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,660
from the neckpits, including Mitch's mom and her barrel

848
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,340
and you know, Jesus Christ.

849
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,420
Getting them back on here.

850
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,020
It looks like their boat's done for.

851
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,300
We need Jesus and if they've got enough,

852
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,900
I think the way we get Jesus over here,

853
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,140
put as many men in those boats or however we do it.

854
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,460
I was thinking the parrot could bring Jesus over here

855
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,220
but do you think the parrot could bring over a human being?

856
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,380
You know, so we've got little boats

857
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,760
that go between the boats.

858
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,600
Right.

859
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,700
Can bring people over and monkeys, really.

860
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,220
Right, that's what I said.

861
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,700
I imagine that's how you,

862
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,860
you said the parrot would carry them.

863
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,500
Well, I said we could, the same way we could.

864
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,740
Your question was, the parrot could maybe carry a monkey

865
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,020
but could it carry a man?

866
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,420
I was talking about boats to begin with

867
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,820
and then I thought about the parrot bringing the monkey over

868
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,400
and then I'm like, well, could the parrot bring a human over?

869
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,180
But yeah, boats is what I was talking about.

870
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,400
I don't know the capability of Dr. Shark's parrots

871
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,700
all that well, you know,

872
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,860
it's capable of in the extremes

873
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,700
but I'm gonna say no, it can't.

874
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,820
But yeah, the boats.

875
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,080
Bring over as many men as we can get

876
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,500
and I've got to go look for powders and potions.

877
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,900
Waverly pulls out a whistle that's like a

878
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,000
and that sends a few bread about boats.

879
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,420
Yeah, the orders are sent.

880
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,740
The orders are sent, yeah.

881
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,620
So if the parrot's coming over.

882
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,740
Oh, the parrot's coming over.

883
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,140
You can hear Miss Knife, the wings flapping hard

884
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,620
against this crisp summer sunshine air.

885
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,260
Salty, baby, it's salty.

886
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,060
So as the parrot flies up, I say,

887
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,700
Mrs. North, you've got to lead the boats.

888
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,820
Tell them to gather all the best men

889
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,100
along with Mrs. Diggory and her barrel.

890
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,680
You bring them back over here.

891
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,300
Make sure the flow doesn't stop.

892
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,500
Yes, do not interrupt the flow.

893
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,700
That is of critical importance.

894
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,140
Bring them back over here.

895
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,580
We're leaving the mech beard, the ship

896
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,540
and a weaker crew to their fights.

897
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,580
You understand?

898
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,620
Mrs. Knife says, cut it off.

899
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,120
Moving on.

900
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Fuck yeah, dude.

901
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,120
And with that, she takes off back to the other ship

902
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,900
and we are on.

903
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,680
Joe, I need to know what way the Adler is up to

904
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,520
as you roll.

905
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,360
Oh shit, it's a 95.

906
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm gonna have to use another luck to make it a 59.

907
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,860
I'm down to one luck, my boys.

908
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,600
But I don't feel like we can afford

909
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,120
not moving at this point.

910
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,780
No, I mean, this is the time to be spending it.

911
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,440
I don't know if we want to set a precedent

912
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
that we explain the luck roll,

913
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,880
but he was turning, he thought he was turning

914
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,480
toward the wind and he realized,

915
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,280
oh fuck, it's the wrong, I mean,

916
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,320
readjusted real quick.

917
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,120
And then he actually caught a pretty good stream.

918
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,160
I'm all for narrative explanations of the dice roll.

919
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,440
I just say that because there's times

920
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,080
where it may be really hard to describe.

921
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,920
That's true.

922
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,360
And that's where we get created.

923
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,280
I dropped the gun.

924
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,520
That is one thing I do like about a D20 system

925
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,800
over maybe the D100 is the implicit scale.

926
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,680
One being shitty, 20 being awesome.

927
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,400
You know what a 15 is, you know what a 10 is.

928
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,220
Sure.

929
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,060
You know what a five is.

930
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,960
I usually do that and then I times it by five.

931
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,240
I feel the same way about the D100 system.

932
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,560
Well, I would if Delta Green didn't use the weird,

933
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,280
like actually lower rolls are not better.

934
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,760
I love the blackjack rules.

935
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,640
It makes me so happy.

936
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,680
I like them too.

937
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
It's just, I don't know.

938
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,260
Well, the port deserters push ahead of you guys,

939
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,100
unfortunately.

940
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,600
Don't give a fuck, Zach.

941
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,000
He wants to talk about the fucking game we're playing.

942
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,160
The boat from the neckbeard ship

943
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,840
starts heading toward you guys.

944
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,120
They're actually heading at the correct angle

945
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,440
to meet you on your way,

946
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,320
but they are going to have to make it around

947
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,160
the port deserters ship in order to make it to you

948
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,320
as you are right next to each other.

949
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,200
I would think that there are the rules of war

950
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,480
where you don't shoot at a abandoning ship, you know.

951
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,360
A tiny little ship.

952
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,640
Unfortunately, we're pirates and we'll slay anything.

953
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,120
And so my thought is shoot them before they shoot us then.

954
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,040
Give it to me, baby.

955
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,680
I'm down in, I don't see any of this happening.

956
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,720
I'm down in the ship.

957
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,680
I need you to roll for finding the correct chemicals

958
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,100
to create this bomb.

959
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,160
Which has the chemical symbol NEMO.

960
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm looking at like pre-made, you know,

961
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,200
stuff I've made already.

962
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,340
Where's the NEMO?

963
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,720
The Necrotic Emulsifying Master.

964
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,560
Ooz.

965
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,380
Good.

966
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,220
Ooz.

967
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,500
Can this be a...

968
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,580
No, it can't be.

969
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,260
I don't even want to argue that.

970
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,080
Uh...

971
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,080
Thank you, friend.

972
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,060
What were you going to say?

973
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,900
What were you going to say?

974
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,580
Can this be a heavy weapons roll that I just rolled?

975
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,200
Oh, to find it?

976
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,440
To find my chemicals that I'm going to use as a weapon.

977
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,380
No, I would say like,

978
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,660
if you're trying to distinguish

979
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,180
between your stash of chemicals,

980
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,180
knowing which one you use to make the heavy weapons like...

981
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,060
Well, yeah, I'm thinking like I've got a wall

982
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,420
of like just shit like I've made already.

983
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,580
What's your heavy weapons skill?

984
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,420
80.

985
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,240
What'd you roll?

986
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,700
An 86, which I could use luck to make a 68.

987
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,940
How would you feel if you had to find the right gun

988
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,440
out of a big rack of guns and used a firearm skill?

989
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,340
Yeah, that's correct.

990
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,700
Tight.

991
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,580
Then I do it.

992
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,940
I use my luck.

993
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,980
Use that luck, baby.

994
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,860
I appreciate that.

995
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,380
You grab the wrong one and make it to the doorway

996
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,260
and then something clicks in your head.

997
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,340
You give it a big sniff.

998
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,160
Well, I sniff it and I'm like,

999
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,720
wait, this is literally to make it.

1000
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,080
This is a stink bomb.

1001
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,560
This is a stink bomb.

1002
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,160
And so I run back and I grabbed the one that basically

1003
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,860
it creates a cloud where like fire cannot happen in it.

1004
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,080
So they can't shoot any weapons.

1005
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,960
That's what I want to grab.

1006
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,800
It's a cloud.

1007
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,920
It's a cloud where fire can not happen?

1008
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,080
It's a cloud where fire can not happen.

1009
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,480
Such a bigger ask.

1010
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,840
Like we fire this onto their ship

1011
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,720
and it's basically like fire extinguisher shit.

1012
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,640
Like fire extinguisher shit explodes

1013
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,720
and so they can't fire any of their cannons

1014
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,560
because there's no fire.

1015
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,400
It gets all over their stuff.

1016
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,920
They can't get any of the wicks lit, yeah.

1017
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,160
No wicks.

1018
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,240
But I'm gonna keep both to where it's that

1019
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,300
and a stink bomb so that it gets funny.

1020
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,720
All right, well, that's awesome.

1021
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,560
And then I run back up.

1022
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,560
And then you run back up and that's gonna be

1023
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,500
your turn this round.

1024
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,260
I love that so much.

1025
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,040
All right, well, we better get going.

1026
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,660
Tick tock on these wicks.

1027
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,280
What is it?

1028
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,740
Dink, dink, the dink, dink man.

1029
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,200
Oh, that's a critical success for the port deserters.

1030
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,360
Fuck you.

1031
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,640
Fuck you.

1032
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,320
They're about to be some sticky like smelly bitches.

1033
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,440
You know what's really handy for you guys

1034
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,700
is that the port deserters make it so far ahead of you

1035
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,120
that the neckbeard ship can actually meet up with you

1036
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,140
this round with no issue.

1037
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:19,140
But I do need a sailing role from Sir Wavy Adler.

1038
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,940
Are they aboard now?

1039
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,760
Who?

1040
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,600
The neckbeards.

1041
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,420
No, not yet.

1042
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,260
They will be next round.

1043
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,380
When they're aboard, can they aid our sailing

1044
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,780
like with more, literally more guys in the fucking like,

1045
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,620
in the rigging?

1046
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,540
If Mrs. Diggory and the monkey,

1047
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,300
the monkey will be a lot of help, I assume.

1048
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,460
We talked about bringing over all the best neckbeards.

1049
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,580
Oh, you were bringing all the, I wasn't listening.

1050
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,420
So you guys.

1051
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,540
All right.

1052
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,300
Why can't the lady and the monkey

1053
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,340
help the ship go faster, Zach?

1054
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,460
That's how sailing ships work.

1055
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,580
You've got one old lady and a monkey.

1056
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,420
Monkeys are way stronger than you think.

1057
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,140
Have you never sailed, you fucking peasant?

1058
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,780
How much advantage do you want?

1059
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,780
Well, preferably like-

1060
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,140
I was thinking one giant long boat full of like-

1061
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,980
Double or triple.

1062
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,740
The hardest pirates with the biggest know-hows.

1063
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,040
Exactly.

1064
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,160
We got an old lady, the boat goes faster,

1065
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,680
you fucking mook.

1066
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,000
Extra blood, baby.

1067
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,800
Erupting out of the ocean,

1068
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,360
in between you and the shore of this island,

1069
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,320
seemingly every bit of blood that has been trailing

1070
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,520
out of these massive barrels

1071
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,960
on the back of all of these ships,

1072
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,520
all the blood is beginning to bubble on the ocean's top.

1073
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,520
And as it bubbles, it is creating a steam

1074
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
that is creating a fog that is-

1075
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,520
And masking all of your surroundings,

1076
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,480
the ship that is just nearby.

1077
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,360
I mean, it is right there.

1078
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,060
They're about to board.

1079
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,960
And then all of a sudden, gone in fog,

1080
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,880
you are completely surrounded.

1081
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,480
You can barely see the hand in front of your face

1082
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,560
and you can hear your entire crew panic

1083
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,280
over the sound of Mitch Diggory getting even louder.

1084
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,360
And you see that fog just billowing thicker and thicker

1085
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,680
as you continue to sail the ship.

1086
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,000
Oh, neckbeards, ahoy, are you out there?

1087
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,080
Roll the sanity.

1088
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,440
I pass mine.

1089
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,480
I also pass mine.

1090
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,200
And I'm gonna go ahead.

1091
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,840
You're asking me to think of a way to use my skills

1092
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,600
to get these guys aboard.

1093
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,720
I've got the perfect one.

1094
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,540
I'm gonna use spot hidden again

1095
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,400
to search them out through the fog

1096
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,540
and guide them in with my voice basically.

1097
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,600
And 18.

1098
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,080
Okay, yeah, that'll do it.

1099
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,400
They follow the sound of your voice.

1100
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,400
Ahoy, neckbeards, ahoy, your scrawny ass is up.

1101
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,040
Get aboard.

1102
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,080
It's a contest to win.

1103
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,960
And you can tell by these dark seas

1104
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,060
that there'll be hell to pay if we don't.

1105
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,100
It's a perfect tone to cut through this fog.

1106
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,360
And it is now blocking out the sun completely.

1107
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,640
So it is dark aboard your ship.

1108
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,160
Mrs. Diggory is still, what?

1109
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,080
With her barrel.

1110
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,080
Yeah, I get her and the barrel set up

1111
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,040
next to Mitch basically.

1112
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,120
But then I have my sword out and I look at Mitch

1113
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,640
and I say, boy, without you finishing your words,

1114
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,160
you should nod yes and no.

1115
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,040
If we lose this thing, are we dead?

1116
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,280
And he nods.

1117
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,060
If we lose this thing, are you and your mother dead?

1118
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,760
And a tear starts welling up in his eyes.

1119
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,100
And he nods.

1120
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,940
Cut his throat.

1121
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,060
It's still better to have two of them,

1122
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,180
though I'm of your way of thinking.

1123
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,060
I'm not around enough for you to hear me say that.

1124
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,860
No, you popped up on board.

1125
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,700
You popped up with your chemical mounted cannon

1126
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,540
in your cannon.

1127
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,980
Yeah, I look around, I'm like,

1128
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,140
squint, I'm like, oh, cut his throat.

1129
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,700
I'm a pirate, so.

1130
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,680
Mrs. Knife disagrees, she prefers torture

1131
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,520
and she suggests.

1132
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,460
Cut the legs.

1133
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,920
And her little wings are flapping the fog away from her,

1134
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,280
so you can see, you can always see Mrs. Knife a little bit

1135
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,760
as cutting through this fog, no matter where she goes.

1136
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,600
Like fucking crackers on that season of Archer,

1137
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,720
everybody but me hated.

1138
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,400
I love that season.

1139
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,440
I love that one too.

1140
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,100
It's one of the internet's least favorites

1141
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,160
and it's like, that's the best coma season.

1142
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,080
Adam Reed admitted during the Dreamland one,

1143
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,440
he was on a lot of pain pills for a surgery

1144
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,660
and it's like a really dark and fucked up and weird tone.

1145
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,480
What is Wavy Adler up to as he's trying to get the crew

1146
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,200
working together while they can't see each other?

1147
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,320
He's using that whistle that he whipped out earlier

1148
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,200
and he's actually prepared for this.

1149
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,740
You enter fog fairly often as a sailor,

1150
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,200
so they kind of know how to navigate through fog.

1151
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,400
So he's doing whistle commands that mean the things

1152
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,140
that we've been meaning all along.

1153
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,860
So it's like, means to get up on the ropes.

1154
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,460
And it's just this super like absolute fog.

1155
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,140
And each one of these people who are working on your ship

1156
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,140
as the crew, they're just individually moving by themselves

1157
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,100
with no idea of like what is happening.

1158
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,140
That knows what individually means.

1159
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:53,140
Yeah, but I just figured out that other people

1160
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,720
can do that too.

1161
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,820
I looked at Thomas and I was like, come on, don't do it.

1162
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,260
I'm like, he's on a roll.

1163
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,780
I almost stopped when I saw the look on your face,

1164
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:12,720
but then the way Joe and Zach got got, I stand by it.

1165
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,340
I need to roll through the fog, baby.

1166
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,800
These whistles are making it

1167
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,460
so you don't have to be at a penalty.

1168
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,940
It's a 63, I passed.

1169
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,020
Congratulations.

1170
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,020
You need three more successes to make it

1171
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,680
in a full circle.

1172
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,060
Something in your pirate bones tells you

1173
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,240
that you're exactly three successes away

1174
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,780
from completing this circle.

1175
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,980
Your navigational skills trying to figure out

1176
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,460
exactly where to meet back up with it.

1177
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,700
Please roll a navigation for me right now.

1178
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,380
That's a pass, a 36 on an 80.

1179
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,600
Navigation's technically my best skill.

1180
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,460
I should have been using that more.

1181
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,120
You can now hear in the distance right in front of you

1182
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,200
the chanting from two other ships.

1183
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,320
Fuck yes.

1184
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,520
Nearby, but they're in the fog.

1185
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,600
Okay, so I turn to Mitch and I ask him,

1186
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,520
man, does your chanting have to be loud?

1187
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,520
He gets a confused look on his face.

1188
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,600
Can you whisper the chant?

1189
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,720
Erwah, yoh, yee, yerp.

1190
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,200
Tell mother to.

1191
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,040
Eh.

1192
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,860
Blerp.

1193
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,700
Woot.

1194
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,540
All right, boy.

1195
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,360
Oh no.

1196
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,440
She fucked up, she broke the chant.

1197
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,920
Hey, hey, Zach fucked up.

1198
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,200
Mrs. Diggory.

1199
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,320
Oh no.

1200
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,040
You gotta roll for Mrs. Diggory.

1201
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,880
All right.

1202
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,400
That was you, bro, not her.

1203
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,040
She chugged some grog on the boat.

1204
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,440
She got in that boat.

1205
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,800
She was like, oh, oh no.

1206
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,840
What'd you get?

1207
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,680
It's an 88.

1208
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,200
She falls overboard.

1209
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,360
Oh my God.

1210
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,680
She coughs and then looks down and then looks scared

1211
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,680
and then looks at Mitch and she's like, I'm so sorry.

1212
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,600
I'm so, I'm so sorry.

1213
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,800
You have to keep going.

1214
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,720
You have to keep going for us.

1215
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,540
You have to keep going.

1216
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,800
Now we're together, we can make this.

1217
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,840
We can make it together.

1218
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,000
I just put my finger to my lips

1219
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,240
and give her a look like, we're pirates

1220
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,480
and we're gonna kill you if you don't stop talking right now.

1221
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,680
Your three faces are the only things

1222
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,040
that can be seen in this massive fog around

1223
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,760
and your hand reaches up out of nowhere

1224
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,000
to put a finger to your mouth

1225
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,640
and she quickly silences

1226
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,880
and then disappears backwards into the fog.

1227
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,080
All right.

1228
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,700
Wavy, what do you think?

1229
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,200
Silence all hands,

1230
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,760
slip by noise and quiet between the fog.

1231
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,920
We'll never know we were there.

1232
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,400
I love this idea.

1233
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,760
I love this idea.

1234
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,600
That's the idea.

1235
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,400
Stealthy as she goes, boys.

1236
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,240
And perhaps if-

1237
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,080
Stealthy as she goes.

1238
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,400
As soon as we bust out of the fog on the other side,

1239
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,080
you give them a load of that special powder of yours.

1240
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,280
I hand Jesus Christ like an empty iron ball.

1241
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,880
What does Jesus Christ look like again?

1242
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,920
He is an emperor, tamarind, penguin,

1243
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,600
so he's got the big mustache, monkey mustache.

1244
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,440
I thought he was a monkey.

1245
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,000
Penguin, did I say emperor, tamarind, penguin?

1246
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,640
Yeah, you did.

1247
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,680
Oh, no.

1248
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,520
Emperor, tamarind.

1249
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,760
You sent a monkey to the other ship

1250
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,600
and you got a penguin.

1251
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,440
He came back and there is some fucky stuff

1252
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,240
happening on this island.

1253
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,840
No, it's my monkey.

1254
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,480
And he, I hand him-

1255
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,560
He's a fucking penguin.

1256
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,920
This guy, he keeps calling it a monkey,

1257
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,960
but that's a penguin.

1258
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,280
We just let him have it.

1259
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,120
We let him have it,

1260
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,800
but he's going to some one of these days.

1261
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,960
We're gonna go up too far north

1262
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,360
and that penguin's gonna die.

1263
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:33,320
So this penguin, who I see still as a monkey,

1264
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,200
is mixing together the stinky stuff

1265
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,400
and the not fire stuff, putting it in this iron ball.

1266
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,080
And then I load it into my shoulder cannon.

1267
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,600
And I wait until I can see where I'm gonna shoot it.

1268
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,440
Awesome.

1269
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,640
In that exact moment, as I get a roll from Wavy Adler,

1270
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,520
you hear in the distance the crew

1271
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,920
from Fancy Pyromancy on the Damsey.

1272
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,520
You haven't been able to hear them yet,

1273
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,820
but everyone is being so quiet in this fog,

1274
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,980
except just in the distance, you hear some scrambling.

1275
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,720
Oh, oh, oh, yes, no, oh, we cannot find it.

1276
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,600
Oh, no, we have to make it back to the original location.

1277
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,480
Yes, to make the circle complete.

1278
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,280
No, we haven't quite made it back

1279
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,160
to the original circle yet, no.

1280
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,180
I passed the sailing roll, it's a 12.

1281
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,280
And a navigation for me, please.

1282
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,120
Another one?

1283
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:26,940
Yes.

1284
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,680
45 on an 80.

1285
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,880
Oh, yes, beautiful.

1286
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,720
Fuck yeah.

1287
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,560
All in the same round, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damsey,

1288
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,640
the Port Deserters, and Death of a Salesman

1289
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,980
have all completed their circle of the island.

1290
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:48,960
None of you have yet to complete the circle

1291
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,320
by finding the other end of your blood trail,

1292
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,320
which is now a thick, red fog that you can see.

1293
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,520
As the fog is coming around you, you see that ahead of you,

1294
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,520
where the fog is literally boiling up out of the ocean,

1295
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,960
it's red, and your trails are each lighting up red,

1296
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,560
and these massive walls going up to the sky,

1297
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,800
but you can't even see the sky anymore.

1298
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,840
There's nothing except for fog.

1299
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,600
Mitch, I have one more question for you.

1300
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,840
What do you think?

1301
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,000
If we win,

1302
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,200
what do we die?

1303
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,280
He gets a big smile on his face,

1304
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,060
and he shakes his head no.

1305
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,400
All right, Edward Spitz is fucking stoked.

1306
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,120
And he's gonna try to do a Spot Hidden role

1307
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,900
to find our blood smoke in the fog.

1308
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,740
Fuck yeah, fuck yeah.

1309
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,420
And passes with a 25 on an eight.

1310
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,260
Hell yeah.

1311
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,660
Awesome, so that is gonna be your first success.

1312
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:56,660
I've basically given each team three navigation successes

1313
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,600
to find the other end of the trail.

1314
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,040
So Edward Spitz, he used Spot Hidden,

1315
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,920
which implies some visuals, but he's a pirate.

1316
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,940
He uses all of his senses.

1317
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,880
As he searches through his spyglass,

1318
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,480
he sees nothing, but all of a sudden,

1319
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,460
he just catches a whiff of blood on the wind,

1320
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,600
and then sees a little wisp of red

1321
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,940
in the direction that he smelled that.

1322
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,320
And he tells Wavy, he's like, that way.

1323
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,420
Wavy, go ahead and roll that navigation.

1324
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,660
That's a 25.

1325
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,980
As you guys push forward into this,

1326
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,980
you hear a low rumble in the distance.

1327
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:40,980
And each one of you can feel the ocean approaching.

1328
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,780
Waves are heading toward you,

1329
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,980
massive waves from the island side.

1330
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,780
And then you finally get to the end of the trail.

1331
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,620
And then you finally hear it, this massive noise,

1332
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,320
this explosion of a ship,

1333
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,780
wood splintering in all different directions,

1334
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,540
and the cries of an entire ship's crew

1335
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,180
all at once through the fog.

1336
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:16,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, oh fuck, oh shit, oh god, no!

1337
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,700
Not ours, right?

1338
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:26,100
No, it's in the distance through the fog.

1339
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,580
Why, thank god that's not our ship.

1340
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,900
I was really scared, I really fucking scared

1341
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,060
the piss out of me.

1342
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,900
I thought I looked around and I was like,

1343
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,980
I can't see anything, and I don't know if it was.

1344
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,580
In one group of pirates screaming in agony and terror,

1345
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,420
sounds much like another.

1346
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,860
Jesus Christ.

1347
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,180
I mean, I really thought that was some more,

1348
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,980
I thought I heard fucking Fat Johnny

1349
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,260
just squealing his little head off.

1350
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:51,100
Anyway, well fuck, have you smelled the blood yet?

1351
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,080
I smelled it a little bit.

1352
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,160
We're heading that way now.

1353
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,980
I thought, I thought I could.

1354
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,520
Holy fucking shit.

1355
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,800
Oh, like they said that back then.

1356
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,880
Suddenly, all the fog that isn't red completely dissipates

1357
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,860
and you can only see these massive walls

1358
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,880
that encircle the island.

1359
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,600
Boom, boom, boom, out like a bullseye.

1360
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,300
If you were looking at this from above,

1361
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,680
it would look like a Target logo, but with more of them.

1362
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,620
And Edward just shouts, I see it.

1363
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:22,820
You notice in this moment that it seems

1364
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:27,540
that the port deserters did not complete their own circle.

1365
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,100
They completed the neck beard circle.

1366
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:34,560
And in that moment, something absolutely obliterated

1367
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,940
their ship from the inside. Holy shit.

1368
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:41,940
And all of them are on the boiling ocean floor,

1369
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:47,340
floor, ceiling, ocean, ocean ground.

1370
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,420
Ocean surface.

1371
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,540
I like roof though.

1372
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,740
The roof of the ocean.

1373
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,940
The roof of the ocean.

1374
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,700
It probably is roof in like 99 out of a hundred languages

1375
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,740
or some shit.

1376
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,940
Yeah, right?

1377
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,780
If you're a fish making the language,

1378
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,620
it would definitely be your roof.

1379
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,260
There's gotta be so many fish languages too.

1380
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,340
Oh yeah.

1381
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,820
Oh, comparatively.

1382
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:14,100
We've got to break the ocean ceiling, you know?

1383
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:17,120
The death of a salesman and fancy pyromancy on the damn sea

1384
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,960
seem to be equidistant from their individual,

1385
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,760
nice, finishing line.

1386
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,320
Yeah.

1387
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,520
Yeah, sorry.

1388
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,080
I didn't want to break you for language,

1389
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,880
but you did it right.

1390
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,720
Yeah.

1391
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,540
You said all those words.

1392
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,440
I thought about telling you that you got it totally wrong

1393
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,280
and gaslighting you.

1394
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,120
I know.

1395
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,560
I thought about being like Zach thinks equidistant

1396
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,400
means the same distance.

1397
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,720
That is not what it means, dude.

1398
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,480
It does.

1399
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,320
It does though.

1400
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,600
Oh yeah.

1401
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,040
I couldn't see my face, but I'm like, wait.

1402
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,000
We're totally gonna make him believe that equidistant means.

1403
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,840
Equidistant.

1404
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,280
Sorry, I had to take off my headphones for a second.

1405
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,660
Where were we?

1406
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,720
We were equidistant, bro.

1407
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:06,720
Oh man.

1408
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,240
I bet even if we talk about how like this will be a bit

1409
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,760
where we gaslight Zach into believing equidistant

1410
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,080
doesn't mean what it means,

1411
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,400
we could still carry it out and like get him to believe it

1412
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,600
for a lot of the season.

1413
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,440
What do you think?

1414
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,600
The thing is I need to fire your cannons.

1415
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,640
I need to fire my cannons.

1416
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,800
I want you to describe.

1417
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,620
Okay, yeah.

1418
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,040
Well, I've got to get rid of this.

1419
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,000
And so as the fog clears on this ship,

1420
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,560
everyone sees you walking down from the top,

1421
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,880
walking down the steps to the deck, carrying what?

1422
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,720
The fog is dissipating at his sides

1423
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,400
as he's slowly walking toward the front with his.

1424
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,800
Well, walking towards the back, right?

1425
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,880
Cause they're behind us now.

1426
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,440
They are equidistant.

1427
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,600
It would be the front popping out of the fog.

1428
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,520
The side, yeah.

1429
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,000
Yeah, and Al has basically just like a small cannon

1430
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,080
on his shoulder.

1431
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,860
He lights a match off the cannon,

1432
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,160
hands it to Jesus Christ, his monkey.

1433
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,700
Jesus Christ grabs the tip of your cannon

1434
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,960
and angles it way higher.

1435
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,360
Oh, wait, what?

1436
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,380
Oh, right, penguin.

1437
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,720
It's totally a monkey, but the pirates don't know

1438
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,560
what a penguin is.

1439
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,120
They're like, that's a penguin.

1440
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,480
He's going to kill that penguin.

1441
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,360
It lifts up the top of the cannon

1442
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,160
to give you an extra bit of boost.

1443
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,840
And the Timurine Monkey is going to assist your role

1444
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,760
by lifting your cannon and showing you,

1445
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,680
we're going to have to fire really fucking far

1446
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,400
because we're back to the, almost the starting line.

1447
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,640
And you remember Fancy Pyromancy on the DMC

1448
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,640
was basically out of cannon mode.

1449
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,960
And he was just like,

1450
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,520
the monkey on the DMC was basically out of cannon range

1451
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,680
when we started.

1452
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,440
Thank God I found a monkey with geometry skills

1453
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,760
and like way higher thinking than I have.

1454
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,880
Let's roll this, baby.

1455
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,480
68 on an 80.

1456
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,680
21 on a monkey.

1457
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,620
Oh, yes, he won.

1458
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,240
All right, go ahead and roll.

1459
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,080
What is this?

1460
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:09,920
It's a shoulder cannon.

1461
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,760
Yeah, it's a shoulder cannon.

1462
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,080
It's a firing combination of stinky potion

1463
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,560
and giant fire extinguisher potion.

1464
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,000
Is this mounted on your shoulder

1465
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,640
and the monkey is like adjusting its trajectory

1466
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,280
or is the monkey on your shoulder

1467
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,840
and the cannon's on its shoulder?

1468
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,240
The cannon is on my right shoulder.

1469
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,640
The monkey's on my left shoulder adjusting it for me.

1470
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,720
Generally, I would have like two people

1471
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,240
like bracing me to do this,

1472
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,080
but I don't need to, so I mean, it's-

1473
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,420
He calls them Jesus Christ,

1474
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,100
but we call him Trajectory the Gunnery Monkey.

1475
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:45,300
The monkey lights the cannon ball and we wait.

1476
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,940
And as we're waiting, we're gonna see

1477
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,780
if they can succeed on this navigation check

1478
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,380
at the same time as Wavy Adler

1479
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,940
to find out if we're gonna finish this race

1480
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,200
before this fucking bomb goes off.

1481
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,040
Okay.

1482
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,180
I got a 94.

1483
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,280
I'm gonna use my very last luck to make it a 49.

1484
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,600
Fuck yeah.

1485
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,420
Hell yeah.

1486
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,260
When did you roll though?

1487
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,440
I rolled a 59 and they have a 60.

1488
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,280
Oh.

1489
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,700
But because of Luke's cannon going off

1490
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,840
in that exact moment,

1491
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,400
as they're about to reach their blood trail,

1492
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,020
it's right in front of them

1493
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,380
and the fog is taking over the front of their ship,

1494
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:37,560
but it hasn't quite made it to the back barrel yet.

1495
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,640
And in that final moment, right before you fired,

1496
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,560
the monkey tilted the cannon just a little bit further

1497
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,080
to the back of their ship.

1498
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,960
And you see this thing just-

1499
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,400
Ew.

1500
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,740
And then-

1501
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,120
Oh God, what's that smell?

1502
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,520
That's the stink bomb part of it

1503
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,280
as it mixes with the blood from inside the barrel

1504
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:08,160
on the back of this ship as blood explodes everywhere

1505
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,800
and Wavy Adler leads the death of a salesman

1506
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,920
directly through the red fog,

1507
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,940
right through until it takes over Mitch as he says,

1508
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,780
what?

1509
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,480
Okay.

1510
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,320
What?

1511
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:24,880
Boom.

1512
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:32,200
In that moment, the red fog that you have created

1513
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,480
completely disappears down into the water.

1514
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,080
Every other circle, each of them,

1515
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,520
one at a time going toward the island,

1516
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,360
boom, boom, boom,

1517
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,040
fog and maybe stone, some sort of cement

1518
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,640
you've never seen anything like it,

1519
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,080
erupting from out of the ocean.

1520
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,240
As each of these walls go up,

1521
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:01,240
blocking off the island from view, the fog fucking like,

1522
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,920
each one of these walls moves forward

1523
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,420
and the island disappears from view.

1524
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:11,120
The fog is the only thing that you can see.

1525
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,920
And in that moment, I need all of you to roll sanity.

1526
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,000
Holy shit, this is fucking awesome, dude.

1527
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,960
I passed 33 on a 60.

1528
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,240
I also passed a 63 on an 80.

1529
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,200
I have 90 sanity.

1530
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,400
The wall next to you created a massive wave

1531
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,280
that pushes you out further to sea

1532
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,520
and directs the tip of your boat away

1533
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,880
from where the island once was.

1534
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,540
The fog behind you dissipates.

1535
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,860
There is absolutely nothing there.

1536
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,700
What's wrong?

1537
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,680
Well, what did we do wrong, Mitch?

1538
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,600
Where's the island?

1539
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,480
I don't know.

1540
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,760
How do we win this thing?

1541
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,440
Mother, mother, I thought that, is it over?

1542
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,640
She walks up to him,

1543
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,240
she's looking off the side of the ship.

1544
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,280
She's like, I suppose it's done.

1545
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,840
Huh?

1546
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,060
You fucking fools.

1547
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,400
You rich fucking fools.

1548
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,640
You killed all these men.

1549
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,200
It's just to throw them walls up.

1550
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,920
Where are my riches?

1551
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,120
Where's Wavy's riches?

1552
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,240
Where's the gold you mentioned?

1553
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,260
There's a big score.

1554
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:20,780
That's what we were doing this for.

1555
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,500
Where's the fucking payout?

1556
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,000
Al is waking up from being knocked out

1557
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,900
by the force of his shoulder cannon

1558
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,480
and he thinks everything is done now

1559
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,180
so he looks up at Jesus Christ, high fives him

1560
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,060
and stands up and then looks over at you guys.

1561
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:39,820
So we did it, where's the gold and shit?

1562
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,700
That's a great fucking question, Al.

1563
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,940
Where is the gold?

1564
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,460
Mom, where's the gold?

1565
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,780
Where's our power, Mrs. Tiggory?

1566
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:50,860
You have all been excellent servants and-

1567
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,340
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

1568
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:57,720
You have completed exactly what we needed from you.

1569
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,460
Thank you.

1570
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,980
I have nothing for you,

1571
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,900
but I appreciate the work that you've done.

1572
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,260
You mean other than the gold?

1573
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,100
Yeah, right.

1574
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:07,920
Yes, that's right.

1575
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,380
Yes, take me back to port and we will get you your gold.

1576
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:15,220
The wall has disappeared and you turn back

1577
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,820
and look at where the wall once was.

1578
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:21,420
No wall, no island, no fog, it's a beautiful sunny day.

1579
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,260
No island?

1580
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,100
No island.

1581
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,400
And what port does she mean?

1582
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,180
Oh, back, you know, Jamaica.

1583
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,580
Where's your fucking husband?

1584
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:30,260
He seems to be gone.

1585
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,540
That's a bit of a relief, isn't it?

1586
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:34,740
Are there still the husks of ships sinking

1587
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,500
or are we alone on the ocean?

1588
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,620
You are absolutely alone on the ocean.

1589
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:41,420
Mitch is still on board, right?

1590
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,380
Mitch is still on board.

1591
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:46,260
Mitch, what the fuck is going on?

1592
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,540
And I pull my knife out, but I have a smile on my face.

1593
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,380
But jovially.

1594
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,740
Yeah, I actually don't know.

1595
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:59,740
I mean, dad said that it would be, you know,

1596
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:01,760
like world changing or whatever.

1597
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,540
And I guess it did change the world, but.

1598
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,500
Kill some pirates and build some walls.

1599
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,540
Build some walls to only have them fall down again.

1600
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,020
There's nothing left.

1601
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,180
Was your dad fond of you and your mom?

1602
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:14,740
No.

1603
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,580
Okay, I see.

1604
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,820
I mean, yeah, in his own way.

1605
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:20,700
Yeah, but he might want to get rid of you or something.

1606
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,940
Perhaps, maybe at some point.

1607
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,060
I just put my flintlock to Mitch's head

1608
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:27,060
and I turned to Mrs. Diggory.

1609
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:30,300
You better tell us the real fucking scheme here

1610
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,820
or I'll blow your son's brains out.

1611
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,300
Your husband changed the world, how'd he do that?

1612
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,380
What changed?

1613
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:37,780
What did we do?

1614
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,500
She looks at Mitch.

1615
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,220
She looks at you.

1616
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:44,580
Looks back behind her over the edge of the ship.

1617
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:48,900
She takes a step backward.

1618
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:49,920
I'm sorry, Mitch.

1619
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,220
She jumps backwards.

1620
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:56,020
Monkey tail in hand, monkey reaching out for.

1621
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,580
Spitz watches her go.

1622
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,300
So Al thinks about,

1623
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:04,180
Al thinks about having, grabbing Jesus's tail

1624
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:07,660
and having Jesus grab her before she falls.

1625
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:11,020
But what really happens is he grabs Jesus's tail

1626
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,700
and Jesus slaps him on the side of the head

1627
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,100
and no safe attempt.

1628
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,180
Yeah, she succeeded for jumping off the ship

1629
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,940
and she splashes down into the water.

1630
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:24,580
She fails her jump roll so she lands safely.

1631
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,900
On the next deck below.

1632
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,220
No, she jumps a couple inches in the air.

1633
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,780
She's on the roof of the water.

1634
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,820
Wavy turns to Mitch.

1635
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,500
But about that gold.

1636
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,380
Yeah, I don't think.

1637
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,020
Oh, there is no gold.

1638
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,460
There's no fucking gold except maybe for his father.

1639
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,300
But we won.

1640
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,140
We won.

1641
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:44,980
Yeah, we won.

1642
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,020
We won someone else's game.

1643
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,260
We won someone else's game, Wavy.

1644
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,180
This game won for us.

1645
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,220
I turn to Mitch and I say, boy, you've got two options.

1646
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,700
He's just staring at the spot on the deck

1647
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,060
where his mom jumped off

1648
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:01,220
and his eyes are as full of water

1649
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:04,500
as they possibly could be without a single drop falling.

1650
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,420
Mitch, it's pirate time.

1651
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,260
It's hard.

1652
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,740
People's moms are dead on this ship.

1653
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,660
So unless you want to join her,

1654
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,940
you tell us where you think your father's gone.

1655
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:14,860
Oh, I don't know.

1656
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:18,020
I thought you were gonna ask me to be a pirate.

1657
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:21,140
You're gonna be like a prisoner pirate or something.

1658
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:21,980
I mean.

1659
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,900
Or you're gonna die unless you tell us.

1660
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:24,740
Wait, but I don't know.

1661
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,380
Can I just be a pirate without being a prisoner?

1662
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,220
What do you know about?

1663
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,500
You're gonna die, Mitch.

1664
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,340
I'm sorry.

1665
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,980
What do you know about being a pirate?

1666
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,940
You guys probably don't have anyone

1667
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,540
who's like good at accounting.

1668
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:36,380
I could do that.

1669
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,820
I didn't make him the offer yet.

1670
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,060
Counting though.

1671
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,900
I don't think any of us know how to do that.

1672
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:41,940
Yeah, I can count.

1673
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,260
As I was saying,

1674
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,900
I don't give a shit what your pirate skills are.

1675
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,460
We'll find a use for you on this ship.

1676
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,300
You can count.

1677
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,140
That's irrelevant.

1678
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,100
I'm sorry, but that's irrelevant.

1679
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,300
No, he's already bringing out the best in me.

1680
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,980
I'm gonna make you a bitch intern

1681
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,620
for about like 24 months

1682
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,500
before you'll get anywhere near accounting

1683
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,860
after the stunt you've pulled.

1684
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:02,700
Do you understand?

1685
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,420
Are you the captain?

1686
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,620
No, but I'm in charge of personnel.

1687
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,460
There's no captain,

1688
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,660
it's a pirate democracy,

1689
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,500
except for you.

1690
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,340
You're at the bottom.

1691
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,860
Wait, I can't be a part of the democracy?

1692
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:18,780
No, you can't vote

1693
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,460
unless you're a full vested crew member.

1694
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,460
I disagree with that.

1695
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,060
I think everybody gets a vote.

1696
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,740
After they've been vested for six months on the ship,

1697
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,460
until then they're provisional pirate members.

1698
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,900
Well, I don't remember it being six months.

1699
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,380
The voice says from the back.

1700
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,340
Well, maybe it's not quite a democracy

1701
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,900
now that we've saved the day, huh?

1702
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,100
I couldn't count though.

1703
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:46,540
Well, that's why we need him for democracy.

1704
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:49,060
HR decision, and I've got my knife to his throat.

1705
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,980
And I say, Mitch, where might your father have gone?

1706
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,500
I know you don't know,

1707
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,340
tell us your best fucking guess

1708
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,860
or slit your throat.

1709
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,020
Oh God, probably home.

1710
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,060
I would guess home or the last place he was,

1711
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,880
which was on the island,

1712
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,440
I don't know where the island is now.

1713
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,280
Edward is losing his patience and he like-

1714
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,120
We can try to find the island.

1715
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,360
We can try to find the island.

1716
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,200
It's gone now.

1717
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,440
And maybe that's where the treasure all along was.

1718
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,280
Cause it's gone.

1719
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,120
I don't know.

1720
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,960
We're not gonna try to find an island school

1721
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,920
and tell us where the fuck home is.

1722
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,520
Wait, hang on though.

1723
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,200
Mitch, if we wanted to find an island,

1724
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,520
how would we do that?

1725
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,400
You say that like that's something you know how to do.

1726
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,280
I guess we just like sail back to where we just were.

1727
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,320
What do you mean where we were?

1728
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,240
We are where we were.

1729
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:35,040
He points to like a spot in the beautiful sunshiny day

1730
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,040
that it is now.

1731
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,440
And he's like, wasn't the island like over there?

1732
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,400
And hey, Wavey, super not.

1733
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,120
But like, you know where the island was.

1734
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,340
No, it was over there.

1735
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,920
But I get your point.

1736
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,160
Let's just go park our boat over top of it.

1737
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,800
Maybe it's below?

1738
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,200
Yeah, maybe we'll find the old bastards ground corpse.

1739
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,160
I wanna pilot the ship over that direction

1740
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,520
just to sit on top of the spot.

1741
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,320
Go ahead and roll navigation for me.

1742
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,000
Mm.

1743
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,640
18, for the listener,

1744
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,800
Zach was giving me his hardest poker face.

1745
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,320
There was no, there was, it was-

1746
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,520
While also making like cum noises.

1747
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,360
But it also, it wasn't-

1748
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,680
Those are like Michael Bobaro noises.

1749
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,760
It was obviously, it was obviously a face

1750
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,880
that was trying to not do either a frown or a smile.

1751
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,800
It was very strongly trying to be

1752
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,640
the most neutral face you could make.

1753
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,760
You can see all my face right now.

1754
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,200
So I have to be very particular.

1755
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,960
You say try not to hide a frown or a smile

1756
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,440
as if Zach would like hide his disappointment

1757
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,240
if we guessed his little game.

1758
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,120
You've stumbled right into it.

1759
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,780
He's trying to hide that little fucking grin

1760
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:40,400
from his bastard face.

1761
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,200
Cause we're gonna be eaten by Xith, Cthulhu.

1762
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,320
As soon as we fucking, anyway.

1763
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,160
The last shot.

1764
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,080
We did light up a target.

1765
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:51,920
The last shot.

1766
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,080
We're gonna go sit in the bullseye of a target.

1767
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:04,440
Trust me, trust me guys, let's get over there.

1768
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,280
You want me to navigate you.

1769
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,560
I agree it makes sense to check out the island.

1770
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,520
The last shot of this short story

1771
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,440
is the death of a salesman heading toward

1772
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:23,440
just a random spot in the open ocean somewhere

1773
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,800
just Northeast of the greater Antilles

1774
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,360
and T.S. Mayores in the North Atlantic Ocean.

1775
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,680
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama.

1776
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,680
Key Lago, Montego, baby why don't we go to Key Lago.

1777
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:46,080
Barbados, I wanna take it down to Coco Mo.

1778
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,680
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow.

1779
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,280
That's where we wanna go.

1780
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,880
Way down in Coco Mo.

1781
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,840
Bahama, come on.

1782
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,680
Dude.

1783
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,320
No, but there's no resolution.

1784
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,960
We don't find out.

1785
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:13,800
Well, I mean.

1786
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,640
That's a really good point.

1787
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,560
It's like the rest of season two.

1788
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,160
Just be sure to stock up on pirate nerd stats

1789
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,240
and then you'll know about the history.

1790
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,080
There you go.

1791
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,880
Of the Dread Pirate neck beard

1792
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:30,240
and the mysterious events that happened on Bullshit Island.

1793
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,160
Also be sure to stock up on t-shirts, towels,

1794
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,480
fanny packs, hats.

1795
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,400
Listen, the store is launched with season two.

1796
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,760
Get your shit.

1797
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,760
Buy more than one for your friends,

1798
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,880
for you just in case.

1799
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,480
You never know how valuable this stuff's gonna be,

1800
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,480
mint condition, so you gotta buy doubles,

1801
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,320
you gotta buy triples.

1802
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,680
I'm no financial expert

1803
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,560
and this doesn't count as real financial advice,

1804
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,680
but I will 100% guarantee that any investment you make

1805
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,000
in a PTPP piece of merch right now

1806
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,000
will increase 1,000 gold by the end of the decade.

1807
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,640
That is a promise.

1808
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:07,960
There you go.

1809
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,520
We'll see you back.

1810
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,360
We'll see you back.

1811
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,200
We'll see you back.

1812
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,800
We'll see you back at home.

1813
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,640
We'll see you back.

1814
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,480
We'll see you back.

1815
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,320
That's the pain people say.

1816
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,160
We'll see you back.

1817
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,000
We'll see you back.

1818
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,840
We'll see you back.

1819
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,680
Hey, we'll see you back.

1820
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,320
All I'm saying is a $43 towel today

1821
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,760
will net you $43,000 at the end of the decade.

1822
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,800
Wow, really?

1823
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,120
That's such a good deal.

1824
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,360
I was thinking more like you pay 40 bucks for it now,

1825
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,120
it's 60 bucks in 10 years?

1826
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,800
Just because that's what a towel would be worth probably.

1827
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,240
Some stupid old towel.

1828
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,480
No, but it's like a sick towel.

1829
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,320
It's 10 years old.

1830
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,720
It's a sick towel that you never used.

1831
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,440
Owned by one of our listeners.

1832
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:49,440
Even worse, owned by one of the hosts.

1833
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,840
Completely disgusting.

1834
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,040
I can smell each one of us individually nice right now.

1835
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,160
On their own?

1836
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,000
Oh yeah.

1837
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,960
They said individually, didn't they?

1838
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,360
Our smells are equidistant.

1839
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,520
Roughly.

1840
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:15,720
Good one.

1841
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,560
Good one.

1842
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,400
Come on.

1843
01:15:44,440 --> 01:16:06,280
Hey, thanks everybody for listening to this short arc here in season two of pretending

1844
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,120
to be people.

1845
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:12,160
There's going to be a few more of those for some backstory and other story goodies that

1846
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:16,440
carry in with the plot of the main thread of season two.

1847
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,240
Very fucking excited.

1848
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:23,840
But I am here because I am at a loss for words.

1849
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:30,000
I don't know how to say how cool it was that Beth May from Dungeons and Daddies was on

1850
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
our podcast.

1851
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Here's what I'll say.

1852
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Equidistant.

1853
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,440
I think it was like just like such a surreal moment and she was so fun to be at the table

1854
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,440
with.

1855
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,440
It was a dream come true.

1856
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,440
It was awesome.

1857
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,440
It was.

1858
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,840
We thought there's no way in hell it could happen.

1859
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:49,820
And really it turns out there is no way in hell that it can happen, but really we're

1860
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:55,000
thinking Beth and she was lovely, but we got to thank her friend that she thought was huge

1861
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
shout out to Travis.

1862
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Big shout out to Travis.

1863
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Big shout out.

1864
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Yeah.

1865
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,480
Travis, if you're out there, hit us up.

1866
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,440
Let's be real friends.

1867
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,440
Yeah.

1868
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,440
Cause who else do you know?

1869
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,440
Beth May already thinks we are.

1870
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,960
Anyway, Travis, you're out there.

1871
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:10,960
We're friends now.

1872
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,000
It's like we said, thanks Beth or whatever, but thank you Travis.

1873
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,640
No, seriously, Beth found out that we weren't the podcast she thought she was coming on

1874
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,760
and still came on the show.

1875
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,760
Anyway.

1876
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,760
So cool.

1877
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,760
Very rad.

1878
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,760
Go listen to Dungeons and Daddies.

1879
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,760
Yes.

1880
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,760
Go buy her book.

1881
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,760
Yes.

1882
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,760
I believe she said it was available in all bookstores.

1883
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,760
I believe that's what she said.

1884
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,360
Go to your bookstore and buy it.

1885
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:36,680
I think she said like go to Barnes and Noble, have them order it and then go pick it up.

1886
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,680
There you go.

1887
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,680
Thomas?

1888
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,800
I just think she's going to think what Luke said was really tragic.

1889
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:42,800
Which part?

1890
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,800
The Barnes and Noble part.

1891
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,800
What about it's tragic?

1892
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,080
You're supposed to actually see the joke was that you're supposed to preorder it at a small

1893
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,080
local bookstore.

1894
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,080
Oh.

1895
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,080
You don't read.

1896
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,080
You don't know.

1897
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,080
I didn't even think about it.

1898
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,080
Oh my God.

1899
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,080
You fucking.

1900
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,080
Why am I friends with you fucking idiots?

1901
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,080
Okay.

1902
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,080
Sorry.

1903
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,080
Answer it.

1904
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,080
Sorry I said Barnes and Noble.

1905
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,080
Answer it.

1906
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,680
Barnes and Noble book buying bitches.

1907
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,680
Well, you know, support your local bookstore.

1908
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,680
I do.

1909
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,680
But when I think of bookstore, I think Barnes and Noble.

1910
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,680
We got one in town.

1911
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,680
Yeah.

1912
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:16,680
But I don't buy books from there.

1913
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,680
It's just that's where you buy books.

1914
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:45,680
Because my life is great and it's all my fault.
