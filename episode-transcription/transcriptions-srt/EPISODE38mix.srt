1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Hello people in this airplane we call life, it's your captain speaking Wolf the dog, and

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,880
I'm here to airdrop some news on y'all while flying drunk.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:22,880
We are taking over the skies here at 694.2 PTBP the sky kingdoms newest and best and

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,180
only radio show.

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:33,300
Look out skybound geese I'm hungry for bird bones and these propellers are awfully sharp.

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,180
I've got an announcement here from my producer it seems that a few days ago on the first

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,060
of the month the third patreon exclusive episode dropped for all of our honorary police officers.

8
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:52,900
Joe Luke Taylor Thomas and Zach got together and played a disgusting and delicious game

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,280
of the end of the world.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,980
You can hear that as well as our first two bonus episodes, a Q&A session, and a game

11
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,460
of everyone is john by following the link to our patreon in the show notes or going

12
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:13,860
to patreon.com slash pretending pod and becoming an honorary police officer by pledging 5 bucks

13
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,100
a month to keep the show alive.

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,860
Honey might help wolf's bowels but honey right in to help wolf's howls it's howling

15
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,660
with wolf.

16
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,180
This week's howling with wolf comes from at the underdash millennial c who tagged at pretending

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,840
pod in an instagram story y'all know how tickled I get when you take time out of your day to

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,060
share the show with your friends.

19
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,940
At the millennial c he writes

20
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,500
It dumb, so much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back streets,

21
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:26,220
you never know if you don't go, you never shine if you don't glow, y'all wolf rarely

22
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,820
lets his emotions get the best of him but when someone takes the time to write up something

23
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:39,340
so personal and meaningful it just... stop it wolf, stop licking up my tears, remember

24
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,580
if you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl tag at pretending pod on instagram

25
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,260
or twitter tag pretending to be people on facebook or write a 5 star review and email

26
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:57,220
us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com fuck all that dumb social media bullshit after

27
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:04,180
all it only dictates whether wolf gets to eat trash or has to eat trash and wolf has

28
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,060
a distaste for mistakes that dicks fake to get milkshakes.

29
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,900
It's time for the news

30
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,200
Last time, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore, and Keith Vigna came to the dark mausoleum

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,220
of their former co-worker Ari Manstein.

32
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,500
They all had four names burned into their skin, Marvin on their chests, Maggie on the

33
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,580
bottom of their left foot, Drew on the backs, and Tilly on their dominant palms.

34
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,460
Keith Vigna called the number left by Agent Kennedy and he answered a few questions from

35
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,660
an automated voice.

36
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,660
John drove the three of them in Keith's cruiser to Jim Cook's house.

37
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,260
In the neighborhood, every light pole was fitted with a sign warning residents about

38
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,060
Clark Bishop.

39
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,700
In Jim Cook's house, Clark showed his partners the book he found and slowly realized he might

40
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,060
be the overseer that Maggie Cook and the Circle of Knowledge is intent on bringing back.

41
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:07,340
A slow drip of vodka from the ceiling led the three sort of officers upstairs to search

42
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,300
for a room without a door.

43
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,420
Keith knocked on the wall to avoid kicking a stud and then put his foot right through

44
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,700
the wall in the hallway.

45
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,620
It is December 6th, 3pm, and Keith Vigna has one foot in.

46
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,660
I've got one foot out.

47
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:33,420
And shaking it all about is kudzu with no backbone.

48
00:04:37,340 --> 00:05:05,500
It's all really funny to me.

49
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,740
There's some really good ones, yeah.

50
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,620
I saw there's like a Zuckerberg one that was like, not verbatim, but basically it's like

51
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,780
he was, he's the one like pushing a bunch of money so that people will go storm area

52
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,700
51 so they can go find his dad.

53
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:28,660
Oh my god.

54
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,660
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

55
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,900
Alright, so Keith gets pushed through this wall by John Lee Pettymore and Clark Bishop.

56
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,780
The drywall folds.

57
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,300
Also Midsummer Spoilers.

58
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:47,260
And Keith Vigna lands on the other side covered in debris and the hole opens up wide enough

59
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,580
for you guys to look in and in this secret room is a small living room set up.

60
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:59,220
There is a chair with an end table facing a small TV VCR that is sitting on top of a

61
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,660
pile of thick books.

62
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,740
There's a desk with a chair and there is a handle of vodka sideways on the floor next

63
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,420
to the end table poured out onto the rug that barely covers the makeshift floor beneath.

64
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,260
When you say makeshift floor, yeah, I'm picturing that this room is kind of like haphazardly

65
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,060
constructed and therefore the floor is this like plywood.

66
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,060
Like walking.

67
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
Just like sitting on the joists.

68
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,060
Yeah.

69
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,700
Like walking through an attic where you only want to walk on the planks.

70
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,780
Yeah, but they've made it so that they can at least like walk around.

71
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,060
Like he's made the, all of the floor load bearing for the most part.

72
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,580
And you said on the TV it's static or?

73
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,900
Yeah, there's static on the TV.

74
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Are there any VCR tapes lying around?

75
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,980
There are no VHS tapes lying around.

76
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,180
What are the books the TV is sitting on?

77
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:59,740
The books that the TV is sitting on are thick textbooks on radiation and physics and quantum

78
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,980
mechanics.

79
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,260
Just a lot of lofty shit.

80
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,980
A lot of light reading.

81
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:10,620
The end table or any of the tables, do they have drawers in them?

82
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,900
No, but as you walk in and look further into this room, you see that on the end table there

83
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,900
is a small vial of clear liquid, a scalpel, and a box of tissues.

84
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,060
The vial.

85
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,140
When I pick it up, how heavy is it?

86
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,340
About as heavy as a glass vial should be.

87
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,780
Real fast, now that we're kind of standing in the room, taking a look around, could I

88
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,580
see another way into this room that wouldn't have needed to be knocked through a wall?

89
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,580
Yes.

90
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,580
What do I see?

91
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,500
There's just a small door in the corner of the room.

92
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,060
When you open it up, you kind of see on the other side that it was just a false wall.

93
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,500
So this was a secret room.

94
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
This is a hidden room.

95
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,620
So I open that door and I see a wall in front of me and I can push on it to open it?

96
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Yeah.

97
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
Got it.

98
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,620
Where do I pop out?

99
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,620
Just in the hallway.

100
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
Upstairs.

101
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,620
Okay.

102
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
I have this vial in my hand.

103
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,700
I'm like, what do you guys think this is?

104
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,060
I'm not going to taste it, but I haven't opened it up yet.

105
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,900
With all the weird shit we've been dealing with, I feel like if I open this up, two things

106
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
could happen.

107
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,600
One, absolutely nothing, and then we wonder what happens, or two, some fucking something

108
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
crazy is going to happen.

109
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,800
What if you become like a Batman?

110
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
I don't want to be like Batman.

111
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,720
I want to, I don't know.

112
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
And I opened it up.

113
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Sorry, I mean a man bat.

114
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,200
As you hold on to the bottom of the vial with one hand, your other hand kind of slowly goes

115
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,240
to grasp around the top of the vial and it's shaking a little bit and slowly twist off

116
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,720
the top with the rubber dropper on top.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,280
As you lift it off, absolutely nothing happens.

118
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,160
As I learned in science class, as Keith Fignan learned in science class, I waft it into my

119
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
nose to see if I smell anything.

120
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
I love the wafting.

121
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,600
It's important for science.

122
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,480
That way you don't fall over and die in eighth grade science class.

123
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,280
This liquid seems to be not noxious in any way.

124
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,880
Well, I'm going to screw the lid back on and put that in one of my big old pockets

125
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
for now.

126
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Okay.

127
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
There was a label on it, was there?

128
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,920
There was no label on it.

129
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,880
Is there anybody else in this room?

130
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Yes, there are.

131
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
There's a man standing there.

132
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
There's a hundred people wanting to fight you.

133
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,200
Asking you to stop touching his things.

134
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Please sir.

135
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,400
Can I do a search to see if I see anything else that I didn't just immediately see?

136
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,280
Well, as you guys continue to look around this room, you would notice that on the desk

137
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:48,060
are three folders and an envelope and the TV VCR itself, there is no antenna on it and

138
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,620
there's no coaxial plugged in.

139
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,720
It's just the power cable.

140
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,760
Hey John, you mentioned a TV in one of your visions.

141
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Is this the TV?

142
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,500
It doesn't seem, no, it doesn't seem like it.

143
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,880
Can I unplug the TV?

144
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Yeah.

145
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,160
When you unplug the TV, the static stops.

146
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Like a TV.

147
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,200
I want to feel inside the VHS slot.

148
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,040
There is a VHS in the TV VCR.

149
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Ooh, eject it please.

150
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,920
I plug the TV back in.

151
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:25,480
When you plug it in as John Lee Pettymore is clicking eject and a VHS pops out and it

152
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,080
is labeled Bishops WOF.

153
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,840
Stick it in there and see if we can not.

154
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,480
Wait, is the VCR plugged into the TV or is this a TV VCR combo?

155
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
It's a combo baby.

156
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,800
I go and look at that tape.

157
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,260
Is there anything in the WOF that, is it an acronym?

158
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,120
Is it periods between them or capitalized?

159
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,920
All capitalized periods in between.

160
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,120
You guys know what WOF could mean?

161
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
We're about to find out.

162
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,080
Put it back in there, see if it'll hit play.

163
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,760
An episode of Wheel of Fortune, of course.

164
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Well hell man, this must have been where old you was hanging out.

165
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,920
And as the episode begins to play, you meet the contestants.

166
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,160
It's couples week on Wheel of Fortune and one of the set of contestants, Clark Bishop's

167
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
parents.

168
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,400
A very young Clark Bishop's parents.

169
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,480
They say that they had just gotten married and they are trying to win money for their

170
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
honeymoon.

171
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,960
Have I ever seen this before?

172
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Nope.

173
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,560
Clark is maybe real sentimental about seeing this and sits in the chair opposite the TV

174
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,280
and watches intently.

175
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,120
John tries to see if there's any more vodka left.

176
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
There is some.

177
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,080
You know in the reservoir on a handle where I wouldn't have poured out the spout, there's

178
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,760
that much vodka left.

179
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,000
I take a swig and then pass it to, I offer it to Vigna.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,560
I kind of put my hand up not wanting any of this spilled vodka, but I look at Clark sitting

181
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,720
down and watching this, I'm like, Clark, I know that you like Wheel of Fortune, but is

182
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,840
this really the time to sit down and start watching an episode?

183
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Keith, those are my parents.

184
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
I've never seen this before.

185
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,360
Those are my parents on Wheel of Fortune.

186
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
That couple right there?

187
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,380
And I look at it and I look at both of them and I look at Clark and I'm like, my God,

188
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,540
those are your parents.

189
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,640
The resemblance is uncanny.

190
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,240
Yeah, I've never seen your parents before, but Jesus Christ, are those not your parents?

191
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,560
Is it canon that my parents look like me?

192
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Oh shit.

193
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,680
You quoted earlier that that might not be the case.

194
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,240
I know I'm adopted.

195
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Do you look like your parents?

196
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,280
I mean, I, yeah, I would say you've always seen it.

197
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,960
I've always seen it.

198
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,800
I want to keep watching the show.

199
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,840
I don't know how to, is there a role I can do to say, is there anything significant to

200
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:53,600
their play or maybe the puzzles they're doing or anything that would ping for Clark as a

201
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,800
thing that's interesting to note?

202
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,360
Do you want to watch the whole episode or are you just going to fast forward through

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,600
trying to catch like what each puzzle is and who solves it and how they do or honestly,

204
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,480
I'll probably watch as much as the boys will let me, what if you just try to fast forward

205
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
to your parents' parts?

206
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,640
I think pause and fast forwards have fast forward, but yeah, let's just, let's just

207
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
fast forward.

208
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,580
I'll just check out my parents' parts anytime they're on camera, push play, you keep going

209
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,580
through.

210
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,840
They seem to be doing quite well, so we'll fast forward until just your parents' parts

211
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
and watch that.

212
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,320
Fellas don't mind, I haven't seen this before and it's nice to see them moving around.

213
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,720
Yeah, and it's just weird as fuck that this is happening right now, that those are your

214
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
parents.

215
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,360
While he is watching it, I'm going to continue searching around this room.

216
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Yeah, absolutely.

217
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,360
So you would notice that there are the three folders and an envelope that are on the desk

218
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
that you haven't touched.

219
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,080
Yeah, I would like to open up each of those starting with the first.

220
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Okay.

221
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:01,240
Alright, so you open up one of the folders and on the inside you see a large stack of

222
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
papers.

223
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,200
It is labeled Operation Stapler.

224
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,060
How thick of a stack of papers?

225
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,060
Quite thick.

226
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,860
On the second page, there is a massive logo that you recognize.

227
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,280
It is an M that is made out of four double helices.

228
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,360
Is there an appendices?

229
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,000
What's the thing at the very beginning?

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Index.

231
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,600
There is an index at the beginning as well.

232
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,680
So basically the front page says Operation Stapler.

233
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,360
On the second page, it's got the logo of the M with the double helices and under it, with

234
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,720
the same M spelled out, it says Myriad.

235
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Myriad?

236
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
M-Y-R-I-A-D.

237
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,200
Can I go to the index and see what the highlights of the paper?

238
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,280
Yeah, absolutely.

239
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,680
So this is basically a program respec.

240
00:14:50,680 --> 00:15:00,560
So this is someone who is going through and rewriting an existing program to create androids.

241
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,420
And the whole respec of this program is to cut down on cost and sell to private companies.

242
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:14,240
Is there anything in this about cutting costs, of where they cut costs on these androids?

243
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,760
Yeah, pretty much all across the board.

244
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,980
They cut it in staff.

245
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,700
They cut it in research.

246
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,700
They cut it in supplies.

247
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Every aspect.

248
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,220
But not anything that indicates in the new androids, specifically like a certain thing

249
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,020
they really cut costs on?

250
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Nope.

251
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,380
Mostly just an overall cut.

252
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,940
Is there any indication of what private companies they thought they might be able to sell them

253
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,940
to?

254
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,420
There are no indications.

255
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,020
I want to Google Myriad.

256
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,900
Not the word, but the...

257
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,060
When you Google Myriad, go ahead and roll.

258
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,140
Do you have a computers skill of some sort?

259
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,780
Yeah, I have 50 in computer science.

260
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
Oh, yeah.

261
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Use that.

262
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,900
69, which is a success.

263
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Oh, it's...

264
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Fuck it, 66.

265
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
It's a fucking critical fail.

266
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Critical fail.

267
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,900
Oh, no.

268
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,060
Myself, my smartphone explodes.

269
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,380
Actually looking at your phone, which is the phone that was just in Kevin's clothes.

270
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
It's not a smartphone.

271
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,380
All right.

272
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
Fuck.

273
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,380
You texted Google.

274
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,380
Cha-cha.

275
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,380
Cha-cha.

276
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
What is Myriad?

277
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,380
I'm just trying to remember what that was called.

278
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
It just gives the description of the actual word.

279
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,860
Cha-cha was awesome before you could just Google things on your phone.

280
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,420
Cha-cha was awesome.

281
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:38,340
The screen on your phone wobbles in a very strange way and covers your phone screen before

282
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,300
it just goes back to normal.

283
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:46,340
Real fast, are androids something in this world that we know about?

284
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
Okay.

285
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,260
It's weird how often that you've interacted with them in the past six days for them to

286
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:59,300
have never been a thing in your life previous, aside from film and television, right?

287
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,140
Which I think maybe we might get copyright stung on this by George Lucas.

288
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,140
Yeah.

289
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,660
The inventor of androids.

290
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
He's a go-getter.

291
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,740
I think he's droid, not android.

292
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,020
Clark, as you keep fast forwarding through, your parents are killing it.

293
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,180
They took a commanding lead in the very first puzzle.

294
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,260
They were always good at it.

295
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,580
The second folder on this desk, it's the exact same setup with the papers, and on the front

296
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,220
page it says Operation Hole Puncher.

297
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,940
On the second page, there is the logo for the Circle of Knowledge, and then underneath

298
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,220
it it says Circle of Knowledge.

299
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:43,400
This one is a smaller paper, and the index is just a list of companies.

300
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,680
Myriad is not on that list?

301
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:52,680
As you go through them, Myriad is not on the list, and they are mostly non-profits, charities,

302
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,000
think tanks, and universities.

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,480
Is it small enough that I could maybe flip through to the first few, maybe like an introductory

304
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,200
page and learn what this is, what it pertains to?

305
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:12,920
It is a list of companies, and then each page of the company has a date, and an address,

306
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,100
and a phone number.

307
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,480
How many companies are there?

308
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,680
There are hundreds.

309
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Okay.

310
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,560
On to the third folder.

311
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,280
Clark, your parents keep winning.

312
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
They just keep winning.

313
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,960
They're knocking it out of the park.

314
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:33,560
Both of them have now succeeded at calling out a puzzle, and they make it to the bonus

315
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,600
round, the final round.

316
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Final Jeopardy, if you will.

317
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,640
I figured they would.

318
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:47,960
The third folder on the desk is called Operation Three Ring Binder, and it is empty, but inside

319
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:55,500
one of the pockets in this folder is this item, and you pull it out, and it is a dirty

320
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,440
dog grooming key fob.

321
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,800
Okay.

322
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,200
Keith has a crazy idea.

323
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,280
He opens up that first folder again.

324
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:13,600
I slip the ring on my finger, and I press it to the page with the M embossment or image.

325
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,760
As you move your hand closer to this page with the image of the M on it, your hands

326
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,200
start shaking, and you get close, and then you press the ring onto the paper, and nothing

327
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
happens.

328
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,480
I knew that's what was going to happen, but I wanted to try.

329
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,240
I'd like to open the envelope.

330
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Okay.

331
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,600
Clark, the bonus round starts, and they put the clue up on, but they don't do the letters

332
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,760
yet, and then the bonus letters come on.

333
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
RST, that will mean.

334
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Thank you.

335
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Yeah.

336
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:57,480
And your mom turns to your dad and says, we're already given the best letters.

337
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,520
They solve the puzzle, and win the prize of the wheel of fortune, and the prize is

338
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
a honeymoon.

339
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
It may as well be.

340
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
They win a honeymoon.

341
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Where do they go?

342
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Branson.

343
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Yep.

344
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,760
It's an all expense paid trip to Branson, Missouri.

345
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,360
Four nights, three days.

346
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,400
That's back in peak Branson, mind you, before Andy Williams die.

347
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Yeah.

348
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Anyway.

349
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:35,160
Thomas, John Lee Pettymore goes to the envelope, and I am now handing Thomas an envelope.

350
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:44,480
Keith looks at John, Kevin, and I'm just hoping that he just reads it out loud.

351
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,480
He doesn't.

352
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
What's it say, dude?

353
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Hold on.

354
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Oh, cool.

355
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,240
You know the wheel of fortune theme song?

356
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,680
That's Jeopardy, right?

357
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
That's Jeopardy.

358
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Wheel of Fortune.

359
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
I don't know what there's.

360
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
That's it.

361
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:11,640
Wheel of Fortune is mostly like, it's a bunch of the stuff, and there's Wheel of Fortune,

362
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,720
and then it goes into Pat Sajak.

363
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
It's wheel.

364
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,360
It's motherfucking Pat Sajak up in this.

365
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,440
Can you just read it out loud though?

366
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,380
It starts with the symbol of the circle of knowledge, and it says faith through knowledge

367
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,720
is just called knowledge, which is the start of Jim Cook's letter disputing the revelations

368
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
of the overseer.

369
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
All right.

370
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,080
Faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

371
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,920
Fellow keepers, it is with great sadness I write to you.

372
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,320
I fear a change is coming.

373
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,880
I cannot be certain, but I suspect there is one among us scheming with treacherous intent.

374
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,240
I have recently grown a tail.

375
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,560
He is not particularly skilled in going unnoticed.

376
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,240
He is an odd little man with round glasses on a fat face with no hair and no chin.

377
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,160
He is a journalist fired for trying to write an expose on Marvin Glass.

378
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Stay alert.

379
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Step carefully.

380
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,040
We are being watched, Jim Cook.

381
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,880
And a lot of the letters are either over or underlined.

382
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,400
So I'm just trying to write those out right now.

383
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
Round glasses, fat face.

384
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Yeah.

385
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,880
Would that remind me of John Peters?

386
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
Didn't he have a round face?

387
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,160
A lot of people have round faces where I come from.

388
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,680
Who was the food guy?

389
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,300
What food guy?

390
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,680
Behind curtain number three.

391
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Harold Dorsey.

392
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Oh, yeah.

393
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Behind curtain number three.

394
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Behind Dorsey.

395
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,800
Yeah, he was a food critic.

396
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I don't know.

397
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
I guess he could have been lying.

398
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,280
That was just the first thing that popped into my mind.

399
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,840
It probably isn't, but.

400
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Yeah.

401
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,840
Because I looked up his website.

402
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
He was a food guy.

403
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,240
I guess he could have maybe stumbled on something and decided to run with it for a Marvin Glass

404
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
thing.

405
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Yeah, probably not.

406
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
I don't know.

407
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
He was following around.

408
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
God damn it.

409
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,900
Who was he following around?

410
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,080
He was following.

411
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,320
He was trying to get.

412
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Maggie Kirk.

413
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
But why?

414
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,120
Why was he following Maggie?

415
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Why was he?

416
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
Maybe because she's Jim's son and he was following Jim.

417
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
But there was a reason.

418
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Well, fuck.

419
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
I don't remember.

420
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Probably my notes somewhere.

421
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
God damn it.

422
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Okay.

423
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
I can't.

424
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
Here's this letter.

425
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,120
I can't make heads or tails of the underlying letters.

426
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,200
I got a Macau a GAC.

427
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,400
Is that anything close?

428
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Macau a GAC.

429
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Yeah.

430
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
You nailed it.

431
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
10 bonus points.

432
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Some of them are overlined.

433
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Some of them are underlined.

434
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,560
I will post a picture of this letter on our Instagram at pretending pod and on our Twitter

435
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,880
at pretending pod.

436
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
All right.

437
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,060
So I think I've got to figure it out.

438
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,040
Listening along at home and you want to try yourself, you might want to go to the pretending

439
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,520
to be people Instagram page now and take a look at that letter at pretending pod.

440
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Hop on there.

441
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Pause this.

442
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,240
See if you can solve it yourself because Thomas is about to break this motherfucker wide open.

443
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
All right.

444
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
So it's two sets of letters.

445
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
What was that about Instagram, John?

446
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
I don't know.

447
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,120
I was speaking in tongues.

448
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,320
There's two sets of letters here.

449
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,760
Half of them are overlined and half of them are underlined.

450
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,960
The overlined letters spell out Maggie.

451
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,320
The underlined letters spell out Cook.

452
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,720
I think old Jim was trying to tell us that his daughter Maggie is the, the trader he

453
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,400
suspects is among us.

454
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,600
Will you read, will you read that opening, that part where he, dear keepers, it is with

455
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
great sadness.

456
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,440
I write to you a fear of change coming.

457
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,160
I cannot be certain, but I suspect there is one among us scheming with treacherous intent.

458
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,120
And then he also, he mentioned his, uh, Oh hell, what did we decide his name was?

459
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,400
The reporter, Harold Dorsey, Harold Dorsey.

460
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,320
So I was, I was mulling that over.

461
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,640
I don't remember exactly why he was following Maggie, but he, he came in and told Drew that

462
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,880
he was going over to Maggie's and Drew said, I'd help you in.

463
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,280
Now that I think about it, Keith, Harold Dorsey just ran a blog.

464
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
I don't know.

465
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
He was old enough.

466
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,880
He could have had a life in journalism before that.

467
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,120
They said he got axed because he was touching a Marvin thing.

468
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,480
Well, let's look into some of the stuff he was writing about before he started talking

469
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
about Marvin.

470
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,700
Did he have an interest in the supernatural?

471
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:20,000
Talking about Harold, I stepped over Harold with Drew's body to pull him out of that exploding

472
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
building.

473
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,960
Harold was following Maggie.

474
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,600
Just Harold, H A R R E L L.

475
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Harold?

476
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Harold.

477
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,040
Okay, let me start that all over again.

478
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Like a man, Carol?

479
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,880
I thought it was Harold Dorsey.

480
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Yeah, I definitely did too because Harold's not a fucking name.

481
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,120
H A R R E L L.

482
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
I wrote down Harold.

483
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Hey.

484
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Okay.

485
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Shit.

486
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Kiss ass.

487
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
We're going to get you.

488
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
Luck, please.

489
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,440
We're going to get you after this podcast, Joe.

490
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,640
Joe gets five luck.

491
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,980
What's that put your luck at now, Joe?

492
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,880
If you're really giving it to me, it makes me 60.

493
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,840
Oh, I'm giving it to you.

494
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,160
I found out the Maggie Cook thing.

495
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,960
It just licked your tain a little bit.

496
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:12,760
Well, you're really taking a lot of the role play out of this for me.

497
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,500
This has all been an elaborate sexual fantasy for a sec.

498
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Power fantasy, baby.

499
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,520
Anyway, Harold Dorsey, I stepped over him with Drew's body.

500
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,240
Everything is about sex, except for sex, which is about power.

501
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,600
Harold died in the explosion.

502
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
Or was he dead already when he walked in?

503
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
No.

504
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,480
When I walked in, it was Harold and Drew laying next to each other, puke all over the place,

505
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,680
Maggie's foot cut off, James, the mill worker's foot cut off.

506
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,160
I don't know if he's eating it or not, but a plate full of foot meat in front of him,

507
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:51,160
bullet in his head, tripped some sort of wire, and I had a split second decision to make.

508
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,600
I drug drew out of there.

509
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,260
I stepped over Harold Dorsey's body.

510
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:02,460
So our theory right now is that Harold Dorsey, turns out, was tailing Jim Cook, and Jim Cook

511
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,180
surmised that he was a disgraced journalist who had been searching for Marvin.

512
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,860
It's kind of two things that are kind of going against each other.

513
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,620
He was fired for writing about Marvin.

514
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,100
Now we know he had a blog, right?

515
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,780
Have we looked into that?

516
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,620
I thought for the most part it was a food blog, because I remember how we found out

517
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,940
about Harold was the Daily Fud.

518
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,460
Maybe he was obsessed with finding out what foot meat tasted like.

519
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,620
But also, I gotta admit, haven't you been wondering?

520
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,660
This just occurred to me.

521
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:44,700
He was a food writer, and Gary that runs the Daily Fud was following him around, but Gary

522
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,480
also had images that relate back to the circle of knowledge in the Daily Fud.

523
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,700
He had a bunch of photos up, you're right.

524
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,620
I'm trying to think now, was Gary really trying to get a food review out of him, or

525
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,940
was he following him around because of the circle of knowledge or something like that?

526
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,740
Was Gary following him around?

527
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,620
Gary was following Harold around, and Harold was following Maggie.

528
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,740
Well then I have a little theory then.

529
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:21,200
It seems that Harold might have been an amateur enthusiast in this sort of otherworldly knowledge,

530
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,640
but perhaps he wasn't really accepted by any of these groups.

531
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,400
The circle of knowledge probably didn't let him in, but he had some suspicions, so he's

532
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,720
following these people around.

533
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,360
Maggie's identified as this traitor perhaps in this note, and maybe he got some word of

534
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,500
that and that's why he was following her.

535
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,840
What if you, as another theory, take out the supernatural elements that we've discovered,

536
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,240
and he just found some connection between the cooks and Marvin?

537
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
That could be too.

538
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
Not bad, actually.

539
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
Occam's Razor.

540
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,600
Well, talking about Maggie, and I know we're bringing a lot of stuff up now, but you told

541
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:05,140
me, us, I suppose, that Maggie inducted you into this circle of knowledge.

542
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:12,200
If her dad is saying that, I mean, based off this envelope, that Maggie's not to be trusted.

543
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,480
She's gone rogue, perhaps.

544
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,300
What do you think about that?

545
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,900
What do we think about the order that our two Jim Cook's letters were written in?

546
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,220
Do you think that he suspected Maggie and then decided that the circle of knowledge

547
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:32,260
was full of the writings of a madman, or the scrawlings of a crazed man, or something like

548
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
that was in the first letter that we read?

549
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,660
Do you think, so, I'm sorry, do you think one led to the other, and which way do you

550
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,660
think it went?

551
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,720
I'd imagine that one came first, since he quotes his own phrase, faith through knowledge

552
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,920
is just called knowledge, at the start of this letter.

553
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,320
And perhaps his doubts in their book led Maggie to turn against him.

554
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,400
Well, I think the faith through knowledge is just knowledge is a circle of knowledge

555
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
slogan.

556
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,500
Maggie said it to me, actually, herself.

557
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,880
That's not a very good slogan.

558
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,680
Maggie said that to me pretty much verbatim.

559
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,960
She was telling me that she knew I had faith, and she needed me to have knowledge.

560
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,400
That's when she showed me that creature I told you about.

561
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,800
So, when I met Maggie, that's who I would be, that's who I would trust, but learning

562
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:24,540
all this new stuff, if her own father, if we've deciphered this correctly, her own fathers

563
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,880
may be saying that Maggie Cook can't be trusted.

564
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,520
How much trust do you have in Maggie Cook?

565
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
She's the chief, Keith.

566
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,560
I've always trusted her with my life, but the chief died.

567
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
We don't even know the focus Maggie Cook is.

568
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,680
I saw Maggie Cook, I don't even know what I saw.

569
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,520
I saw Maggie Cook dead, but you're saying that you saw her alive, and she inducted you

570
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,560
into this thing, and now I've got this letter telling us that she is not to be trusted.

571
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,920
What do we do about this?

572
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,540
Here's the thing is that whether or not she can be trusted, should be trusted, whether

573
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,880
it's her or not, the thing she showed me was real as day in my eyes.

574
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
I saw the thing.

575
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,520
It scared the daylights out of me.

576
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,000
But what if she's not showing you the whole truth?

577
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,880
They're only telling you part of her plans.

578
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,520
I'm just saying, if she's telling me that she wants to stop the thing, I would want

579
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
to stop the thing.

580
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,720
So, I mean, I guess she could be lying about wanting to stop it?

581
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Well...

582
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
I don't know.

583
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,160
I want to stop the thing, fellas.

584
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,640
I agree with that as well.

585
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:33,560
I mean, we gotta stop the thing, and we can figure out all this, where any alliances lie

586
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,680
later on, but I think at the end of the day we gotta stop, you know, whatever's going

587
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
on.

588
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,080
I think Marvin Glass is our biggest problem at this point right now.

589
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,360
Well, he's our most addressable problem.

590
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Exactly, John.

591
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,760
It's something we can do.

592
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,160
Well, and it's something that basically my alliance lies with him at basically blackmailing

593
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,600
me into being his ally.

594
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,480
You've just incurred a debt to him.

595
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Right.

596
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,960
Well, and Kevin John, I mean, what's...

597
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I don't have any loyalty to him, but...

598
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,640
And neither do you, so I think this is who we should be focusing on right now, and I

599
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,960
think we gotta head that way, and I still like our original plan that...

600
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,560
Is there any more documents in this room?

601
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,920
I'll tell you what Clark is wondering about, and so maybe he'll rifle through papers.

602
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,140
Can he find a connection between Jim and or Maggie to Marvin?

603
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,320
The only connection that you would be able to find in this room has already been laid

604
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,680
out, which is a folder that is labeled Operation Three Ring Binder, and has a dirty dog grooming

605
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,600
key fob inside of it.

606
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,760
Didn't Maggie have one of those?

607
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
I don't know.

608
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
Just John Peters.

609
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,000
How do we reckon that that's a connection?

610
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,320
Oh, I was just giving you a connection between this room and Marvin Glass.

611
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,320
Yeah.

612
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,760
Well, we're operating under the assumption that this room was Old Me's room, right?

613
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
Isn't that what we...

614
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
That's what I'm thinking.

615
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,560
Or it'd be pretty weird if it wasn't.

616
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,640
So he was collecting stuff about Jim Cook.

617
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,760
No, he wasn't.

618
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,920
He's living in Jim Cook's house.

619
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
He's just living in his house.

620
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
You're right.

621
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,400
It's probably a letter Jim Cook wrote to him, maybe, if he's part of the survey.

622
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,720
Boy, what the fuck?

623
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,120
Seconded.

624
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:18,840
Keith walks out the Keith-shaped hole in the wall and says, come on, boys.

625
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Let's go.

626
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
Let's go to Marvin's.

627
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,940
This hole was made for me.

628
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
Let's go to the glass.

629
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,200
Let's go to the glass.

630
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,420
Let's do our plan.

631
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,000
We have a lot of new information.

632
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,320
There's nothing else that tells me we shouldn't just do this.

633
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
Do what exactly?

634
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,460
Do we have a...

635
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,520
We're going to Chewbacca you.

636
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,920
We're going to Chewbacca you.

637
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
We're going to...

638
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
But then what?

639
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,720
Oh, then we're going to probably kill everybody.

640
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,880
Yeah, I think we're going to have to have a shootout.

641
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,080
So maybe before we go to...

642
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,320
Well, what are we armed with now?

643
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,020
I got my small, powerful gun, but I've just got my service pistol.

644
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,240
Can we hit up a gun store in the city?

645
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Yeah, for sure.

646
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,480
When you guys go downstairs, you would see we had those items sitting out on the kitchen

647
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
counter.

648
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,960
Make sure that we got that all accounted for.

649
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,180
The leather holster was grabbed by Jon.

650
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,380
The ring was grabbed by Keith.

651
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,520
Which is around a shoestring on my neck.

652
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Absolutely.

653
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,640
One pube still hanging on.

654
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:25,660
And there is a Ziploc bag containing the single tarot card of the devil with several bullet

655
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,300
holes in it and a taxidermied baby squirrel.

656
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,840
And as you guys are re-looking over all this, you would notice now that you've seen Clark's

657
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,840
parents when they were young on the TV, you would recognize that there is a picture of

658
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,360
them on the fridge with Jim Cook.

659
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,160
They are posing with silly hats and Jim Cook is begrudgingly smiling.

660
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,680
Does that mean anything to you, Clark?

661
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,680
What?

662
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
This picture.

663
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,680
Oh yeah.

664
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,160
I didn't know that they knew each other.

665
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,080
No, I'd never seen that picture before.

666
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,320
Do you think that maybe they had... that maybe your parents weren't just Wheel of Fortune

667
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
players?

668
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,200
Maybe, I don't know, maybe we may all be connected in this somehow.

669
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,240
I just, yeah, I just don't know.

670
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,560
Seeing that picture on there, I just was surprised that they knew each other.

671
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,640
I just kind of thought it was neat.

672
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,160
It helped me believe that I was on the good side when Maggie showed up.

673
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
That's for sure.

674
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,520
My parents, it was nice to see the parents smiling once again.

675
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,120
Clark, did you grab that VHS tape?

676
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
I did not.

677
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Okay.

678
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
I finished it though, right?

679
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
I saw everything that was on it.

680
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Yeah.

681
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,520
Was there anything in it?

682
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,220
There's nothing like in the episode or anything that sparked any imagination there, but other

683
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,640
than just, you know, seeing your parents.

684
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:52,560
But you would notice when you looked at the tape itself, it has been played so many times.

685
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,520
That just made me sad.

686
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,940
Right on.

687
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:05,300
Maybe even like lifetimes of playing over and over again.

688
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:12,960
If we pretend that this baby squirrel is for sure from Julie Maxwell, does that mean anything?

689
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,140
Does that change anything for anybody or mean anything for anybody, if we take it as fact?

690
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,460
When I saw attacks at everything, I thought of Julie Maxwell, but it didn't really ping

691
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,900
anything in my brain.

692
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,180
Have we had any indication that she was in the circle of knowledge?

693
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,700
Was she in the circle of knowledge?

694
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
I don't...

695
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Well, here's another thing.

696
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,700
I don't think so.

697
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,460
Speaking about that baby squirrel bag, that devil card, the devil tarot card, there was

698
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,460
a file at Marvin Glass's plates labeled Satan.

699
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:48,620
And all that was in it was a picture of a woman with short curly hair, shoulder length

700
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:54,620
maybe, and a mouth that took up half her face with a look of unbridled pleasure on it.

701
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,620
Did you know her?

702
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,620
No.

703
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,620
But I remember she had a big mouth because that's one of my favorite Netflix original

704
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,540
series.

705
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:11,740
It really gets to the heart of the torrid storm that rages in a young person's heart

706
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,100
and mind as they go through adolescence.

707
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,780
It gets to the hard on of the matter.

708
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,300
Yeah, there's a lot of boner stuff too.

709
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,500
Surprisingly, Keith Vigna does not like that television show.

710
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
You don't like Vigna?

711
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Not really.

712
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,420
Edit, edit, edit, edit, edit.

713
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,340
It's like the only good show about middle school ever.

714
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,260
So devil, Satan, shot, tarot card...

715
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,660
Hold on, that just pisses me off because it makes me feel like you had a really chill

716
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,540
and easy adolescence.

717
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,740
I don't want to talk on this right now.

718
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,740
I want to keep playing the game.

719
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
I do want to talk on this.

720
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
I don't.

721
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,740
We can talk about it later.

722
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,740
How was your 8th grade just like really nice?

723
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,740
I just want to play the game.

724
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,740
I want to play the game.

725
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,740
Fuck you.

726
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,980
Luke never went through an awkward phase.

727
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,980
Why are you funny?

728
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,580
I just want to focus on what we're doing right now.

729
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,780
I'm into it.

730
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,620
Devil card with bullet holes through it.

731
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,980
You saw a Satan file.

732
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,500
I mean, I don't know what that means.

733
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,660
Well, it's just the last time I saw something, you know, tangentially related to the devil.

734
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,660
So I thought I'd bring it up.

735
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Gotcha.

736
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,540
Seems like maybe both sides of this are eyeing someone.

737
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
Hail Satan.

738
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
That they, yeah.

739
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,340
Can I inspect the card a little more?

740
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,580
Is there anything else I can glean from it that maybe I missed?

741
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:35,940
As you pull the card out of the bag, your fingers go over each ridge where the bullet

742
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:42,100
holes have struck through it and you feel the ridges and you look at the card and it

743
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:47,340
is a tarot card with bullet holes in it.

744
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,020
Got me again.

745
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,540
Those two things are on my person.

746
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,980
Oh, so back to my hypothetical, does, does Jim Cook owning a thing that Julie Maxwell

747
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,100
might have made change anything for anybody?

748
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
No.

749
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,380
I mean, nothing actually connect indicates that they knew each other, but maybe I can't

750
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,380
think of anything.

751
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,380
All right.

752
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,140
I pocket that bag with the contents inside.

753
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
Okay.

754
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,140
Boys.

755
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm about to storm the gates.

756
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,700
You want to go?

757
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:25,460
I mean, we had a arm ourselves and, uh, I think we play it by ear once we get inside.

758
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:31,220
I mean, we, we got our, we got our, we got our, our idea of getting into the depths of

759
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:37,260
Marvin glasses compound, but once we get in there, Clark, you're probably not going to

760
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
be armed.

761
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,300
Cause I mean, unless, unless there's something that you can hide away, cause you're our,

762
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,740
you're going to be our, our, we drag them in there.

763
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,020
He can be loaded to the teeth.

764
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,800
I mean, the second we reveal our, our deception, he starts firing too.

765
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,440
So I think you should be as secretly armed as you can.

766
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,660
But if they disagree, I mean, it should be hidden, but it's not like we should send them

767
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,660
in lightly armed.

768
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,280
No, no, I don't think so either.

769
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,420
But at the end of the day, you, you may be unarmed.

770
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,660
You won't be unarmed Clark.

771
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,660
Don't worry.

772
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,980
I'm going to fucking, but that's what I'm saying.

773
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,020
That's what I'm, I'm just preparing for the worst is you get stripped of your arms.

774
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,460
We are armed up enough.

775
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,820
We throw you something, but we're going to have to fight our way out of the middle of

776
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,600
what I'm saying, man, is the second anybody comes at him to like search him.

777
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,640
That's when we start shooting.

778
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,940
I don't think so.

779
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,660
I think we get all the way to Martin glass until we start shooting.

780
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,660
Yeah.

781
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,820
If it's, if they frisk us at the front door, I don't think we're not going to start shooting

782
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,820
through the front door.

783
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,540
We're going to wait till we get to our pass a speech check or something.

784
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,220
Again, we can come to it when we come to it.

785
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,220
Okay.

786
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,020
Preparing you preparing for the worst.

787
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,020
That's all I'm saying.

788
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,020
I think you worry too much.

789
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
I'll put a, the world's going to hell.

790
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,740
I'll put a, man, John actually kind of a group of Keith on this one.

791
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,940
If they frisk us and I've got guns on me, if they're going to ask why you didn't take

792
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,860
them, we just kill those guys at the door.

793
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,140
I don't like, no.

794
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,340
And then we start a shootout and we don't win it.

795
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,100
I think we need to get all the way.

796
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,580
I think we get all the way to Martin glass before we do anything.

797
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,540
We throw a couple of guns to him at the end of the day because they frisk him.

798
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:13,220
They look at us and they, I mean, they trust us enough, but not more than they trust anybody

799
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,340
else that works there.

800
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,280
So I'm thinking he goes in unarmed.

801
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,200
We go in real armed.

802
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,460
If they ask us why we got arms on us, then we say, cause we got this guy.

803
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,880
He's he's not armed, but he's dangerous.

804
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,780
The other members of the glass family or his henchmen or whatever, does everybody know

805
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,020
that you're John Lee Pettymore in Kevin's body or that no one knows that.

806
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,980
So you, it seemed when we were up in our cages, had a kind of the run of the thing.

807
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,980
Exactly.

808
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,980
You're like captain to him.

809
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,980
Yeah.

810
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,700
I'm way higher up than new Charles.

811
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,180
I think they're going to trust me.

812
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,740
And the only exception is if Rosemary has come back and she thinks we're working against

813
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,620
them now, which that might make it hard to get in in the first place.

814
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,120
But I think we can bullshit our way past anybody trying to frisk you.

815
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120
You can throw it.

816
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
Yeah.

817
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
You could throw your perceived weight around.

818
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Exactly.

819
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,160
If they, you know, if they find the guns on you, we just say, we're getting you here in

820
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,060
a hurry and thanks for finding them and taking them off of them and we'll collect them and

821
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,060
move on.

822
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
I agree.

823
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,060
Okay.

824
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,060
I'm good with that.

825
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
Let's go buy some guns.

826
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,060
Let's head over to the glass compound.

827
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
What's that?

828
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,060
The gun store first.

829
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,060
The gun store.

830
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,060
The gun store, I mean.

831
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,060
And then the glass compound.

832
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:30,260
Welcome to large Eddie's gun emporium.

833
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,720
What's the largest gun you got?

834
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Large Eddie.

835
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720
Oh, this one right here.

836
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,040
It's the, it's the cutter in half.

837
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Cutter in half?

838
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,840
Barely newer in half.

839
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
I step up to the counter.

840
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:48,960
I've got my only gun on me is my large and powerful gun, but I'd like to have like a,

841
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,920
like an assault rifle on me, like military fully auto assault rifle.

842
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,000
I want to purchase one of those.

843
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Okay.

844
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,800
Do you have a money?

845
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I.

846
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,220
I've got a, I've got a Marvin glass company card.

847
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,220
Yeah.

848
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,220
Well, we're okay.

849
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:11,060
I've got the credit card in my wallet as a, as John Lee Pettymore says that the guy, his

850
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:16,420
ears kind of perk up and he's like, Oh, uh, actually if you guys want to come on back

851
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,420
here and he, uh, kicks the back door open.

852
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,420
Thank you.

853
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,420
Large Eddie.

854
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:27,940
You guys walk into the back room and it is right into his trap.

855
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:33,040
It's literally, it's just a trap door.

856
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,460
Next week on pretending to be people, it's just us falling for 30 minutes, spy kids.

857
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,160
They're going to talk about what to do next.

858
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:49,080
Uh, as they're falling, you guys walk back into a room that is a plethora of a madman's

859
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,080
dreams.

860
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,080
What kind of guns do does Keith, does Keith see that he, that he likes?

861
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,820
I don't know anything about guns, but it's all the cool ones.

862
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,480
You get big ones and small ones, red ones and blue ones.

863
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,820
There's some with cool sights on them and others have silencers and there's some big

864
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,820
ones.

865
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,820
There's some shotguns.

866
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:16,300
So Keith, Keith eyes, a large submachine gun and it's kind of glowing and I stepped up

867
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,900
to that one and I touch it.

868
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:22,340
It's kind of like cold to the touch and I asked big Eddie, what's this one?

869
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,580
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry.

870
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:28,480
And he flips a switch and turns off the light that's right behind it.

871
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,160
And he's like, oh, it's just, that's just a real big gun.

872
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,080
That's a nice cold gun.

873
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,760
Cold fusion gun.

874
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,040
It works in cold weather.

875
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,100
Is it, is it a fusion?

876
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Is it a fusion?

877
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,100
Good.

878
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,100
No, it just means it works good in cold.

879
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,540
It's the cold fusion brand firearm.

880
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,040
You never heard of cold fusion?

881
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,640
The most murderous pieces this side of the Mississippi.

882
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,120
Capital C, capital F.

883
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,540
I pick it up and it's about a, it's like a two ARs combined into each other.

884
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,540
Fully out.

885
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:04,660
Oh, I pick it up, throw it on his card and I sling it across my back because it's already

886
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,380
got a leather strap on it.

887
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,380
Ooh, that's nice.

888
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,900
I want to grab just a few pistols.

889
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,900
You grab a few pistols.

890
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,620
You got him tucked into the waistband and maybe one in the boot, one in the butt, one

891
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,620
in the boot.

892
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:23,880
I want to grab a powerful pistol with a, with a large magazine and a semi-automatic shotgun.

893
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,600
You grab the two of those large Eddie bows in reverence and you all leave.

894
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Before we leave your gun emporium, do you have any, any smoke grenades, regular grenades,

895
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,600
flash bangs?

896
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Yeah.

897
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,200
I'd like two of each for all my friends and me.

898
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,440
Two of each for all your friends, smoke, flash, and bang.

899
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
What are the?

900
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:55,820
Smoke, flash, bang, and regular fragmentation, original, original recipe.

901
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,820
Original flavor.

902
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,820
Yeah.

903
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,820
All right.

904
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:04,140
How are you guys approaching this concept to get into the glass?

905
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:09,540
That is, I think we go right into the front wherever.

906
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,540
Yeah.

907
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:15,820
So I know pretty well how to get us through there if we go in through the den of sin through

908
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,480
the dirty dog room and uh, the street access.

909
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
Okay.

910
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,160
So I, I think I can sneak us pretty deep into this place if we, uh, so we wouldn't even

911
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,640
have to like meet some folks at the front door.

912
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,680
I like that idea.

913
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,180
And then we can walk in there and as soon as we do, as soon as we meet any kind of resistance,

914
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,820
we just say, Hey, we're taking this man personally to see Marvin Glass.

915
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,920
He murdered, uh, not to be the broken record here, but then what say we get all the way

916
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,320
straight to Marvin.

917
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,240
We shoot our way out.

918
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,300
We kind of want to talk them a little bit, don't we?

919
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,980
I mean, yeah, we just got to prove that we can kill the people protecting him.

920
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:59,020
So we might have to do that, but I honestly, there's like a, there's probably a 66% chance

921
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:03,180
that this ends in our glorious deaths.

922
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,860
I'll take the 34.

923
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,860
You think it's that high that we, well, I think here's the deal.

924
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,300
We, we have a shoe that we don't kill Marvin Glass.

925
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,280
We shoot everybody around him.

926
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,120
If we got to shoot him, we injure him, but we talked to him.

927
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,120
Maybe he's valuable.

928
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,120
Maybe he's not.

929
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,120
We kill him.

930
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,760
We shoot our way out or sneak our way out and then we head straight to contention.

931
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,760
It's what I think.

932
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,760
Try to find Drew.

933
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,960
You guys are discussing this as you drive into the heart of the city where John Lee

934
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:39,000
Pettymore knows the alleyway in order to get in to the den of sin and the three of you

935
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,600
strapped up exactly how you want to be prepared for what you're diving into.

936
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:51,700
You go and step on this large grate on the ground in this alleyway.

937
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:57,300
John Lee Pettymore pulls the dirty dog grooming key fob out of his hand and lifts it up.

938
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,100
And with that, the three of you do fall through a trap door and begin falling.
