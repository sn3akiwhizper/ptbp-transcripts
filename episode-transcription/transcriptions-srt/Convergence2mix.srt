1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hey, what's up? It's Zach. I just want to pop in here up top to make a quick announcement.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,800
It's getting really cold outside. We here at PTBP feel super grateful to not only have a

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,080
warm place to sleep at night, but also the means to help those who don't. So we're going to take

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,000
the money from all new and upgrading Patreon supporters throughout the month of November.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,520
We're going to double it and we're going to buy blankets and sleeping bags for folks in

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,440
Springfield who need them. So one more time for the people super focused on washing dishes or

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,080
eating pussy or both, if you join our Patreon or upgrade your support any time in the month

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:47,040
of November, we are going to take all that new and upgraded money, we're going to double it,

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,760
and then we're going to use that money to purchase blankets and sleeping bags for people in our area

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,200
who need some help staying warm this winter. This David Winters. Whatever, here's Wolf.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:08,160
Hello my children from times past, present, and future. I've only just now in this moment

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,040
realized that I happen to be stuck in a fucking cage in this godforsaken barn.

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,520
And despite all my rage, I somehow wound up in the 1990s. What the flippin' fuck is going on

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,520
around here? My producer's going to get an earful about this whenever he is. But anyways,

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,640
since I'm stuck here, I may as well continue the show. As I always say, the show must go on.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,960
I invented that saying. Everyone else who says it is plagiarizing me. Anyway, we got a new Howlin'

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,720
with Wolf, and this week's is presented by Stephen Lee from Brampton, Ontario, Canada,

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,760
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pog. He writes, hello PTBP crew.

19
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:10,160
I wanted to thank you for hours of horrifying, heroin, and hilarious content. Last October,

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,800
I was seeking some good spooky content to binge and scratch that delta green itch,

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,040
and I began to listen. Listening motivated me enough to get a one-shot started with my

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,320
gaming group. Keep up the great work, and I'd like to shout out my own agents, Hannah, Sarah,

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,800
and Scott, as they probe the limits of scientific knowledge and the edges of what's real.

24
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,800
Well, damn. Hello, Stephen Lee. I'm happy that whatever this show is inspired you to do

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,520
something. You only have one shot in this life, unlike me, and I'm glad you are shooting that

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,240
one shot to run a one-shot with a gaming group. I'm glad you're doing whatever the hell it is

27
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,440
you're doing, and I hope you're loving doing it. Ta-ta for now. Well, now, if you want to

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,360
write up something for your dimension hopping wolf to hell, it's really quite simple. Just

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,960
tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram, or you can go above and beyond. Spend 30 seconds

30
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,160
of your time. Write a quick five-star review on Apple Podcasts, and then let us know it was you

31
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:35,920
with an email to pretendingpod at gmail.com. Pretending Pod. Pretending Pod. Pretending Pod.

32
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,240
If you can't support the show by telling your friends that you're a heckin' weirdo,

33
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:48,960
throw us some bones on Patreon in exchange for a slop trough full of 24 episodes. Like that piece

34
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:56,160
of shit Zack said at the top of the show, we're out here slingin' extra tent to purchase tents

35
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,720
and sleeping bags for folks who need them. It's cold out there, but Wolf's got a warm heart.

36
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:11,200
Now, everyone listening to this, please do me an actually important favor. Stop whatever you are

37
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:19,680
doing right now. Raise your snout to the sky like the animal you are, and shout these three words

38
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:28,320
at the top of your lungs. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. It's time for the news. Last time, Federal

39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:39,280
Marshal Harlan Nash, ATF Agent Tanner Tan, Luda Hyde, and DEA Agents Joe Dean and Cindy Woodabaga

40
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,480
were sent to Groversville, Tennessee, the bud end of regional jokes due to the reported UFO sightings

41
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:54,640
in the area. What brought them there, however, was neither unidentified nor flying. A recent high

42
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:01,200
school graduate named Billy Ray Spivey smashed a hole in his dad's chest before going on a

43
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,160
painkiller-focused burglary spree, which included punching a gas station attendant in the head so

44
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,200
hard that the victim's gore detached and flew off his shoulders. After being hit center mass with

45
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,280
four rounds, Billy went down long enough for the cops on the scene to detain and sedate the

46
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,920
unnaturally strong teen boy. With that information, Ncel badgered the apprehended and restrained Billy

47
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,480
Ray, considered cutting him open, and eventually went to his girlfriend's house in Groversville.

48
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,640
She wasn't there, but they talked to her weird mom for a weirder amount of time. Thankfully,

49
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:49,280
they found a business card in her room for Scott Adams, a UFO hunter with a group called Watch the

50
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:58,320
Skies. Watch the Skies? More like watch these guys keep interviewing this cool ass mom for the next

51
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:16,160
four episodes. Shit might get hairy, but at least we have Brat Pit with Miss Mary.

52
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:57,440
You guys know the we are farmers thing, but this time it's like

53
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:07,120
David Winters. David Winters is here, everyone, to run us through a game of Delta Green. Yes,

54
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:14,000
he decided that one episode was not enough. You didn't get the closure you were seeking, David?

55
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,120
No, I was shooting for a single episode appearance, but it seems as though I bit

56
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,040
off more than I could chew, and I am now contractually obligated to stay.

57
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,560
We are a mouthful. We did find you to a really, really brutal contract.

58
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
How much are we making him pay us?

59
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,200
Really should read those things before I sign them.

60
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,880
We actually have a controlling stake in the glass cannon network now.

61
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,400
He's going to have to break to those guys.

62
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,600
Well, I didn't have one in the first place. Well, it's kind of like every time you update

63
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,400
your phone's operating system, and you're just like, agree, agree, agree. How bad could this be?

64
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,840
That's what we actually slipped it into, was your latest Samsung terms of service.

65
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,160
We looked at you, and we were like, he's not an Apple guy. He's not using an iPhone.

66
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,120
He's like me.

67
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,480
He's one of the Thomases of the world.

68
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,840
Actually, I bet you are an Apple guy. Am I correct? Yes.

69
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,040
I was wrong. I walked in the store the other day. I was like, give me another one, please.

70
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,000
Not the newest one, but one that's better than mine currently that will actually open up

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,480
when I click an app because there for a while, David, I was clicking an app,

72
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,920
and then it would just close because my phone didn't work anymore because it was 10 years old.

73
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,840
Wow. That's impressive.

74
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,880
10 years old?

75
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,200
Yeah.

76
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,160
2011?

77
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,320
Yeah, as an iPhone original series. I had the OG iPhone.

78
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,160
Wow. That was from 2007.

79
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,440
Yep. A decade ago.

80
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,920
Never forget.

81
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
We already did 30 seconds of silence.

82
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,920
Yeah, but then Luke brought up 9-11, so we've got to do 30 more.

83
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,420
30 more.

84
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
Josh, respect.

85
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,380
Jesus.

86
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,800
I don't want to do another 30 seconds.

87
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
It's so uncomfortable the first time.

88
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,920
You know what was uncomfortable?

89
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,240
As as a nation, watching those people leap to their deaths.

90
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
Can we take 30 fucking seconds, Joe?

91
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,520
A moment of silence.

92
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
I don't like that at all.

93
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,480
No, sir.

94
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,560
And with that, I think let's get into this episode of this one shot that we're doing

95
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,400
here with David Winters.

96
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,280
Have you ever heard this? Winters is coming.

97
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,600
That's what he says every time he climaxes.

98
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
Episode two.

99
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
We feel like we know you.

100
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,480
We're comfortable with you, David.

101
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
Are you comfortable?

102
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm so comfortable.

103
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,880
You don't even know.

104
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,080
That is actually scary.

105
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,240
All right, let's go into this 18-year-old girl's room.

106
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,700
Mm-hmm.

107
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,640
We just found a business card.

108
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, and we're gonna...

109
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,800
Yes, yes, yes.

110
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,760
We need to go talk to Bradley Allen, he uses his computer.

111
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,880
We've got a lot of people we need to talk to.

112
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,040
Bradley Allen has potentially been at work missing this whole time,

113
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
but we do know there's an internet-capable computer at his work, so...

114
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,440
Was the town hall and the sheriff's office all kind of together?

115
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,920
Yep, yep, that's all the center of Grover'sville.

116
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
We're gonna kill a lot of birds.

117
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,640
He found a business card, just to recap.

118
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,840
Scott Adams, watch the skies with an email address.

119
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,000
Watch the skies at AOL.

120
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,500
Watch.

121
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,700
Yes.

122
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,280
He's probably still working through his 20 free hours

123
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,360
from his last three and a half inch floppy disk that he just received.

124
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,560
Those were fun in the early 90s.

125
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,760
All the CDs and floppy disks is where they try to get you hooked.

126
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,560
AOL mailers.

127
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,000
You're like, hey, you can get 20 hours of internet a month for $15.

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,480
Now, did you look more closely at the business card?

129
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,400
We didn't even get to the business card that much.

130
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
Did we put it under blacklight?

131
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,840
Yeah, if you have a black...

132
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,080
Someone has to have a Room Raider style blacklight flashlight

133
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,520
on their character sheet, right?

134
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,000
I think Harlan definitely would.

135
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
He was wearing cargo pants.

136
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,040
I think all those pockets were full of things like that.

137
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,340
That was...

138
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,000
We didn't have time to send you the list of things in Harlan's pants,

139
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,160
but I reviewed it beforehand.

140
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,280
That was one of the things.

141
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,640
If you want to check the business card for semen, you can do so.

142
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,240
Yeah, that's standard procedure in my line of work.

143
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,080
This is a pretty sexy business card.

144
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,640
We do need to think like 1992, so we should probably also check for prints.

145
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,960
So we do that because we're cops in 1992.

146
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,600
Rest in peace.

147
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,400
The show?

148
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,020
The show.

149
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah, that was sad.

150
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
30 seconds of silence.

151
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,240
What's up, everybody?

152
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,880
Further look at the business card.

153
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
Yeah, we are investigating the business card, right?

154
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,640
Yeah, so do you want to use forensics if any of you...

155
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,720
Yeah, I got 50 of that.

156
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,280
Hey, me too.

157
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,120
I ain't got none.

158
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,620
Go for it.

159
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,720
49!

160
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,160
I failed a 61.

161
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,600
Alright, with your forensic skill, you dust for prints,

162
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,400
but that's a weird thing to dust for on a business card.

163
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,080
However, also with your forensic skill, you flip the business card over

164
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,400
and there's also a phone number handwritten on the back.

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
Good thing you rolled a success.

166
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
Otherwise, you wouldn't have seen that.

167
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm looking at it.

168
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,280
What are these numbers?

169
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,160
Alright, I swear to God, these make the same amount of digits.

170
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,800
How many is a phone number?

171
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,280
We'll have to call it.

172
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,720
I bet it's Scott Adams.

173
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,000
We'll have to get to a phone.

174
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
I bet there's one near the computer at Bradley's office.

175
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,320
Hey, do you think this is famed creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams?

176
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,320
That's the assumption I was operating under.

177
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,960
I bet it is.

178
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,760
Cindy Woodapega looks really serious and goes,

179
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
I don't read the newspaper.

180
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,840
And not even the funnies?

181
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Dilbert's a slice of office life comic.

182
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
I've got a few of them posted up in my cubicle back at,

183
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,680
you know, our main DAA headquarters in the city that that is located in.

184
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
Whatever field office we're currently based out of, which is uh...

185
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,540
Memphis?

186
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
Yeah, Memphis.

187
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,360
Back in my cubicle in Memphis.

188
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,800
I'll show you when we get back there.

189
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,000
I look forward to it.

190
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,720
It's pretty funny.

191
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,840
Dogworth flies a plane.

192
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:57,920
Well, Nancy, I think I know what the answer is going to be,

193
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,600
but are you familiar with the Scott Adams fella?

194
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,400
Yes, but I haven't seen a newspaper and...

195
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,840
Oh, sorry.

196
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,880
Not the Dilbert guy.

197
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,600
No, this.

198
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
And I show her the business card.

199
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,120
No, I don't.

200
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,320
I don't know who that is.

201
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,760
Was your daughter into like Dilbert or UFOs or anything like that?

202
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,280
Either of those things.

203
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
Yeah, and stuff like it.

204
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
A weird Venn diagram of the two.

205
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,520
Yeah, she collected all of the alien themed Dilbert cartoons.

206
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,080
How'd you know?

207
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
That just a lucky guess.

208
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,320
That Venn diagram's a circle from November of 87.

209
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,240
I ran for a few weeks.

210
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,560
Dogworth flies a UFO.

211
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,640
No, I have no idea who Scott Adams is, nor do I care.

212
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,880
Nancy, this is kind of a stretch, but did your daughter ever mention,

213
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,400
you know, exploring the theoretical limits of human capability,

214
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,200
perhaps through surgical enhancements?

215
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,800
No, I thought you were going to say through seeking higher education in college,

216
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,200
and she has discussed that, but surgical enhancements less so.

217
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
Where did she want to go?

218
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:31,520
She wanted to go to the Ohio State University because the V sounds so strong.

219
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,480
Prestigious.

220
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,040
I agree.

221
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,600
That is, that's assertive.

222
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,840
Did she already have a major picked out?

223
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,120
I don't think so.

224
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,920
I don't know.

225
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,640
Illustration?

226
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,600
Yeah, cartoon literary critique.

227
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,280
It's all coming together.

228
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
Nancy, this is very important.

229
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,960
Did she ever correspond with any famous cartoonists?

230
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,880
She did with Scott Adams, Gary Larson, Gary Larson.

231
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,760
The far side?

232
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,600
Yes, she's a big far side fan.

233
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,400
The rapper?

234
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,960
Who isn't?

235
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,160
Oh no, I mean, I've got just as many far sides as I do Dilberts.

236
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,400
I can't wait to get you back to Memphis.

237
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,400
I can't wait to get you back to Memphis is an awesome name for a country album.

238
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,880
Yep.

239
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,520
Holy shit.

240
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,480
Well, do you guys, can you think of anything else or should we try to get on the internet?

241
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,840
I wish you the best of luck trying to find this internet you're looking for.

242
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,800
Yeah, I would say you're pretty suspicious to me, but I can't really put my finger on it.

243
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,520
That doesn't mean you're considered a suspect at this time.

244
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,800
Person of interest.

245
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,680
Perhaps.

246
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,160
Okay.

247
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
We like letting people know being very transparent.

248
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
But a human role on her.

249
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Tell me if she's under the influence of anything.

250
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,640
Can I do that?

251
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,440
That's good.

252
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,680
You can roll medicine or human.

253
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,200
Uh, I'm going to human.

254
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,080
Cause no one has medicine.

255
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,840
I critical fail 88.

256
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,480
Oh, you just yell.

257
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,520
She's on drugs.

258
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,680
She looks as though with your critical fail that she might be very high on PCP right now.

259
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,280
Does his critical fail preclude me from trying to human role?

260
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,960
You can go for it.

261
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,960
The side effects of PCP at higher doses include hallucinations, catatonic posturing,

262
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,640
increased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, raised temperature, and shallow breathing

263
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,080
of which is demonstrating all of them with your critical failure.

264
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,360
How do you know David Winters?

265
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,840
This is part of my prep.

266
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,720
I have to, I have to have a random.

267
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,360
Sorry, honey.

268
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,040
I have to live and breathe these characters.

269
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,680
Micro doses, PCP.

270
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm like whispering to one of them.

271
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,400
She's, she's sweating and she's got the elevated heart rate and her shallow breathing.

272
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,120
You'd see it, right?

273
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,800
You see all those signs, right?

274
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,920
Yeah, we're, it is classic signs of PCP, but, uh, there does seem to just be something

275
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,120
strange in her eyes.

276
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,720
Uh, something that's not there.

277
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,080
Why don't I take a crack at this?

278
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,600
I rolled a, uh, a 38 on a 60.

279
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,840
She does not look to be under the influence of PCP.

280
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Contrary.

281
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,400
This is classic PCP.

282
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,080
It's not.

283
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I agree with Harlan.

284
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,320
Wait, you look, bear in mind, you do have, you do have two DEA agents and you have tattoos

285
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
of PCP on your arm.

286
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,480
I have so many PCP tattoos that show what PCP looks like.

287
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,920
Do you have any ICP tattoos?

288
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,520
Well, you have the cartoon of Dogbert doing PCP and demonstrating all the effects.

289
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,800
Yes, of course.

290
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,360
Well, my juggalo name is tattooed on the back of my neck.

291
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,320
Crystal.

292
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,820
Crystal.

293
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,880
So I wanted to roll a natural and I rolled a 91 because I was trying to see if there's

294
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,040
anything in her eyes that looked unnatural as I'm trying to make my determinations,

295
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,240
but I failed miserably.

296
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,200
Do you have any unnatural?

297
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,240
I have 10 unnatural.

298
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,760
I took it to explain my backstory, uh, which, oh, I'll get to it.

299
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,280
If you don't die first.

300
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,820
Fair enough.

301
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,740
We've seen her far in the future shitting on a toilet with her smartphone.

302
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,700
It was a 90 year old woman.

303
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,020
I've got no problem killing this person in the universe forking in two directions.

304
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,740
So you're on notice sec.

305
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,060
He's not invincible.

306
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,060
Damn it.

307
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,540
Okay.

308
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,060
I don't think she's on.

309
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,860
I can't tell that she, do you think she's on drugs?

310
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,460
No, I don't think she's on drugs.

311
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,980
Yeah.

312
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,620
I think she's just really fucking weird.

313
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:53,860
Yeah.

314
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,780
I don't really like being around her.

315
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,380
It makes me very uncomfortable.

316
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,660
I did kind of want to have this whole conversation like away from her.

317
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,540
We're all just staring her in the eyes while we're talking,

318
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,380
but honestly she's probably fine with it.

319
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:05,540
Yeah.

320
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,500
She's just watching you just like something's clearly wrong, but I don't think it's drugs,

321
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:10,820
ma'am.

322
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:18,500
Um, have you come under any four episodes of us just questioning this?

323
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,140
You guys are, you're down with Intel, right?

324
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,820
Absolutely.

325
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,020
Okay.

326
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,220
Um, ma'am, have you come under the influence of anything?

327
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,820
He kind of loves his voice and gets like a little closer.

328
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,740
Spooky.

329
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Don't do me now.

330
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,260
Spooky.

331
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,820
Is the X-Files out yet?

332
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,380
Like dragons, aliens, Allens.

333
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,180
Oh, you know what?

334
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,140
I've been in about a year.

335
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,140
There's a show like an exactly this, this time next year.

336
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,660
You're going to be like, wowie zowie.

337
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:00,900
Wow.

338
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,780
I can really relate to what those guys were going through.

339
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,300
They should have called it the end files.

340
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,700
Anyway, I saw that in my partner's eyes one time.

341
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,340
That's how I know.

342
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,540
We sound crazier than she does.

343
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,980
So we need to get the fuck out.

344
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,940
Let's go talk to Bradley.

345
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,420
Time to leave.

346
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,620
Look at that.

347
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,500
Take care.

348
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:22,820
Cool.

349
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:22,980
Yeah.

350
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,220
Can we do like a little quick search of the rest of the house as we go out?

351
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,720
Sure.

352
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,340
Like just to search.

353
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,100
I rolled a 16 on a 70.

354
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,980
Pass.

355
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,180
48 on a 50.

356
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,900
I failed.

357
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,540
I failed too.

358
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,740
A 79 on a 70.

359
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,020
I rolled a 79.

360
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,260
They tumbled down the stairs, but we noticed behind a picture frame.

361
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,200
Yeah.

362
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,600
Oh shit.

363
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,380
Boy, well, no critical successes.

364
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,980
That's what I was.

365
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,100
I was looking for there.

366
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,580
Otherwise you would have found, uh, several bodies.

367
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,260
I just didn't look that direction.

368
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,620
You would have found a little alien mind controlling her behind the walls.

369
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,620
There's nothing out of place or out of the ordinary.

370
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,740
The house is pristine.

371
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,700
You see clearly her husband lives there as well.

372
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,340
Much like the daughter, their rooms are spotless.

373
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,540
It seems as though this lady just walks around the house, cleans all day and thinks about

374
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,820
Dilbert cartoons.

375
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,940
And that's pretty much it.

376
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,820
In a lot of ways, Joe Dane can relate to that.

377
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:30,580
Wow.

378
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,100
That's really sad, man.

379
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,140
He's a by the book guy.

380
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,060
Let's head down to this city center.

381
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,620
City hall.

382
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,140
We're doing a city hall.

383
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,180
Do we want to do?

384
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,380
It's about 10 o'clock now.

385
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,740
We spent two hours there.

386
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,140
You spent two hours, both in story and in real life.

387
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,700
Questioning.

388
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,820
I want to be very clear.

389
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,700
You can never spend less in game time than you spend in real life doing something.

390
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,980
According to her, her husband's still there, so we might as well stop by.

391
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,020
According to her.

392
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
And she seems super trustworthy.

393
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,060
Let's go see the sheriff first and we can talk about, we can ascertain what the local

394
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,260
fuzz knows and maybe get kind of a more bird's eye view of the town from him.

395
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,900
I agree with that.

396
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,180
We don't need to let him know that we need to use the internet to look this shit up.

397
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,140
To the sheriff.

398
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,860
You drive about the one mile back into town.

399
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,620
Again, center of town is the town hall.

400
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:36,260
Just to the side is the joint sheriff's office, ambulance, single ambulance stand and volunteer

401
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,300
fire department.

402
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:43,140
You knock on the door and conveniently the sheriff, even though it's 10 o'clock at night,

403
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,660
is still working.

404
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,020
And he greets you.

405
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,580
Ah, you agents.

406
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,100
Thank you for finally making it.

407
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,940
Sheriff Dan Oakley.

408
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,940
How goes it?

409
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,860
Oakley, it's nice to make your acquaintance.

410
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,300
And she puts out a hand.

411
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,140
Is she taller than him too?

412
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,260
No, he's pretty tall.

413
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:06,020
He's tall, but fat with gray hair, solid gray mustache hugging his upper lip.

414
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,460
He looks kind of like a poor man's cliff from Cheers.

415
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:16,740
As he goes to meet her for a, for a hand shake, she like dodges it and then goes for

416
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,860
a hug where she puts her arms around his, like right above his belt.

417
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,100
Whoa, whoa there, miss.

418
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,620
Hey, careful.

419
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,780
Good to meet you.

420
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,220
Close to my gun, if you know what I mean.

421
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,540
Close to your woodpecker.

422
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,820
I'm Cindy Woodpecker.

423
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,540
Nice to meet you.

424
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,220
Sheriff Dan Oakley.

425
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,140
I've got to apologize for my partner.

426
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,100
I'm agent Dodine and this is my partner.

427
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,740
Agent Cindy Woodpecker, DEA.

428
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,940
These are our associates on this current task force.

429
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,820
Harlin.

430
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,620
Hello.

431
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,660
Tan Luthad.

432
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,300
Hello Tan.

433
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,660
Nice to meet you all.

434
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,620
Sounds like you've got a real pickle here in town.

435
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:55,780
Yeah.

436
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,500
Why don't you brief us on what you know so far, Sheriff?

437
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,060
And she lets go of the embrace or just life in general.

438
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,220
I don't want to be around.

439
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,180
Which would you prefer?

440
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,100
Let it go.

441
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,420
No, as she lets go of the Sheriff, you see that, like,

442
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,700
Jodine has had a very intense grasp on like her belt,

443
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,180
like trying to like pull her away this whole time.

444
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,420
Like a dog straight on the leash, pulling her back.

445
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,060
Yes.

446
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,700
Okay, so you successfully pull her back and he's,

447
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,060
I'm glad you made it in here.

448
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,220
Welcome to my town.

449
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,460
Been Sheriff here for years and it's not too often we get

450
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,340
city folk in here.

451
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,380
What do you want to know?

452
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,580
What can I help you with?

453
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,820
Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?

454
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,660
Sunny days.

455
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,380
Ah, nice.

456
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,020
Okay, sick.

457
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,700
So you're a Grover's fan too.

458
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,180
All right, so we just got in.

459
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,340
We went to the Allen's house and that mother is under some

460
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,220
sort of influence.

461
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,820
Doesn't seem to be drugs from my personal understanding of

462
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,060
the situation, but she is out of it for real.

463
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,180
And she has not seen her daughter who was the boyfriend in

464
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,660
forever.

465
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,900
The daughter was the boyfriend?

466
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,860
Yeah, three weeks.

467
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,660
Yeah.

468
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,220
So has there been a, would you say, a rash of disappearances

469
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,780
in this town?

470
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,300
Not that I'm aware of.

471
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,620
Is that what you're investigating?

472
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,900
No, no, we're here investigating a super myth.

473
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,940
Yeah, a rare strain of super myth with the DEA.

474
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,380
But Sheriff, let me ask you one question real quick that

475
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,900
might cut to the quick here.

476
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,140
Has anything been going wrong in your town lately or do you

477
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,500
feel like things are just fine?

478
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,620
Are you insulting my ability to police this town?

479
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,100
No, sir.

480
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,180
That's a standard DEA question.

481
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,180
It's just something we have to ask.

482
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,140
It's part of a forum.

483
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,260
When drugs are involved, oftentimes things go a little haywire.

484
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,140
We just wanted to see if there's no drugs.

485
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,500
There are no drugs here.

486
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,780
Let's just put it that way.

487
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,380
I feel like I've kind of given a sort of presence to where

488
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,700
he's going to ignore me, which is what I was going for.

489
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,420
I'd like to be looking for cuts, small incisions on his skin

490
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,020
while he is caught off guard by being offended.

491
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,740
Give me a search.

492
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,340
22.

493
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,020
Hell yes.

494
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,220
You get a good enough look because remember it required

495
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,780
that last time to see those tiny little pricks.

496
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,420
He does not have them.

497
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,140
He would have had to have found a way to manage the pain.

498
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:33,300
Sheriff, were you aware that Jane Allen has been missing?

499
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,860
No, I wasn't.

500
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,140
Have any other kids gone missing that you're aware of?

501
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Well, that Billy Ray boy, of course.

502
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,500
But you know all about that.

503
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,860
Yeah, that's kind of what sent us down here.

504
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,620
The super meth that he was on.

505
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,340
Yeah.

506
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,620
Which is how come he was able to punch his daddy through the chest so hard.

507
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,340
Yeah, it's real shame.

508
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,620
Yeah, real shame.

509
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,340
And the devil.

510
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,420
You know, them kids.

511
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,060
The combination of the two is really horrible.

512
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,780
DND.

513
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,700
It gets them all riled up.

514
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,500
Always at work.

515
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,860
Yeah, kids need church.

516
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,140
Spiritual war is real.

517
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,340
It is.

518
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,580
It seems you have two churches here, which seems a little light for a town of 1200.

519
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,100
Do you have problems with attendance?

520
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,340
What percentage of your population would you say attends?

521
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,140
It's a light flock.

522
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,420
Let's put it that way.

523
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,740
We used to have three churches.

524
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,300
Shame.

525
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,260
One went out of business.

526
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,060
Yeah, it's happening all over.

527
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,740
To the extent churches are businesses.

528
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,380
Of course, everything should be run like a business.

529
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,500
And it's America.

530
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:34,820
Yeah.

531
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,340
Are you looking to attend services?

532
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,500
Is that why you're asking these very specific church questions?

533
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,020
Maybe if we're in town long enough.

534
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,100
The next question I actually want to know is, have you seen Bradley Allen recently?

535
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,460
The Alder?

536
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,540
Yeah, he's next door.

537
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,980
Yeah, he works next door.

538
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,220
Have you seen him coming and going from work in the past few days or even weeks?

539
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,060
Yeah, here and there.

540
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,140
When was the last couple days ago?

541
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,860
What's he like?

542
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,460
What can you tell us about him?

543
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,100
Smart man.

544
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,500
He was educated in the big city.

545
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,740
We're lucky to have him as a leader.

546
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,180
Is he from around here?

547
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,980
Born and bred.

548
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,420
Let's go to the bakery.

549
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,700
We're getting to the butt end of this.

550
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,980
If I could be of any service to you all, I'd be happy to.

551
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,860
But I think this drug stuff is nonsense.

552
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,700
It would never happen under my watch.

553
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Sheriff, you never know with folks not attending church like they once did.

554
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,340
I've seen good, upstanding Christian children just go astray.

555
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,740
And so you told me your flock was diminishing and we're with the DEA.

556
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,140
It gets, you wouldn't believe what we see.

557
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,980
Super meth for one.

558
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,740
But we're basically healers.

559
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,940
You have nothing to worry about.

560
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,500
We're going to come in and we're going to take care of it.

561
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,780
And you're going to look like a hero and it'll be great.

562
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,060
I want to know one thing.

563
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:01,460
And that is you're here investigating the super meth.

564
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Why are you looking for missing people?

565
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,740
The, the boy, uh, Billy Ray Spivvy.

566
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,540
Spivvy?

567
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,980
How do folks say that around here?

568
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,780
Spivvy.

569
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,820
Spivvy.

570
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,420
Those spivvy spivvies.

571
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,140
And the spivvy spivvies.

572
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,620
You said that with perhaps a hint of disdain.

573
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,740
Is that a family that's, that causes some, some ruckus?

574
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,380
Occasionally.

575
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,060
Occasionally.

576
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,820
They've been known to get in trouble with the law.

577
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,420
Well, then I doubt you'd be surprised to hear that we suspect that's baby boy brought the

578
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,500
super meth to your town and he might've spread it around to some of his friends.

579
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,780
And with the drugs, a lot of the times, you know, people don't pay their, what they owe

580
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,980
and people go missing.

581
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,540
And so that's kind of the connection of, you know, every thread we can kind of pull on.

582
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,260
So we were just looking for his girlfriend then that Jane Allen.

583
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:54,740
And we dropped by her mama's house who said that she ain't seen her in about three weeks.

584
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,460
So that got us, that was just got us wondering.

585
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,220
I'm, I'm sure she's going to be fine.

586
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,980
I wouldn't, I'll fill out a report, but kids around here, very mature.

587
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,500
Speaking of the kids around here, I was curious if you, if you knew about the local hangouts,

588
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,580
where, where do they, where do those kids congregate, especially the seniors in town?

589
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,700
Well, the kids that can drink, they, they go to Murrells County bunker.

590
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,220
It's the only place in town with, with booze license.

591
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,500
We keep all the riffraff there.

592
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,780
The younger ones, I know what those kids do.

593
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,780
They have their siblings buy them beer at the county bunker.

594
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,060
And then they take it down to the reservoir and hang at the reservoir.

595
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,700
And how, how, how big a gathering do you sometimes find there at the reservoir?

596
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Is it, is it five or six kids or is it 20 or 30 kids?

597
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,740
Ah, just a handful.

598
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,260
Small town, small town.

599
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,380
What day is today?

600
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,740
Yeah, is it party time?

601
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,820
It's a, it is a Thursday night.

602
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,780
Thirsty Thursday.

603
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,420
Thirsty Thursday.

604
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,220
I bet the kids are down at the reservoir.

605
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,060
Maybe we go down there and talk to them after we talk to Mr. Allen.

606
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,660
If he's, yeah.

607
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,700
If he's in there.

608
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,500
How many aldermen does this town have besides Mr. Allen?

609
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:08,820
Eight.

610
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,340
Name all of them.

611
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,540
Oh, super good.

612
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,580
I'd really rather not.

613
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,740
I'll tell you the head aldermen is Merle barn.

614
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,540
Oh, that makes sense.

615
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,500
Yeah.

616
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,940
Richest man in town.

617
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,260
Is he the booze owner and the hotel we're staying at?

618
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:26,820
Yes, sir.

619
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,540
Oh yeah.

620
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,860
And the hotel and the auto body shop.

621
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,100
Who owns the ice cream parlor?

622
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,620
Oh, that's not Merle.

623
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,220
It's competing business of his.

624
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,980
The mega deuce.

625
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:44,100
I would recommend if, uh, you, you recognize it is almost midnight and you have not had

626
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,420
anything to eat nor are you sleeping.

627
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,700
Where can we get a bite to eat at midnight around here?

628
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:56,980
Only if the mega deuce in a town like this, uh, everything shuts down at about nine o'clock

629
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,780
except the 24 seven mega deuce.

630
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,820
That's very handy.

631
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:06,420
That doesn't seem like a great business idea, but I'm glad they're open.

632
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,500
Should we go talk to Bradley?

633
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:16,260
Well, I mean, so sheriff is the city hall open right now.

634
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,380
Would anybody be there?

635
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,440
Probably.

636
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,540
Yeah.

637
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:19,780
Yeah.

638
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,740
Let's go check it out.

639
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,540
Yeah, let's go.

640
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,900
She opens up her purse and pulls out a few cliff bars and hands them out to the group.

641
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,180
Chomp these, uh, grainy boys down on the way there.

642
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,540
Give me some.

643
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,980
No, you don't want one?

644
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,420
And they don't exist.

645
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,300
Cliff bars exist.

646
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,900
Oh, she pulls out four bags of trail mix.

647
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,100
Oh, her home at her trail mix is good.

648
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,460
There's lots of M and M's.

649
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,940
What's the brand of those really, really dry nature valley nature valley.

650
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,500
Yeah.

651
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,940
I think those are boosted at the time.

652
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,180
Those were definitely around by the mid nineties.

653
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,580
Man, those things make a mess, huh?

654
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,780
Yeah, they're good though.

655
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,780
They are really tasty before we leave.

656
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,180
Harlan wants to ask the Sheriff.

657
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,980
Uh, Sheriff, are you, uh, are you aware of, uh, of a Scott Adams in town?

658
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,740
Scott at yes.

659
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,580
That troublemaker.

660
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:10,900
Yes.

661
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,260
I looking at a UFO nonsense.

662
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,460
One of those idiots.

663
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,860
What does he have to do with the drugs?

664
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,420
Oh, nothing.

665
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,820
We were just wondering if he was the fellow who wrote Dilbert.

666
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,300
Same name.

667
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,140
I checked.

668
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,660
Would you run a background check on him?

669
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:25,780
Not him.

670
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,020
That is disappointing.

671
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,020
On average, how many UFO abductions do you have around here?

672
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,820
We're just fans.

673
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,980
Wait, we don't have any.

674
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,100
That is nonsense.

675
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,780
Bunch of poppycock.

676
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,820
If you ask me, I just it's, it's ATF procedure.

677
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,580
You got to ask, have you been your, your whole life Sheriff?

678
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,220
Born and bred.

679
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,060
He said it again.

680
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:55,540
What, what to the best of your knowledge is the, the origin of these UFO conspiracies

681
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,900
surrounding this town.

682
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,780
Why are you asking so many questions about UFOs?

683
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,220
Wait, is that David or the Sheriff?

684
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,060
Uh, why are you asking?

685
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,620
I was like, you're gaslighting us.

686
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:17,620
If the spooky Delta green story about a UFO town doesn't like anyway.

687
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:17,860
Okay.

688
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:24,660
Well, no, it's just that, uh, well, we heard that was kind of, uh, you know, what passes

689
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,540
for tourist draw around here was kind of the UFO.

690
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:27,700
Yeah.

691
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,460
We like to get to know the history, even the alternative false histories.

692
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,900
We need to know the character of the town.

693
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,540
Sure.

694
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,260
Sure.

695
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,760
Yes.

696
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,100
Fine.

697
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,380
Uh, yes, we are the butt end of jokes all across the country.

698
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,420
They say those idiots in Grover's Ville, they say they're such Muppets.

699
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,620
They named a Muppet after him.

700
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,820
That's what they say about us.

701
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,140
I'm from Ralphsburg.

702
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,340
So I understand.

703
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,980
Oh, sorry.

704
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,620
Rolfsburg.

705
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,500
Yeah.

706
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,620
I'm sorry to hear that.

707
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,900
I'm from Elmo town.

708
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,620
So I also completely I'm from big birding 10 say one, Joe.

709
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,820
Uh, snuffle up against, uh, that's, uh, that's one of them.

710
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,460
Snuffle up.

711
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,740
What we're saying is we know your pain.

712
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,140
Yeah.

713
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,340
We don't think this is a mother.

714
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,140
Thank you.

715
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,860
Sounds like you got your head on straight about all this, but why?

716
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,660
What again?

717
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,460
Yes, sir.

718
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,340
What's the origin?

719
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,060
Why did it start?

720
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,540
Was there like a Roswell crash siding sort of precipitating incident or

721
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:29,300
people say they see stuff in the skies and that kind of nonsense.

722
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,300
Never seen it myself.

723
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,420
Think it's a bunch of hooey.

724
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,940
This town's fine.

725
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,940
I am a great sheriff to be clear.

726
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,900
I believe that.

727
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,540
I believe that.

728
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,020
Sheriff.

729
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,500
Yeah.

730
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:40,900
You know what?

731
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,620
Here's our car phone number and he scribbles it down.

732
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,500
You just call us.

733
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,640
Yeah.

734
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,760
Yeah.

735
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,820
Wow.

736
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,400
So you just call us anytime you got some pertinent information.

737
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
You might think of anything you think of.

738
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,680
You can call the DAA.

739
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,000
Sorry.

740
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,080
I just, I want to be clear here.

741
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,160
It's a phone in your car.

742
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,660
Yeah.

743
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,520
Yeah.

744
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,120
I think they've had those for about 10 years.

745
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,240
Isn't that cool?

746
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,840
That's so cool, right?

747
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,600
You can, uh, beat me too.

748
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,920
I got my beeper, my pager on me.

749
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,880
I'll beep you something funny sometime like eight zero zero eight.

750
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,360
Oh, boobs.

751
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,600
Yeah.

752
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:18,920
Sheriff.

753
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,680
Let's do try to keep things professional.

754
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,360
We are federal agents.

755
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,400
I'm sorry.

756
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,480
That man's beeper channel is a critical piece of national security.

757
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,720
Can't be filling it up with security with boobs.

758
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,680
Beeper number is, uh, actually, yeah, it's eight zero zero eight one three five.

759
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,560
Wooda Baker goes for the high five and then turns her back and starts walking next door.

760
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,320
Yeah.

761
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,360
We're done with you, Sheriff.

762
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,360
Wait, Joe's always got one more question.

763
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,920
Wait, let's go to the last question with Joe.

764
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,840
You're, uh, you're working here pretty late.

765
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,600
Is there something that's keeping you tonight?

766
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,640
Sorry.

767
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,360
Is it, uh, since when is it bad to love your job?

768
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,880
I'm not saying it's bad.

769
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,240
I'm asking if there's something on your desk that's taking a little extra time.

770
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,000
If loving your job is wrong, then I don't want to be right.

771
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,200
You know, exactly.

772
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,480
We believe that too.

773
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,000
But, uh, what are you working on tonight?

774
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,200
What's your job tonight?

775
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,160
Just general policing, waiting for calls to come in.

776
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,880
I have a staff.

777
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,360
I have a staff of 28 deputies.

778
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,200
Is there that much crime around here?

779
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,480
That's a lot of it's the whole, it's the county, the whole county.

780
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,760
No, they're severely understaffed.

781
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,240
Yes, I, I have, uh, 28 deputies for a 1200 person town.

782
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,760
We're very over policed.

783
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,960
That sounds about right.

784
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,200
Have all your deputies, have all your deputies been coming in and showing up to work and

785
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,080
everything?

786
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,840
I would stand for nothing less.

787
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,480
Okay.

788
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,360
Just making sure.

789
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,440
Bye.

790
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,760
Bye.

791
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,440
I don't trust you.

792
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,160
All right, let's go.

793
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,000
She don't trust nobody though.

794
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,880
That's just her way.

795
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,480
Hey, you have a pleasant Eden Sheriff.

796
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,200
Thank you Sheriff.

797
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,000
Thank you.

798
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,480
I love making Thomas play the character that cleans up my social messes.

799
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:19,400
As you leave, he calls out, uh, if you, if you go to the mega deuce, tell him the Sheriff

800
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,040
sent you.

801
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,080
Oh yeah, we'll do.

802
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,040
Wait, hold on now.

803
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,840
One more question.

804
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,320
You reeled him back in.

805
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,800
Now, now Murlsey, he, he owns the competing businesses to the, to the mega deuce.

806
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah.

807
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,880
Yes sir.

808
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,240
Why didn't you tell us to say the Sheriff sent you to Murl's?

809
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,880
Agent, have you ever heard of supporting small and local?

810
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,440
Just trying to help Mr. Cervantes out.

811
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,400
Can I, he meant that?

812
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:49,900
Sure.

813
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,360
59 on a 60.

814
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,040
Oh, he's not really bullshitting you.

815
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,720
It doesn't seem like he's misleading you.

816
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,600
He's suggesting you go to like a 24 hour diner and restaurant versus going to a bar with

817
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,200
presumably like microwave chicken fingers and stuff.

818
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,160
It's actually probably just good advice as far as quality food goes.

819
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,640
He's being nice.

820
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,520
This devious bastard.

821
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,560
Wait a minute.

822
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,640
Harlan, I've looked into his soul.

823
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,640
I've seen a kind man offering true culinary suggestions.

824
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,160
So I believe we should head on a, well, wait, I guess we're going to hit up the city hall

825
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,660
first.

826
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,860
Bye.

827
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,360
Bye.

828
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
Bye.

829
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,860
Bye.

830
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,360
Bye.

831
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,860
Bye.

832
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,360
Bye.

833
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,860
Bye.

834
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,000
Walking sounds, walking sounds, walking sounds.

835
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,800
You walk a whole 30 feet to like the front of city hall.

836
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,840
We ring the doorbell.

837
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,600
We're playing like a side scroller.

838
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,560
Three thugs attack you.

839
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,200
All in a line.

840
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,800
I move my joystick to the right.

841
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,120
So you go to the city hall.

842
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,880
It's a nicer, more regal looking building.

843
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,440
Clearly the nicest building in town.

844
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,360
It's up almost a flight of stairs outside to get kind of in the front.

845
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:14,280
And there's like a large grand foyer as you get in with a reception desk up front.

846
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,160
And it happens to be staffed by a young woman right now.

847
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,720
How long is the loading screen from when we go inside to when we can see everything?

848
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,640
Well, it's the early nineties, so it's probably around eight or nine minutes.

849
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,800
But that's good.

850
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,960
And you probably had to switch discs in between.

851
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,460
Right.

852
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,160
Is the young woman Jane Allen?

853
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,200
No.

854
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,000
Hey, could it be?

855
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,960
That would be convenient.

856
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,440
Could it be?

857
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,320
She was at work.

858
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,880
Hot damn.

859
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,000
Cracked the cakes.

860
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,880
Her mom was right.

861
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,240
Her husband and daughter were just working a lot for a really long time.

862
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,000
Hi ma'am.

863
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,560
Hello.

864
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,520
We're agents.

865
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,520
Could you point us to Mr. Bradley Allen's office?

866
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,480
Ah, the alderman.

867
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,680
Yes.

868
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,320
That's the one.

869
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,640
Let me get him for you.

870
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,600
He's in his office?

871
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,280
Yeah, he's busy right now.

872
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,720
I'll get him for you if you can just hang here.

873
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,840
Can I interest?

874
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,320
Real quick, we want to go back and ask the sheriff some questions.

875
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,200
We do?

876
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,480
No, I'm sorry.

877
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,200
Real quick, how many of the aldermen are working tonight?

878
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,120
Just a couple of them, I think.

879
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,240
Is it typical for them to, you know, burn that old midnight oil?

880
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,120
It's tax season.

881
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,480
You know, alderman and taxes.

882
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,200
You know, that's what they say, like peas and carrots.

883
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,760
And death.

884
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:33,720
And death.

885
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,520
Death and aldermen.

886
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,520
That's what they say.

887
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:36,840
Go ahead.

888
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,800
I'll go get him.

889
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,560
We'll guard the desk for you while you go get him.

890
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,280
Thank you.

891
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,680
And sorry, you said you wanted to speak to Bradley, right?

892
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,080
Yes.

893
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,800
Yes ma'am.

894
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,400
How many did she say were working?

895
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,880
Two.

896
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,200
Wow.

897
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,120
Do you want a glass of water or anything while you're waiting?

898
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,200
Just go get the alderman, please.

899
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,960
All right, there's a water cooler over there.

900
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,880
If you need anything, the bathroom's right behind you.

901
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,200
Thank you.

902
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,560
Because you haven't, as far as I know, gone to the bathroom yet since you've been here.

903
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,680
I took a shit, dude.

904
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,920
That's a real odd thing to say to somebody.

905
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,520
Dude, in real Delta Green, are you supposed to take shits?

906
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,120
I took a shit right before the meeting.

907
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,360
That pre-meeting shit.

908
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,360
You have to be careful because you might get disorders related to, like, pooping your pants

909
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,160
and stuff.

910
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,200
Yeah, no, Luke had that through all, like, a year and a half of our first campaign.

911
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,880
So we got a lot of shit jokes.

912
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,600
They're usually pretty good.

913
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,480
Well, mine was from digging through my own poop, I think.

914
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,260
Yeah.

915
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,500
There were little spider eggs in it.

916
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,900
You can hang out there, water cooler, restroom.

917
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,380
I would like to dig around in her desk.

918
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,420
Okay, roll me a search.

919
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,020
Pass 19 on a 50.

920
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,860
Anyone else searching or just that?

921
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,300
It's fine if it's just that.

922
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,100
I'm not pushing.

923
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,900
Well, I think Harlan would be not searching the desk, but peeping down hallways, just

924
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,820
kind of getting a lay of the building.

925
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,540
Okay, roll me an alertness for that.

926
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,260
Cindy is putting on her cardigan and cheaters.

927
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,620
I pass my alertness roll.

928
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,300
It's a 35 on a 50.

929
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,540
All right, alertness, all you see or hear for that matter, she goes up some stairs to

930
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,380
some sort of offices upstairs, looking down the longer hallways to the left or right.

931
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,420
They're totally dark.

932
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,820
There's no movement or anything else.

933
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,380
It's probably much busier during the day than it is right now.

934
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,060
In fact, the lights are largely off.

935
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,860
It's pretty dimly lit, actually, inside.

936
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,020
They're conserving those taxpayer dollars.

937
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,820
With that search role, you go through her desk, you find her purse, you find standard

938
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,460
stuff in there.

939
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:40,220
ID, lipstick, mirror, no cell phone yet, and her name is Jennifer Kahn.

940
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,740
You also see that on her desk, on her name tag.

941
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,860
K-H-A-N.

942
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,580
So nothing out of the ordinary in here?

943
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,100
Nothing out of the ordinary.

944
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,620
She's gone for a couple minutes.

945
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,500
Has she gone for long enough for us to yell after her?

946
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,460
Maybe her last name?

947
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,380
I was going to do it.

948
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,740
You didn't have to ask.

949
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:08,460
While they're making Star Trek jokes, Jodine goes and uses the bathroom.

950
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:14,860
Yeah, after I rifle around her desk, I also go use the bathroom.

951
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,220
Okay, great.

952
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:23,020
So after a couple minutes, she comes back, assuming neither of you took that long in

953
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,140
the bathroom, you can still be in the bathroom finishing your business if you really want

954
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:35,340
to when she comes back, but she comes back with an alder man dressed neatly in a suit

955
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,060
and he introduces himself.

956
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,380
Hello there, I'm Bradley Allen.

957
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,940
I reach out my hand to shake it.

958
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,700
Oh, freshly washed.

959
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,220
It's not, I didn't pee on my hand.

960
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,180
He did though, but he didn't say that.

961
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,540
He just thinks it.

962
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,740
Okay, good.

963
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,180
It's clean.

964
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,380
Roll me a persuade.

965
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,220
It's got to beat his smell roll.

966
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:00,860
I got a three.

967
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,740
And then against my human.

968
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,220
Ah, yeah, that 42 is going to beat your three opposed.

969
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:08,720
I'm sorry.

970
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,780
So the first thing, the first impression this guy gets of us is that he shakes his hand

971
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:22,540
and he knows it and he smells it and it smells like asparagus and he's like, oh, yeah.

972
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,740
That's bullshit.

973
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,740
You guys need to get some different soap in there.

974
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:29,020
Asparagus soap is very odd choice, very odd choice.

975
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,140
And then I just kind of fall back a little bit and just look down at my shoes.

976
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,660
He wipes it on his suit, his pant leg.

977
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,020
Well, what can I help the other three of you with?

978
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,260
We are with a special DEA task force.

979
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:49,580
We've got some questions for you regarding, well, frankly, your daughter and her friend,

980
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,260
Billy race baby.

981
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,180
Oh, would you, is there some more private?

982
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,740
We can talk.

983
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,220
Yeah, we can.

984
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,380
Let's grab one of these side offices right here.

985
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,540
I do want to assure you that at this moment, your daughter is not considered a suspect

986
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,180
or involved in any criminal activity.

987
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,020
Is she okay?

988
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,300
We have some questions for you, sir.

989
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,900
Can we, can we go into another room?

990
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,860
Uh, yes.

991
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,860
You're already in one room.

992
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,540
One question per room.

993
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,980
Let's try out a different one.

994
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,700
I'm sorry, sir.

995
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,500
The vibes in this room are just, they're kind of assaulting me right now.

996
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,980
Could we go to, yes, I can take you to another office if you'd like.

997
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,740
Is there one that looked like a nice view of the main intersection, main street?

998
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:39,340
Is there one where you could tell us when was the last time you saw your daughter?

999
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,100
That's ultimately what we need to know.

1000
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,300
No, we don't have one of those rooms.

1001
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,260
Oh shoot.

1002
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,860
Well, could you tell us anyway?

1003
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,780
I can take you to the room where I am pretty evasive with my answers to these questions.

1004
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,660
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

1005
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,780
Why don't we go to your office and we'll just, you can evade and we'll

1006
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,500
humant and we'll see what we get.

1007
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,300
I'd rather not.

1008
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,220
Yeah, but we're the DEA, so why don't you show us that office, Alderman?

1009
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,980
I'd rather go to the room where you don't humant and you just listen to me

1010
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,300
and take everything I say on face as the truth.

1011
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,060
Oh sure, that's what we meant by your office.

1012
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,620
Let's go.

1013
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,660
We all wink at each other.

1014
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,460
Do you have something in your eyes?

1015
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:14,960
Yeah.

1016
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,460
Truth.

1017
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,220
You don't want to look into my partner's eyes.

1018
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,300
Are you making fun of my lazy eye?

1019
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,180
Oh, I forgot about Harlan's weird eye.

1020
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,300
Why don't you show us to your office, Alderman?

1021
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,980
Yeah, this is uncomfortable now.

1022
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,620
Mm-hmm.

1023
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,260
Good.

1024
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,900
I'm very busy.

1025
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,460
I have to go.

1026
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,460
Yeah, we'll go with you.

1027
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,860
We just follow him.

1028
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,700
You can just work while we ask you questions.

1029
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,300
I'm just joshing around, guys.

1030
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,300
It's hilarious.

1031
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,020
Face guy.

1032
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,420
I'm just joshing.

1033
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,220
That's good.

1034
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:50,700
I'm joshing.

1035
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,500
That's good.

1036
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,660
So would you say it's been more than two weeks since you saw your daughter?

1037
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,700
Yeah, probably.

1038
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,700
What kind of drugs is your wife on?

1039
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,340
I assume she's just high on life.

1040
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,060
We're God-fearing people in this town.

1041
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:04,560
Okay.

1042
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:08,540
We talked to your wife and it doesn't really add up.

1043
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,100
So you haven't seen your daughter in like three weeks.

1044
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,900
And that's not normal, but you're fine with it.

1045
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,020
She's an independent girl.

1046
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,020
I've been busy at work.

1047
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,220
I don't think it's that big of a deal.

1048
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,900
What's been keeping you so busy?

1049
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,940
It's tax season.

1050
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,780
Can I human Tim saying, I don't think it's that big of a deal.

1051
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,060
Also, it's September.

1052
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,260
It isn't taxi.

1053
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,940
Same in our County.

1054
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,860
It is 14 success.

1055
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,980
62 on a 16 fail.

1056
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:36,540
What are we?

1057
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:36,860
Okay.

1058
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,660
I failed mine.

1059
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:38,780
Human.

1060
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,300
Oh no, I got a 99.

1061
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,380
That's pretty bad.

1062
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:56,860
Luke's like, tell me, Luke is now actively working for him with the conspiracy guys.

1063
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,740
Leave him alone.

1064
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,060
It all makes sense.

1065
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,340
Now she's an adult.

1066
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,700
She can do what she wants.

1067
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:10,060
He is not being evasive, but he also has kind of a similar level of deadness.

1068
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:15,900
As far as his empathy goes similar to his wife where he is saying it doesn't bother

1069
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,460
him.

1070
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,620
It doesn't seem like it bothers him, but he also doesn't seem like he's some like psychopathic

1071
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,980
serial killer either.

1072
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,220
So it's somewhere kind of in between that golf.

1073
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,900
There's something a little not there.

1074
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,220
It's like Stepfordy.

1075
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:28,700
Yeah.

1076
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,180
And we didn't get that impression from the sheriff.

1077
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,700
Not to the same extent.

1078
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,420
No.

1079
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:33,900
Okay.

1080
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,420
This the sheriff was weird too.

1081
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,220
But a little bit.

1082
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,540
Yeah.

1083
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,860
I feel like I was like, what's going on?

1084
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,300
What does what's going on in your town bother you or is anything in your town bothering

1085
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:42,780
you?

1086
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,020
Yeah.

1087
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,900
And he was just like, basically everything's peachy keen.

1088
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,060
No.

1089
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,220
Wasn't he like, are you saying I'm a bad sheriff?

1090
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:48,460
Yeah.

1091
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,460
But I feel like that was his version of it.

1092
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:56,060
Like he got defensive in an attempt to cover up the fact that he doesn't truly believe

1093
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,500
that anything is wrong.

1094
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,980
My problem was I tried to ask a leading question instead of just doing a vibe check.

1095
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,820
We go up to everyone else the rest of the time.

1096
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,100
We're like, Hey, excuse me.

1097
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,620
Can I roll vibes on this motherfucker?

1098
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,100
Mr.

1099
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,900
Allen, could you describe your daughter's relationship with Mr.

1100
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,380
Spivvy?

1101
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,140
Oh, that boy.

1102
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,420
Boy's no good for her.

1103
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,540
She's going places.

1104
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,620
Boy's just dragging her down.

1105
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,380
But that's why you people were here.

1106
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,660
Because of him and those drugs.

1107
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,460
That's what the sheriff said.

1108
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:26,700
Yeah.

1109
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,740
He's a brick.

1110
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,620
He is a brick.

1111
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,020
He's like a brick of this new super meth.

1112
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,140
Drowning her slowly.

1113
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,860
Yeah.

1114
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,900
I don't think the civilian is necessarily privy to maybe all that.

1115
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,620
Oh, you're right.

1116
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,820
I have a hard time keeping all my information to myself.

1117
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,020
Here's the deal, Alderman.

1118
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,580
You say she was hanging out with a boy that you knew was trouble.

1119
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,220
He's trouble.

1120
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,820
You say she's going places, though.

1121
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,980
The Ohio State University.

1122
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,780
Ohio State University.

1123
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,540
The Ohio State University.

1124
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,820
I put in a good word.

1125
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:58,860
Isn't it odd that Ohio State University backwards is USO?

1126
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,980
That's pretty similar to UFO.

1127
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,140
And that's just a little coincidence I noted.

1128
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,860
But going on, don't you think it's odd that a boy you do not enjoy, let's put it that

1129
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:13,180
way, this spivvy boy, he's been running around with your daughter.

1130
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:13,980
You think he's trouble.

1131
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,900
You say she's going places.

1132
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,300
Yep.

1133
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,220
And she's in fact been places unknown for the past three weeks.

1134
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,580
What are you suggesting?

1135
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,660
Why aren't you worried about that?

1136
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,140
Well, that spivvy boy, he's in custody, right?

1137
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,260
As of yesterday night or this morning, correct?

1138
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,940
I got nothing to worry about.

1139
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,300
He's going to stay away from my girl.

1140
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:40,780
Do you know anybody that has been abducted around here by aliens or unidentified things?

1141
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:44,060
Why does it always have to come back to aliens in this town?

1142
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:44,620
Well, you know.

1143
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,860
You can't just conduct a normal drug investigation.

1144
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,820
You got to ask the nonsense alien questions, just like every reporter.

1145
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,380
If you would have ever seen this meth, you would say it's otherworldly.

1146
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,980
Ah, nice.

1147
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,860
It's pretty cool meth.

1148
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:02,060
Now, can I human him on his...

1149
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,340
I guess that would be what it is.

1150
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:09,180
I want to know if this anger about the UFOs, which the sheriff also demonstrated.

1151
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,700
Is that legitimate, like hometown pride, like we're the butt of all these jokes?

1152
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,260
Or is that defensive?

1153
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,540
Why is everybody asking about aliens?

1154
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,060
18.

1155
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,860
Oh, yes.

1156
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,100
All right.

1157
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:27,340
With your 18, you know that they're definitely the butt end of the jokes

1158
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:30,460
based on your interaction with the sheriff as well as him.

1159
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:35,580
You know, people in authority here don't like their town being looked at as this kind of laughing stock.

1160
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,540
That makes sense.

1161
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:42,540
It's unclear if he's actively hiding anything, but he's definitely defensive about it.

1162
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:42,940
Gotcha.

1163
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,700
But it is just like the sheriff.

1164
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,500
He's like, I fucking hate that my town is this.

1165
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,420
And as the town leader, he seems to have a really good reason to feel that way.

1166
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,780
As far as you know, that's it.

1167
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,020
Because you didn't crit succeed, Thomas.

1168
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,140
Hey, man.

1169
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:03,180
Hey, just popped in my head.

1170
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,340
Do you have any tattoos?

1171
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,740
Or maybe you could show us your arm or your leg.

1172
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,580
That's a very forward question.

1173
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,940
Oh, look, I got tattoos.

1174
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:16,220
This one is Japanese for diligence.

1175
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,100
I do.

1176
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,580
Oh, what?

1177
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,820
I have May I please.

1178
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,980
So he takes off his suit jacket that starts rolling up his sleeve like he's going to give blood.

1179
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,860
And you see right on the inside of his right forearm.

1180
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,220
He's got one of those sweet infinity sign tattoos.

1181
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,660
Nice upon closer inspection.

1182
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,540
Oh, yeah, let me get a closer look at that.

1183
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,540
We're all just digging our eyes.

1184
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,420
Woodabaga just grabs his arm and brings it up to all of our eyes.

1185
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,100
I pass with a 40 on a seven.

1186
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,460
I got another 99.

1187
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,460
No, 44.

1188
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,460
Oh, I passed with a plain old two.

1189
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,140
You rip his arm out of his socket, but then I am able to get a good look at it.

1190
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,740
I think you've crit success on, like, every person that you've looked at closely at this point.

1191
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:10,700
So the first time on Billy Ray, you definitively saw marks.

1192
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,580
And then it was Nancy, the mom.

1193
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:13,820
Yes.

1194
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,140
Yeah, definitively did not have it.

1195
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,940
And he also definitively does not have it.

1196
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,740
Same with the sheriff.

1197
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:24,700
Nowhere on his exposed arms, on his neck, hands, anything that you can see exposed right now.

1198
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:29,340
He definitively does not have the same kind of muscle punctures.

1199
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,940
Sorry, it's just my partner here has tattoos.

1200
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,660
And then we've been working on this task force with Tan here.

1201
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,940
So they've all been just razzing me about, you know, when are you going to get yours?

1202
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,660
When do you get yours?

1203
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,100
And I'm like, it's 1992.

1204
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,860
We're like 20 years away from that being really socially acceptable.

1205
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:48,060
Just, you know, in a professional job, maybe even 30.

1206
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,100
If I had to give a rust out cement, that's just what I've been saying to them.

1207
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,260
So that's why we were really, uh, that's why we wanted to just get all up and look at your tattoo.

1208
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,940
It's just been on our minds lately.

1209
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,900
I hope you like it.

1210
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,140
Yeah.

1211
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,860
What's it mean?

1212
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,300
It means infinity.

1213
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,660
Oh, I thought it was eight.

1214
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,060
Nice.

1215
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,820
Oh, that happens sometimes, you know.

1216
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,620
Do you ever use your computer to look up tattoo ideas?

1217
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,780
Maybe we could go use your computer real quick.

1218
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,460
Thank you.

1219
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:14,780
Okay.

1220
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,060
In the office that you're currently in, there is a computer.

1221
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,540
He can crack it open for you.

1222
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,180
There's not really such a thing as cyber security at this point.

1223
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,260
There's not even a login really to get on.

1224
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:32,540
And he fires up the 28-8 modem on that computer and you hear that sweet, sweet sound of

1225
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:49,340
And, uh, Joe, I think you said you have a AOL account.

1226
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:53,580
Character Joe or no, Joe's still rocking an AOL account.

1227
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,940
Joe's like, this will be confusing.

1228
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,900
And I was like, no, it's fine.

1229
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:57,340
Yeah.

1230
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,380
It's really confusing.

1231
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:58,700
Sorry.

1232
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,260
Player Thomas, character Joe, you said you had an AOL account?

1233
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:12,300
Yeah, it's Joe, capital D-E-A, lowercase n at aol.com.

1234
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,180
Joe Dean.

1235
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,460
Okay, great.

1236
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:19,820
You log in and then you get the, you've got mail.

1237
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,060
Okay.

1238
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,100
Joe Dean clicks his mail.

1239
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:22,860
Who's it from?

1240
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,580
Your AOL.

1241
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,300
Your AOL.

1242
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,300
Now it'll probably be from one of my bonds, right?

1243
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,140
Sounds role-play appropriate.

1244
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:37,740
So I've got my rich brother, Jim Dean, uh, and then my mom and my dad.

1245
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:43,260
I think this is a really shitty chain email from Jim, especially in 1992.

1246
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:47,420
He's probably the only reason I have an internet, like an AOL account right now.

1247
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,180
Like last Thanksgiving, he was like, yeah, personal computer.

1248
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,460
The, you know, the nerds came in, wired up my home.

1249
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,500
I've got, uh, I've got access to the whole world right now, baby.

1250
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,820
And it's just a shitty AOL chat room.

1251
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,020
And he made you look like a fool at your own Thanksgiving dinner.

1252
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:08,060
So that's a lifelong pattern that I've talked to you about in more vulnerable moments.

1253
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,940
Agent would have begun.

1254
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,740
Oh yeah, sorry.

1255
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,020
Bring that up.

1256
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,460
Anyway, it's literally just a shitty joke email from his brother, Jim.

1257
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,580
Do you guys remember any, uh, nineties joke chain emails?

1258
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,540
It's probably just the,

1259
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,220
my mom used to fucking love those all.

1260
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,780
This is like a little bit before that for sure.

1261
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:29,180
It's not one of those emails where it's like, if you don't forward this to at least 10 people,

1262
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,860
you're going to have bad luck kind of thing.

1263
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,500
Exactly.

1264
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:31,900
Yeah.

1265
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,220
Yeah.

1266
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:32,700
It's that.

1267
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,700
And then it's also a lot of, uh, weird proto Clinton conspiracy jokes.

1268
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,340
Joe Dean's like, man, I hope this doesn't, you know,

1269
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,900
take weird route in the public consciousness so that a lot, you know, anyway, I hope this

1270
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,300
doesn't sink a really viable candidate.

1271
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,300
Hey Joe, here's that card.

1272
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,580
I hand you the business card.

1273
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,500
I hope this country doesn't hate women enough.

1274
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,500
Watch the skies.

1275
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,780
Orange piece of shit.

1276
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,220
AOL.com.

1277
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,860
I'm done with my musings.

1278
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,580
Well, what do you do?

1279
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,500
What do you do with that email address?

1280
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,660
Well, Joe Dean, he's like, I got this boys.

1281
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:11,180
Watch this over to like compose mail or whatever.

1282
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:15,980
Types in the email address, subject line, D E.

1283
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:16,300
Hey.

1284
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:29,500
And he says, hello, I'm in Grover's Ville for a few days.

1285
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,700
Curious, uh, re UFOs.

1286
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,020
Wanted to ask you some cues.

1287
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,620
You can get back to me here or just set a time that we meet.

1288
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,180
Cause I don't know if we're going to get access to the email again.

1289
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,300
That is such a good idea.

1290
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,100
I was like, oh, I've been wondering about that the whole time.

1291
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,100
Like this, how do we get a computer again?

1292
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,700
This conspiracy dude is going to love it if I'm just like, yeah.

1293
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:50,940
Yeah.

1294
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,500
Meet at the mega deuce at noon tomorrow.

1295
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,780
Sincerely, John Dean, federal agent.

1296
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,500
Aggressive.

1297
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,340
I want him to think I might know things.

1298
00:59:59,340 --> 00:59:59,900
What's that?

1299
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,820
A with the circle around it.

1300
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,940
That stands for at.

1301
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,300
Asked and answered.

1302
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,580
It's called an apostrophe.

1303
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,860
I think I believe that's correct.

1304
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,540
Email was sent.

1305
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,180
Yep.

1306
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,460
You've got mail.

1307
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,100
Ooh.

1308
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,060
Auto reply.

1309
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,500
Oh, it's my fucking brother again.

1310
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,260
Did you get two messages perhaps?

1311
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:21,900
Oh, I did.

1312
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,420
Look, the Dilbert guy messaged us back.

1313
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:27,340
You.

1314
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:27,820
Yes.

1315
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,700
Did get an auto reply straight to your email.

1316
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,900
So auto reply, uh, read D E Hey.

1317
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:41,420
And in the body of the email, it says I'm out of the office for at least the next couple of weeks.

1318
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:45,900
Investigating what's happening in Grover's Ville.

1319
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,940
I will get back to you at my earliest convenience.

1320
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:53,260
Signed Scott Adams, not the creator of Dilbert.

1321
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:58,300
And he gives a address in Knoxville.

1322
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,860
Is there a telephone in this office we're in?

1323
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,620
There is in fact a telephone in this office.

1324
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,660
Are you going to call that address?

1325
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,140
No, I'm going to call the number that was on the back of the card.

1326
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,580
Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1327
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,980
Is the alderman still in the office for this?

1328
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:10,460
Yeah.

1329
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:13,820
Sir, you're, we're going to have to commandeer your office for the next, uh,

1330
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,100
roughly 10 minutes, uh, for an urgent federal business.

1331
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,940
Uh, we're about to call our boss.

1332
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,980
We need to commandeer your phone.

1333
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,260
Could you please step outside?

1334
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,180
Cindy will start walking out the door with him alongside Jodine.

1335
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,220
You're escorting him out?

1336
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:26,380
Yeah.

1337
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,820
We just started escorting him out.

1338
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,940
But yeah, it's okay.

1339
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,420
But yeah, it's just only for a little bit.

1340
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,060
You're all right.

1341
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:32,700
It's okay.

1342
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,420
You got busy.

1343
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,420
Remember you said you had to get back to work, right?

1344
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,060
Yeah.

1345
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:36,540
10 minutes.

1346
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,260
But that other alderman's wondering where you are.

1347
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,220
Probably got to talk to him.

1348
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:41,740
Okay.

1349
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,460
I'll wait.

1350
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,380
You know, do you need to ask me any more questions or should I just go back to work?

1351
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,500
Now you can fuck off.

1352
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,000
Thanks.

1353
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:49,660
Great meeting you all.

1354
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,380
But wait.

1355
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,940
Except for she realizes she's wearing the cardigan.

1356
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,140
She's like, Oh, wrong voice.

1357
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:54,860
Ah, dammit.

1358
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:57,900
Okay.

1359
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:58,540
He fucks off.

1360
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,740
He goes upstairs back doing whatever he's doing upstairs with taxes.

1361
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:04,620
And you're gonna make that phone call?

1362
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,100
Yes.

1363
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:11,100
I'm dialing beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1364
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,260
No, I need rotary phone sounds.

1365
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:20,460
Oh, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

1366
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,180
All right.

1367
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,900
Now I need that trademarked ring that you guys do.

1368
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,860
Oh, so well.

1369
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:25,820
We'll put it in.

1370
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,380
I don't think I've ever actually heard this.

1371
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,580
I'll do it in post Taylor.

1372
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,080
Really?

1373
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,980
Thomas doesn't listen to the show.

1374
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,340
No, I'm not allowed to listen.

1375
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,060
I need to do a re-listen, but sorry.

1376
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,020
It's one of my favorite parts.

1377
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,740
Everybody talks about it on the forums.

1378
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,380
And it's from an episode I was not previously allowed to listen to.

1379
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,020
It's it's good stuff.

1380
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:53,980
You call it rings once or twice, and then you get that dial-up modem sound on the back end.

1381
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,380
Sort of like when you call a fax machine or something else.

1382
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,540
Not ringing like a normal phone.

1383
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,180
Listen to this.

1384
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,620
What's happening?

1385
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:05,420
It's a, that sounds like a fax machine.

1386
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:09,740
It looks like maybe he was expecting documents of some sort.

1387
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:10,380
I hang up.

1388
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,020
Should we fax him something?

1389
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,020
Is there a fax machine in the alderman's office?

1390
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,500
There is.

1391
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,340
I write what you wrote in your email.

1392
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:17,980
You send that.

1393
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,740
It bounces back.

1394
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,780
Fax unable to send.

1395
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:21,340
It's not.

1396
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,860
So apparently it's not a fax machine.

1397
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,460
It's actually a modem on the receiving end.

1398
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,220
Does that just mean he's on the internet?

1399
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:26,460
Yeah.

1400
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:26,620
Yeah.

1401
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,180
Okay.

1402
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,260
So Joe doesn't know why a person would write down an internet address,

1403
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,100
modem address on a piece of paper.

1404
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,940
But, uh, my character probably would.

1405
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:35,740
It's a no, no, no.

1406
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:36,140
He didn't.

1407
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:36,620
He didn't.

1408
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:36,860
He.

1409
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:39,900
So remember back in the day, you couldn't use the phone if you were connected to the internet

1410
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,780
or like, yeah.

1411
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,740
Oh, that's what you're saying.

1412
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:43,740
It's it's like we, yeah, exactly.

1413
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,540
Gotcha.

1414
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:45,180
Well, okay.

1415
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:47,260
You used to get just to get a busy tone if that happened.

1416
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,540
Oh, maybe in 1992.

1417
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,820
I mean, who has computer science?

1418
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:52,220
I do.

1419
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,380
Who are you calling when you were three years old?

1420
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,220
You can wait.

1421
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,020
You can roll me some.

1422
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,660
But you don't have to answer this, but how old are you?

1423
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,180
I was born in the mid eighties.

1424
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:02,140
All right.

1425
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:02,300
Yeah.

1426
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,140
I'm the oldest one here.

1427
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:08,780
And I remember AOL at age six, uh, doing exactly this.

1428
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,660
If you picked up the phone line in the household, that's what you heard.

1429
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:15,180
But if you called into that house, it was just dial tone.

1430
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,940
That's a fail 73 on a 50 computer science.

1431
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,940
Well, you have a 50 anyway, you would know this.

1432
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,460
This is one of those like base.

1433
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,620
Hold on for Joe's information.

1434
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:30,860
That means the call is coming from inside the house in this building using the internet.

1435
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:31,980
Or it's just us.

1436
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,300
I log off of AOL and we make the call again.

1437
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,420
Oh my God.

1438
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,780
It was a puzzle this whole time.

1439
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:46,780
David, we just had to get off the internet puzzle.

1440
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,580
You are the ones that killed all those people.

1441
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:53,740
Damn.

1442
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:54,460
And that's it.

1443
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,020
We're done.

1444
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,300
I inspect my own arm.

1445
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,540
You're the aliens.

1446
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,940
We're all covered in tiny little needle marks.

1447
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,060
You call that happens.

1448
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:04,380
Okay.

1449
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,060
Maybe you're right in real life.

1450
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,140
It would be a busy signal in this world.

1451
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:12,220
The way the technology works, that means it's, it's logged in.

1452
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,700
That's the point of that you're supposed to get.

1453
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:21,020
I will give you something else just cause no one has, uh, the telecommunications,

1454
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,940
uh, networking skill.

1455
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:29,980
One thing you would notice that phone number is area code nine three one, which is not

1456
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,980
a Knoxville phone number.

1457
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,340
So it's a different area code than the phone number on the footer of his email.

1458
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,980
Nine three one is the area code for this County.

1459
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,900
So it seems to be a local number.

1460
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,260
He might be staying at the same motel we're staying at.

1461
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:43,740
Oh yeah.

1462
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,100
Let's just go ahead and can we call Merle's the front desk?

1463
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,740
Cause I assume there's a phone book in here or we have there is a phone book.

1464
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:56,620
So, um, let's, let's call Merle's and ask if, uh, if the Scott Adams is standing there

1465
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,740
and if he created Dilbert.

1466
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,420
Bring, bring.

1467
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,060
Merle's shut eye.

1468
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,340
How can I help you?

1469
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:06,860
Hey, this is one of the Sheriff's, uh, down at, uh, this is one of the deputies

1470
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,620
down at the Sheriff's office.

1471
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:11,980
Have you got a Scott Adams stand with y'all?

1472
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,140
Uh, let me check.

1473
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,220
And you hear some papers in the background.

1474
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:19,020
Um, yeah, we got a, we got a Scott Adams here.

1475
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:23,420
Um, he's been here for a hot second as the kids say.

1476
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,340
Let me check the records.

1477
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:27,020
Oh, do they say that yet?

1478
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:27,660
They do here.

1479
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,540
This is, this is actually the town it originates in, in the early nineties.

1480
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:38,220
Eventually proliferate elsewhere, but give me a hot second and yes.

1481
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,580
Oh no, he's been here.

1482
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,980
Uh, he has been, he's been here for a couple of weeks now.

1483
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,340
It looks like he's paid up for three more nights.

1484
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,380
What's his room number?

1485
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:48,940
I'm sorry.

1486
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:53,820
Uh, who is this asking specifically about, uh, people saying at this, uh, motel that

1487
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,940
I probably should ask that before, um, I just give away information like this

1488
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,060
willy nilly on the phone.

1489
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:02,140
Oh, deputy Clark down from the, the Groversville Ferris department.

1490
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,740
Your deputy Clark.

1491
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,860
Well, I'm new in case there's a deputy Clark, you know, and don't like.

1492
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:08,780
Oh, okay.

1493
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:08,940
Yes.

1494
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,380
That's why they got me on the night shift.

1495
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:10,700
Yeah.

1496
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,260
That okay.

1497
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:11,820
That makes sense.

1498
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,300
Sure.

1499
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,260
Um, yeah, no, no, no.

1500
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:13,900
He's here.

1501
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,180
Uh, he has two rooms down here at the motel.

1502
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,180
Two rooms and all these unpaid parking tickets.

1503
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,660
What a, which is what we're after him for.

1504
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,260
He's paid up for three more days.

1505
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,860
He should have paid his parking tickets.

1506
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:31,820
He has one room he's staying in and, um, there is a second room, uh, for storage

1507
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:34,460
of research materials, whatever that means.

1508
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:34,860
Wow.

1509
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:38,860
He just put all that on his book and yeah, it's all, it's all here.

1510
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:39,500
And what was your name?

1511
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,780
I'm the manager by the way.

1512
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:42,380
Uh, my name is Riker Yates.

1513
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,300
Strong name.

1514
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:45,180
Very strong name.

1515
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,060
That's a strong name.

1516
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:47,020
Riker Yates.

1517
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:47,820
Thank you.

1518
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:52,220
Well, I was deputy, uh, you remember and I will, you have a pleasant night.

1519
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,460
Hey, ask him about the UFOs.

1520
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,660
You liked that UFO stuff?

1521
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:00,300
Why is it always about the UFOs?

1522
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:04,300
Click.

1523
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,300
Hi.

1524
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,940
No, I can't get high.

1525
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,700
I thought this stuff helped anxiety.

1526
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,580
It must be something inside of me.

1527
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:46,300
Does anybody know why I can't get high?

1528
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:54,140
I can't sit though I can't and I don't want to try.

1529
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,140
Don't want to try.

1530
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:04,140
Please miss me won't you spare me something more can you buy.

1531
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,140
Where do you begin?

1532
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:12,140
I don't know how.

1533
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:15,980
I don't know how.

1534
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:21,980
Hallucinations so big time but spiders out the night.

1535
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,980
Spiders out the night.

1536
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:31,980
Breathing in, breathing out.

1537
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:39,980
I've been hiding in low low places with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.

1538
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:47,820
And I can't help but feel it I'll always be at the bottom.

1539
01:09:47,820 --> 01:10:17,660
I think I'm allergic or something better gone with nothing so I won't get high.

1540
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:23,500
No I won't get high.

1541
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:27,500
By all means do it if it helps.

1542
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,500
For me it makes my brain melt.

1543
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:39,500
Does anybody know why I can't get high?

1544
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:47,500
I can't sit though I can't and I don't want to try.

1545
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:57,500
Please miss me won't you spare me something more can you buy.

1546
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,500
Where do you begin?

1547
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,500
I don't know how.

1548
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:13,500
Hallucinations so big time but spiders out the night.

1549
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:23,500
Breathing in, breathing out.

1550
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:31,500
I've been hiding in low low places with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.

1551
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:37,500
And I can't help but feel it I'll always be at the bottom.
