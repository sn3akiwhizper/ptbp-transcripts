1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
What's good, my friends? Y'all want to know what's really good? Your boy Wolf the dog sure does

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,960
What's really good is me being your host on the greatest show in the known and unknown universe

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,400
six nine four point two PTBP

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,660
The only show that will let y'all know what's really going on in all the dimensions

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,540
Suck it NPR. What do you fools even know about the 27th dimension?

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,640
Speaking of other dimensions this week's howling with wolf comes from Justin Jay from the Twitter

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,420
Dimension who tagged that pretending pod in a tweet about benching the whole show in four days. Whoa

8
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,480
Hell yeah, Justin Jay on Twitter. They write

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,740
Hey wolf long time listener first time howler

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,580
I wanted to give a shout out to my best friend Dan

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,940
Well best friend besides my wife your taste in music and games and podcast is unparalleled

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,880
And I'm glad I could turn you on to the adventures of our boys and contention

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,460
You're also an invaluable asset and we couldn't make our show without you. What show you ask?

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,220
Well, if y'all want more supernatural nonsense in your lives, you should check out the cryptid cases

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,900
See you Friday, probably hell yeah, Justin Jay from Twitter

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,580
Thanks for writing about the show and spreading the good word of the fine folks of PTBP

17
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,060
I like your name

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,380
Justin it reminds me of a name I once had in a past life in another dimension

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,740
I look forward to seeing you Friday probably but you will not see me on Friday

20
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,300
Probably I like to hang out from afar usually using some binoculars or telescopes just

21
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,860
watching

22
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,940
Waiting until the time is just right

23
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,780
Remember if you want to write up something for your wolf the how tag at pretending pod on

24
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:13,540
Instagram or Twitter tag pretending to be people on Facebook or write a five-star review and email us at pretending pod at gmail.com

25
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,320
Also the contest happening over on the subreddit ends at

26
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,460
1159 p.m. Central time on September 23rd

27
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,900

28
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,460
hardback slip case set of Delta green the role-playing game

29
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:40,060
Check out all the gorgeous entries on the thread so far as they are all stunning in their own delightful ways

30
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,020
Gorgeous stunning

31
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,620
Delightful it can't be but it is it's the news

32
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,420
with Keith vigna

33
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:58,620
Unconscious Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore took turns tossing grenades into the maw of the atrociously massive fish person creature

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,300
Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent Chad was

35
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,420
decapitated by the scythe of a fishy humanoid

36
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:13,440
This same gamey bipedal amphibian then lodged that scythe into the skull of Kathy piston

37
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:20,860
John Lee Kevin Moore was swallowed whole by Big Daddy fish monster, but swam through the whole Keith made previously

38
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:28,700
However, an unseen force dragged his body down to the bottom of the tank up against the glass of that

39
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,940
gargantuan aquarium in Kevin Lee Pettymore made direct eye contact with Marvin glass as

40
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,460
lungs filled with water

41
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:46,520
Like the lead singer the pussycat dolls once said don't hold your breath. It's kudzu with no backbone, baby

42
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,420
Oh

43
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,500
My mama made me miss my M&Ms. Oh my

44
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,280
Hey Clark, hey Joe, you can you can call me Clark you can call me Clark

45
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Clark you are

46
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,260
Standing on the wet catwalk above this murky water in this dank room

47
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,700
Keith vigna is in your arms and in front of you both is the lone

48
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,620
Standing fish man

49
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,460
Just previously the giant monstrosity

50
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,180
That is in the deep and four times bigger than the normal fish man

51
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,660
swallowed John Lee Pettymore John Lee Kevin more hole and

52
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,420
Then dove into the depths below

53
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,700
We are still in combat and shit it is the top of the order which means

54
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,740
It is Clark Bishop's turn

55
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,900
Looking down into the water. Can I see big fish boy?

56
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,020
Or is he just completely out of sight at this point completely out of sight at this point? Okay

57
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,340
I'm going to take a shot at the fish man in front of me

58
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,820
Go ahead and roll firearms as you kind of back up with Keith vigna in your arms

59
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:30,340
You are backing into a part of the catwalk that has been ripped down by the giant monstrosity

60
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,180
So there's water behind you. Do you roll a successful firearms check?

61
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,300
I did a 13 on an 80. All right, go ahead and roll a d10 for me for damage

62
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,420
For all right, so there's no catwalk behind me at all. No, it has been ripped down

63
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,580
Could I make a maneuver across that corner? You would have to roll an athletics check at a negative 20%

64
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,580
Because you're holding on to Keith vigna. I would give you a negative 40 but Keith vigna

65
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,100
He's a rubbery guy. He's pretty easy to hold on to I don't feel like I can risk it

66
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,900
So I'll just wait and see what happens. All righty

67
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,420
But it's the fish man that's in front of me is blocking my way us ostensibly ostensibly

68
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,500
He is even though he's on the opposite side of the elevator door

69
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,260
He is still blocking your way because behind you in between you in the elevator door

70
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,200
It's just this torn down catwalk and you're not sure if you jump down into it with a couple

71
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Feet of water up on to your knees

72
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,440
It might break all the way off and fall into the depths plunge below

73
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
so it is this

74
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,720
It looks like a human. Honestly, it does it looks like a human person that has been genetically modified or

75
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,200
grown and birthed in some

76
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,440
Unnatural way to make them look like this and sure your everyday monstrosity

77
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,440
Exactly, and this everyday monstrosity is coming at you with a massive scythe

78
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,840
And it fails its rule. Thank God

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,560
So it kind of lunges toward you and you move just right out of the way as it comes for you and it's back to

80
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,880
You it's just gonna go back and forth here. Oh for real. Yes, sir. So what would you like to do?

81
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,240
What are damage mechanics if I wanted to use that scythe against him

82
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,640
Could I use an unarmed combat to take that flail at me and turn it on him?

83
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
I think we've done that before. Yeah, actually

84
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,960
You can you can absolutely do that. Yes. Okay, I'm gonna show that would mean you're gonna basically do unarmed combat

85
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Okay against him. So go ahead and roll that. I

86
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
I

87
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,080
Pass a 38 on a 70 he's gonna try to fight back and he failed with a 91 fuck

88
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,640
yeah, so what you're gonna do is it with this you can take control of his scythe and

89
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,320
Do damage with it. So that damage is a d8 plus two. So go ahead and roll that for me. Oh, dude

90
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,780
I don't think I have a d8 sitting out. Do you I have a d8?

91
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,620
It's one of the nice metal ones that you gave me sweet. I hope it rolls an eight

92
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
It fucking did

93
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:22,780
Yeah, that is it had six hit points left with fuck two armor

94
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,300
You take it just down to zero do you want to describe how you take control of this fish man's

95
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:39,140
Main weapon and take it down when he came swinging at me and he totally whiffed in the air my gun hand I

96
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:46,780
Reached out and wrapped my arm around at that peg or that the stick of the scythe. Absolutely and just lunge forward

97
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,340
I was probably wanting to aim as high as I could to decapitate but we'll see how high that got me

98
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,920
It got him like maybe oh it goes

99
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
It goes straight

100
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,220
Straight through one of its gills on the side of its neck and you actually see a the scythe goes

101
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,160
Into the gills and comes out of the fish man's mouth with the human teeth

102
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,520
And so the point of the scythe is coming out through its big smile. That's a nice little kung-fu move. I put on that boy

103
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,560
And as you do that it falls

104
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,980
Onto the catwalk next to you and you are standing in this

105
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,080
murky

106
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
damp dank

107
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,200
prison torture chamber aquatic mess by yourself

108
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,000
Keith vigna is in your arms. You did all that with him like as a puppet and

109
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,920
Like a marionette like in front of you

110
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah

111
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,480
Are we still in combat orders do I need to know and as you stand there kind of reeling from this

112
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
you feel a

113
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,280
Rumble from beneath and looking down you see this massive explosion

114
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,100
Happen deep down in the water and the bubbles start coming and they don't stop coming

115
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,460
John Lee Pettymore got fed to the fish and he hit the ground running did him. All right, so

116
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,060
as these bubbles are hitting top of the water so to a

117
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,920
Massive fish side

118
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,860
Humanoid flank of fish flank of fish

119
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,980
Floats to the top of the water

120
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,540
That's either a really good sign or a really bad and then on the other side of you

121
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,560
You see the bottom half of this monstrosity with its weird legs

122
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,700
Fused together and it's tight tight genitals

123
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,860
in between and

124
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,720
Next to it. You see the bottom half of George piston and the top half of George piston

125
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
I

126
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,320
Said that's an okay half to see as far as knowing that John's down there

127
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,160
And I need you to roll a sanity check. Oh shit

128
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:25,120
I do not pass. It's a 30 on a 16. Okay. I need you to go down to 15 losing one sanity and

129
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,840
you just break down in this room and

130
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,720
As you're standing there holding the body of Keith Wigner

131
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,640
crying as a God

132
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
Who has failed?

133
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
ding

134
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,780
The elevator door opens up

135
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Oh, do you want it to be empty

136
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Did you think it would be empty

137
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,160
a little afraid of getting at all this and then fighting some in an elevator, so

138
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,920
I guess we'll see what's happening. It's empty. Oh

139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,280
Thank God is Keith in my arms do I think he's dead as I'm holding him or do I know that he's

140
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,840
Unconscious or whatever roll a first aid check. Okay. Oh

141
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,000
Fuck

142
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,040
Shit at 38 on a 30. All right, so close he is

143
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Super dead

144
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,040
I

145
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Drop him in the water

146
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,040
Burial at sea. No, I'm not gonna drop him in the water

147
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,720
I'm gonna try I want to get to the elevator and I just want to throw him between

148
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,560
The threshold like over the threshold so that the doors can't close. Okay, it keeps the elevator there

149
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,320
You're doing this and then I want to go back to what the last place I saw John Lee Pettymore

150
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,600
Is it in the same place that the now body has reemerged resurfaced or is it in a different area now the?

151
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,800
There's not a current in here so everything that floated to the top is where it was earlier

152
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,360
Is that what you asked essentially?

153
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,680
I was wondering if the when the when the big guy got him did he swim away with him?

154
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Seems like you went straight down. Okay

155
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,840
Fuck there's other people hanging in this room. Yes. Do I a recognize any of them and B

156
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,100
Can I tell if any of them are alive or actually I'm more looking for any of them that are already dead

157
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,580
There's the nearest one to you is already dead

158
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,100
The other three seem to be unconscious that you can see but one is like very clearly

159
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,940
skin

160
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:40,340
dilapidating to the point of the fish hook has ripped its way from the middle of the forearm all the way up to the

161
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,420
Hands and it's just hanging clearly by bones at this point

162
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,220
Yeah, I was thinking I was gonna use him to like see if there were other monsters in the water

163
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,540
But I'm nervous about time with that if John Lee Pettymore is still alive and under the surface

164
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,820
I think I'm going to have to

165
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,220
dive in

166
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,500
And look for him. Okay. How do I do that?

167
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,160
You dive in Clark takes off his contention uniform and he's in his tidy whiteies off to do so amazing

168
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,820
Alright, are you bringing anything? Are you bringing the the scythe with you? Yeah

169
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,260
Yeah, that's not gonna leave my side for as long as I can keep it

170
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,300
That's a cool weapon of destruction right there

171
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,220
All right

172
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,220
according to the rules you have

173
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,700
Con times five rounds if you take a full breath before you jump in

174
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,340
So you have a shitload of rounds? Yeah, that's a lot

175
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:45,680
So I am going to I also have that thing that makes it so that my con is extra high

176
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,320
Oh my gosh. Yeah, so you have plenty of time

177
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,980
Yeah, so if your search is above a 40 you'll find what you're looking for

178
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:00,060
But if it's not if it's a 40 or below then I'll have you roll search. So what is your search skill?

179
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,180
I don't have any in search. So I have the baseline of 20. Okay, so you'll need to roll. Okay

180
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Shit

181
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Oh

182
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,680
Zach you want to take a picture of this? I rolled it. I rolled a 19

183
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,780
My god, I rolled a fucking 19 on a 20. I'm like shaking

184
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
Hahaha

185
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:40,640
Joe Terry's ability to roll successes in the most dire of situations keeps me on my toes as a GM more than

186
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,920
anything else

187
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:50,260
More than Luke just like claiming that things exist like more than Thomas doing jokes like

188
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,780
your ability to roll successes when you have nothing in the skill is

189
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,380
Mind-blowing that that was incredible. I literally have an adrenaline surge right now

190
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,020
Joe Clark is swimming through this murkiness and

191
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
swimming and swimming and

192
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,800
You're trying to find anything but the water is so

193
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,660
So opaque with how dirty and disgusting it is every once in a while

194
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:25,020
You find these pockets of like cool water that are a little bit easier to see through but for the most part

195
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,860
it is

196
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,540
Impossible to see more than a foot in front of your face down here

197
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,380
but all of a sudden you reach out and you feel

198
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,020
Clothes

199
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,420
And you feel the body of John Lee Pettymore in front of you and

200
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,620
Continuing to reach for it. You see he is pressed up against glass

201
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,720
Some sort of a wall here. What do you want to do?

202
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,820
You're on the other side of John Lee Pettymore from this glass as you swim up are my eyes open enough underwater that I can

203
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,460
See him at this point. Yes, are his eyes open or closed? He is faced away from you and he seems to be

204
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,620
Forcibly pushed up against this glass. Oh shit

205
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,140
Can I run a hand?

206
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,260
Kind of toward the front of him

207
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,100
Here's Joe's theory and probably Clark's too is that maybe he's being

208
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,940
Suctioned into that window because there's a hole in it and the water is trying to be rushed out

209
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,300
So can I feel that hole if there is one you feel all the way down? I'm gonna roll

210
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
dice I

211
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,140
Need you to roll stealth as I roll something else

212
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
I've got a 30 in that I

213
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,020
Got a 36 on a 30 so I fail I'm not gonna tell you what I rolled fuck

214
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,740
Fuck but I rolled dice

215
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,000
So, but so I just I don't feel that hole right you do not feel a hole

216
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
Okay as you run your hand, but you do feel pressure

217
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:09,420
Pulling his body up against this glass. Can I get my face closer to the glass and maybe see what's on the other side?

218
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,460
Yes, you can what lastly looking on the other side of the glass

219
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,580
You push your face up against it and open up your eyes in this disgusting water and

220
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,420
You see a large

221
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,100
office and in the middle of this office, there's a desk and

222
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,940
Marvin Glass is standing at this desk

223
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,980
Holding up a picture in his hand and he's showing it to Rosemary

224
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,940
who's standing on the other side of the desk and

225
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,060
He is like shaking it in her face and

226
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,620
With his other hand. He is holding it out

227
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,880
Toward the glass toward you toward John Lee petty more

228
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:03,300
Fuck so I'm pressed against the glass and I'm seeing that can I look like down as if I were looking down at myself and see

229
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,780
If there's any water coming out of where John is there's there's not right? There's not okay

230
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,900
I'm gonna try and pull him away from the glass and see what happens. Okay, I need you to roll strength. Okay. Okay, okay. I

231
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:26,060
Pass a 32 on a 65 as you pull at John Lee petty Moore's body you feel

232
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
Absolutely, no change

233
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,660
You feel it is as if you are trying to pull a statue

234
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,340
Away from its place on the ground or trying to pull a

235
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,820
Car to the side with your hands. Like it's just not gonna move not gonna budge

236
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,580
Fuck does Kevin John have any grenades left on him? No. Yeah, I didn't think so. I don't think I could do either

237
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,840
I'm afraid to ask a question because the you'll think about it. It'll be no

238
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,300
Can I fire my gun underwater in real life? I don't think you can I don't think so

239
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:10,020
Right. I don't think you can I think there are guns in this world that you can fire underwater

240
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,060
But I don't think that you're like service pistol is one of them. Fuck

241
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,480
Can I get a sense of how far down below the catwalks?

242
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,060
I have traveled to find the John Lee petty Moore's body against the glass role intelligence for me. I

243
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,740
Pass a 20 on a 55 like 40 meters. It's pretty deep

244
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:40,080
I want to roll first aid to see if John Lee petty Moore is actually alive or not

245
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,260
Okay, reach for that pulse while you roll first aid. I

246
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,940
Pass five on a 30 John Lee petty Moore's heart is no longer beating

247
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,060
He's kind of robot II though, I don't know if he needs a heart anymore I

248
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,460
Don't have a heart you wouldn't find a heartbeat on me and I'm dandy

249
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,740
And that's why you don't have to roll sanity

250
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,180
I'm kind of at a loss here. Here's what I think I'm gonna try because I've got such good

251
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,360
underwater swimming skills that I've just made up just now

252
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,420
Can I swim up to the top here's what I want to do

253
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,340
I'll tell you the whole action that I want to hit me with it

254
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,380
So I want to swim back up to the top jump onto the catwalk run over to

255
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,540
Keith's body and try and find his strong tiny powerful gun

256
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,020
I want to run back to the edge of the catwalk and shoot down where I last was

257
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:44,900
Trying to break the glass into into glasses office. I want to break the glass into glasses office so that it floods

258
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,260
Okay, give me any and all roles I need to do to make that happen

259
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
This is gonna be good

260
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,180
You swim back down you got that

261
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,060
insane

262
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:14,500
Constitution and we'll say that you you felt your way around to figure out like where you were on the catwalk

263
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
So you get up on the catwalk?

264
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Still like empty in here

265
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:26,180
Just these unconscious and maybe dead bodies hanging in the background as you walk over to the body of Keith Vigna

266
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Which is halfway into the elevator and the elevator door is like as you're walking up. It's like going. Yeah

267
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
It just keeps hitting

268
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
And he's losing a hit point every time

269
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,340
He killed John Lee Pettymore

270
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,740
What else can you do it sounds like Clark's winning

271
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Clark won the game. So

272
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,300
This was player versus player the whole time

273
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
You guys knew that right? Yeah

274
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,460
So you go over and you grab this small powerful pistol off of Keith's belt

275
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,780
Or inside his massive cargo shorts rather

276
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,100
Yeah, you drop back down into the water. What are you doing?

277
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,860
You're diving down with this gun still in your whitey-tities drenched from head to toe walking on the catwalk

278
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,740
The image of this is fantastic. I love it, too

279
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,340
I so in my quick explanation, I said I was gonna shoot from the catwalk. Oh, I was trying on the cat

280
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,900
I was trying to avoid the waterlogged gun issue. Gotcha with his powerful gun to maybe help with the extra distance

281
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:38,660
Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Go ahead and roll a roll a sanity check for me

282
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,420
This wasn't to lose sanity. This is just to gauge a

283
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,780
a

284
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,300
Feeling oh my god

285
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:53,420
I pass a 12 on a 15 now's an interesting time to pass a sanity check when it when it doesn't matter

286
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,700
for losing sanity points

287
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:04,820
Yeah, you you fully you look at this gun you say no. No all guns can't fire underwater. I'm sure

288
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
And

289
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:17,180
That's gonna be a boon to you in the future so okay describe what you're doing here

290
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,180
I'm going back to the edge

291
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,980
To the wall and

292
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,640
The sweat is dripping down your balls as you fire making the bitches crawl

293
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
All right, so you ski ski motherfucker

294
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,000
And when you fire the very first time you fire you see a crack

295
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,740
Do you continue to fire? Yes. Yes. Yes, I do

296
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,620
You continue firing?

297
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,500
until a

298
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,780
leak

299
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:06,220
Begins and then all of a sudden you see the spiderweb of cracks

300
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,780
Grow so quickly across this entire

301
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,580
Wall and in one swift movement all the glass

302
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,380
Breaks out and all of this water starts rushing into the room

303
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,740
Where you saw Marvin glass and Rosemary

304
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:40,100
Fuck yeah, you're still standing on this catwalk. What do you do as the water presumably starts lowering because it's being rushed into that room

305
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:46,260
Yeah, can I see better what's happening in that room from where I am? I'm specifically looking to see if

306
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,000
John's body is being swept in with it

307
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,880
And I'm specifically looking to see where Marvin has ended up or is or is ending up or is maybe running

308
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:03,160
I don't know. That's really interesting because when you look down into this next room over as you will you see

309
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Marvin glass and

310
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,480
rosemary

311
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,800
Marvin glass has his hands up and

312
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,560
His desk is still right in front of him. It's at standing height. He doesn't sit at his desk. It's a standing desk

313
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,400
he's trying to be healthy and

314
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,600
He is holding himself

315
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
the desk and

316
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,480
rosemary

317
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,440
Above the water as it's rushing in below him and as the water settles into like us one level

318
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,480
Covering the floor of both of these rooms these very very large rooms

319
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,400
He holds a hand down and then he lowers himself

320
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:50,800
And rosemary on to the top of the water and both of them are standing on the water

321
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,000
You do not see the body of John lee petting more

322
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Roll stealth for me. Whoa. Whoa. Okay first roll sanity. Let's go ahead and do that. Okay

323
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I fail the sanity a

324
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,440
35 on a 15. All right, you're gonna lose to sanity. All righty. I'm at 13 now

325
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,440
I need you what is your stealth at I'm gonna give you a negative for losing that sanity. I've got a 30 in stealth

326
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,360
Okay. Well, I'm giving you a negative 40. So

327
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
No need to roll here. I guess

328
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,840
Actually, go ahead and roll. Let's see if your dice match and if the dice match no matter what it's a critical fail

329
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,680
Oh boy

330
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
The dice do not match

331
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:44,320
It's a 49. It's a regular fail as Marvin glass whips his head up and makes direct eye contact

332
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
with you

333
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
I hurt my side though

334
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
my rib hit my

335
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Oh

336
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,280
Something something feels bad. That's a heck of a scream. Oh god, you ruptured your appendix

337
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,680
Heartbreaking I need you to roll power for me

338
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,920
Okay, okay, it's a contest, okay

339
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,200
God I pass but it's really low I pass with a six

340
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,800
He

341
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,840
Actually passed with a nine nice Wow a six and a nine

342
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,880
You feel your entire body sees

343
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,600
you no longer have control and he lifts up his hand and

344
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,880
in one swift movement, like do you remember when you were in the

345
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,740
Cemetery and that creature just moved into position

346
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,160
You do that and all of a sudden you are standing in front of Marvin glass

347
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,820
You're standing on the water and you are standing on

348
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:05,220
The water I can feel my weight in my shoes and standing on it. Yes, you can. Oh my god, that's cool

349
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,540
I need you to roll another sanity check for me

350
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,900
Because

351
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:17,620
You just changed locations so quickly fail 80. Oh fuck. It's a fail above my power

352
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:25,140
85 what do you want to do here Clark as a god who is standing on water now?

353
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,140
Who is now standing on water?

354
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:35,160
If he's still got me held I can't do anything but that for for describing what's going on in inside Clark's head

355
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,300
he would we he'd be freaking the fuck out and

356
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,340
wanting to

357
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,620
Wanting to rip Marvin in the limb from limb. He would be

358
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,300
He would be fighting with every fiber of his body to get out of the hole that whatever Marvin has on him and

359
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:56,340
Shoving the small but powerful pistol into his fucking mouth. Yeah, it looks really sad because you can't do any of that

360
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:02,060
Yeah, we can see on your face how badly you want to so as far as these disorders go

361
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:09,540
I mean that would probably like it would be fucking up his brain from the inside. Yes, I would be I would be melting in

362
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,580
Inward to not be able to express what I'm feeling right now

363
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,100
All right, well, uh, we'll stop there for now I'm gonna go grab Luke oh shit

364
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,980
Luke yes, Keith Vigno is unconscious. Yeah, I

365
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
I just saw some stuff

366
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:48,020
Luke Keith Vigna's eyes open and they're staring into black darkness

367
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,060
just pure obsidian

368
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,740
Reflection looking back down at you

369
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,020
And you notice that you have been jammed

370
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,260
halfway into this elevator and the elevators doors are

371
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,860
Closing on you just like close open close open close

372
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,920
Open and you feel on your chest where you got just shredded

373
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,180
earlier

374
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,860
You feel a bit of walking around and you hear

375
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,980
Hey friend, I'm almost done. I'm almost done taking care of you

376
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:34,260
Are you gonna I hope that you're feeling better and you gain four hit points? Oh, yeah

377
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:39,380
I think you were at two hit points when you went is right. So you're up to six hit points now and

378
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:47,580
looking down you see that Peter Dieter is spitting his like weird saliva all over you and then like

379
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,500
Using his little human hands to like close up your wounds

380
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,860
basically a tear

381
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:01,660
Falls down what my right eye and I just say you don't know how good it is to see you

382
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,700
I never thought I'd see you again. I'm glad I could I'm glad I could save you my friend

383
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,260
It's really it's really nice to see a friend again. I was inside of

384
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:18,160
Darkness for a long time and it was really gross in there and I just I hated it. There were all these

385
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:24,680
Are these bad friends, you know, yeah, they kept coming in and they were all very

386
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,320
Very standoffish. How did you get out? I swam there was a there's a lot of water rushing

387
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
And I just went with the current

388
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,000
Okay

389
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,400
Yeah

390
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:41,080
As you as you look down you actually see the water in this room

391
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,480
This room that you've just been trapped in for some time. The water is

392
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,160
Much lower than it was before like

393
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:57,600
40 meters lower. Okay than it was before and looking down you see the wall on the right side is gone

394
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,120
Which is where you think that aquarium class was so it appears to have been

395
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,400
Probably broken it appears to have probably been broken are my eyes adjusting at all

396
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,640
Is it getting a little less?

397
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,700
Can I see a little better in here you can see a little bit better as you're coming to

398
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:24,420
Consciousness and looking down you see that there was a room next to this room at a lower point and it is

399
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,620
Marvin Glasses office

400
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,520
but the floor is made entirely of water and

401
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:37,120
Marvin Glass is standing on this water behind his platform podium like desk and

402
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
across from him is

403
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
Clark Bishop and

404
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,760
Rose Mary do they see me I need you to roll stealth. What's Keith victim percent ten percent?

405
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Not a sneaky guy

406
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:59,880
89 all right, would you like to spend 79 luck to make that a success? No, I can't and I wouldn't anyway

407
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
All right with that

408
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,960
Marvin Glass looks up at you. He is

409
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,680
150 200 yards away, but you feel it when you look down you feel his eyes

410
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
staring into you I want to

411
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,020
crab walk backwards into the

412
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,980
Into the elevator. I should roll power for me

413
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,560
18 on a 50 I rolled a six

414
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,660
Wait, it means you win. Yay

415
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:42,800
All right, so what that means is as you back away you see in front of you Peter Deeter is

416
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:51,280
Lifted off of you and goes flying down below as you scurry back into the elevator and the door closes

417
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,160
Oh, I needed him roll sanity. I know you don't have empathy. No technically I

418
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,680
Mean you do Luke feels bad, right?

419
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,600
But Peter Deeter, I think Keith feels bad because Peter could have helped him

420
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,880
But not I don't feel bad for not an emotional way, right? No, it's because you needed a

421
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,240
Compatriot on you. I needed help. I didn't care about him necessarily. Yeah

422
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:25,120
The door closes and you were in this elevator is there lighter is it also like just pitch black no, there's light in here

423
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,600
It's as you've been in this elevator before and it looks very similar except for now

424
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,600
It is wet because you are soaking wet and it is covered in your blood

425
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Yeah, so with his spit and whatnot has it patched up a little bit of the bleeding. Yes, it has. Okay, cool. I

426
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,720
Stand up. Is there any thing else in here with me or is it just me?

427
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:52,120
It is just you and the elevator begins moving backwards and then up and then across

428
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,960
And then up like that Roald Dahl book just like that

429
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,880
These schnoz berries don't taste anything like schnoz berries. Yeah

430
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,960
So

431
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
the elevator door opens

432
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
into a lab and

433
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Looking around you can see these

434
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:20,920
These clear dividing walls all over the place are covered in like Expo marker with all this crazy math

435
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,400
All over this is not the one that I the lab that I came out of recently. No, it is not

436
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,680
however, you see a familiar face inside this lab that is full of

437
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,640
computers and magnets and all these

438
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:42,720
electrical shit and there's a panel of television screens and there's a window into another room like a

439
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,940
Like almost like an interrogation room like in the police station, but the room that's inside is completely covered in blood

440
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,320
And the person that you see in this room is

441
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,960
the scientist

442
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,240
Dressed in the scientist lady. Yeah. Yeah, and she's dressed in this white lab coat

443
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,220
And she's got the goggles and the hair going all crazy to top her head

444
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,180
She's walking around and she looks up. She sees you she sees your hurt. She's like

445
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,720
Well, what are you doing around here hey, I need your help with something you're Keith, right?

446
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
We just fixed you up

447
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,760
Yeah, I was sent on a mission by by Marvin and well, I came back to report to him what happened

448
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,840
But I got in a little trouble. Oh, I don't I walk into the room

449
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,300
I'm looking for my little fish friend. He was in that room where we fixed you up earlier

450
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,600
He was in there, but oh, yeah, but he's not there now

451
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:49,420
So I'm looking for him here in Francis's lab. Have you seen him cute little fella?

452
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,280
well

453
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
the mission Marvin sent me on

454
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,480
Right before he did it. He uh, I think he tried to kill that little fish guy

455
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,480
He sent him into the big aquarium down there. He

456
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,720
somehow he put his fist through the glass and just let him go and

457
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,800
There was some

458
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,960
Much bigger fish in there that I don't know if he he would have made it or not. The scientists face just melts

459
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
into the sad

460
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,280
Placidity oh

461
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,760
Okay, they make sense, but I don't know for sure. I didn't see him get eaten or anything

462
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,320
He might still be swimming around in there. He might have escaped. I don't know. Can I do a human on her? Sure

463
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,240
Yeah, I want to see if she's somebody that I can like trust to

464
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Information that I know, okay

465
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,080
64 and an 80. All right. Yeah, she is

466
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,040
She's really hurt by this to the point to where this is like crushing information

467
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,200
I thought maybe you wanted to hurt him or something

468
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,400
But I just got hurt up in a I was in a room over the over the water

469
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,840
The aquarium or whatever is and yeah of the torch

470
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,880
Yeah, I was in the torture chamber and I've gotten to a little skiff and I was hurt

471
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
I was I got knocked out and I was a plea and

472
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:14,040
With one of them prisoners. No one of the one of those fish men. I don't know why they were attacking me, but they did

473
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,400
No, no, no, well, there's no way my boys would ever do well and I just show her

474
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,360
you know the wounds that I have I'm like one of them did this and well

475
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,120
Your little fish friend. I'm a nicknamed him Peter. I woke up to him

476
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,600
Helping me out. I was about to die I think and he he healed me up real good

477
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,240
But right before I got in the elevator, he got somehow got thrown off

478
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,400
He might have got thrown down with Marvin Oh

479
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,360
where

480
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:52,440
Wait, how did he get to Marvin's office? There's not an entrance that well I saw him

481
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,480
There's a lot less water in that aquarium

482
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,400
now when I when I got knocked out it was almost up to where I was in the catwalk and

483
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,760
Now there it's about you know hundreds of feet lower than it is now Oh

484
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Hundreds of well eat I

485
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,560
Don't know. I was dark in there. It was a lot less water down in there

486
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:18,800
I could see it was Marvin standing with a couple other people. Oh the the water flooded Marvin's office

487
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,600
I guess if that's where Marvin hangs out at that's all I that's all I saw

488
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:28,640
But was it if you think that he might be in the right when you walked in? Yeah. Oh, no

489
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,080
I gotta get down there then. Oh, well, can I come with you? I saw I think I might have seen a I

490
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,480
Don't know it's a if it's a friend or an enemy, but somebody that I recognize too. Yeah, I

491
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:48,340
Absolutely. Let's go down there. Do you want to do anything before you leave? I would like to search the room. Yeah. All right

492
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Go ahead and roll search for me

493
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Oh

494
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,480
38 on a 40 awesome. So as you're explaining all this and you guys are having this conversation

495
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,280
you're looking around this room and

496
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,880
Noting everything that is around you find all these

497
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,880
VHS tapes lined up right next to the panel of screens next to a VHS player and

498
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:20,040
you can see that this is footage you're guessing from the room that is covered in blood and

499
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,840
When you're looking around at the math that it's all over these boards you would notice that is Francis's handwriting

500
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,040
Hey before we leave what what went on in that room? Oh

501
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:39,000
Yeah, and now this is where what Francis's job. I'll just tell you later. I want to

502
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:46,120
Swipe one of the VHS tapes and put it. Oh, I can show you that later if you want

503
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,400
You probably shouldn't take it with you I guess we could pop it in right now if you're there

504
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,240
I would like to see it with my own eyes. Oh

505
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,520
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be far better. Just seeing your face. Watch this

506
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,200
So you put in this VHS tape and it's static on the

507
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:14,000
screens in front of you and then you see it's security footage from the corner of this room and it's covered in blood and

508
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,460
In the room there's a desk a

509
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,920
Table and behind the table. There's a person standing and it's a

510
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,800
it's a young man, and he is rail thin absolutely malnourished and

511
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,660
Does it remind me of like a one of the cage fighting kids?

512
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:40,600
Absolutely reminds you of one of the cage fighting kids and this kid reaches out in front and in front of him on the desk

513
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,480
There is a small metal sphere

514
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
and when

515
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,940
He reaches out and grabs onto the sphere

516
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,840
You see immediately

517
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,320
multiple shiny limbs extend from this small metal sphere and

518
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,080
Slam into the walls on either side

519
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,320
giving it the leverage it needs to fling itself out of the hand of this young boy and

520
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
up on top

521
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:17,880
One of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of his neck and another snaps his head forward

522
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,440
You can see a fracture as the third metal tendril reaches in

523
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,440
Gripping the top of this young boy's spine

524
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,920
Where it meets his head and it rips his entire

525
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,120
Spinal cord out of his body in one swift motion and then it forces itself

526
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,880
into the hole that it made

527
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,120
and then all of a sudden

528
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:47,160
The boy just starts running and slamming his head into the wall

529
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,680
Repeatedly until he falls to the ground bleeding all over the room

530
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:04,840
The scientist is laughing as she's watching you watch this. I need you to roll sanity for me. I don't think so

531
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:11,520
Yeah, maybe the sanity is going to be for the the science fiction nature of right

532
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,080
You just saw I don't I mine is really low

533
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,060
Yeah, I rolled a 43 on 8 so alright

534
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:25,620
You are going to lose to sanity taking you down to 6 sanity. Hold on

535
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:32,200
So I got to my breaking point the last time that's why oh wait, that's why you have the way I have that

536
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,240
I don't think I ever changed what my next breaking point was. You don't have one. I'm joking

537
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,680
Yeah, your next your next breaking point will be zero in which case you lose your mind completely

538
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,240
Cool, cool

539
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,480
That'll be fun. Yeah, super fun

540
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:54,640
So I think Keith, you know not too much bothered by the violent aspect of it

541
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,480
But seeing that metal ball turn into some sort of weird

542
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,160
Silver monster thing and seeing that happen and

543
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,420
I asked her I'm like, is this what is on all of these videotapes? Oh, yeah

544
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,720
We're trying to figure out what's the deal with the metal balls?

545
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:20,200
Is that so every time you is any time somebody touches one of those metal balls that happens but she nods her head and her hair

546
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Frantically fucks the top. I've

547
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,340
I've seen one of these before and I've seen somebody touch it and that doesn't happen you did what now you saw what?

548
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,400
I've seen one of those before and well who had it? Where was it from?

549
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,760
We can get into it later after we go rescue your fish friend. Let's talk while we walk

550
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:45,600
All right. Okay, you guys start talking and walking. So you tell me you saw one in Spears. We found it in a

551
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,640
Fucked up head of a body which makes me

552
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,340
Keith in his mind is like oh fuck, you know like

553
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,140
yeah, we got it out and we handled it and

554
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,740
Nothing happened to it. Oh

555
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:08,060
You touched the ball. No, I didn't but who do you well one of my fellow officers?

556
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:15,480
Went back before all this shit went down. I was a police officer. I probably yeah, I'm not anymore

557
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,480
I don't I don't guess but

558
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,540
yeah, he had it on him and he touched it we had another one too and

559
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,380
we had a

560
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,180
Well, this might be too much information, but fuck it

561
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:36,420
Been a weird weird week. We have a bag that if you put these these silver balls in there, they disappear

562
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:42,780
They do what now they disappear you put it in the bag and then there's nothing in it after that is

563
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,040
Remarkable and it doesn't make sense. Where do you find these they're

564
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,640
Let's go ahead and just and that elevator door that you're in opens up and you are looking at the hallway that leads to

565
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,240
Marvin Glasses office and

566
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,120
You walk down to the end of the hallway

567
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,400
there's a 10 by 10 slab of black marble an

568
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,560
enormous and strange door that slowly slides open as you approach and

569
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:20,240
As it slides open Keith gets a weird shiver down his neck because he remembers the last time he was here you

570
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:26,080
Remember looking down at this room earlier and she says wait a second

571
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,800
There was water and as she's saying that water just starts

572
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:37,880
Exploding out of this door and begins filling up the hallway that you were in needed a role in athletics check to swim

573
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,880
Oh

574
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,480
All right

575
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,560
Joe Clark Bishop is

576
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,700
standing in front of Marvin Glass unable to move and the first thing that he says is

577
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:15,280
Visitors and then he holds up his hand and he pulls up out of the water below you

578
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,800
Keith Vigna and

579
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:24,280
The scientist the woman in the white lab coat and the goggles and the foppish hair

580
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,540
That's the classic mad scientist the classic mad scientist and they both immediately

581
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:37,320
Come out of the water. They're drenched and then all of a sudden they're both standing there next to you as well when you both

582
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,560
Look around you see on this desk on this like platform

583
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
Desk in front of you

584
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,320
He has sitting

585
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,320
the very strange camera

586
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,320
the very strange gun and

587
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,520
a silver sphere

588
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,040
that is on a little platform and

589
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
in his hand

590
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:07,320
It's a picture and you recognize it as one of the Polaroid pictures that would come out of this strange camera

591
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,240
and he holds it up to the two of you and

592
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,640
Looking at this picture you see in this darkness

593
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:21,340
This world of darkness that you've seen before with the ground made of light coming up

594
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,520
you see

595
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:32,680
John Lee Pettymore in the body of Kevin Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop and he says

596
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,480
Tell me

597
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,960
What you know about this?

598
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
I

599
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,840
Keith literally does what I just did and his

600
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:54,080
Mouth agape jaw dropped the same. I can't I don't like

601
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,320
Oh

602
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Try

603
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,640
Try

604
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,320
You
