1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Well, well, well, hello there once again.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,200
Fancy catching you here at this place we call the Radio Waves.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,080
Come on in and have yourself a seat.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,240
Stay a while, listen to me, Wolf the Dog.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:27,280
Broadcast from 694.2 PTBP, the greatest radio station ever by galactic mile.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,440
That's like a country mile, but for space.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,080
Speaking of great things, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach,

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,960
out in Ventura County, California, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
Hey, listener, what a fine idea, hmm?

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,040
Just a little tweet to tell your friends that you're the kind of freak

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,520
that don't shy away from the horrors of at Pretending Pod.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,360
Sounds pretty cool to me, thanks Zach from Ventura County, California.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,640
Zach writes,

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,240
Hey Wolf, love you and everyone on the show.

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,360
For anyone listening in SoCal looking for their own furry critter companion,

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,400
check out the Ventura County Animal Shelter.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,200
They got dogs, cats, rabbits, and all manner of cute cuddly critters looking for homes.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,960
No unnatural horrors, just members of the coalition you haven't met yet.

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,120
You never know when you'll need a friend to tell you to hide in the creek.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,040
Thank you for all your hard work.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,760
Can't wait to see what's next in season two.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,360
Well, thanks for writing in, Zach, about these dang good animals.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,560
I share a special bond with all creatures of all dimensions,

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,360
and a cool name, Zach, if it's even a real name.

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,880
I don't know a single human being named Zach.

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Zach is a fake name invented by the Illuminati.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,280
If you know anyone named Zach, report them to the agency.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
Do not approach a Zach.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,600
Do not lock eyes with any of them.

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,920
They do not exist in this space.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
They are from elsewhere that does not exist.

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,400
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how,

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,880
tag at pretending pod on the internet.

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,120
All of our links are in the show notes.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
And if you really like this show, like you like like this show,

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,400
and you want to show it by showering us with $6 and 66 in coins,

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,360
mostly dimes, at least one penny,

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
you'll be pleased to know that one of those links down there in the show notes

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,000
is to our Patreon at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,920
That money buys Papa Wolf the special grease.

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,480
This month, you'll get to hear the PTBP boys break down some mistakes

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,320
that were edited out of their recent run of control copy.

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,840
In a Patreon exclusive bonus episode that Zach,

44
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,560
not a real name, is calling how to be a bad GM.

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
You won't want to miss this one.

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
It's over an hour of laughing at that dumb ass Zach's mistakes

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,480
while he desperately tries to learn how to do better next time.

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,880
But if hyperbolic headlines aren't your thing, don't worry.

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,480
It's time for the news.

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,240
Last time, Dr. Rusty Hooch, the never missed scientist.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,400
Dr. Olivia Miller, the sad single mom surgeon.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,800
Doreen Maureen, the iPad scrolling Pinterest lady

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,400
and the refrigerated pocket having basic training dropout, the Chuckster.

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,320
They went to a corrugated metal hunting cabin in the middle of the Arkansas woods,

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:55,200
posing as Dr. Ann Falsom, the Bigfoot scientist and friend to B-U-S-H

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,080
in order to retrieve the corpse of an unnatural creature.

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,680
However, when Dr. Ann Falsom and her team

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,640
entered the headquarters of Bigfoot underground,

59
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,160
search and hunt, the air was sucked out of the room.

60
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,960
Bleeding out on a tarp on a pool table was not the corpse of any sort of Bigfoot,

61
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,800
but rather it was the bruised and bullet-riddled body of a 12-year-old boy.

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,480
And as Carl Lambert growled in confusion, it became clear to everyone else

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,040
that this dead boy on the table was somehow Michael Lambert,

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
Carl's brother who weren't missing over 30 years ago.

65
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
Something about that math just don't add up.

66
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,120
But that's family for you, always complex, emotional and time-bending.

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,680
Here's a brand new track that hits that same familial trinity.

68
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,240
It's Molly Healy with Circles.

69
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Searing star, deafening heat, you don't know why you found it.

70
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:31,040
In this fate as your widest portion, you'd better learn how to keep it.

71
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,440
I don't know how old you guys are.

72
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,000
You strike me roughly my age, but I don't know.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
I don't want to assume.

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
How old are you guys?

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,480
Almost 30.

76
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,360
Sub 30?

77
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,520
Yeah, we're about to turn 30.

78
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,800
And then Allie's 19.

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,480
I'm so, I'm 24.

80
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,200
I'm the baby.

81
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,040
Well, I mean, I'm happy then that you, because you recently came out of the closet, right?

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,960
So, uh, because I was like, if you're over 30, I'm like, oh man, what a,

83
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,440
so many years you, you lost out on pussy.

84
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,800
How much pussy would you have gotten in homeschool?

85
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,000
Actually a lot.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
They're all gay.

87
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,160
Amazing.

88
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
I think Allie's pussy game's strong.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
It sounded better coming out of her mouth than mine.

90
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,280
Let's talk about your characters and what situation they are currently in.

91
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,920
I think things ended interestingly.

92
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,920
So I'd like to dive into each of your minds for a quick moment.

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,480
As you've lost either one sanity for three of you or five sanity for the Chuckster.

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
Is there anything going on in the Chuckster's mind

95
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,720
other than just cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

96
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,800
As you are looking at this, uh, I assume that the, the flood of chemicals to your brain

97
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,960
that is just shutting you down right now is enough to make it hard to, uh, to assess the

98
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,680
situation.

99
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,160
But I just want to know what's going on in that, in that little fucking pea brain.

100
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,720
I think, uh, the Chuckster has always had the ability to like, I don't know, think everything's

101
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,120
chill.

102
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
Everything's fine.

103
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,360
Like even when bad things happen, like getting kicked out of basic training, he's just like,

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,480
it's cool, crack a brew and move on with my life and it's all good and everything's happy.

105
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,200
But this is the first time where he's like faced with his own mortality, that something

106
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,960
bad could actually happen to him.

107
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,280
And he does have a very close relationship with his parents, but he has been lying to

108
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,120
them because he wants them to be proud of his accomplishments.

109
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,560
And he's feeling this, I might not measure up and this might be the end and maybe I need

110
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
to take things more seriously.

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,800
Damn.

112
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,160
That's like really internal.

113
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,880
I was just like, yo, what happened to the Bigfoot?

114
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,640
And you're like, I have to change my life.

115
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,320
I think I'm going to start, uh, doing yoga.

116
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,920
I think that's what he's thinking about.

117
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,280
I got to start, I'm going to start washing my vegetables before I eat them.

118
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,800
Because maybe they have vegetables.

119
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,440
Yeah, that's true.

120
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,920
Maybe I need to figure out what vegetables are.

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,160
What's going through Dr. Olivia Miller's mind?

122
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,960
Normally, I think she would, um, be able to separate her professionality with her emotions,

123
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,080
like, because she's seen so many, so many dead bodies in her life.

124
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,280
And also, you know, you know, people coming in from accidents and gnarly shit like that.

125
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,680
Uh, so I think that's why she didn't lose all of her sanity, like Chuck Steere.

126
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,560
Coming from when she had that scene with her daughter, it's always rough to see a child.

127
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,000
It pulls at her heart string a little bit more so.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,160
And also in this way, uh, but also knowing what's going on in the world, having a sense

129
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,440
of the unnatural and the weird occult thinking it's coming for children.

130
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,520
I think she's only been exposed so far to adults having gone through these terrible things.

131
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,440
And so now, uh, faced with a child, it's unsettling to her.

132
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,920
But I think she taps into her professionality immediately and will try to assess the situation.

133
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Notice that Carl is reacting the way he's reacting, so he did not know.

134
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:45,680
Um, and she will, yeah, she will slowly try to approach the corpse

135
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
and make a medical assessment of it.

136
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,120
Yeah, totally.

137
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,560
I think Doreen is kind of in the weird mix of just like going back and forth

138
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
between feeling like completely sick because it's a child and she's been

139
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,600
haunted by these little metal melting children.

140
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:10,080
But at the same time, there's like a weird wrong comfort because she is like an agent

141
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:18,880
and has dealt with like murder before this almost feels like routine routine to her.

142
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,520
I know.

143
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,240
But I think that's part of the reason why she lost less sanity.

144
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
Another day in the office.

145
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,600
Yeah.

146
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
She's like good at compartmentalizing.

147
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,560
Yeah.

148
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,440
So does she like spring to action type of person or?

149
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,840
She'd probably be the first one to move forward.

150
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,400
Yeah.

151
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,040
What would even like, what is her move?

152
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,440
Check this out.

153
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,360
I know that you're not an FBI agent.

154
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,160
And I know that we don't always know what the proper like move is.

155
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,840
You know, when you're playing someone who just has a completely different job in life

156
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,200
than we do, it's role playing.

157
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
But you know, what would be Doreen's next move?

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
There's a body.

159
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
Nobody touch it.

160
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
Trying to find evidence.

161
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,160
Rusty over here should take this moment to like analyze the body.

162
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,960
Maybe me too.

163
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,520
Sure.

164
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:16,000
And, and Dr. Miller, of course, surgeon, you guys have like a good team for, for analyzing

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
the situation for sure.

166
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,040
I think it's interesting because Doreen, I would imagine is normally trying to figure

167
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,160
out who killed the body.

168
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,640
Right.

169
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,720
But in this case, you know, you know, it's pretty obvious, you know.

170
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,120
But I think the question right now is how did this body get here when did it, is this

171
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
morphed from something else or like, did something put this here?

172
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,520
Totally.

173
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah.

174
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Rusty, I think she's pretty almost in a twisted way, like finally paying attention.

175
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,760
Like she's interested now.

176
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,400
Like she's been a little preoccupied with her personal life.

177
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,200
She's pretty selfish and private and she's been pretty like annoyed by her fellow agent.

178
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
So she hasn't really been giving a shit.

179
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,240
And it's very one-to-one with Ali's experience so far in the game.

180
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
I was very annoyed by my fellow agents.

181
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,280
Didn't really give a shit.

182
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,760
But now that there's a dead body, I'm pretty stoked.

183
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,280
Well, and like, cause her experiences with the unnatural occurrences were like very impersonal

184
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,080
because she was so far removed from everything else.

185
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,520
So everyone else had a more like personal hands-on experience.

186
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,640
So now that she's seeing this body, she's like kind of finally like taking it seriously

187
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,840
and is actually like interested and she needs to be interested in something to do her job well.

188
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,360
Is she thinking like, I see my next Nobel prize.

189
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,440
Exactly.

190
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I think like probably for everyone, the Delta green part of your brain

191
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,960
in the back of your brain is saying, where's the evidence?

192
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,160
How do we destroy it and make sure this doesn't get out?

193
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,400
And finally, there is a certain amount of evidence

194
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,840
that lives inside the brains of witnesses, right?

195
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,960
So you do know that Jerome Dyer is another Delta green agent.

196
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:07,280
It's fine if he knows, but there are two civilians in this room right now, Carl Lambert,

197
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,480
crying for Michael, who you remember to be the name of his younger brother who went missing

198
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,760
almost 30 years ago, but who is still a 12 year old corpse on this table right now.

199
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,080
And then you have Janice Ruth, who is also in this room.

200
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:31,600
So I'm going to cut to her real quick as she is going to make a beeline for the front door.

201
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,200
Hell no.

202
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,840
Am I real quick?

203
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,680
Am I pretty incapacitated?

204
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,320
Oh yeah.

205
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,720
Okay.

206
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,040
Yeah.

207
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,520
Sorry.

208
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,640
Ellie, you said Dr. Miller was going to be really interested in going up to the body,

209
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,600
but as soon as Janice Ruth starts making a move, you reacted immediately.

210
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,360
So let's go to you.

211
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,280
Do you step into her way or?

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,040
The thing is I want to, Ellie, but I don't know if my character would be,

213
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,960
have that sort of role in her behavior because she's unbelievably clumsy and

214
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,360
like my dex is not great.

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,360
So I feel like it would be one of those like situations where I'm like somebody stop her,

216
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,680
but I would try to motion for her if I can, like I can roll for it.

217
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,560
I mean, who knows?

218
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:20,960
I don't know.

219
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,760
Alertness.

220
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
Would that be a thing or?

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,280
Yeah.

222
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,840
Let's actually just have all three of you who've succeeded on your sanity checks.

223
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:34,960
If you could all roll alertness and actually Lindsey is Doreen's alertness or search higher.

224
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,840
I succeed.

225
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,480
Okay, great.

226
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,680
I got a little roll.

227
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,480
I got a 12.

228
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
Oh, nice.

229
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
I got a 97 on a 20.

230
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,800
My alertness is higher than my search.

231
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,760
And what did you roll?

232
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,960
Oh, I sorry.

233
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,680
I haven't rolled yet.

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,480
74 on a 70.

235
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:56,880
Okay.

236
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,480
So Ellie, I'm going to give you the option since you're the only one who succeeded.

237
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,920
Are you, uh, are you going to make a move toward the door to stop Janice Ruth before

238
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,040
she goes out or are you going to immediately check out the body?

239
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,080
Miller wants to check out the body, but she is the body, but she is a super, super, she's

240
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,800
cool right now.

241
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,080
She's cool headed, level headed.

242
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,680
So she knows exactly what's going on.

243
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Her perception is on point.

244
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,560
So she just straight up goes to, uh, she catches Ruth by the arm.

245
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,520
Oh, there's no need.

246
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,120
There's no need to panic.

247
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,200
No, are you kidding me?

248
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,700
Panic?

249
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,860
Panicking.

250
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,960
You seem to have been through a lot.

251
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,920
This happens a lot.

252
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:47,280
And she is going to lie and she's going to try to convince Ruth that she is hallucinating.

253
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,320
She's been hallucinating, uh, had some sort of head trauma.

254
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,880
She's going to try to do like a medical, do the power of suggestion of like, how have

255
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,920
you been sleeping lately?

256
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,160
Have you had any head trauma?

257
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,720
All right.

258
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,840
Uh, do you have psychotherapy?

259
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,240
Yes.

260
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,800
Oh, awesome.

261
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,400
Go ahead and roll psychotherapy.

262
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,800
Uh, not super high.

263
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,240
41 for psychotherapy.

264
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,600
Where's my psychotherapy?

265
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,680
Where the fuck is my fucking psychotherapy?

266
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,720
Uh, no, um, I have nevermind.

267
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,840
Uh, no, I failed.

268
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,240
I know what it was.

269
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,120
I know what it was.

270
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,080
I know what it is.

271
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,580
No.

272
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,000
Calm down.

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,640
Calm down.

274
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,760
I just, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

275
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
Um, I'm going to, yeah.

276
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,720
She's going to need to be restrained.

277
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:36,960
Yeah.

278
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,360
All right.

279
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,160
So, uh, can I punch her in the face?

280
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,640
Jesus.

281
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,080
Can I just, can I try and restart?

282
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,280
I probably have.

283
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,520
Yeah.

284
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,400
I think at this point, if, uh, the other two who have succeeded on their sanity checks

285
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,160
want to, want to move in to help.

286
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,480
Yeah.

287
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,520
I think I probably have things to help restrain.

288
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,480
Medical doctor, do you have an inhaler in your bag?

289
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,320
I didn't take one out last week, but, uh, do I, Zach, please?

290
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,800
Always.

291
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,960
I, I like to think that everyone has everything.

292
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,480
Everyone's very well prepared.

293
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
You wouldn't be in Delta Green if you weren't.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,400
Oh, what's this?

295
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,160
A million dollars in my pocket.

296
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,680
Okay.

297
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,280
I'm gonna shove the inhaler in her and try to shove a inhaler in her mouth.

298
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,680
So as Dr. Hooch and Doreen Marine kind of grab either side of this woman and set her

299
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,720
down onto the ground, still with the echo of cool, cool, cool, cool.

300
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,160
She's in the background.

301
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Uh, Dr. Miller pulls out an inhaler, helps Janice Ruth with.

302
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:51,840
Uh, you look over and you see Jerome Dyer.

303
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
Agent Dyer is, uh, is comforting.

304
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,400
Carl Lambert, who is now on his knees, kind of crawled up toward the pool table.

305
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,920
He's got his elbows on the pool table and his hands flat.

306
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,200
Chin is on his hands and he's just crying and staring at the face.

307
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,680
You know, kind of from the side, uh, on this corpse of this, again, just completely bruised

308
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,600
every single part of the skin all the way down is blue and black and purple with bruising.

309
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,520
And there's just slug hole after slug hole with blood just pouring out and pooling on

310
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
this tarp below.

311
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:36,560
And Jerome Dyer is just comforting Carl as best he can as Carl is just weeping and moaning.

312
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,840
This was a separate room, right?

313
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,360
Basically the setup of this room is you walk in the front door on your right, there's a

314
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,160
bathroom.

315
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,480
There's not like a door to the bathroom.

316
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,200
There's just a stall door with a toilet in the stall with a sink next to it.

317
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,600
That's all still open in this room.

318
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,120
There's a skee-ball table right next to our skee-ball, you know, uh, not table machine,

319
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,160
machine, skee-ball machine right next to the toilet.

320
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,480
And, um, uh, and then, you know, uh, in the middle of the room is this pool table with

321
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,360
the tarp on it where this boy's body is laying lifeless in the corner of the room.

322
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:23,280
There's some couches and a TV, and then all hanging on the walls is equipment for both

323
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,080
Bigfoot hunting and for YouTube video making the two most important things in life.

324
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,960
And you also would notice that, uh, there's some like work desks and stuff where they've

325
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,280
got their, uh, computer set up.

326
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,720
Jerome Dyer's looking back at one of the computers and he pulls out his phone and looks at the

327
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,360
time and, and then, and that doesn't matter.

328
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,320
I was just, I just kept talking for some reason.

329
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,600
Okay, so, uh, just like, and then this happens, and then this happens.

330
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,720
Dr. Millie would, uh, tries to get the attention of, uh, Dr. Rusty Hooch or Dr. Falsom.

331
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,400
Pretend name is right now and be like, we should try to look at the body, but we need

332
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
to calm these two assholes down first.

333
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,200
Um, but she doesn't say that she tries to do it with her eyebrows.

334
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,700
Exactly.

335
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,440
Can I go out to the lab and cook something up to knock them out?

336
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
Oh yeah, absolutely.

337
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:21,920
Okay.

338
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:28,640
So I see Dr. Miller looking at me and I just kind of sneak out the back while you two are

339
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,840
holding her down.

340
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,880
As Dr. Miller can kind of go look at the body, Doreen is still with Janice Ruth and

341
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,560
Janice looks up at you and she's like, are you going to help?

342
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,240
What's happening?

343
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,400
Honey, I got my iPad out in the car.

344
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,360
Let me just go get it.

345
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
It'll calm you down.

346
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,240
It calms me down every night.

347
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,440
Oh no, no, I need you.

348
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,880
I need you right here.

349
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,440
All right.

350
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,940
Okay.

351
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,600
What do we do?

352
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,560
I pull out my personal cell phone and I pull up Pinterest.

353
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,060
Okay.

354
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,060
What do we do?

355
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,580
Just look at the pretty pictures, honey.

356
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,780
Just look at the pretty pictures.

357
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,980
This is literally like you're at the zoo, like on one side of the glass, like showing

358
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,180
the chimpanzee, like pictures of other chimpanzees.

359
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,100
And they're like telling you like, oh, nice.

360
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,340
Okay.

361
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,540
You can swipe to the next one.

362
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,820
I love that video, but this is Janice Ruth's version.

363
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,500
She's like, that's nice.

364
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,540
Let's go to the next one.

365
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,140
Oh, thank you.

366
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,020
That's a nice couch.

367
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,480
Oh God.

368
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,820
What is, is it like interior design porn?

369
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,980
I'm showing her videos of cooking.

370
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,220
I'm showing her like TikTok cooking videos and then like, and then interior design.

371
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,460
Those like tiny cooking videos where everything's super small and she's like,

372
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,500
everything's made of felt.

373
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,620
She's like, how did they make a spatula so small?

374
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,020
She like actually gets upset again because she doesn't understand.

375
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,180
While she's, while, uh, Janice Ruth is distracted.

376
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,620
Can I come back in with the shit?

377
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,220
But I need to approach Dr.

378
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,260
Miller first.

379
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:02,580
Rural pharmacy for what got, what got up, what you made for what happened in the lab.

380
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,940
55 on an 80.

381
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,460
That is a critical success.

382
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,700
Oh my gosh.

383
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,220
You're going to knock her out forever.

384
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,660
Oh my gosh.

385
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,620
You can fucking kill her.

386
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,500
Perfect because it's a critical success.

387
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,660
You can, uh, and because we made so many jokes about potions,

388
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,180
uh, you can give this if, I mean, if they'll take it right.

389
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,820
You have a liquid that is going to be clear.

390
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,780
It is going to be unscented.

391
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,580
It will have no taste and you cannot see it and they will only wake up when you, um,

392
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,780
is it the yin yang twins who said, snap your fingers?

393
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,280
Yeah.

394
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:55,140
Wait, can it be in a tiny, tiny cauldron and then maybe have some like smoke coming out of it?

395
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:05,940
Sometimes when you interject, it's useful all the time.

396
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,300
No, but it's as tiny as the tiny cooking videos, so she's intrigued.

397
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,540
Yeah.

398
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,980
She actually really likes it.

399
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,020
My God.

400
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,620
All right.

401
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:22,980
So I, um, I have this tiny, tiny culture in my hand, but I, I approached Dr.

402
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,500
Miller while Janice Ruth is being distracted with tiny cooking videos.

403
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,660
All right, listen, I've got something and I'm talking low so I can use my, my normal voice.

404
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,940
I'm not in character right now.

405
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,900
I've got something that'll knock these fuckers out, but as soon as I give it to him,

406
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,660
we're not going to be able to ask him a damn thing.

407
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,940
So do I need to wait a second?

408
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,740
What do I do?

409
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,460
That's a good point.

410
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,580
Like it, it seems like, um, our friend here has been able to calm her down somewhat.

411
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,180
Let's try to talk to them before.

412
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,140
And if they become aggravated again, let's use your little cauldron.

413
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,340
All right, we're going to need a word.

414
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,700
Banana.

415
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,700
But banana, got it.

416
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,540
That's my safety word.

417
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,940
You say banana, those fuckers knocked out immediately.

418
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,300
Exactly.

419
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,700
Perfect.

420
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,260
Thank you.

421
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,900
Thank you.

422
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,540
Good job.

423
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,500
Good thinking there.

424
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,580
She gives like a nod of approval to, uh, to Rusty.

425
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:21,300
And then I go and I hide my, I hide my, Rusty comes immediately.

426
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,340
Then I hide my tiny cauldrons.

427
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,380
Where do you hide it?

428
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,660
I put it in the corner.

429
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,980
Labeled tiny cauldron.

430
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:42,740
The Chuckster is coming out of his, uh, of his temp insane temp insane.

431
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,580
So it started out like really high.

432
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,620
Cool, cool, cool.

433
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,780
And as he comes back, it's like, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,

434
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,300
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

435
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,860
And then that's him just being normal.

436
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,060
Okay.

437
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,420
You're looking at this situation.

438
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:06,500
Currently we have Doreen Marine is showing Pinterest videos to Janice Ruth

439
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,340
and keeping her calm in the corner.

440
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,340
I'm picturing her in the corner, like up against the bathroom stall door.

441
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:19,380
It's literally the exact same shot of Doreen, like over someone and like a bathroom stall.

442
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,460
But this time she's helping as opposed to slamming a teenager into the toilet.

443
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:31,140
Dr. Rusty Hooch is carefully placing a tiny cauldron into the corner for safekeeping.

444
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:37,700
And, um, Dr. Olivia Miller is heading straight to the body to give it a thorough look over

445
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,380
as the Chuckster comes out of the situation and also sees

446
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:49,860
Carl Lambert staring at the body with agent Jerome Dyer kind of stroking his, um, lack of hair.

447
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,220
Can I roll a medicine to see, uh, what I see?

448
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,300
Yes, please roll.

449
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,900
Oh, well, 55 on a 60 actually.

450
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,380
Holy fucking shit, Ellie.

451
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,220
55.

452
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:19,300
So, um, because you critically succeeded mathematically, it just fucking happens all

453
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,780
the time.

454
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,220
Wait, it is.

455
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:21,940
Okay.

456
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,180
So it's, uh, one is a create zero.

457
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,860
One is the critical success.

458
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,540
Um, and then 100 is a critical fail.

459
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,780
So if you've got, that's 11 chances to critical out of a hundred.

460
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,020
So there's an 11% chance, but I feel like it's happening more than 11% of the time.

461
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,420
God is in this house.

462
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,500
No, it's still happening to me, but it's a crit fail.

463
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,020
Okay.

464
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:53,460
So with that being said, I am going to have Lindsay, Allie, Taylor, go ahead and take

465
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,420
off your headphones and get the fuck out of the living room.

466
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,500
So you can't hear me talk to Ellie right now.

467
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,440
What?

468
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,140
This is a game mechanic in the game.

469
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,020
That's so funny.

470
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,380
So Ellie, I like to run closed games.

471
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,980
So, uh, you know, obviously with all the introduction stuff, I think it's fun to let

472
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,780
everyone in on like the character full, like character idea of each person, even

473
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,300
though you meet as strangers and you wouldn't know all that information beforehand.

474
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,660
But once we get into the shit and someone learns a piece of valuable information that

475
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,140
the others wouldn't know, I think it's fun to just give that piece of information to

476
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,140
the person playing the character who knows it.

477
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,260
Okay.

478
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,900
Interesting.

479
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,220
All right.

480
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,740
So I can make a decision later whether I share it or not.

481
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,420
Yeah.

482
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:45,060
And this is kind of a pretty, uh, pivotal moment in the story.

483
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,060
So as Dr.

484
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:55,700
Olivia Miller checks out this body underneath all this bruising, all this black and blue

485
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:06,420
and purple bruising up near the chest of this boy, there seems to be a rash and it's in

486
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,100
the form of a circle.

487
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:14,740
You see the biggest circle first, and it probably goes over the shoulder, under the arm a little

488
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:21,540
bit around the pectoral muscle, over the clavicle, and then back around forming an enormous circle

489
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,900
over the, over the chest, kind of exactly where you would put your hand over your heart

490
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,460
to, uh, you know, swear an oath.

491
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,460
And then you notice a smaller circle just inside that bigger one.

492
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:41,380
And these are just these red rashes and they're thick lines as they get closer to the center.

493
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,620
And you see, it's like a bullseye.

494
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,660
It's like a target.

495
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,460
And in the very middle, you begin to look really closely.

496
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,540
You've got your gloves on, you're all suited up.

497
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:59,540
So you're able to kind of move the skin around and the skin is so wrinkly, like it's been

498
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,580
stretched out and now it's kind of sunken back in.

499
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,860
Like, oh, my doorbell rang.

500
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,500
That's odd.

501
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,220
Oh, perfect.

502
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,940
And, uh, I'm sorry.

503
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,300
I'm going to get that real quick.

504
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,060
This is the worst time to do this.

505
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,660
Sorry about that.

506
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,220
It's my good friend Joe's birthday, uh, in three days.

507
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,900
And that was his birthday present in the mail.

508
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,800
Yay.

509
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,800
Okay.

510
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,260
Back into the most intense thing we've done.

511
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,480
Yeah.

512
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,220
I'm like, I'm like, okay, so it's stretched out.

513
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,780
He's big.

514
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,180
Okay.

515
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:46,100
You notice as you kind of pinch at the center of this bullseye, there's a divot dug out

516
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:54,500
in the skin as if there was something, like if a golf ball were to land on the green,

517
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:01,540
uh, from a high place, then it would make a round spot in the grass.

518
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,820
Like a crater.

519
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,380
Yes.

520
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:10,500
Like a very, very small crater, just a, um, concave skin spot.

521
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,100
But because it's so wrinkly, it's almost like, um, it's almost like if you had an

522
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,140
uninflated balloon that you've taken scissors to just like an edge part of.

523
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:26,980
So there's just a little hole, like a little circle hole there in the skin.

524
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:34,820
And because you critically succeeded out of the corner of your eye, as you're pinching

525
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:50,340
the skin and noticing this little hole, you see something tiny black with countless legs.

526
00:30:51,700 --> 00:31:01,860
Crawling on the ground of the dirty tile floor and this weird impromptu cabin barn thing.

527
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,460
And it looks to your eyes like a tick.

528
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,940
You've never seen a tick like this.

529
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:16,180
It has so many legs all around to where as it's moving, it just kind of looks like it's

530
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,020
floating right above the ground.

531
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,080
Ugh.

532
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,980
Go ahead and roll sanity.

533
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,700
31 on to my current 55.

534
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:26,740
Okay.

535
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,060
You're not going to lose any sanity.

536
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:36,020
You know, from your medical training and experience that a bull's eye rash is actually

537
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,740
a common occurrence in tick bites.

538
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,780
Tick bites.

539
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,740
Tick bites.

540
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,060
Yeah.

541
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,060
I've actually had a fair amount of ticks.

542
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,740
They're common in Sweden.

543
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,060
Yeah.

544
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,380
So, you know, it's always a bad sign when you get like, because you can get that several

545
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,060
weeks after they've stung you and then you have to.

546
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,540
Yeah.

547
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,100
All right.

548
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:00,580
Well, my theory, if we're now doing it secretly, and I had this theory last time when you

549
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:07,780
reveal the body and everyone's reaction is that it's somehow this boy is Bigfoot, right?

550
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,060
But he's morphing back like a werewolf or something.

551
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,020
That's my thing.

552
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,420
Right.

553
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:12,920
Yeah.

554
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,240
But, you know, much more awful way, but I didn't account for the tick.

555
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,320
So now I'm a little, I'm a little interested and curious, but I don't know.

556
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,240
So do I have to tell them or is it up to me?

557
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,360
You don't have to tell them.

558
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,400
You can just describe your actions however you would like, but I'm going to have basically

559
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,440
this will be your moment is your moment of knowledge is going to be your turn here.

560
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:42,680
And then as we, as we bring everyone back in, I'm actually going to move into combat

561
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,360
order and we're going to like, we're in combat rounds.

562
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,660
Okay.

563
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Hello, please come back and record the rest of the day.

564
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,080
Zach, this is such a good, like, you're such a good GM.

565
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,400
Thank you.

566
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,760
Thank you.

567
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,480
Great.

568
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,120
So much fun.

569
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,320
What'd y'all talk about?

570
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,960
Welcome back.

571
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,800
We're moving into combat order.

572
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,960
I would like to know what your dexterity are because we're going to move from whoever

573
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,280
has the highest dexterity down to whoever has the lowest dexterity.

574
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,920
So do you want the score or the times five score?

575
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,560
Either one.

576
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,480
Cause I'll know the difference.

577
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,120
12.

578
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,600
Okay.

579
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,720
12.

580
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,760
Oh shit.

581
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,560
10.

582
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,440
Fine.

583
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:26,940
10.

584
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,120
Damn.

585
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,680
Okay.

586
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,720
So yeah, rock, scissors, paper.

587
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,160
This will be hilarious because Lindsay and Ellie have the delay.

588
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,080
So let's start with Ali and Taylor.

589
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,360
Okay.

590
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,320
Do you do shoot?

591
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,600
Shoot is for losers.

592
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,480
Rock, paper, shoot.

593
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,920
Rock, paper, shoot.

594
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:44,840
All right.

595
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,800
Ali goes first.

596
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,360
Uh, rock, paper, shoot.

597
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,320
This is going to be hilarious.

598
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,440
I'm just going to close my eyes and do it.

599
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,640
All right.

600
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,680
Rock, paper, scissors.

601
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,120
Open your eyes.

602
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,640
Oh, fuck.

603
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,480
All right.

604
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,640
So it is going to go Dr.

605
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,480
Rusty Hooch, then Chuck the Chuckster, then.

606
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,560
Actually, after that experience that I had, uh, where I lost my sanity,

607
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,640
I'm, I'm trying to be more serious.

608
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,040
So I'm like, call me, call me Charles.

609
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,280
Now

610
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:29,880
he says to God inside his own head, he's like, I really say that to yourself.

611
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,400
You're like, you get this together.

612
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,200
Chuckster.

613
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,360
No, get this together.

614
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,080
Charles.

615
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,600
Amazing.

616
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,360


617
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,080
Charles, the serious, very serious boy.

618
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,000
We're going to start with Jerome.

619
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,560
Then we're going to do Dr.

620
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,160
Rusty Hooch, Charles, Charles, Charles.

621
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,440
You can call me Charles T's.

622
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,360
I'll call you just Charles.

623
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,200
Then, uh, then it will be Carl.

624
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,440
And then we'll have Doreen and Miller.

625
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,880
And then I don't know.

626
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm just saying this out loud.

627
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,040
I'm going to cut it from the show.

628
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,720
Oh, so we can say weird stuff.

629
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,520
And I like poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.

630
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,880
And now it's all staying in.

631
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,640
Janice Ruth is going to be last.

632
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,520
So, uh, okay.

633
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,800
So as far as you guys know, everything is the exact same.

634
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,600
When you look over, you can notice that Dr.

635
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,240
Miller is, uh, is pinching at the skin on the chest of this corpse.

636
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,800
She is wearing like a full hazmat suit and gloves at this point, as are

637
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,320
all four of you.

638
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,560
If you forgot about that and your mental image of the scene, throw it back in there.

639
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,760
And so we're going to have Dr.

640
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,680
Hooch kick this thing off.

641
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,280
As you also would see, Dr.

642
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:57,800
Miller is now releasing the skin and begins looking for, uh, something in her

643
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,080
pockets or bag that she has with her.

644
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,800
And it's Dr.

645
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,360
Hooch's turn.

646
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,680
Dr.

647
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,040
Hooch, what do you do?

648
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,280
Okay.

649
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,800
So I run over there because I'm supposed to be the doctor.

650
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,200
Aren't you a scientist?

651
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Yeah, but, uh, and Folsom.

652
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,640
Oh, that's right.

653
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,920
We're still keeping up appearances at this point.

654
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,560
I forgot.

655
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,320
So I put my cauldron down and I quickly remember that I'm supposed to be the

656
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,520
doctor in the situation.

657
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,960
So I run over to Dr.

658
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,760
Miller, put my British accent back on and I loudly say, I loudly say this.

659
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,880
Right.

660
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,320
Let me take a look at the body.

661
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,360
Don't no one touch.

662
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,560
Move aside, move aside.

663
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,040
Which is perfect because she's already moving aside.

664
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,320
It is now Charles's turn.

665
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,920
I don't understand.

666
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,880
Is everything as I saw it last?

667
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,380
Yep.

668
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,400
Okay.

669
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,080
That's kind of the uncomfortable thing about moving into dexterity order in

670
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,200
Delta Green is sometimes you don't know why or why.

671
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,280
Cause a lot of times we'd be in moving in dexterity order when you're in combat

672
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,360
and then like a gunfight or a chase.

673
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,400
So this could be either one of those, but it also could just be me being like,

674
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,560
and now we're moving in dexterity order to make it seem like the tight

675
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,920
intention of the situation.

676
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,160
Okay.

677
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,440
I think that I'm going to use my two months of basic training knowledge.

678
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,640
I'm going to, I'm going to barrel roll over to the door and secure it.

679
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,800
I'm going to secure the place so that no one can escape.

680
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,720
Ocular pat down of the entire place.

681
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,760
You are at the only doors, the entrance and the exit.

682
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,560
Excellent move.

683
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,400
Jerome Dyer is still very much calming down Carl.

684
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,440
As Carl begins, let's see, actually, I'm going to go ahead and roll for Carl's

685
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,320
sanity here.

686
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,680
Carl's eyes begin to turn to anger.

687
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,920
And if anyone were to notice you, you, you're hearing Carl's sobs become more

688
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,720
just like, what the fuck?

689
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,520
Which I'm realizing now would be hard not to notice.

690
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,040
And Janice Ruth is, I'm just okay.

691
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,320
I'm just going to be okay.

692
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,600
I'm just going to be okay.

693
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,400
And I keep rolling really high sanity checks.

694
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,480
And so I'm going to lose my mind again a little bit.

695
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,560
And she looks up at Doreen.

696
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,680
She says, I'm fine now.

697
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,640
And she's going to try to stand up and, uh, and move toward the door that both.

698
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,760
Now Doreen is kind of in the way of, as well as Charles.

699
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,360
Is it my turn?

700
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:32,680
Yeah.

701
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,880
I think for Doreen specifically, she's just really ready to help with the body,

702
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:44,120
but I guess if she's fucking relegated, taking care of old lady on the ground.

703
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,240
She sure did.

704
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,960
I guess for this turn, I'm going to try and convince Janice to not leave the premises.

705
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,840
Yeah, great.

706
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,560
If you want to roll persuade or psychotherapy, which everyone's higher.

707
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,480
I rolled an 86 on a 50.

708
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,160
Damn, not lucky with the rolls.

709
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,840
At least it's not a crit fail.

710
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,040
At least it's not a crit fail.

711
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:19,160
Janice Ruth stands up and is going to move past you.

712
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,560
Now only has Charles between herself and the door.

713
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,400
Dr. Miller, it is your turn.

714
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:32,040
Dr. Miller sees that Janice is on her way to the door and she says with, uh, I'm going

715
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,680
to roll a persuade for this and she's going to say, if you leave, I have reasons to believe

716
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,880
that we're all going to die.

717
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,960
That is a strong persuade.

718
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,680
Uh, it's also weird and crazy, so I'm not going to get, I was, I was like, she deserves

719
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,400
a plus 20 on that until I thought about Janice Ruth in that situation, which is like, what

720
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,480
the fuck are you talking about, dude?

721
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:02,200
Uh, so go ahead and, uh, we'll just go straight up and down and roll that persuade.

722
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,120
Um, 15 on a 40 persuade.

723
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,760
Excellent.

724
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,320
Excellent.

725
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,280
Uh, she turns around, puts her hand behind her back.

726
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,440
Is that a threat?

727
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,320
It's not a threat.

728
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,320
It's a warning and it goes for all of you.

729
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,120
And she looks at the Carl who's crying and, um, and everyone in the room is just like,

730
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,000
nobody leaves.

731
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,720
I have reason to believe that there's something really wrong going on here.

732
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,000
When you look down, you notice that, uh, the floor is just white and tile and there's some

733
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,680
dirt spread around it, but you don't see anything else anymore.

734
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:42,200
Cause you've taken your eyes off the ground and, uh, we're going to head back to the top

735
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,160
of the order with Jerome.

736
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,400
Jerome's like, come on, Carl, it's going to be okay.

737
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,440
It's going to be okay.

738
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:46,840
All right.

739
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,560
Stay with me.

740
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,120
Stay with me.

741
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,560
Like a car that won't start.

742
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,600
And, uh, Charles, what are you doing?

743
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:54,920
Okay.

744
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,720
So I'm feeling very confident with your confidence.

745
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,040
Sorry.

746
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,080
Just to give you a quick rundown, Janice turned her back to you when she turned to talk to

747
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,040
Dr. Miller.

748
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,040
When she put her hand behind her back, you see that she's reaching for a gun that is

749
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,440
in her like waistband.

750
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:12,840
Okay.

751
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,200
And you are literally within arm's reach of both.

752
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,000
You can grab her hand, you can grab her wrist, you can grab her gun, you can punch your butt.

753
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,160
Well, okay.

754
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,280
I think I'll use my, I would like to talk and move at the same time and humans typically

755
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,680
do that.

756
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,720
You can definitely do that.

757
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:27,960
Okay.

758
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,240
You're like, what can I do?

759
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,200
What can I do in this game?

760
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,640
It's kind of two things at once.

761
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:33,880
Yeah.

762
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,480
Talking, talking is always like kind of a free action.

763
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:37,960
Freebie.

764
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,200
Yeah.

765
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,760
Okay.

766
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,560
So I am action wise.

767
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,040
I am using my athletics to reach for the gun.

768
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,360
Okay.

769
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,000
And also I'm going to do like a, I can picture this.

770
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,920
So she's turned around and I'm going to stick my leg between her legs and then wrap it around

771
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,000
one and get her down to a kneeling position.

772
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,280
Okay.

773
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,240
Yeah, that's rad.

774
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,560
Go ahead and roll athletics.

775
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:06,760
This is like a wrestling move or, um, I guess athletics.

776
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,600
I mean, if you want to give me something I have higher in like unarmed combat actually

777
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,720
is probably closer.

778
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,440
That's lower though.

779
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:14,680
Yeah.

780
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,160
Go ahead and roll.

781
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,480
I'm going to go ahead and roll athletics.

782
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,600
You know what?

783
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,240
I'm going to go.

784
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,480
I pass either one 39 on a 40 or on a 50 or a 60.

785
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,800
Whoa.

786
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,400
All right.

787
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,280
The jig is up.

788
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,080
What the fuck is going on here?

789
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,320
I turned to Jerome.

790
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,720
You got to fill us in, bro.

791
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,160
Like this shit's crazy.

792
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,360
Absolutely no idea.

793
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,720
This was a goddamn Bigfoot five minutes ago.

794
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,520
Well then how the fuck did it turn into a little boy?

795
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,040
I'm not a doctor.

796
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,080
And you both just like whip pan turn to the other two.

797
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,560
I think someone should look to see if there is security footage so we can see a transformation.

798
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,600
Did I skip Dr.

799
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,480
Hooch's turn?

800
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,040
Yes.

801
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,840
Allie, you didn't speak up at all.

802
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,560
I thought I went.

803
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,400
I was like, I guess I go after Taylor.

804
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,040
I guess I, I guess I lost rock, paper, scissors.

805
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,400
I forgot I won rock, paper, scissors.

806
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,800
I forgot to, you know, have you go next.

807
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,600
So it's your turn.

808
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:19,960
Okay.

809
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,680
So I, now that things are getting a little more out of hand with these two civilians,

810
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:31,320
I look directly at Doreen and then I glance over at the cauldron in the corner so that

811
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,160
she knows she needs to go get it.

812
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,040
And I'm still like hovering over the body playing Dr.

813
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,760
Anne Folsom.

814
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,360
I'm so sorry.

815
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,880
I, if you could hold, just everyone hold for a moment.

816
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,240
My Pro Tools is not responding and I'm having a heart attack.

817
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,200
Oh, you're doing great.

818
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,600
What do you use your Pro Tools for?

819
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,560
Recording.

820
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,800
Oh, that's bad.

821
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,300
Yeah.

822
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,180
Oh no.

823
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,360
Yep.

824
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,080
I just realized.

825
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,480
Hey guys, it's all still there.

826
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:06,680
It literally did full not responding white screen and then boom, back to fully in motion.

827
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,720
Can you imagine?

828
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,520
Oh my God.

829
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,000
Let's get this man a shot.

830
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,400
I had to rerecord an entire, two entire episodes once.

831
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,620
No.

832
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:26,440
That it was like, it was like a very cool finale, like all the revelations and it's

833
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,760
like gone.

834
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,920
That fucking sucks.

835
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,240
Yeah.

836
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,840
But it actually, the second time around was better because then they could rehearse.

837
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,960
Yeah, of course.

838
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,460
Yep.

839
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,080
Yeah.

840
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,840
We recorded, we rerecorded our first episode because it was the first time we were ever

841
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,200
on mic and we finished and we were like, that sucked.

842
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,640
All right.

843
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:53,800
Let's move on to, well, if I'm being honest, didn't hear a goddamn word you said Allie.

844
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,520
So I'm still doctor who just still hovering over the body playing and fall some playing

845
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,400
doctor, but she looks over her shoulder directly at Doreen and then looks over at the cauldron

846
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,560
to let Doreen know that she needs to go grab that.

847
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:05,800
Yes.

848
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,400
Go ahead and roll alertness for me.

849
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:07,900
Okay.

850
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:09,640
Damn.

851
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,480
Why'd you give me such a low alertness?

852
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,640
Yeah.

853
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,200
Sorry, dude.

854
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,320
Wait.

855
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:13,960
Holy shit.

856
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,520
Is that a great success?

857
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,200
No, 11 would be.

858
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,200
Oh, what does it mean?

859
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,560
It means you passed.

860
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,040
Oh, okay.

861
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,760
I pass.

862
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,400
Congrats.

863
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:23,960
Thank you.

864
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,680
Uh, okay.

865
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,440
Instead of leaving, instead of leaving the room this time, Lindsay and Taylor, just take

866
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,240
off your headphones.

867
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,240
And then if you just like put your fingers in your ears and wiggle them a little bit,

868
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,800
maybe don't make that noise.

869
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,040
Dr.

870
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,680
Hooch.

871
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,080
Yeah.

872
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:50,440
As you look at Doreen, Marine, you see that there is a small tick on the ground that is

873
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:58,440
crawling directly towards the military boots that are planted firmly on the ground in

874
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,480
between Doreen.

875
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,440
I don't know why I'm describing her feet so weird.

876
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,600
It's heading toward her boots.

877
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,520
It's a small tick.

878
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,680
I need you to roll sanity.

879
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:09,480
Okay.

880
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,360
It's just a bug.

881
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,440
You got 71 on a 55.

882
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,280
Oh, it's probably not just a bug.

883
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,720
You're going to lose one sanity.

884
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,480
You've seen ticks.

885
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,520
Ticks don't have that many legs, Dr.

886
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,320
Hooch.

887
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:32,920
This thing basically is floating as a wild amount of legs, but also seemingly a changing

888
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:39,160
amount of legs carries this thing as if it's floating just off the ground directly toward

889
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,800
Doreen Marine.

890
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,480
As you, as you, uh, point at her and then give her the eyes, you know, over to, over

891
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,840
to the vial.

892
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,280
Do I get another action?

893
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,120
Because you failed your sanity?

894
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,880
No, but you do see this thing.

895
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,000
And so the knowledge that you possess and making the move toward Marine of having her,

896
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,840
which is handy that you're telling her to move.

897
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,760
Yeah, I guess.

898
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,440
That does work out quite well for you.

899
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:05,960
Okay.

900
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,460
Okay.

901
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,420
Okay.

902
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,320
Understood.

903
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,760
Hey, did you fucking get me?

904
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,400
All right.

905
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:11,640
Yeah.

906
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,320
So I motion to Doreen Marine to go over to the cauldron in the corner.

907
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,520
The cauldron to get the, uh, the sleepy time medicine.

908
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,720
Banana time.

909
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,440
It's fucking banana time.

910
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:30,840
Uh, and with that, I need everyone else to roll sanity.

911
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,680
So Charles, Doreen, Dr.

912
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,040
Miller, go ahead and roll.

913
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,480
Alertness.

914
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:37,980
Sorry.

915
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,880
Did I say alertness or sanity?

916
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,440
You said sanity.

917
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,320
Oh, alertness.

918
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,120
Roll alertness.

919
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,320
Thank God.

920
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,200
Because if it was sanity, I would have crit failed, but I crit success.

921
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,880
44.

922
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,840
Congratulations.

923
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,840
Yeah, that was a real turnaround.

924
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,240
Lindsay.

925
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,680
51 on a 70.

926
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,880
Oh, success.

927
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,680
And Dr.

928
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,560
Miller fail 34 on a 20.

929
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:03,800
Dr.

930
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,800
Miller seems to be looking all around on the floor, trying to find something that she may

931
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,160
have seen previously, but is now lost Doreen.

932
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,040
You see it right in front of your boots on the ground, crawling toward you.

933
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:24,120
And Charles, you also see this little, little creature.

934
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,600
Um, no, go ahead and roll a sanity, both Charles and Doreen.

935
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,960
Why is sanity so low?

936
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,320
Yeah, I failed 4259.

937
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,600
Oh, that's a success.

938
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,680
So, uh, you have so much sanity.

939
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,080
I only lost one earlier when you lost like five.

940
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,320
Okay.

941
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,640
Sorry.

942
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,080
Lindsay, take off your headphones again.

943
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,440
As you just, oh wait, no, hold on.

944
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:46,920
Sorry.

945
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,200
Keep them on just for a moment.

946
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:48,680
Listen to me.

947
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,200
Listen to the words coming out of my mouth.

948
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,320
You see just a tick.

949
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,840
There's just a tick on the ground.

950
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,480
It's normal.

951
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,200
You're out in the woods.

952
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,840
There's a tick.

953
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,360
There's, you know, sometimes there's crickets.

954
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,400
Sometimes there's ants.

955
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,800
No, it's just like a normal tick.

956
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,240
I mean, ticks are not great.

957
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,440
You don't want it to be near your foot, I suppose, but that's all you see.

958
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,400
You take off your headphones.

959
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:05,960
No big deal.

960
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:12,520
Hey, uh, Chuckster, this thing has so many goddamn legs.

961
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,840
Uh, like this is not a tick.

962
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:20,280
This is, it looks like a tick, but it's almost like floating off the ground with how many

963
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,000
legs it has and the number of legs keeps changing.

964
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,400
And like with the critical success on the alertness, you actually notice that it is

965
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:34,200
almost like forming and reforming in different spots around like as it's moving toward Terrain's

966
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:34,760
boot.

967
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,800
I can picture that.

968
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,840
Yeah, me too.

969
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,360
Good storytelling.

970
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,560
Oh, hey, thanks dude.

971
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,080
I love you.

972
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,800
Love you too.

973
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,000
Shut up.

974
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,920
Get a room.

975
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,320
I'm so jealous of Lindsay.

976
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,440
She gets to close her ears.

977
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,480
Lindsay, they're saying bad things about you.

978
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,520
And Lindsay's back.

979
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,760
I messed up on the fun.

980
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,600
You have no idea how lucky you are.

981
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,560
Doreen, it's your turn.

982
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,040
What do you do?

983
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,240
I'm going for the cauldron.

984
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,000
Hey Zach, do I have to lose sanity points?

985
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,280
Yeah, just lose one.

986
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:12,780
Okay.

987
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,200
Thanks for asking.

988
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,960
You did have homework.

989
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,240
The rest of the class groans.

990
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,880
Roll dexterity.

991
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,140
Okay.

992
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,260
God.

993
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,040
Zero on.

994
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,600
I'm sorry, you rolled zero?

995
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,640
I rolled double zero.

996
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,140
Hey guys.

997
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,720
All right, so double zero means 100.

998
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,400
100 is literally the worst thing you can roll in this game.

999
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,400
And Zach, what did you roll?

1000
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,720
And this was a contest and I rolled a 38.

1001
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,760
You rolled a 100.

1002
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,280
So yeah, pretty easy.

1003
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,080
You move over to the cauldron in the corner.

1004
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,560
What do you do?

1005
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,520
Do I know what this is for?

1006
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,560
Do I know that this cauldron is like a potion that you've made that will knock them out?

1007
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:16,360
I mean, all I've done is go out, bring it in, and then look at you and look at it.

1008
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,200
So I grab it and I look at you.

1009
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,640
I just glance over at Janice Ruth.

1010
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,560
At this time, real quick, Ellie, if you could take off your headphones as well.

1011
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,040
Lindsay and Ally, take off your headphones and plug your ears.

1012
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,320
Me, it's me.

1013
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,600
Hey Taylor.

1014
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,640
Yeah, what's up?

1015
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,440
What's up, bro?

1016
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,560
You're my favorite.

1017
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,920
I love you so much.

1018
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,080
Should we pause like every five minutes to do this?

1019
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,200
Yeah, it's really fun.

1020
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,400
All right, should we get them back?

1021
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,880
Are you serious?

1022
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:54,200
Because you critically succeeded on your alertness check to see this weird fucking seemingly

1023
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,920
unnatural otherworldly bug.

1024
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,800
You also notice it, you know how I described how it like kind of blips in and out?

1025
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:13,560
It seems to blip a couple times as it jumps and it slides directly down into the military

1026
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:20,360
boots of one Doreen Marine and disappears into her boot.

1027
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:26,840
You process that information finally when she's across the room and has grabbed this

1028
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,680
cauldron, you finally think to yourself like, holy shit, that thing just like disappeared

1029
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,560
into her boot.

1030
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,680
That's so weird.

1031
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,080
And am I allowed to do anything or just know it?

1032
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,640
You just have to know that for now.

1033
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,520
I can't yell out?

1034
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,480
Let her act first if that's cool.

1035
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,880
We don't want to interrupt her.

1036
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,480
She seems to have something fun to do.

1037
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,400
I think she's excited about it.

1038
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:49,880
What do you think?

1039
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,720
All right, let's get it back.

1040
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,680
All right, come back.

1041
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,320
All right.

1042
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,000
Hold on, I have to wipe the earwax off my fingers onto my pants.

1043
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,880
Everyone stop what you're doing.

1044
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,720
This is the most grossed out I've ever been recording the show.

1045
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,000
And he records with Luke and Thomas.

1046
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,280
I'm so honored.

1047
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,240
No mention of Joe there.

1048
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,120
That's interesting.

1049
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,760
Joe's a saint.

1050
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,680
Yeah, no, no big deal.

1051
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,520
Doreen Marine, what do you do?

1052
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:39,640
I made eyes with Rusty Hooch, who just looks at Janice, right?

1053
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,160
I'm going to head towards Janice.

1054
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:47,720
And I think my plan is to just like try and like, as if she were my cat or my dog, just

1055
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,720
like pry her mouth open and give her some of this and like rubber throat to get her

1056
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,360
to swallow.

1057
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,240
As you're doing that.

1058
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,440
Doreen, pour it in your boot.

1059
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,800
So I poured in my boot, not all of it.

1060
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,600
Whoa, what the fuck?

1061
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,640
So trusting.

1062
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,160
Wow, so trusting.

1063
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,440
That's amazing.

1064
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,280
He seems pretty sure of himself.

1065
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,440
And also like, and once I became Charles, everyone just was like, wow, there's just

1066
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,320
something about him.

1067
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,600
I just trust him.

1068
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,840
He pulled that move where he got the gun.

1069
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,640
Charles in charge of our taste.

1070
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,840
Now recording.

1071
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,200
Now recording.

1072
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,800
You are now being recorded.

1073
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,760
That's how I'm going to laugh for this episode.

1074
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,120
If you guys are cool with that.

1075
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,600
Only if I can laugh like.

1076
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,080
That's a satisfying mic sound.

1077
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,640
That was dick-sucking sound.

1078
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,480
Satisfying.

1079
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:57,880
All right.

1080
00:55:51,080 --> 00:56:08,920
Let's go.

1081
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:37,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1082
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,080
Till they chase you out again

1083
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:47,080
Find your feet on your broken bones

1084
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:57,080
Clear out the edge again

1085
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1086
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:57,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1087
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:17,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1088
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:37,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1089
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:57,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1090
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:21,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1091
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:41,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1092
00:59:41,080 --> 01:00:01,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1093
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:29,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

1094
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:53,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss
