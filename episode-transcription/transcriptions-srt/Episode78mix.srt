1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
I'm feeling like a damn sandwich here, y'all.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,880
I am the meat that is between the good numbers six and nine,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,600
the bridge between the celestial numerals

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,320
that make us all feel so nice.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,560
That's right, y'all, this is episode 78.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,680
And I'm building a bridge of vocal vibrations

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,000
live from 694.2 PTBP.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,040
The numbers always tell the truth,

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,000
especially when they are the good numbers,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
the nice numbers.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,800
Speaking of numbers, we got one special message

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,600
from one very special listener.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,000
This week's Howler with Wolf is from Zach,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,640
who tagged that pretending pod

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,080
on his Instagram story for once.

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,960
He writes,

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,880
Hey Wolf, long time listener, first time Howler.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Howler howls.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,760
Did you do it?

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,920
Did you howl?

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,360
Okay, now I want to hear you do a real long howl.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,160
And it starts real confident,

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,400
like you're the only wolf in the whole dumpster.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,280
But then as the howl goes on,

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,180
you become less and less sure of yourself.

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,040
Like you're stoned and underdressed at a wedding

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,600
that you weren't invited to until like the week before

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,140
when you ran into your old friend's fiance

29
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,360
at the coffee shop.

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,580
And she invited you after acting

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,360
like it was a total accident.

32
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,360
You were left off the guest list in the first place.

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
Now, do that now.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,880
Okay, thanks, love you, bye.

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,840
P.S. Hey Joe, Justin, Luke, and Thomas,

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,680
I think y'all pretty funny and nice and cute to boot.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,100
Now listen here, Zachary.

38
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,560
I do not howl on command for any man,

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,520
except for beautiful trash beings

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,760
who wish to roll in the filth with me, you dig?

41
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,280
I've also never been invited to a wedding,

42
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,840
but that has never stopped me

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,280
from enjoying myself to the fullest.

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,160
Full of love, full of trash, forever and evermore.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,480
That sounds like holy matrimony to me, y'all.

46
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,400
Emphasis on the moan.

47
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,960
I love you too, Zach.

48
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,360
And one day I will eat your soul,

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,320
but before I do, I'll give you a little forehead kiss.

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,920
Stop it, stop what you're doing right now.

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,360
Pull over the car, dry off those hands,

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,840
and put down the damn quesadilla.

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,400
Go to Twitter, search at pretending pod.

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Go to Instagram, search at pretending pod.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's literally the exact same thing

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
that Jesus told his bro-mies.

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,280
Put down the quesadilla and follow me.

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
Or keep just listening, I guess,

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,880
but don't disappoint ol' Wolfie like that.

60
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,720
Tell your online friends about the show

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
and tag at pretending pod.

62
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,920
In terms of perspective,

63
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,960
let's try to look at this from Drew's.

64
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
It's time for the news.

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,600
Drew drove to the city in the midst

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,880
of a reconstruction of contention

67
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,000
that implemented puddle teaming,

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,880
the act of placing small man-made pools

69
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,720
filled with fish around town.

70
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,800
Drew admitted he didn't come up with this plan.

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
Rather, it was Pastor Adam Kane

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,240
who has seemingly assumed control of contention.

73
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,840
Drew went on to say the pastor

74
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,600
was using fish to collect the ooze.

75
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,880
Drew chastised the officers for leaving contention

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,120
during this phenomenally strange and harrowing time,

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,320
but John Lee Pettymore the 3rd

78
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,560
saw a vision of Drew bringing the radio, helmet,

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,320
and briefcase full of money

80
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
to the First Church of Contention,

81
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,040
and he freaked out on Drew for turning on his coworkers

82
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,800
until Drew showed them a round scar on his belly

83
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,120
from where he had been tortured.

84
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,880
When they patted down Drew,

85
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,480
they found a bloody piece of cheap carpet.

86
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,600
Drew told them, deadpan,

87
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,280
that choking on the carpet until he almost died

88
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,800
was how he found them.

89
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,960
It didn't take long

90
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,440
for the former contingent police officers

91
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,920
to torture Drew as well,

92
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
asking him to prove his assertion

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
by telling them where Tildy B. Mitchell is.

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,360
He said he saw only a small dark prison in his vision.

95
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,840
John went batshit and tried to pull off his own head.

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Clark chased after him,

97
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,080
and Tyler, Kerry Page's energetic black lab,

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,240
came bounding toward the group from behind a barn,

99
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,120
taking us now to Clark's oldest loose end.

100
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,840
Honk if you know this, Wolf's boldest goose friend.

101
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,080
It's a brand new hit, a lone crack tone.

102
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,280
It's kazoo with no backbone.

103
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,200
Here we go.

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
Oh, yeah, it's a new episode.

105
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,440
Yeah, it's a new episode.

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,160
We have to record a new episode now.

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,920
Oh, behind the scenes.

108
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,740
Everybody listening out there.

109
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,720
It hasn't been a whole week

110
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,940
since we recorded the last episode.

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,120
Nope.

112
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,040
What have you guys been up to

113
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,760
since we recorded the last episode?

114
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,180
It feels like it's been a week.

115
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,180
I've been reading drill tweets.

116
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,680
I took a stroll over the restroom over there

117
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,040
and came back.

118
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,400
It was a good jaunt.

119
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,280
I've just been on Reddit.

120
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,040
I opened up another bubbly.

121
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,880
What flavor?

122
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,320
It's aha, it's strawberry cucumber.

123
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,240
Who makes aha?

124
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,320
Who makes aha?

125
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,160
I don't care.

126
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,980
What do you have, Joe?

127
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,460
I bought cranberry raspberry flavored La Croix.

128
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,920
I haven't tried it yet, though,

129
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,680
but I hadn't seen that flavor before.

130
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,760
I haven't seen that either.

131
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,200
Yeah, cran-raz.

132
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,840
Just so you know, it's the Coca-Cola company.

133
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,280
Hey, will you crack one right now?

134
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,160
I could've sworn that the package said cran-raz,

135
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,800
but this says razz cranberry.

136
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,400
It did a reverse of the thing.

137
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,240
I don't know why.

138
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,480
Here we go.

139
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,600
Oh!

140
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
Ooh, that's a crisp one

141
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,040
ripping the head off of that bad boy.

142
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
Oh, it's foaming everywhere.

143
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh my God, Joe is just pouring it all over his forehead

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,160
while he shakes his golden locks back and forth.

145
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,000
Wow.

146
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,020
It's good.

147
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,800
And welcome to episode 78

148
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,320
here at Pretending To Be People.

149
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,480
You guys have had a week to think on what happened

150
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,440
in the last episode.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,880
Any thoughts pop up?

152
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,080
I'm worried that you're gonna make me play Tyler

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,280
and Clark at the same time.

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,040
So I've been preparing.

155
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,160
I've been going in and out of character as fast as I can.

156
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Can we see some of that?

157
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
No.

158
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,440
Just a little taste.

159
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,240
It's good to see the Contingent Boys.

160
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,120
Good to see you too, Tyler.

161
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,880
See, I've been practicing.

162
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,720
It's flawless, right?

163
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,360
Contrast really makes Clark Bishop's voice.

164
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,480
John Wayne-y?

165
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Wayne-y.

166
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,960
Didn't we just leave the city?

167
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,400
How did Tyler get up here?

168
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,360
We pulled over, I think, outside Contingent.

169
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,680
It was like a dirt road, right?

170
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,800
Yeah, you guys were like halfway there, maybe.

171
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,480
He did make some distance though, it sounds like.

172
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,720
Yeah, what, like 30 miles?

173
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,520
When we did our Contingent Critter Coalition,

174
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,120
was that the date?

175
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,960
What date did that take place on?

176
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you remember?

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,460
I think it was December 5th.

178
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,060
What day is it today?

179
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,820
I think it's December 6th.

180
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,940
Well, Luke, it's been a whole week since the last episode.

181
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,700
What have you thought about in the past week

182
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,820
about what is happening and what you should do on this one?

183
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,940
You know, not much.

184
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,540
Probably be more mean to Drew.

185
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,860
Were you mean to Drew back in the day, five days ago?

186
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,140
Not really, no.

187
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,580
I wasn't trying to be mean to him,

188
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,660
I was just more interested in the case than his whole being.

189
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,340
Yeah, you've seen a lot of misery and despair at this point.

190
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,620
Misery signals.

191
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,780
Okie doke, I'm ready to make shit up as I go.

192
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,260
Alrighty, well you guys are in the misery business,

193
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,700
so let's open up shop.

194
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,160
Tyler!

195
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,780
Is that Tyler?

196
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,620
That's Karen Page's dog, that's, guys,

197
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,800
that's the dog I was supposed to find.

198
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,340
That's it, it's right there.

199
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,920
I pat Clark in the back and says,

200
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,380
looks like you found him.

201
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,700
Mission accomplished, we can go home now.

202
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,060
Hey Drew, how do you know who Tyler is?

203
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,540
You all can see Drew Andrews

204
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,540
just filled brimming with affection.

205
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,620
Well, Tyler's just the greatest dog in the world

206
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,420
and I could've sworn that he'd been eaten by homeless people

207
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:46,420
but, I mean, he's Councilman Kerry Page's dog, right?

208
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,300
Drew, that's correct, it's weird though

209
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,500
because she floated the same homeless thing

210
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,420
that you just said.

211
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,580
Oh yeah, I guess I remember you telling me about that.

212
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,100
I'm confused though, how did you know this dog was Tyler?

213
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,660
John, I mean, I did put signs all over the neighborhood.

214
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,980
He probably saw it on the copier or something.

215
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,320
It just seems like you know this dog.

216
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,540
Is that accurate, Drew?

217
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,580
Well, yeah, it's like Clark said,

218
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,980
I saw the pictures on the copier.

219
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,420
Humant!

220
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,820
Okay, everybody roll humant.

221
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,700
Yeah.

222
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,220
Pass.

223
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,340
Ah, 11.

224
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,460
62 on 80.

225
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,300
I fail a 78 on a 30.

226
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,740
Okay, I'm gonna kick you out, Drew.

227
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,580
Okay.

228
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,040
Hey, Luke and Thomas.

229
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,880
Yo.

230
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,700
Zach.

231
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,260
Thomas, John Lee Pettymore especially,

232
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,140
when you hear Drew talking about Tyler,

233
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,660
it's not Drew, that's not Drew talking about Tyler.

234
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,380
It's not his voice, it's not his cadence.

235
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,620
I mean, it is his voice,

236
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,820
but it's not his personality that's coming through.

237
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,300
Damn it, didn't I spend 10 luck

238
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,900
to try to figure out if this was Drew or not?

239
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,460
Yeah, well, I guess actually it was more so

240
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,560
like you asked if you could trust Drew

241
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,060
and I answered that question more so

242
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,380
instead of like, is it Drew as a question?

243
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,980
Whatever, I made my choice.

244
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,500
Okay, let's get Joe back in here.

245
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
Drew, Drew, you seem awfully fond of a dog

246
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,160
that you saw on a poster.

247
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,060
He's probably just happy

248
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,180
that I'm able to close my case, guys.

249
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,220
Yes, yeah, it's definitely that I'm happy for Clark Bishop

250
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,420
because he was really worried about not finding that dog

251
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,480
because Councilwoman Carrie Pages is a very respected person

252
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,180
in the contention community.

253
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,300
Thank you not to interrupt me right now, please.

254
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,140
Drew, you would not have known that that was Tyler

255
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,100
based off a black and white picture from a poster.

256
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,740
That could be any dog, this doesn't add up.

257
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,140
Well, it's a black lab and it's a black and white picture.

258
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,020
I feel like that doesn't discredit it.

259
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,420
It's less that you recognize the dog

260
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,900
and it's more that you seem to know about this dog

261
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,140
that you've never met.

262
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,860
You seem to have genuine affection

263
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,580
for a dog you've only seen on a poster.

264
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,180
Well, Councilwoman Carrie Pages

265
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,260
is an excellent member of our community

266
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,020
and the fact that she has a dog means that that dog

267
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,580
must be one of the greatest dogs

268
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,020
that could be around for sure.

269
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,840
Hey, Carrie.

270
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,680
Yeah, what?

271
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,580
And as Keith Vigna says, Carrie and Drew says,

272
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,800
what, Clark Bishop's eyes widen.

273
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,980
I need everybody to roll sanity.

274
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,980
What?

275
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,820
Fail, but not over my power.

276
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,780
Fail, not over my power.

277
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,740
I also fail, but not over my power.

278
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,740
Everybody lose one sanity as Tyler runs up to Drew Andrews.

279
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,120
I believe still in handcuffs.

280
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,900
Oh yeah, he's still in handcuffs.

281
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,180
Drew gets down on his knees and starts like nuzzling

282
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,820
as Tyler runs right up and begins kissing

283
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,140
and licking all over Drew Andrews.

284
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,940
Drew, Tyler really does know you pretty well.

285
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,180
This ain't Drew, Clark.

286
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,260
They called, yeah, you, what?

287
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,460
Councilwoman Pages, how the hell did you get

288
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,760
in the body of our associate?

289
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,800
Clark's eyes widen even further.

290
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,580
What, what?

291
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,440
I am simply here to bring back the three of you

292
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,360
to contention and I didn't think that this was gonna be

293
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,360
that much of an issue.

294
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Jesus, it's like with you people

295
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,280
and I'm just glad that Tyler is here.

296
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,020
If you would, if you would just come back,

297
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,920
I think we could do a lot of good together.

298
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,660
It's just that we needed your help

299
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,800
and we didn't know exactly how to get it

300
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,800
and so we just need, we figured Drew might be the best way

301
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,540
to get you guys to come back.

302
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,760
I don't know about these guys,

303
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,300
but I don't take very kindly to tricks being played on me.

304
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,440
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,500
Yeah, what do you guys think?

306
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,340
I don't like it.

307
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,200
Clark looks like he's trying to do

308
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,900
a lot of math in his head.

309
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,400
How did you get switched?

310
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,280
Yeah, how did you become Drew?

311
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,520
The radio.

312
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,440
Right, that makes sense.

313
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,960
Where's Drew then?

314
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,800
Is he okay?

315
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,520
You see a flicker in Drew's eyes.

316
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,800
If you ever wanna see Drew Andrews again,

317
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,920
you're gonna come back to contention with me.

318
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,420
So you tortured poor Drew and he wouldn't flip on us.

319
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,060
So you had to switch his body with yours?

320
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,020
Is that what happened?

321
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,580
He shrugs his shoulders.

322
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,300
I poke the wound.

323
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,500
Yeah, I was gonna say I punch him in the gut

324
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
where that wound was.

325
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Poke and punch, same time.

326
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,340
No, God.

327
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,260
Please, please don't hurt me.

328
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,180
Please don't hurt me, I'll do it.

329
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,200
I'll even act like you guys don't even know Drew anymore.

330
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
I didn't think about this.

331
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,820
There's three of you, there's only one of me.

332
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,420
Please just don't hurt Tyler

333
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,060
and we could all go back to contention

334
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,660
and I can help you, I can help you.

335
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
I can help you, thank you.

336
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,800
Council woman, first of all, we're not gonna hurt Tyler,

337
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,260
but we might take him away from you forever.

338
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,380
Well, that would be hurting him

339
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,980
because we're so connected.

340
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,820
I don't know.

341
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,700
I think he'd be real happy

342
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,980
after we fed him steaks for a few days.

343
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,820
You wouldn't.

344
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,500
He might forget all about you.

345
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,420
Drew starts crying.

346
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,140
Council woman, now,

347
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,380
why don't you tell us what the preacher wants?

348
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,740
I already told you, we're just trying to help.

349
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,740
Can I humid that?

350
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,580
No.

351
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,400
All right, go ahead and roll.

352
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,400
Keith.

353
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,920
64 on 80.

354
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,100
Well, okay, so he's trying to collect all the residue, right?

355
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,880
So that there's no more out in contention

356
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,600
so that we can pull away all the puddles

357
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,400
and we can open up contention again.

358
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,000
You think he just wants to collect the residue

359
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,920
and then do nothing with it?

360
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,400
How can he keep it safe, contained?

361
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,040
I'm not in charge of that.

362
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,640
I think we gotta go talk to this guy.

363
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,200
You never stopped to think, did you?

364
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,160
Drew, I mean, Carrie?

365
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,040
Drew, Carrie?

366
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,880
Drew, Drew, Drew.

367
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,700
Drew, Drew, Drew.

368
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,540
Drew, Drew, Drew.

369
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,380
Drew, Drew, Drew.

370
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,220
Drew, Drew, Drew.

371
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,960
I was trying not to laugh.

372
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,500
Welcome to pretending to be people

373
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,340
where everything is made up and the roles don't matter.

374
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:23,340
You got put into the body of Drew

375
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,640
with a radio that had tubes on it

376
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,320
by, I assume, Pastor Adam Kane.

377
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,840
Was this all just like a Tuesday afternoon for you?

378
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,440
How did you react to all the...

379
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,560
Are you aware of the world around you

380
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,760
that you've now entered?

381
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,960
Oh, I think she's aware, Clark.

382
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,480
You've been with the pastor for quite a while, haven't you?

383
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,660
Well, when you guys weren't doing anything,

384
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,520
we decided that we needed to team up

385
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,920
to make change happen, something substantial

386
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,080
that could actually take care of business in this time.

387
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,880
I don't like this excuse.

388
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,100
I don't like that line of reasoning at all.

389
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,120
Carrie, walk me through the day

390
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
that Pastor Adam Kane said to you,

391
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,440
I need you to switch bodies with this guy here

392
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,520
using this radio.

393
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,360
How did that set with you?

394
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,480
That was just earlier today,

395
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,520
and honestly, I'm pretty heads in at that point,

396
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,880
so I don't know if you've noticed,

397
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,960
but the world is different now,

398
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,480
and you either adapt or you die.

399
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,400
Oh, we know.

400
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,040
I lean in and whisper,

401
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,440
is this because I couldn't find your dog soon enough?

402
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,160
Is this because of me?

403
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,520
Clark, I have no ill will against you

404
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,080
now that my dog is back.

405
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,900
All right, so how about this?

406
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,640
What if we, you know,

407
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,480
we're gonna send Tyler away,

408
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,520
somewhere where you can never find him

409
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,640
and you'll never see him again.

410
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,720
Now, we're not gonna hurt him,

411
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,160
but yeah, unless you become a mole for us.

412
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,280
That's what I said I would do.

413
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,920
Yes, we're on the same page.

414
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,260
Well, I know. It was your idea.

415
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,520
It was your idea. Okay, I love it.

416
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,720
It can be your idea too.

417
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,680
I just want you to know

418
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,480
that that's the leverage we have against you,

419
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,680
is that you won't ever see your dog again.

420
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,680
This brief reunion will be merely a painful moment in time

421
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,600
in which you get to see what might've been.

422
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,020
Drew and Tyler have their heads,

423
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,280
their foreheads pressed right up against each other.

424
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,200
Drew kind of like does one final push into Tyler's forehead

425
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,360
and then leans back and looks you dead in the eyes

426
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,200
and is like, I will do anything to be,

427
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
I will do anything to keep Tyler safe.

428
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,320
That's what I like to hear.

429
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
Boys, I think we ought to head back to contention.

430
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,760
It sounds like there's even more trouble brewing down there.

431
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,960
Oh, hey, why don't you tell us how you got this car?

432
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,320
We know it's not yours.

433
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,160
It was in the police department parking lot.

434
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,960
Yeah, old Trent left it there.

435
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,000
I think Grand Theft Auto is,

436
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,640
or tampering with a motor vehicle

437
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,840
is the least of our concern right now.

438
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,300
I'm gonna put Drew Carey in the back of the car,

439
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,580
get back in the passenger seat and look at the guys.

440
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,420
Who's driving?

441
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,580
Let's put her in the trunk

442
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,040
and put the dog in the front seat.

443
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,880
Okay.

444
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,440
I love that.

445
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,280
I'll drive.

446
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,740
Are you keeping Drew tied up?

447
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,980
Are you keeping him handcuffed?

448
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,820
Yes.

449
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,780
And are you doing anything with his legs?

450
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,700
Leg cuffed.

451
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,540
Yep.

452
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,360
Oh, damn.

453
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,540
It seems like that might cause more trouble than it helps.

454
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,020
He's gonna be able to be mobile when we get places.

455
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,520
Yeah, when we get places.

456
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,500
We're driving back, we're halfway to contention.

457
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,100
You afraid he's gonna walk out of the trunk?

458
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,580
If he's got his legs,

459
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,860
he might be able to kick his way out.

460
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,620
But if we leg cuff him,

461
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,500
then all he can do is wiggle like an ineffective worm

462
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,340
back there.

463
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,100
Handcuffs with attached ankle cuffs

464
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,380
were pretty common in the 70s.

465
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,060
So that's what Clark has on his old school

466
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,980
contention police officer uniform.

467
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,820
I got these here.

468
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,420
I'm imagining handcuffs on his wrist,

469
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,500
handcuffs on his ankles,

470
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,260
and then two handcuffs connecting those handcuffs

471
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,780
like behind his back like a hog tied.

472
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,620
Yeah.

473
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,500
Rigged and ready to go.

474
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,660
Boys, can we go to my hotel?

475
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,580
There's something I really need to show you.

476
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,660
Yeah, we're driving now.

477
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,800
We're in charge of our own destinies.

478
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,380
Of course we can do that.

479
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,580
Do you guys have any other plans?

480
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,780
We're gonna have to deal with the pastor at some point,

481
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,420
but I've been meaning to get back

482
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,400
and show you guys this for a minute.

483
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,380
Let's just do it.

484
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,500
Yeah, that's fine, sure.

485
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,280
And I gotta let Bean out.

486
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,040
He's probably ripped up the carpet

487
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,360
or peed and pooped in there.

488
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,060
I don't know if he even has food left.

489
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,360
We should probably give your dog

490
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,760
to someone who's gonna take care of it.

491
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,900
Him and Tyler can go to a farm.

492
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,260
Not really though, I love Bean.

493
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,220
All right, let's go to contention.

494
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,000
The highway between the city

495
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,080
and the small town of contention,

496
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,200
if it truly can be called a highway,

497
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,680
the part nearest to contention

498
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,580
hasn't seen road repair in decades.

499
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,160
Those from contention know to forfeit the radio

500
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,780
during certain stretches of road

501
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,280
because the rough old concrete is so loud,

502
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,720
the damage to the speakers as well as to your ears

503
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,560
is never worth it.

504
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,480
That's just something you're all used to.

505
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,160
What you're not used to is a blockade

506
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,160
made of splintered church pews stopping you from exiting

507
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,720
and the sign from Subtropolis torn down and spray painted.

508
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,560
It's like leaning up against this blockade,

509
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,920
has a big arrow to the right and says,

510
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,480
detour, please keep right.

511
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,620
I need you all to roll alertness or search,

512
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,760
whichever's higher or Thomas, you can roll drive

513
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,600
if that one's higher in order to see this

514
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,680
in time to do anything about it.

515
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,880
I slow down and I wanna say that

516
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,300
I feel like this is a trap.

517
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,940
I fail.

518
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,620
I rolled a six on a 60.

519
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,460
I rolled a 35 on a 70 drive.

520
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,760
So I just, I slow to a stop before we have to turn off

521
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,920
and I say something doesn't feel right.

522
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,060
I think we're about to get children of mend.

523
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,520
In the distance, you see that the detour leads down

524
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,600
some crunchy December grass and onto the service road,

525
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,780
just to the right, just to the north of the exit ramp.

526
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,440
But there is certainly some sort of situation

527
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,300
set up on this service road.

528
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,980
A crane sits off to the side of this makeshift entrance

529
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,960
to contention.

530
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,460
It's boom and jib hanging over the middle of the road

531
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,680
where its payload sits.

532
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,600
A substitute gate made of those big ass construction tubes.

533
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,800
So basically the crane is there to let cars into contention

534
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,360
by lifting all these tubes.

535
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,800
Like sauna tubes, the kind of things you fill with concrete?

536
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,600
No, the big concrete.

537
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,360
Big plastic tubes.

538
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,100
If we were in the matrix and we shot them,

539
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,900
they would go rolling across the road

540
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,260
and cars would crash into them.

541
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,100
Gotcha.

542
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,140
But the highway itself is clear.

543
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,400
It's just the exit ramp that has all this construction

544
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,240
going on, right?

545
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,320
So we could keep going down the highway unobstructed,

546
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
come around maybe the backside or something like that.

547
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,100
So yeah, we just keep driving.

548
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,080
Fuck the detour.

549
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,500
We look for a back way into town.

550
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,340
Yeah.

551
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,300
Or at least one that doesn't have a giant crane in the way.

552
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,260
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

553
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,460
If this is the main entrance,

554
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,100
then it stands to reason that the others

555
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,040
are probably less secure than this.

556
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,400
That's what I'm hoping at least, yeah.

557
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,240
It's worth scouting.

558
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,780
Plus we're the cops and unless the pastor

559
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,300
has explicitly said to not let us in.

560
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,400
We know this town doesn't feel too kindly

561
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,280
about us right now.

562
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,880
I think we're the cops is about the worst thing

563
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,160
that could come out of anyone's mouth trying to get in.

564
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,660
Like why the fuck did you leave?

565
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,300
Why aren't you here in the first place?

566
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,520
But doesn't it kind of sound like

567
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,480
Pastor Adam Cain's running the show now and he wants us?

568
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,660
If we could not alert him to our presence,

569
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,900
that'd be the best for now.

570
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,020
I agree 100%.

571
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,020
I'm just saying I think if push came to shove,

572
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,100
we could probably get through this barrier.

573
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,580
Let's try to find another way around and get to my hotel.

574
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,780
So if you could all pull up the map real quick.

575
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,900
Yeah, I've got the map.

576
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,820
I want you to see essentially why Hotel Motel

577
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,300
might be one of the harder places to get into.

578
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,860
I see what you mean.

579
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,580
Yeah, it's right by the exit.

580
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,620
We don't have to drive anywhere.

581
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,240
Let's just pull, let's go back down the highway

582
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,920
the way we came a little bit,

583
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,160
pull off the side of the road

584
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,880
and then just walk to the Hotel Motel.

585
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,080
Yeah, that works.

586
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,160
Are you leaving Tyler in the car?

587
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,060
No, we're leaving Drew Carey in the trunk,

588
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,600
but we're taking Tyler with us.

589
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,760
You don't think we should take Drew Carey with us?

590
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,480
We hogtied him pretty good.

591
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,880
Wasn't our whole conversation though,

592
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,880
was that she was gonna be on our side and help us now

593
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,980
because we threatened her dog.

594
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,620
But I don't know, I mean,

595
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,320
it just seems like she's more of a liability

596
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,220
while we run a dude Drew's thing real quick.

597
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,060
You mean Keith's thing?

598
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,780
Yeah, it feels like the safest place for her to be

599
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,820
would be in this trunk.

600
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,540
I'm just saying we're not gonna be at the hotel for long.

601
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,340
Yeah, we're just missing in and out.

602
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,900
I just gotta get something.

603
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,740
Okay, yeah.

604
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,620
You can, somebody can stay here and guard,

605
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,620
guard him, them if you want, but I don't know.

606
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,900
Let's just all go and make it real quick

607
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,340
and get back to the car.

608
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,300
Here's my only fear,

609
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,060
is that things don't seem to go well for us.

610
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,380
So what if Drew Carey's trapped in the trunk for a while?

611
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,800
Well, that's her own fault for becoming, you know,

612
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,580
a pawn of this evil goo like a collecting pastor.

613
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,300
But we also were just saying that she could be helpful.

614
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,960
Like, are we abandoning the idea

615
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,700
that that could be helpful to us?

616
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,220
Right now, I think she's the most helpful in that trunk.

617
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,420
If she feels like she's in a situation

618
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,320
where we're leading her,

619
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,000
trying to be stealthy to the hotel,

620
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,100
and she can just scream like,

621
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,880
hey, hey, they're here,

622
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,160
and sick a bunch of people on us.

623
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,000
True.

624
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,820
That's true.

625
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,040
True, true.

626
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,880
Okay.

627
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,700
All right, that's it.

628
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,540
Let's go.

629
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,120
Let's go to the hotel on foot with Tyler, right?

630
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,040
We're bringing Tyler with us?

631
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,880
Yeah.

632
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,700
Yeah.

633
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,080
Clark goes around to the trunk and pats on it.

634
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,920
We'll be right back.

635
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,000
We're taking Tyler, so don't get any funny ideas

636
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,240
about getting out of there.

637
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,720
Wait, where are you going right now?

638
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,540
Please, thank you.

639
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,720
Tell me, please.

640
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,560
Nope, nope.

641
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,380
We don't want you,

642
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,000
if any of your friends come along and find this truck,

643
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,840
we don't want you leading them to us,

644
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,860
so we'll be back within 15 minutes, half an hour,

645
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,160
and you just sit tight.

646
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,960
Clark's gonna be staying here with you,

647
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,280
and then I wink at them.

648
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,800
And I'm putting some headphones in,

649
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,920
and I'm just gonna sit silently to myself

650
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,760
in the front seat up there.

651
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,520
Yeah, he's listening to an audio book,

652
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,360
so you don't disturb him or anything,

653
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,120
or he won't be able to enjoy that.

654
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,080
Great job.

655
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,040
That's exactly right.

656
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,120
You just don't say nothing.

657
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,400
All right, let's go, boys.

658
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,240
Boy.

659
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,440
I meant Keith and Tyler.

660
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

661
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,360
And then we all head off to the hotel motel.

662
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,660
Is there anything in the car we can use

663
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,920
to make a makeshift leash for Tyler?

664
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,480
Oh, for sure, seat belt.

665
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,040
There's a light cardigan in the back,

666
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,260
and I tie that around his collar.

667
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,480
One sleeve tied around the collar,

668
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,360
the other sleeve I'm holding on to.

669
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,200
Okay.

670
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,620
Cardigan leash.

671
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,660
Cardigan leash.

672
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,500
I love it.

673
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,820
All right, Keith, you know,

674
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,540
I probably should have humanted you

675
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,940
or done something to make sure

676
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,500
that your motives were good and leaning us

677
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,860
away from our main goals back to your hotel room.

678
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,900
But I didn't, so let's just get this over with.

679
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,860
Okey-dokey, who's got the worst stealth?

680
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,060
Mine's 50.

681
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,100
Mine's 10.

682
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,380
Oh my God.

683
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,220
Why?

684
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,520
I've got 30.

685
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,100
Okay, so I'm gonna have John and Clark roll

686
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,520
if you guys succeed, you'll be able to assist

687
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,680
by giving a plus 20 each on a success to Keith.

688
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,520
10.

689
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
So that is a plus 20 to Keith's 10.

690
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,520
I failed, a 40.

691
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,720
All right, Keith, you're gonna roll under 30.

692
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,740
83.

693
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,600
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, John Lee,

694
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,380
Pettymore the 3rd, and Tyler

695
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,660
are walking across the highway.

696
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,700
I need everybody to roll alertness.

697
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,140
32 on a 60.

698
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,500
90 on a 60.

699
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,380
87 on a 70.

700
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,380
All righty, just got Thomas here.

701
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,280
Thomas, you see across the highway

702
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,360
when you're like on the highway itself,

703
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,280
it's the highest point that you've been at.

704
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,160
And looking across the town of contention,

705
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,800
there's not much of a skyline in contention, right?

706
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,020
Not too many tall buildings here,

707
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,760
but you do notice that surrounding what you know

708
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,740
as the campus of First Church of Contention,

709
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,180
there is, that doesn't look right, it can't,

710
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,220
it's moving, it's a wall.

711
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,700
You imagine this is what it looked like

712
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,260
if Moses actually had parted the Red Sea,

713
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,900
as you see a moat in the air that is surrounding

714
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,960
the campus of the First Church of Contention.

715
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,780
And in the water are many different kinds of fish

716
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,140
that are all swimming about.

717
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,520
I need you to roll sanity.

718
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,120
Ooh, fail.

719
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,600
Lose one sanity as you realize

720
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,200
what you are going up against.

721
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,520
This is the kind of unnatural

722
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,080
that you have not witnessed something this controlled,

723
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,080
right, like everything that you've seen

724
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,940
has been just haphazard, seemingly chaotic.

725
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,240
But this, this was formed and this is held.

726
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,360
This is scary.

727
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,340
That's what you're supposed to do in horror, right?

728
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,420
Is you say, this is scary.

729
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,260
This is scary.

730
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,380
You're scared now.

731
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,900
Do you feel it inside of you where you're scared?

732
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,740
Oh yeah.

733
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,060
All right, I'm gonna, did you roll over your power?

734
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,940
No.

735
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,580
Okay, I'm gonna bring them back.

736
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,140
Sorry, I forgot to tell you guys

737
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,020
I was putting you in the waiting room.

738
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Well, and they should have just been there because.

739
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Yeah, immediately.

740
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,480
Yeah, I stop at my track and I tap you on the shoulders

741
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,760
and point to the first church of contention

742
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,320
and I say, hey guys, take a look

743
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,040
at what's going on around the church.

744
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,640
Both of you roll sanity for me.

745
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,720
For looking at the church?

746
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,120
Yep.

747
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,960
I fail.

748
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,780
I fail.

749
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,880
Do you fail over your power either one of you?

750
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,540
No.

751
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,820
So you each lose one sanity.

752
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,340
How close to the church are we?

753
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,220
Quite a ways from the church.

754
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,180
Okay, I see it on the map now.

755
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,020
I mean 20 blocks maybe?

756
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,840
Yeah.

757
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,220
Or like five.

758
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,140
Oh yeah, like five blocks, sorry.

759
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,100
Above the skyline of contention,

760
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,020
which is basically non-existent,

761
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,320
I think the highest thing in the town previous to this

762
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,180
was probably the church's cross

763
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,480
on top of their steeple.

764
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Currently above that, you see a massive wall of water

765
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,560
that is surrounding the entire land that the church sits on

766
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,560
and it is exactly like what you think it might look like

767
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,840
if you made a wall out of water.

768
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,680
Yeah, exactly.

769
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,640
It's exactly what it would look like

770
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,880
if you made a wall out of water

771
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,760
and there are fish swimming all through it

772
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,820
it's cool some of them literally jump out of the water

773
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,380
and then gravity pulls them back in sideways

774
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,580
into the wall of water.

775
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,420
And oh, I forgot to mention, it's scary.

776
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,140
You've never seen this kind of unnatural power

777
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,100
controlled like this.

778
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,820
It seems to not be chaotic, it is purposeful.

779
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,580
Clark starts walking toward it.

780
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,100
Clark, what are you doing?

781
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,400
You didn't, did you see all that?

782
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,720
There's fish in there, they're just flopping around.

783
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,120
Look at that, I gotta see this thing.

784
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,960
Yeah, I mean, let's just swing by the hotel real quick

785
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,040
and then we can go there.

786
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,560
Yeah, Clark, that's kind of where all our,

787
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,080
seemingly all our enemies are.

788
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,020
I mean, except our human enemies,

789
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,800
the ooze is its own thing.

790
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,460
Yeah, see, Tyler agrees.

791
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,820
We should just go run by the hotel real quick

792
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,660
and check things out.

793
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,740
But you're saying that we'll be able to get up there

794
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,020
close to it later on maybe.

795
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,860
Yeah, yeah.

796
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,380
See some of those fish.

797
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,540
Oh yeah, we'll take them fish.

798
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,920
That'd be neat as hell.

799
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,860
All right, yeah, let's go.

800
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,620
A regular ichthyologist is Clark Bishop.

801
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,460
You know it.

802
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,700
Pick the pace up a little bit

803
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,980
and start more than jogging towards the hotel.

804
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,820
Yeah, I follow.

805
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,980
As you guys get to hotel motel

806
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,120
you see that all the doors are open.

807
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,200
I sprint to my room and in the parking lot.

808
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,620
Look down here, it looks like a dog

809
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,020
tried to get into this room.

810
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,440
It looks like one burst from the inside outward

811
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,280
in this one here.

812
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,400
Yeah, can we reconstruct the series of events

813
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,240
that happened here?

814
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,160
It's several critters working together it seems.

815
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
It looks like a bird hit the window here.

816
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,820
Wow, this is something strange went on.

817
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,760
Maybe it's, do I see a cat around anywhere?

818
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,340
You guys are seeing that from a distance

819
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,140
and just wonderfully ignoring the scene

820
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,660
that's in the parking lot of hotel motel

821
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,700
which before you is, there's a dunking booth

822
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,580
filled with fish and sitting above the water

823
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,180
there's a young boy, a large boy with dumpling cheeks

824
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,580
and rounded ears that accentuate the roundness of his face

825
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,680
and he is slowly surveying the area

826
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,680
with a furrowed brow above glassy, darting eyes

827
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,720
while consistently stuffing his face

828
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,480
with a cheesy ziti scooped up

829
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,920
from a mixing bowl in his lap.

830
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,640
It seems like this husky fella is some kind of lookout.

831
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,200
They said they were using children and crazy folks

832
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,040
to look out for the ooze.

833
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,720
And see he's got his little tank of fish there

834
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,080
that he can just dump down into

835
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,060
in case it comes by.

836
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,080
Roll alertness for me, Thomas.

837
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,940
Seven.

838
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,500
And you notice alongside that astute observation

839
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,140
there is a walkie talkie that is mounted

840
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,700
on the netting of this dunk tank

841
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,620
so that it could be used

842
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,500
if someone was standing in the dunk tank.

843
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,340
Walkie talkie.

844
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,100
What's he, what's the kid wearing?

845
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,140
What is the kid wearing?

846
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,940
He is wearing.

847
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,300
I'm mostly asking, is he wearing like a swimsuit

848
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,020
so that he would be happy to be dunked

849
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,040
or is he just wearing civilian clothing?

850
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,920
No, he's just wearing normal clothes.

851
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,080
What'd you say, Thomas?

852
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,000
Said lack a week.

853
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,160
Like Meatwad and some awkward teen hunger force.

854
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,460
It's just a thing.

855
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,960
So what happens?

856
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,440
We tell you what happens.

857
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,640
Hey fellas, see that walkie talkie he's got there?

858
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,520
Yeah.

859
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,560
Seems like he could alert the church to our presence

860
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,760
so we might wanna, we might wanna duck down.

861
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,920
How are we gonna sneak around him?

862
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,620
Yeah, you could draw stealth.

863
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,060
Is anybody feeling particularly sneaky?

864
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,140
Is this a working carnival dunk tank?

865
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,980
Like does it have a target that we could hit

866
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,260
and dunk the kid?

867
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,940
Yeah, let's say that it does.

868
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,660
All right, can any of us throw?

869
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,640
We could shoot.

870
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,160
That's true.

871
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,380
I've got a 60 firearms, what do you got?

872
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,780
I'm feeling a little better than that.

873
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,820
All right, Keith, take the shot.

874
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,500
Well, I mean, what's your plan here?

875
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,920
If we dunk him, he's gonna say that he got dunked

876
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,160
and hurt a gunshot.

877
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,920
Right, but it gives us time and his confusion to run by.

878
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,940
He won't necessarily see what dunked him.

879
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,780
That's true.

880
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,280
And if you, you know, fuck up and hit the kid,

881
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,760
then we don't really have a problem either way, so.

882
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,600
That's true.

883
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,720
But as a, just throwing it out there,

884
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,720
another option is that we're here to get something

885
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,560
from Keith. Just shoot the kid

886
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,340
instead of fucking around with the dunk tank?

887
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,800
You're right, you're right.

888
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,260
Keith, why don't you,

889
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,980
you're not wearing a uniform or anything.

890
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,460
Why don't you walk up there, show him, I guess,

891
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,900
your hotel room key or whatever.

892
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,820
I mean, he's looking out for goo, right?

893
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,640
I mean, that's ostensibly what he's looking out for.

894
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,700
I could try to just obscure my face.

895
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,140
Give me. Is Keith clean-shaven?

896
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,700
Scraggly, but it's been a couple days since I shaved, so.

897
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,540
I grab a big thing of mud and I just rub it

898
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,860
all over your face where a beard would be.

899
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,620
I allow it to happen.

900
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,800
I have the mud beard on and I want to just quickly

901
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,160
walk over to my hotel room.

902
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,760
And if it helps, I do have some disguise points.

903
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,240
Clark, you, me, and the dog will hunker down here

904
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,920
and we'll see how Keith gets along.

905
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,680
If he gets into any trouble with this boy,

906
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,240
the boy's like, hey, that's Officer Vigna.

907
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,720
You know, we'll dunk him or shoot him

908
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,120
or do what we have to do.

909
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,960
Exactly.

910
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,820
We've taken care of kids before, so.

911
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:29,820
Uh, I didn't know that.

912
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,120
I thought you meant take care of him like we dunk him.

913
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,600
I'm not, I don't think I want to kill a kid today.

914
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,680
Like I said, whatever we have to do,

915
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm just, I'm glad you're my partner in this

916
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,080
because we've been there before.

917
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,160
We've done through, we've, you know,

918
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,000
we've gone through this, so I know you'll do

919
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,440
what must be done when the time comes.

920
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,240
I didn't do it. I didn't do it last time.

921
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,880
It was a thing that happened that we were there for,

922
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,600
but I wasn't, like I would've,

923
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,180
I would've preferred it not to have happened,

924
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,460
but I, I'm with you.

925
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,300
We're here.

926
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,220
We're on the exact same page, buddy.

927
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,100
I know you're with me, killer.

928
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

929
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,300
Keith, roll a disguise.

930
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,540
There was a face of really happy

931
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,220
and then a face of maybe shock.

932
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
A 23 on a 30.

933
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,100
Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

934
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,460
As you walk by, you see these very glassy,

935
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,380
very darting eyes of this total chub,

936
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,280
look you up and down and then immediately pay you no mind

937
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,040
as he continues to survey the land.

938
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,820
And you walk into a room that has been ransacked.

939
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,560
Bean is not here.

940
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,400
Shit.

941
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,000
And the window, as you all observed earlier,

942
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,240
has been busted out.

943
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,560
I immediately go directly to the safe.

944
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,540
So, hotel safes, motel safes.

945
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,520
I think you can just pick them up, right?

946
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,400
Some of them.

947
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,880
It depends, yep.

948
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,340
So, Luke, how much luck do you have?

949
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,160
35.

950
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,100
That sucks.

951
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,020
Go ahead and roll luck to see if your safe

952
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,340
is in hotel motel.

953
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,420
22.

954
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

955
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,260
And Bean is inside.

956
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,940
Whew, I was gonna be so disappointed.

957
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,940
I was too, honestly, I was gonna be pissed.

958
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,900
I was like, please roll.

959
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,620
Okay, crit, crit success, it is there.

960
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,820
Yeah, I'm trying to think of something

961
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,860
that would make it better.

962
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,880
Oh, you don't have to, you don't have to,

963
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,160
this kid is completely preoccupied

964
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,200
when you come out with it.

965
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,060
Like, he is. The safe?

966
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,660
I'm like, I don't need the whole safe.

967
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,780
Oh, right.

968
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,260
Oh, shit, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

969
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,980
I was like, okay, so Keith carries this safe out.

970
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,380
Fuck me, so.

971
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,140
Guys, look, the safe was still there.

972
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

973
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,460
That's all I needed.

974
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,300
We didn't take it.

975
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,940
We could put stuff in it.

976
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,180
Are you glad we came?

977
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

978
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,280
All right, do your thing.

979
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,520
I open up the safe,

980
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,400
take out the watch that I had put in there,

981
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,200
I put it in my pocket, and I head back to the guys.

982
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,640
Yeah, and this kid pays you absolutely no mind

983
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,840
because of your critical success,

984
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,400
and you make it back,

985
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,080
and Tyler greets you with a warm lick on the face.

986
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,560
Okay, guys, do you wanna walk to the church

987
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,960
or go back to the car, but either way.

988
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,400
Keith, why the fuck did we come out here in the first place?

989
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,080
I need you to see something.

990
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,180
Well, one of you guys put this on,

991
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,420
and I reach into my pocket and hold out the watch.

992
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,820
Yeah, sure, that's a nice watch, and I put it on.

993
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,220
Okay, John Lee Pettymore the Thirth puts it on,

994
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,120
and I'm gonna send the other two to the waiting room.

995
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,960
Peace out.

996
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

997
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,780
Hey, Thomas.

998
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,460
Hello, Zach.

999
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,260
Thomas, it feels like the consciousness

1000
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,200
of John Lee Pettymore is changing the channel

1001
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,800
just like back and forth and back and forth

1002
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,340
all between these different scenes,

1003
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,240
and you begin to phase out of your reality

1004
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,220
as this watch slips onto your wrist,

1005
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,640
and you seem to be somewhere else entirely,

1006
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,640
and you feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers,

1007
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,660
and then the wet grass turns dry, so dry,

1008
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,640
and the dirt turns to dust,

1009
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,300
and you look up, and you see contention

1010
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,300
as an old mining town in the late 1800s,

1011
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,020
and you look next to you,

1012
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,600
and you see a man lying face down on the ground,

1013
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,800
not moving, and then all of a sudden,

1014
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,200
you're looking at a door in the ground,

1015
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,400
like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried,

1016
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,820
and on the door is an inscription,

1017
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:45,220
and it says, Pettymore Forevermore,

1018
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,880
and then the watch is slipped off of your wrist,

1019
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,760
and you come back to reality.

1020
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,440
John Lee Pettymore the third puts this watch on,

1021
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,880
and then quickly pulls the watch off his wrist.

1022
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,160
Keith, what the hell is this?

1023
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,000
What'd you see?

1024
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,820
What'd you see?

1025
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,760
What does that mean?

1026
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,060
I saw contention in its early days.

1027
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,900
I saw a man on the ground face down,

1028
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,800
and I saw a door.

1029
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,640
A door in the ground?

1030
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,940
A door in the ground, yeah.

1031
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,820
Did you read it?

1032
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,140
Did it say anything on it?

1033
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,980
It said, Pettymore Forevermore.

1034
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,860
When I put that on the first time,

1035
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,860
I saw a door in the ground, but it had beans on it.

1036
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The door is just covered in beans.

1037
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:43,600
That watch, my father gave that watch to Ferguson as a kid.

1038
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,720
Why don't we see what happens when Clark puts it on,

1039
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,680
and I like slap it on your wrist.

1040
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,520
What do you mean?

1041
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,680
What do I, you guys are seeing?

1042
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,180
Bye guys.

1043
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,020
Look.

1044
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,560
Hey Joe.

1045
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,400
Hello.

1046
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,040
As Clark Bishop has this watch slapped on his wrist,

1047
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,640
it feels like your consciousness

1048
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,380
is just flipping through the channels,

1049
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,600
and you begin to phase out of your reality,

1050
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,920
and you're somewhere else entirely,

1051
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,620
and you feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers.

1052
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,640
The wet grass and dirt turns to dry, dry dust.

1053
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,760
And you've seen pictures of contention from the late 1800s,

1054
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,800
but you've never been there.

1055
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,000
And looking to your left, you see a man who's not moving

1056
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,880
face down on the ground next to you.

1057
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,360
You're back in this wet grass and dirt,

1058
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,960
and you see Maggie Cook's house,

1059
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,200
and in the backyard there's a door floating in the air.

1060
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,120
And then all of a sudden you're looking at this door

1061
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,980
that's mostly buried, sealed, metal door,

1062
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,180
and there's an inscription on it.

1063
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,060
It says one, five, two, two, five, one, eight, one,

1064
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,540
nine, five, five, one, eight,

1065
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:09,420
which you immediately can recognize as overseer.

1066
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,500
That's on the door in the ground?

1067
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,340
Yep.

1068
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,660
Okay, okay, okay.

1069
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,500
I don't get it, but okay.

1070
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,320
That makes sense.

1071
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,160
I mean, I kinda get it.

1072
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,000
I kinda get it.

1073
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,700
John Lee Pettymore slaps this watch

1074
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,900
onto Clark Bishop's wrist, and his eyes go blank,

1075
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,780
and then not hardly any time passes

1076
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,780
before the watch slips off the wrist

1077
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,380
and Clark Bishop looks at you.

1078
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,700
Did you see the door?

1079
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,740
What did yours say?

1080
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,980
Door, door, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1081
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,780
It was the numbers, it was numbers, it was.

1082
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,620
What numbers?

1083
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,420
It was the ones they spelled overseer.

1084
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,020
Oh, shit, well, that's you, Clark.

1085
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,700
Was the door in the ground?

1086
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,140
Yeah, yeah.

1087
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,500
Did you see anything else?

1088
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,980
Yeah, I saw Maggie's house.

1089
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,020
I was standing out there in front of it.

1090
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,340
You know, she lives right there on Bean's Pond,

1091
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:12,340
and I saw a door, and it was floating above Bean's Pond,

1092
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,940
and then suddenly I was looking down at door in the ground,

1093
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,060
and that's where the numbers were.

1094
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,520
The numbers spelled out overseer,

1095
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,520
and I saw the dusty, it looked like really old contention,

1096
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,800
and there was that guy face down, like you said.

1097
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,800
When I was in the belly of that beast, I had a vision.

1098
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,260
Well, I saw my brother in Bean's Pond,

1099
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,640
but there was no water in it,

1100
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,020
and he was looking at a door in the ground

1101
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,720
in the bottom of Bean's Pond.

1102
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,040
If I interpreted my visions correctly,

1103
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,460
I think you're onto something.

1104
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,220
Bean's Pond is involved in some way.

1105
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,500
Before I brought it up,

1106
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,240
I wanted you guys to see that watch,

1107
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,700
but I think we need to go there.

1108
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,540
Yeah, I mean.

1109
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,420
What do you guys think is the bigger fish

1110
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,500
that we need to fry?

1111
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,440
Well, once the pastor knows we're here, he knows we're here,

1112
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,540
and we're not gonna be able to get much done.

1113
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,740
But we do need to save Drew from him.

1114
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,980
I don't know, boys.

1115
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,940
Maybe if we find the door, it'll help us.

1116
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,320
It's gotta mean something.

1117
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,300
If we happen to choose wrong,

1118
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,040
we'll hopefully just reset, right?

1119
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,880
I mean.

1120
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,160
We got all the time in the world.

1121
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,000
I would hope so.

1122
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,800
In increments of two hours every day.

1123
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,960
We never know when our last, you know, what if it stops?

1124
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,960
Well, we were lucky to have gotten this far, I think.

1125
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,800
You know.

1126
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Really, any time after our first deaths is a blessing,

1127
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,000
so let's just be thankful for what we got,

1128
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,660
you know.

1129
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,980
Don't beat yourself up over losing something

1130
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,700
you don't even have yet, you know what I mean?

1131
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,980
Well, I mean, I think we oughta go find the doors.

1132
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,820
It's been on my mind for days.

1133
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,900
Yeah, let's fucking knock on these doors.

1134
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,180
So we're heading to Bean's Pond, eh?

1135
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,160
Yeah, and I mean, we gotta get to the bottom of it,

1136
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,940
but the water might be there, and I point to the wall.

1137
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,300
Have you put the watch on more than once, Keith?

1138
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,020
No, as soon as I put it on and I locked it up,

1139
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,760
as soon as I took it off.

1140
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,240
Okay, Zach, just in the interest of podcast time,

1141
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,400
if I put this on, will I have the same vision again

1142
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,520
or a different vision?

1143
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,960
That seems like a big question.

1144
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,200
I know, but if the answer is just the same,

1145
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,960
we can move right along, but.

1146
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,520
I think you have to say you'll do it, and then see what happens.

1147
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,560
Since you asked me that, here, give me that back,

1148
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,120
and I take the watch and put it on one more time.

1149
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:49,080
reality blinks and flickers in a now familiar but still unsettling way and you're standing

1150
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:56,740
over a man's body who's face down in the dry cracked dirt the smell of piss and shit wafts

1151
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:03,360
through the humid summer air and looking down the road to your perceived destination you

1152
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:10,800
recognize your hometown of contention back to the body on the ground your hands are trembling

1153
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,680
as you roll him over a dead man in his mid-20s stiff as a glass of moonshine dressed in the

1154
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:24,260
fashion of the day which is the late 1800s and a tri-folded piece of parchment falls

1155
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:31,000
out of this deceased man's jacket pocket it's a job advertisement for the contention mining

1156
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:40,840
company and it reads we is hiring able bodies readying untapped site plenty of work hesitate

1157
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,200
not

1158
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:16,160
try

1159
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,160
bye
