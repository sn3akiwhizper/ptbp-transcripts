00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello my students, it's your professor Wolf the Dog and I'm here to teach you all about

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:14,720
what's synthesizing here on 694.2 PTBP, Contentions only form of education.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:22,440
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from AtKCruise36 on Twitter who tagged at PretendingPod, an

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,440
A plus thing to do my students.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,120
The people of contention are fed up with our incompetent gun-crazy police force.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,440
We the committee to unite the nearby townsfolk refuse to let good, hard-working folks be

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,780
terrorized by the likes of a petty more firing wildly into the sky.

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,860
The good lord knows we've suffered enough and the overflow in the offering plate shows

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,360
this to be true.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,200
Head on down to the first church of contention to salve your soul and enjoy some casserole

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,360
prepared by our lady's auxiliary.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,880
Coffee is always hot and so, so black y'all.

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,100
Speaking of the first church of contention, go ahead and send thoughts and prayers to

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,880
Pastor Adam Cain.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,000
We all know he's going through hell today.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,060
However, Professor Wolf is here to talk facts with y'all.

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,560
It's time for the news my babies.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,920
Earlier this evening, the officers cleaned themselves up after fighting a large robot

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,520
man with feelings, perhaps.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,120
Is it a robot if it has feelings?

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,280
What are the rules here, I don't know.

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,480
Keith Wigner found a single piece of music called The Rise of the End in the bench of

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,280
the stringless piano.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,020
If that's true and I'm sober, that's high strangeness.

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,520
Clark Bishop found, in the flipped over coffee table, blueprints for calm, comfy campground.

26
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,980
A suspiciously planned out set of seven buildings, six encircling a large one in the center that

27
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,020
sits on Lake Combe.

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
A similar design was found drawn on a piece of paper in the pocket of one of those two

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,380
corpses they found in the pit under the trap door that Bishop fell into.

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,860
Then in James the Millworker's house, the officers remembered that he died in Chief

31
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,900
Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head, face down and a plate of foot meat.

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,300
They also remember the contents of the present that she received from an unknown source the

33
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,900
night she took off.

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:32,180
A red rose, a white hot hat, and a black silk bow tie.

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,360
All of which were present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
statue respectively.

37
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,800
After undressing the bottom half of the still standing robot man, the gang finds a logo

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,680
on the smooth pelvic area.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,440
It is an M made out of four double helices.

40
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,020
They voted and decided to store the legs in Keith's cruiser's trunk.

41
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,000
Is it just me or is life getting stranger and stranger around here?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,400
An educator of the masses, Wolf, had another scary dream.

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,360
Today on December 4th, during a nap, I was eating a glass of water and began bleeding

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,840
all over the floor.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,640
I looked down and my dog Wolf was lapping up the blood.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,820
So then he looks up at me and he has a fish in his mouth and it's flopping around.

47
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,760
The blood from my mouth pours all over my wolf and then my dog's face is the face of

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,480
that fish and in the fish's mouth is my face.

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,080
Now class, find a partner for this next assignment or work in a group or fly solo.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,200
It's your life and it also cuts you with no back bone.

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:11,880
Alright, maybe, maybe we should just get a good night's sleep and check out the mill

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
in the morning.

53
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,240
Because nobody's going to be at the mill right now.

54
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,480
Yeah, it'd be a good time for snooping but not a great time for investing.

55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,080
I think it's a better time for snoozing than snooping.

56
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,680
That's the second smartest thing you've ever said.

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,320
I could get a few winks in, that's for sure.

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,440
Okay, hey John, do you want to just crash at my place because I think, I mean it's closer

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,400
than going all the way out to your house.

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,880
Keith, man, you know that's nice but hotel rooms just depress me and I'm really looking

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,040
forward to getting back to my home, just how I like it, you know.

62
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,440
Maybe we should all stay, maybe we should all stay at Clark's house so that we're together

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,720
just in case something dangerous happens.

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
I got plenty of beds.

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Yeah, he does, he has plenty of beds.

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,880
I know we're just not a giant robot but are you a little, maybe you should go sleep with

67
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,120
Clark buddy, that's fine, there's no shame in a grown man being afraid after a robot

68
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
encounter.

69
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,640
No, I'm not afraid, I'm just thinking that we should probably all stick together at this

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
point.

71
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
You know, some weird shit's going on.

72
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
No man, I like-

73
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,880
What if the ooze, what if the, what's the closest waterway to you, you know?

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,640
Well there's actually, there's a beautiful little creek that runs right through my property.

75
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Okay, well-

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,160
You guys can come, do you want to come stay out there, Keith?

77
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,480
No, not really.

78
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Okay.

79
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,880
Oh actually, yeah, I forgot, I kind of have, well I'm going to call up this girl later

80
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
so.

81
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Okay, well-

82
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
I'm pretty excited to show her my-

83
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Also-

84
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Zeke's a Hazard DVDs.

85
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
You guys have your-

86
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
And Smokey and the Bandit.

87
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,760
You guys have your cars at the police station?

88
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Well-

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,120
I don't think we have cars in, I think-

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,440
Yeah, there's some cruisers but we need to get replacement cruisers.

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,560
The cruisers are still destroyed, right?

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
That is correct.

93
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Yeah, I've got my-

94
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720
You've got a truck out at your property-

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Yeah, for sure.

96
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
That we talked about.

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Oh wait, and then do you have a-

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,400
I don't think I do.

99
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,600
So you know, guys, I think it'd just be easiest for us to all stay at Clark's house tonight

100
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,440
since we only have one car.

101
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,800
You get pretty easily-

102
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,200
Yeah, I mean, the station's even easier to get to and we can just get new cars, buddy.

103
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,920
You have an impound lot so you can just take cars that have been impounded.

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,800
Okay, well, I guess I'll take you to the impound lot.

105
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,880
Hey Clark, man, can I talk to you for a second?

106
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,960
You know, I think Vigna's afraid of something and maybe just invite him over for a little

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
sleepover or something.

108
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,280
He doesn't seem like he wants to-

109
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,560
He seems spooked, you're right, you're right.

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,440
I'll put a word in his ear for sure, let him know he's welcome.

111
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Yeah.

112
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Oh, hey, so you sure you don't want to have a sleepover over at Clark's?

113
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,600
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,880
Keith, you're more than welcome, though, to hang out for a little while, you know?

115
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, I mean, I just, you know, I don't-

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,040
Buddy, this is cute, but I'm going back to my house.

117
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
You know what?

118
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
I'll take you up on that.

119
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
You got a spare bed?

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Yeah, I got a spare bed, Keith.

121
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Okay.

122
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
You like Salisbury Steak?

123
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
It will probably be safer for you tonight if you're with Clark.

124
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,920
Do you have Game Show Network?

125
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,120
As a matter of fact, I watch Wheel of Fortune every night.

126
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Dude, I'm down to watch whatever's on Game Show Network, whether it be Match Game, Cash

127
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,440
Cab, Wheel of Fortune, whatever's going on.

128
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
I like that Cash Cab.

129
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,600
We're going to watch Wheel of Fortune, but I gotta warn you, I get a puzzle sometimes

130
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
a time.

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,960
Hey, well, let's see if I can't bestie on at least one round.

132
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Ooh, good luck.

133
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,080
Okay, so I drive the three of us to the impound lot.

134
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,520
What kind of car do you get?

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
That is the question.

136
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Yeah.

137
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:37,400
John Lee Pettymore is in the mood for the classics tonight, so I'm going to take a dope,

138
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,760
I don't know, cars, a cool 70s car.

139
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,680
How about like a Stingray Corvette, dude?

140
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,020
Do we have one of those?

141
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,500
Probably not impounded.

142
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,380
A 91.

143
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,300
There's a pretty sweet 91 Toyota Corolla.

144
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Is it all modded?

145
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
No.

146
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
No.

147
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Okay.

148
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
No.

149
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,300
When I said sweet, I was lying.

150
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
What about like a...

151
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,220
There's a cool lime green GEO over there.

152
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,220
No, I'm good.

153
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,820
I'll take the Corolla, I guess.

154
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,620
I'm going to take a 1990 Lincoln Town Car.

155
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
Nice.

156
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
Whoa.

157
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,460
I'm going to just stay in my cruiser.

158
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,620
My stepdad had one of those.

159
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,620
Really?

160
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,620
I think that year and everything.

161
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,220
He had one.

162
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,220
I remember feeling like it felt like a boat inside.

163
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,220
It was so wide.

164
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
It super is, yeah.

165
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,220
Okay.

166
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,940
And here are the keys for those.

167
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:30,460
And yeah, as soon as we get the cruisers back in working order, I'll make sure that you're

168
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
in them.

169
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:39,100
But for now, maybe let's not let the town know that you're cruising around in cars from

170
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,900
the impound lot, probably.

171
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
Oh, yeah.

172
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,140
I mean, definitely not a great idea.

173
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,860
I mean, don't like, you know...

174
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,340
Hey, Drew, I'll see you around, buddy.

175
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,260
And I drift out of the parking lot.

176
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Okay.

177
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,860
Hey, Clark, I'll just follow you back home.

178
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,860
Follow me back over there?

179
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Yeah, of course.

180
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,860
How old is it?

181
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Nine.

182
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
Nine thirty, maybe now.

183
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Sure.

184
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Are there any late night food spots open?

185
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
Yeah.

186
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
I mean, you can always get a burger at Burgatory.

187
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
And Daily Fuzz is still open.

188
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,060
Well, I mean, you offered me Sal's Berry Steak.

189
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
That sounds...

190
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,540
I tell you what, I've been looking forward to my chicken nugget dinner.

191
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,540
So...

192
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
Okay.

193
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Bring me a burger, bring it over.

194
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
That's fine.

195
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,940
Well, I mean, really what I'd like to do is have a bishop night.

196
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,760
Do you have an extra for me?

197
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
I got you.

198
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,360
I got a Sal's Berry Steak I've been holding back.

199
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
You can have that one.

200
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Okay.

201
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,520
I'll just follow you home, then.

202
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,780
Who wants to go first?

203
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
You guys?

204
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Whatever you want.

205
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,780
If you want to go first.

206
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,780
I think maybe...

207
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Yeah, we'll have you guys here first.

208
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:50,540
I pull up into my driveway where you coming straight behind me?

209
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Yeah, I was falling right behind you.

210
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,140
So I wait for him to get out of his car and I go up the steps, unlock my door and...

211
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,500
You got a driveway that's two cars wide, right?

212
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,980
I picture it one car wide.

213
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
Okay.

214
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,980
So I park behind you then.

215
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
Yep.

216
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,260
And I go up and unlock the door and I just kind of leave it open, but just walk straight

217
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,160
in and head toward the kitchen.

218
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,340
I get out of my cruiser.

219
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,620
I go to my trunk, I pop it open.

220
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:23,140
I see the legs of the robot in there and I forcefully pull up the false bottom and I

221
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:30,780
grab a bag of chips and a couple of Slim Jims and I drop it down, close my trunk and I walk

222
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,300
in and I walk in the open door, close it behind me and I look at Clark, I go, I brought a

223
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
couple of snacks.

224
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,540
I know we got a couple of meals going, but you know, I figured for maybe, maybe we could

225
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:48,220
watch a couple episodes and I put that on his coffee table and that'd be a good snack.

226
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,700
I go to my freezer and I pull out the chicken nuggets and I pull out the Salisbury steak

227
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,900
and Clark has always ever done one frozen dinner at a time.

228
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,760
So he's kind of baffled right now and he thinks about it for a while and then he puts both

229
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,700
of them into the microwave and just doubles the time.

230
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,520
I sit down, uh, Clark, could you describe, well, not Clark, but uh, could, could you

231
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,740
describe Clark's like a furniture situation?

232
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,660
Yeah, there's a couch that is along the window next to the door and there's a recliner right

233
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,880
across from the TV and everything is kind of dated.

234
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,340
So if I, if I sat on the couch, it would be in view of the television, view of the television,

235
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,620
but perpendicular to it.

236
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,060
So it's a little off kilter.

237
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,340
So, uh, I sit down on the side of the couch, closest, you just make yourself at home over

238
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
there Keith.

239
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,260
Mi casa, su casa, as the Spanish say.

240
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,300
I sit down on the side of the couch that's closest to like the, the, the, the best view

241
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,780
of the television cause I know that I'm in your house, you're cooking me food.

242
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,220
I did bring snacks over, but I don't, I don't feel like I should sit in your recliner.

243
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,140
So I sit down on that side of the couch, but I also do scoot the couch up a little

244
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,140
closer to TV.

245
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,980
I walk in and kind of pause.

246
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,940
Uh, did you move it?

247
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
Did you move the couch there?

248
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,900
Yeah, I just, you know, I figured if we're watching TV, I might as well, is that, I,

249
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,340
and I, I immediately, I move it back, scratching up the floor again as I move it back.

250
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,340
Clark winces.

251
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,340
I'm sorry, man.

252
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,500
So I get up and I, um, no, it's, it's, it's fine.

253
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,180
You're just Clark, just sit down.

254
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
Just sit down.

255
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,620
No, I got to keep an eye on these.

256
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
You know what?

257
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
I'm the guest here.

258
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,820
I'll, I'll keep an eye on the food.

259
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,100
You just sit down in your recliner, pop, pop the legs up, sit down.

260
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Don't worry about it.

261
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
I, you know what?

262
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
I'm the guest.

263
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,180
I'm, I'm here to take care of you.

264
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,180
Clark uneasily sits down in the recliner.

265
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,340
I sit down on the, the, uh, the arm of the recliner and I'm like, you know, I'll just,

266
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,300
as soon as that microwave goes off, I'll, I'll get our stuff.

267
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:04,820
And I, I put my arm around Clark and I, I'm like, you know, turn on that game show network.

268
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,300
You know, this is a nice little bonding.

269
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,620
Clark leans forward real hard to get out of the arm and grabs the remote.

270
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,260
And I, I kinda, I pull my arm up and understanding how uncomfortable he is, I'm like, is this

271
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
good?

272
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:27,980
Now, how is the couch placed within the room?

273
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,780
Uh, I do want to emphasize that the house is immaculate.

274
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,900
Like I keep it pretty Spartan and clean.

275
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:39,260
I flip on the game show network and uh, I instantly kind of do the slack jot in front

276
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,020
of the TV face for, Oh, Hey, um, I kind of start to pop up.

277
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,860
No, I, I almost smells like plastic burning.

278
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,700
I almost forcefully like put my hand on Clark's chest and push him down into his comfy chair.

279
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
I kiss Keith.

280
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,700
I'll get it.

281
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:11,020
The microwave goes off, I get up and I, I go, I don't really, okay, um, ding.

282
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,840
I get up off the arm chair of the lazy boy and I go to the microwave and I open it up

283
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:24,680
and um, I see two microwave dinners stacked on top of each other and the plastic on the

284
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,800
top part is just melted into my Salisbury steak.

285
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,540
So I pull them out and like the chicken nuggets are cooked well and like I peel the plastic

286
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,440
top off of that and I'm like, Oh, these look good.

287
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,240
So I grabbed the chicken nugget, I swish it around in the mashed potato part of that and

288
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I pop it in my mouth.

289
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I'm like, yeah, that's pretty good.

290
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,760
It burns the fuck out of your mouth.

291
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
Yeah.

292
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,720
So did you pass your constitution check?

293
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
I did actually.

294
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Yeah.

295
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
All right.

296
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
You can, you can deal with it.

297
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
So I, and then I get the Salisbury steak, the plastic is melted onto the Salisbury steak.

298
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,700
I try to peel the plastic off, but like I, it takes me like eight different peeling off

299
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,700
the edges to get in.

300
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,320
There's still a plastic on there, but I'm like, yeah, what, I mean, I'm a guest in this

301
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
house.

302
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Fuck it.

303
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:21,640
So, um, yeah, so I bring, um, both TV dinners in there and I sit back down on the arm of

304
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,600
of Clark's chair and I'm like, okay, let's watch.

305
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,440
Uh, what is this like a, like jeopardy or something?

306
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,360
I only have one TV dinner tray stand that I use.

307
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,360
So I go over and grab that and I kind of start setting it up in front of me and I look up

308
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,400
at Keith sitting on the arm of my chair and I'm, Hey, you know, you can, you can use this.

309
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,360
Go, go take that over to that couch over there.

310
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,960
No dude, that's okay.

311
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
You can.

312
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,760
I stand up and start setting up the tray in front of the couch.

313
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
You can use it.

314
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,600
And I put it back in front of him.

315
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,960
Just lay, lay down and, and don't worry about it.

316
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,360
I'm just going to sit right here.

317
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,840
I I'm real, I'm, I'm starting to get a little weirded out that he's wanting to hover around

318
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
me.

319
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,040
So this is uncomfortable.

320
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,640
And I looked down at my chicken nugget tray and Hey, he, these usually have eight nuggets

321
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,880
in them, but this one only has, Oh yeah, that's, I was gonna, and I, I like

322
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,320
use my plastic fork to cut a little piece of my Salisbury steak out and I put it on

323
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,120
his chicken nugget tray, but it's the one piece of Salisbury steak that has like the

324
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,000
plastic still melted on top of it.

325
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You know what?

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,520
I will take that tray and I take the tray.

327
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,520
I go sit down on the edge of the couch and I'm like, okay, let's uh, let's just play

328
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,360
wheel fortune or how are, you know, that goes right buddy.

329
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,680
I uh, those chicken nuggets are cooked very well by the way.

330
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,400
I, I, I, uh, I kind of fumble with the, uh, the plastic on the Salisbury steak and I popped

331
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,280
that into my mouth first and I'm like, I do like that.

332
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
I do really like that.

333
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Salisbury steak.

334
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
It's a good one.

335
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I gave you just so you know.

336
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Yeah.

337
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:09,440
I mean, and I, um, I, uh, take, I take like a little bite of it and like, it's okay.

338
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,520
I, for the sake of time, I finished my entire meal real quick and I like without a word

339
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,560
stand up and start walking back to the bedrooms and I go into like a linen closet and I get

340
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,800
out like a pillow and some sheets and I go into the spare bedroom that has a bed in it

341
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,160
but is bare and I get the sheets all on it.

342
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,400
Hey, uh, Keith, uh, I got your bed ready.

343
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Dude.

344
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,560
This show is kind of like hangman real quick.

345
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:44,240
I need you both to roll an intelligence check against each other.

346
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,800
I got a 39 on a 55.

347
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,280
I got a 73 on a 50.

348
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,440
Clark wipes the floor with Keith while playing along to wheel of fortune.

349
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Nice.

350
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Anyway, that was happening.

351
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,200
Oh, I mean, I tell you what Keith, I watch this about every night, so don't feel bad.

352
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,760
You came up against a master.

353
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Yeah.

354
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Okay.

355
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,320
I think I might go home honestly, but oh, you don't want to.

356
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,760
I got the bed ready and if you're feeling, if you're feeling comfortable on your own

357
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,840
tonight, I respect that you should, you know, I think I forgot why I came over here initially.

358
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,040
It wasn't to, it was to hang out with you, Clark.

359
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,720
That's that I'll, I'll stay here.

360
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,080
It wasn't for any other reason other than I just wanted to hang out with you.

361
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Yeah.

362
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Of course.

363
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
I had a great time.

364
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,920
He knows deep inside that Keith was just real scared tonight about all the things we'd seen

365
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,640
today and he knows that he's, this is his way of reaching out for comfort and this is

366
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
time of need.

367
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,060
Um, I go to sleep in the bed that Clark has made for me.

368
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,960
I wait until Clark goes to sleep.

369
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Yeah.

370
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,360
I go ahead and go to bed like right, like after that conversation, I'm like, I want

371
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,040
to, I want to pass out.

372
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,180
I call my landlord at the hotel and I say, Hey, is there an open room that I can stay

373
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,540
in besides my own tonight?

374
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,540
Cause I've got somebody that might be after me in the morning.

375
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,580
There's definitely an open room.

376
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,860
So I, um, I clean up our TV dinners.

377
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,940
I move the couch back.

378
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,500
I quietly leave Bishop's house.

379
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:31,180
Keith, when you may get back to hotel motel, you are getting out of your police cruiser

380
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,660
when a young girl approaches you.

381
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,800
She seems to be a high schooler and you recognize her.

382
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,100
This is your niece.

383
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,020
It's Ferguson's daughter.

384
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,020
What's her name?

385
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,260
Oh, my niece is Francis beans.

386
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Okay.

387
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:57,660
So Francis Francis, she walks up to you and she puts a finger over her mouth and hands

388
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,980
you a note.

389
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,980
Yeah.

390
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,860
If you want to read that aloud, no one hates my dad more than you.

391
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,860
So I'm coming to you first with this opportunity.

392
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,420
I know you have no love for your parents, especially after they left everything to Fergie,

393
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,360
but I recently found out their deaths for no accident.

394
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,460
He killed them when he needed the money.

395
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,360
I found his will all of his money.

396
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,860
Some of which I think you deserve goes to me upon his death.

397
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,860
I will give you $1 million to kill my dad, please.

398
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,200
We deserve it.

399
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,300
He deserves it.

400
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,200
Follow me in your car, but don't make it obvious.

401
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,400
And she holds a lighter underneath the note and she lights it.

402
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
She kind of motions.

403
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,580
I throw the note off to the side as it's burning.

404
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:56,680
And she goes over and hops in her Chrysler Sebring and kind of motions for you to follow

405
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
her.

406
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I look around.

407
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,440
Can I do a search for anyone around us?

408
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
Sure.

409
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Yeah.

410
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
Six.

411
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,500
You see that no one is out and about right now.

412
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
No one's watching.

413
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,860
I reluctantly get in the passenger side of her car.

414
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:21,700
When you get into her car, she looks at you and she rolls her eyes and she's like, um,

415
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,840
maybe get in your own car.

416
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,440
Maybe follow me in your car.

417
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,860
Like it said on the fucking note, maybe.

418
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,340
No, take me to where you're going to go.

419
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,340
Okay.

420
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,380
And she drives up and hops on the highway and heads toward the city.

421
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,060
John Lee Pettymore, as you were driving north through contention on the way to your home,

422
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,340
you go over the bridge that travels over Coles Creek.

423
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,440
Looking out the window of your borrowed and pounded vehicle, you see animals of all size

424
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,940
and type filling the waters below, but you notice there are fewer and fewer animals the

425
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,960
farther north you drive.

426
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,780
After passing the highway and leaving the city limits of contention, you turn down a

427
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:25,180
long gravel road that eventually leads to the isolated home of officer Pettymore.

428
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,940
What do you do upon arrival?

429
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,740
I'm going to give Drew a call real quick.

430
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,020
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

431
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,520
Hey.

432
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,820
Hey Drew, is everything set for tonight?

433
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,820
Everything's ready to go.

434
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,820
When do you want me to come out?

435
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,500
Uh, what time did you tell them to meet?

436
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
2 a.m.

437
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
2 a.m.

438
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
All right.

439
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Why don't you get here around midnight?

440
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Okay, perfect.

441
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
All right.

442
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I'll see you then.

443
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
All right.

444
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Okay.

445
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I'm excited buddy.

446
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Me too.

447
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
We're going to be rich.

448
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Hopefully.

449
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Okay.

450
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Okay.

451
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,860
Like John Lee Pettymore gives himself a moment to, uh, to imagine that just like, what if,

452
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
what if it does all go well?

453
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,340
What if I do get that money and he, he sits in the, the Toyota Corolla for about five

454
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,820
minutes just like letting himself feel that and kind of trying to de-stress a little bit.

455
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:15,360
He's going to try to get a little nap before, before, uh, everything goes down.

456
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,620
So yeah, he's just excited to get back to his home.

457
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,620
Absolutely.

458
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,780
As you walk into your house, however, your entire home has been flipped over.

459
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,620
It looks like someone broke in and rifled through all of your shit.

460
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,080
What the hell?

461
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,300
What the fucking hell?

462
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,220
As you're going through room by room, trying to piece together what's happening with your

463
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:44,660
gun out, you notice that you're, uh, Smokey and the Bandit DVDs and all the memorabilia

464
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,020
has been knocked over.

465
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,700
Some of it's been stepped on.

466
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,780
Smokey's!

467
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,780
I would do such a thing.

468
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,780
God damn it.

469
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,260
First this whole fucking town goes to shit and then somebody steps on my Smokey DVDs

470
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:05,300
and now it's fucking, what a goddamn horrible day.

471
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:16,980
And as you are looking about, you see, there is a Burgatory Rewards card for Keith Vigna

472
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
on the floor.

473
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,180
I'm, I'm gonna kill him.

474
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,980
I'm gonna fucking kill that son of a bitch.

475
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:32,860
That idiot, incompetent, coke-addled, motherfucking ransacker, I'm going to kill him.

476
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,780
You say to an empty, turned-over home.

477
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Ah!

478
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,980
I fire my gun several times into the ceiling.

479
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:46,820
Dust and, like, the popcorn from the ceiling starts coming down around you.

480
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
You had popcorn in your ceiling, right?

481
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,300
Yeah, I keep several.

482
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,660
It's cheaper than insulation.

483
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,140
You just go to the stadium.

484
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:00,140
So the sprint car racing, they just used to give me big ol' bags of the popcorn.

485
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,620
If you keep it in plastic, it doesn't go bad.

486
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,700
And that is, yeah, the squirrels had chewed through all my old shit, so.

487
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,500
They definitely won't chew through the popcorn.

488
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Well not in plastic.

489
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,180
They can't smell it.

490
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,940
It does, I mean, now that it's raining down on me here, it does look like the squirrel,

491
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,940
yeah, like, it's mostly just kernels, so, I think that, yeah, I think they got into

492
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,940
it.

493
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
Yeah.

494
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,500
He lets his frustration out, shooting, shooting his gun into the roof, and then he just collapses

495
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,140
onto the couch, dejected.

496
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,780
Would you run and try to make sure that the cocaine is still where you put it?

497
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,500
Would you be worried about that?

498
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
No.

499
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,940
Well, it was dark, but it would have taken, like, excavation to get it, yeah, and I don't

500
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
think I saw any signs of that.

501
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,460
How are you prepping for the deal that's going down?

502
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,580
I don't think he would sleep now.

503
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,660
I think he's too angry to sleep.

504
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:57,580
John Lee Pennymore just needs to stay focused, and he is unspeakably angry at Keith, but

505
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,920
he's going to rechannel that anger into just energy for tonight.

506
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:08,340
What he's going to do right now is smoke a big ol' bowl and put on smoking the bandit

507
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:13,580
and just de-stress for a minute and just fucking try to forget it all for a minute.

508
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,540
I'm going to be a rich man in two hours.

509
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,260
I just got to fucking, er, four hours.

510
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,300
Drew gets here in two hours.

511
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:33,780
I just got to calm down, watch Smokey, and then tomorrow I'm going to kill Keith Igna.

512
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,020
Then the credits roll on Smokey and the bandit extended cut.

513
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,020
The doorbell rings.

514
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,660
Gun draw, and I go to the door.

515
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Yeah, it's Drew.

516
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,660
I peek through.

517
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Hey, hey, buddy.

518
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
Hey!

519
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,660
Come on in.

520
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,660
Okay, cool.

521
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:52,460
And he is holding a pistol, and he is holding it, like, by the top.

522
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,060
Hey, Drew, you ever shot one of those before?

523
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Nope.

524
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Okay, we got a couple hours.

525
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,300
I'm going to give you a quick rundown on all this.

526
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,260
See, here's the safety.

527
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
You got that off.

528
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Yep.

529
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,260
Yeah, you want to put that on.

530
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,260
Oh, okay.

531
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,260
Let's go.

532
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,260
I got a shooting tree.

533
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,260
Let's go back and shoot the shooting tree for a minute.

534
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,700
You guys go back and shoot the shooting tree for a minute, and he's not, you know, he's

535
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
not good.

536
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,580
I at least want to teach him how to, like, hold it.

537
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
Yeah, you don't think he's going to shoot you.

538
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
No.

539
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,620
Unless things get really bad, I want you to just keep that safety on, but I do feel like

540
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,900
we've taught you how to hold this and look more intimidating to the mafia.

541
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,900
I couldn't agree more.

542
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,020
I look very intimidating.

543
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,460
She says with four inches of gums just hanging out.

544
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,740
Man, Emmett made the right call.

545
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Emmett's so cool.

546
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
What'd you say?

547
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
Nothing, buddy.

548
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
Okay, cool.

549
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,340
You're, hey, you can get a billion gum surgeries with all the money we're going to have.

550
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,340
I didn't even consider, oh my goodness.

551
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,180
Think about that, buddy.

552
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,980
John, what's sex like?

553
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,540
That's not bad.

554
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
Okay.

555
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
Maybe one day.

556
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,540
How old are you, dude?

557
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
I'm 57.

558
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
No.

559
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,980
He's in his early 30s.

560
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,060
God, you must moisturize.

561
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,300
We're getting you laid.

562
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
We're going to get you laid tonight.

563
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Okay.

564
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Probably not tonight.

565
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
I'm very tired.

566
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,420
I should not be making a cocaine deal at two in the morning.

567
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,500
I'm extremely wounded and this town is beset by unnatural horrors.

568
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,940
So maybe we'll have to wait until next week, but we'll get you laid, buddy.

569
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Okay.

570
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
Oh my goodness.

571
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
Okay, cool.

572
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,940
Is there a strip club in town?

573
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,020
No, there's just a, there's an auto mechanic called sassy reds.

574
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
Okay.

575
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,240
It's a pink Cadillac.

576
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,980
It's coming up on, that's so much better.

577
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,460
So it's coming up on 2 AM.

578
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,340
I'm going to go ahead and have you lose two willpower for me.

579
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
Okay.

580
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
I'm down to eight.

581
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,540
And then what do you want to do last minute?

582
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,060
Get ready.

583
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,020
You think they could probably be rolling up whenever.

584
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,220
So drew, I've, I've made some arrangements here.

585
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,300
I'm just going to check to make sure that's all on place.

586
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,180
Just out to the woods.

587
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:10,980
I just kind of make a bird call and a similar, but slightly different bird returns.

588
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,980
The call.

589
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,300
I love the great Northern collar.

590
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
It's my favorite bird.

591
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
Drew.

592
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
How about you?

593
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Oh, I've never heard of that one.

594
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,620
I'm a fan of pigeons.

595
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,620
Okay.

596
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,060
Those sure are birds.

597
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,020
Uh, I'm going to do a little bump too.

598
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
Okay, cool.

599
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,940
Go ahead and roll a D six, four, four willpower back, full.

600
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
Yeah.

601
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
12.

602
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,100
It feels to you like right before lunch, I'm ready to start my day.

603
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:46,420
That's a joke, but that's also just true to John and Thomas.

604
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:52,460
Well, we've established that John goes to work at like 7 AM.

605
00:29:52,500 --> 00:30:00,100
Okay, so you hear a car turn down your road, you've got a long driveway and you see the

606
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:09,660
lights and it is a large white 15 passenger van that is pulling a white trailer behind

607
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:17,420
it and as it pulls up to your homestead, you would see painted on the van as well as the

608
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,540
trailer in large block letters, it says Jesus Christ ministries.

609
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
Oh shit.

610
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:29,740
As you're looking at it, it looks like the 15 passenger van is filled with children.

611
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,540
Hey, uh, uh, Drew, what the fuck are all the kids doing in the van?

612
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,340
I have absolutely no idea.

613
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,580
Um, who are we meeting exactly?

614
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,580
His name is the Duke.

615
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
He's with the mafia?

616
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
I don't-

617
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,580
How do you know the Duke?

618
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,580
I-I-

619
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,500
God, we should have covered some of this before.

620
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Probably.

621
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:52,140
As you guys are having that conversation, the van passenger door opens up and the most

622
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,620
handsome man you've ever seen gets out of the van.

623
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:02,980
He has perfect hair, perfect teeth, a perfect jawline and he is wearing the fuck out of

624
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:11,180
a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel and he begins walking

625
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,140
up to the two of you on the porch and he just stands there.

626
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,740
He's the Duke?

627
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,260
Yes I am.

628
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,740
Are you Drew?

629
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,740
Drew's here.

630
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:30,300
Uh, yes, I'm Drew and I believe you've got some cocaine for me, is that correct?

631
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,940
I believe you have some money for us?

632
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,380
Uh, that is certainly correct.

633
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,740
Alright, well we'll point your boys where to dig in.

634
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,980
We got the cocaine on the property here, store it away, uh, why don't you show us the money?

635
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,580
You give half of it to us, we'll show you the first hole, give us the other half, we'll

636
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,100
show you the second hole.

637
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,300
Seems like a deal.

638
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,860
He is going to turn around and walk back into the van.

639
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:02,540
He kind of leans in, you hear him say something, and then he comes back out with a briefcase

640
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,260
handcuffed to his wrist.

641
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:14,460
I've got half, which is five billion dollars US currency, in this briefcase.

642
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:20,420
And you see a bunch of children run out, they're all carrying shovels, and they stay pretty

643
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,500
far away, they're like on the other side of the van, they all kind of line up, like staring

644
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,900
at you, all holding the shovels in the exact same way in front of them.

645
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,540
And he says, where do you want me to dig?

646
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,860
Drew, go take a look at that briefcase, make sure everything's alright.

647
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,860
Okay.

648
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:43,300
And he pops over there, looks into the briefcase, he cracks it open, closes it right back up,

649
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,980
Drew walks back, I don't know, it seems like a whole shitload of money in there, John.

650
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,300
Alright buddy, hold onto your britches, you're not Keith.

651
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Keith, his britches too big.

652
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,460
Yeah, I think they're too big.

653
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
Too big.

654
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,460
Yeah, so they fall off.

655
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
Fucking first.

656
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,020
Anyway, alright, just hold onto your britches buddy, we're not through this yet.

657
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:11,300
Alright Duke, you see that maple tree over there?

658
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,540
Get to digging.

659
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:20,900
And he points, and the children in a beautiful single file line, all with the same movements

660
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,500
run over, and all at the exact same time begin digging.

661
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,900
Mr. Duke, while you got your children there digging, can I ask you a couple questions?

662
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
Go for it.

663
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,380
Uh, why you got children out here digging for cocaine at two in the morning?

664
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,980
I didn't have anybody else.

665
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,980
How'd you get them?

666
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,180
Um, well, I made those children.

667
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
They're yours?

668
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,180
Yep.

669
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,180
Same mom?

670
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,580
Uh, yeah, yeah, you can say that.

671
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:52,420
And he walks back over, and these kids are digging so fucking fast, dirt is just like

672
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,660
flying everywhere, and they get down and, I'm assuming this is where the cocaine is,

673
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,660
is that correct?

674
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,700
Okay, so about half of it.

675
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:09,380
And they start piling the cocaine into the trailer that is being pulled behind the van.

676
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:16,900
And the Duke walks over and unlatches the handcuff from the other end and hands you

677
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
the briefcase.

678
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,660
There's five million dollars in it.

679
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
Alright.

680
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,900
That's, wow, that's a lot of money.

681
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,820
Duke, uh, Duke, Duke, show us the other case.

682
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,340
You're a stickler.

683
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,940
And he walks back to the van and hooks another case onto his wrist and walks back over to

684
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,860
you and gives you a peek.

685
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,860
Looks the same.

686
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,460
Alright, just round back behind that woodpile.

687
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,740
Your boy should see the hole.

688
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,580
Well, alright.

689
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:52,380
And he sends the children over to behind the woodpile, and they begin digging just as furiously

690
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,820
as they did the first time.

691
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,500
Drew, can I speak to you for a minute?

692
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Yeah.

693
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,940
You don't know nothing about, what kind of crime is this Duke involved in?

694
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,700
I think he's a drug dealer.

695
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,340
Alright, yeah, that's fair.

696
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
That's fair.

697
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
Uh, how dangerous do you think he is?

698
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,340
I mean, he just brought children.

699
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,540
I haven't told you this, but we've got about a dozen petty moor cousins watching us from

700
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
the trees right now.

701
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
What?

702
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
Yeah, man.

703
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
Overwatch.

704
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Like...

705
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
I thought it was just me and you.

706
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
That takes so much stress off my shoulders.

707
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,100
I should have probably told you, yeah.

708
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Oh my goodness.

709
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,260
But I don't see a fucking, I don't see any goons or muscle, just all these children.

710
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,900
And, you know, I don't want to take candy from a baby, but it seems like we could just

711
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,900
take the ten million dollars and all the cocaine.

712
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,380
What kind of retribution would that bring down upon us?

713
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,940
You want to fuck with a drug dealer from the city?

714
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
Maybe.

715
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,100
I'm just saying, it seems like the opportunity has presented itself.

716
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,500
But then we'd just have to sell the cocaine again.

717
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
This was really stressful.

718
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,060
I've been pooping all day.

719
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:57,140
Yeah, but imagine how easy you would poop from now on if you had ten million dollars.

720
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:02,660
I honestly don't see that much of a difference between five and ten million dollars, but...

721
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,860
It's twice, there's twice a difference.

722
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,500
Yeah, math was never my strong suit, but I just think...

723
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,300
I don't know, it's just a thought I had.

724
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,620
Maybe he's got somebody watching us, I don't know, but...

725
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,620
John?

726
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,620
Fuck, yeah?

727
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,780
I'm down with whatever you want to do.

728
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,260
Just give me a signal, okay?

729
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,540
Yell bubblegum tree.

730
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,060
What's that mean?

731
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,060
Just kidding.

732
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,980
Oh my god, I got so scared for a moment, and he like hits you on the chest with his hand

733
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
and he's like...

734
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,860
Oh man, you're so silly, I like doing this with you.

735
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,940
Me too Drew, you're a fun guy.

736
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,540
And the children are now taking the second pile of cocaine and loading it up into the

737
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,100
trailer behind this van.

738
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:52,500
And when they are finished, the Duke walks toward you and undoes the lock on the handcuffs

739
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,340
to the briefcase and hands you the briefcase.

740
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,780
Well this is just fucking great.

741
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,860
I love it when a deal goes off without a hitch.

742
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,860
Me too.

743
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,820
This went off far smoother than I expected it to.

744
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,100
I do have a couple questions though.

745
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,180
And I understand I might have to grease your palms to get you to talk, but you just gave

746
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,180
me a shitload of money.

747
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,780
It seems like I'm in a position to give a little bit back and I slip them like a grand.

748
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
What is this for?

749
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,520
That's a down payment for some information.

750
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,500
I wouldn't give me any money until you have the information you think this money is worth.

751
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,460
I think the information I'm looking for might be worth a little bit more than a grand.

752
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,140
You ask the question, I'll name the price, and we can figure it out.

753
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,220
What do you know about Marvin Glass?

754
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:47,340
Well, I don't fucking like him.

755
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,900
I would consider him my competition, I suppose.

756
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:59,660
Although he is also a customer, I guess it's a bit of a mixed bag, my relationship with

757
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,660
Marvin Glass.

758
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,020
A personal customer, or he buys in bulk from you?

759
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,740
That'll be one thousand dollars.

760
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,740
Done.

761
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,180
He buys in bulk.

762
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,300
Do you know anything about his boys?

763
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,300
Like his uh...

764
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
His two sons.

765
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Oh, I don't know.

766
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:20,820
He has them, I don't know, he has them run muscle for them sometimes, he has them shake

767
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
people down.

768
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
I don't fucking know.

769
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,700
Neither one of them have ever been much of a threat to me.

770
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,140
What are y'all hearing in the city about what's been going down under contention?

771
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,500
Anything making the news up there?

772
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:38,460
Well, I have heard, uh, you know, it's a bit on the news that the contingent police department

773
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,780
is uh, doing a pretty fucking terrible job, and they're probably gonna get eroded real

774
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
soon.

775
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,500
So, you know, I don't know, seems like a bunch of death and murder, it's gotten a lot of

776
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,500
the fuzz off my back, I'll tell you that much.

777
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,940
The city fuzz is focusing their attention down here?

778
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:00,180
Well, I don't know, things have been pretty smooth for me recently, I'm not sure what

779
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,180
that's all about.

780
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,940
Hey, Mr. Duke, is there any significance to the rose you wear?

781
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,220
I like the way it smells.

782
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,060
I can't smell, I don't have the sense to smell, it's a joke.

783
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

784
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,860
I look fresh as fuck, don't you think?

785
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,940
You're pretty fly, I mean, it's a good thing you had all those kids to do that digging

786
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,940
with that white suit.

787
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,100
I absolutely agree.

788
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,500
These are all your kids?

789
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,300
And he turns around, Drew, it's good doing business with you, I think we're done here.

790
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,740
And he opens up the passenger door of the van.

791
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:36,580
And the children all load in with military precision before the Duke gives a quick bow,

792
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,900
hops into the white van with Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side, and begins

793
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:48,620
the wide turn necessary to head back down John's long gravel driveway.

794
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:54,700
The van drives away into darkness, and Drew looks at you with wide eyes.

795
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
Drew?

796
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Yeah?

797
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
We're fucking millionaires, buddy.

798
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,700
Oh my god, we're fucking millionaires.

799
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,700
Oh my god.

800
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
This is incredible.

801
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,700
We just gotta get out of this town alive first.

802
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,700
Should we leave tomorrow?

803
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,700
I hadn't, I hadn't thought about it.

804
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,700
Drew, you wouldn't, would you leave the boys at a time like this?

805
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Cause fuck it, man, now that you said it, I think I might.

806
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:32,700
Well, I definitely don't need the paycheck anymore, and honestly, you know, our relationship

807
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,700
has gotten stronger over the past couple days through all this.

808
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,700
You know, I like Clark, Keith can certainly kiss my piss.

809
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,700
Kiss my piss?

810
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Kiss my piss.

811
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:52,700
He hands you, he hands you the firearm that he brought, and he's like, I honestly feel

812
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
really weird holding this.

813
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,700
Hey buddy though, listen, you're a cocaine millionaire now.

814
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
Hold onto it.

815
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
You might need it for protection.

816
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,700
Okay.

817
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,700
And he takes it back, and he's holding it correctly this time.

818
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,700
He actually checks and makes sure the safety is on.

819
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,700
John doesn't say anything, but like he wells up with pride just a little bit.

820
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,700
Jimmy whistles and calls the Pettymore cousins out of the woods.

821
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Awesome.

822
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,700
I'm trying to remember your cousin's name that saw the oil.

823
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Oh yeah.

824
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,700
I don't think I've invited him.

825
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,700
Jimmy.

826
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Not him.

827
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
Not the shrooms guy?

828
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,700
No.

829
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,700
These are younger cousins.

830
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,700
Fair enough.

831
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,700
Like the youngest one is probably like 15.

832
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Okay, yeah.

833
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
Oldest?

834
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
40.

835
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,700
Nice.

836
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
Okay, so they all come out of the woods.

837
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,700
Do you want to describe that?

838
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,700
Yeah.

839
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:48,260
So about eight very clearly Pettymores just step out from behind some trees in a circle

840
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:55,120
around everywhere, and the youngest is 15, the oldest is 40, but they all are unmistakably

841
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,500
of John's family.

842
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,700
Like the blood is strong and perhaps intertwined.

843
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,820
Oh yeah.

844
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,820
And yeah, John-

845
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,700
Nothing stronger than incest blood.

846
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,700
Nope.

847
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,380
John gives them each 10 grand out of his suitcase and says, good work boys.

848
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,020
I'll see you all at the reunion.

849
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,020
They all like-

850
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,340
Oh yeah, and I toss them a 24 pack of keystone light.

851
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,980
Hell yeah.

852
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:24,100
They all like do a jump in the air and like high five each other.

853
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,100
Yeah.

854
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,700
We all take our pistols out and fire them into the air.

855
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,700
Fuck yes.

856
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,700
Freeze frame.

857
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:30,700


858
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,540
Clark, after you go to bed, you are having a little trouble sleeping.

859
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,860
This is the first time someone's slept in your house in a long time.

860
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:59,060
And you actually hear Keith open his door, walk out and you hear him open the front door

861
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,540
and then you hear him leave and you hear a car start up and then you hear the car back

862
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,540
out of the driveway.

863
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,220
I want to get up and go to the front door and lock it.

864
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,220
You do so?

865
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,220
And I'm going to go back to bed.

866
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,220
Okay, cool.

867
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:18,500
So as you go back to your bed, looking out the window, you see Coles Creek which runs

868
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:25,140
alongside your house and it flows down south from the lake at Centennial Park up north.

869
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:31,700
You see the whole thing is packed with animals and a fair few people have been out and about

870
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,460
looking for their pets.

871
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,480
There's maybe one or two people out there now.

872
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:43,520
But then you see another human and this one is in the creek hobbling down the frigid waterway

873
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,040
in your direction.

874
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,200
It's running, but it seems to be fighting through a limp and when he reaches the point

875
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:56,360
in the creek closest to your house, he leaps from the water and begins screaming and waving

876
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,000
his arms all while looking in your specific direction.

877
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,120
I need you to roll Sanity for me.

878
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:08,360
I pass 23 on a 29.

879
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
Okay, cool.

880
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:15,320
You're going to lose one Sanity and I don't know how you're going to rationalize this.

881
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:22,320
Your brain is like having a hard time processing this, but this man making his way toward your

882
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,920
house is you.

883
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,400
Oh shit.

884
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,320
All of a sudden you feel a warm pinch on the back of your neck and your vision tunnels

885
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,560
to a close.

886
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:41,360
You come to as a black bag is being snatched off your head.

887
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,920
You feel hung over and your chest feels weird and tight.

888
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,780
It smells damp and earthy and there's a haze around the torch above you shedding partial

889
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,580
light from the middle of this small stonewalled room.

890
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:04,420
You are sitting in a chair across a stone table from a man with grey hair under a white

891
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:09,260
hard hat in a charcoal suit with a bolo tie.

892
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,980
He looks relaxed as he tosses the black bag onto the table and begins to speak.

893
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:21,220
Okay, so after Richard III's coronation, he was visited by a seer from Leichster who

894
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,960
called himself the overseer.

895
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:30,360
The seer claimed that the now king was to hold some very important knowledge but would

896
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,500
need to have the restraint to not abuse this power.

897
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,860
See, Richard was given this knowledge, but he couldn't handle it.

898
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,740
He lost his mind and killed his two nephews.

899
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:47,580
The overseer, disappointed, eventually passed the same knowledge down to a Henry Tudor so

900
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,140
he could whoop Richard at Bosworth.

901
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:57,020
Henry VII held this power and eventually passed it down to a reliable and trusted confidant,

902
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,860
thankfully not his piece of shit son.

903
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:05,460
This knowledge was passed down repeatedly, abused and respected, respected and abused

904
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,800
until it made its way over the Atlantic to the colonies.

905
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:17,280
Eventually landing with a high order of masons, a select few held this information for generations.

906
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,960
But a grand purpose was never found.

907
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,020
Until Paul Simon.

908
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,960
The politician, not the singer.

909
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,840
Soon after being elected to the Senate, he was walking near his home when he came across

910
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,200
the first known xenonimatode.

911
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,720
He sought out Robert Byrd, the Senate minority leader at the time to share his newfound understanding

912
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,120
of the world.

913
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,800
Thankfully for the world, Byrd was among those carrying the knowledge of the overseer from

914
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,000
centuries before.

915
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,360
Together they formed a small circle of men to hold the weight of this realization.

916
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:58,260
Now today, we carry on their tradition by keeping the darkness out of this world.

917
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,320
We are the opaque rampart delaying the destruction of life as we know it.

918
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,120
Welcome to the circle of knowledge.

919
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,140
Now you have questions, I'm sure.

920
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,360
And I know this sounds hypocritical after that lengthy oration, but as my high school

921
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,840
English teacher would always say, show, don't tell.

922
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:22,120
And he immediately reaches under the table, and as he stands, he holds up an unspeakable

923
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,240
worm-like abomination with one hand away from his body.

924
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:32,560
The thing is two feet long and tube-like, covered in a squeamish black partially translucent

925
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,620
membrane.

926
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:40,720
Its body is segmented, and toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through

927
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,160
its thin looking exterior.

928
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,760
It has no identifiable eyes or nose.

929
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,560
Its cavernous circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked

930
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:00,560
teeth and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black.

931
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:35,720
How am I the only one trying to fool over How can you have enough drowning out of the
