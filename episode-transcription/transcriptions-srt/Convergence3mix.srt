1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
God damn it, y'all.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,740
Shit just keeps getting weirder and weirder around here.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,000
It's your trap tricky trusted teacher wolf the dog,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,080
and I am no longer surrounded by walls.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,880
From my cage, I can see that there is a lot

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,000
of bizarre alien thingies all around me.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,520
Bio luminescence, mushroomy thingies.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,740
What the fuck is going on around here?

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,220
I guess the show still must go on.

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,540
Bullshit working conditions is what this is.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,620
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,380
At Super Nerd Jeff, who is located in Slovenia.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,900
At Super Nerd Jeff tweeted about the show

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,460
and tagged At Pretending Pod,

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,960
the second coolest thing you can do in Slovenia.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,660
The first, dance with the fairies on Bled Island.

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,560
Those little groovers really know how to cut a wool,

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,060
if you know what I mean.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,820
And if you don't, do some damn research.

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,900
Wolf ain't gonna spoon feed you every morsel,

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,540
but I am gonna have.

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,220
At Super Nerd Jeff writes,

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,220
I hope this message reaches you safely, wolf.

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,480
I don't know which lines of communication

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,980
are safe these days.

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,980
You and the boys are doing God's work over at 694.2 PTBP.

27
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,700
Handlers, agents, and dogs everywhere

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,140
could take a leaf out of your creepy freckled

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,780
human skin book.

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,700
To my own agents, it is coming.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,180
The future we have waited and worked so long for.

32
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,540
Foretold in years past, born of pestilence

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,820
and fermented in solitude.

34
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,700
Prepare yourselves.

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,360
Much love from the safe house in Slovenia.

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,120
Keep up the fine work, fellas.

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,060
Now I don't know where your safe house is, Jeff,

38
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,060
but if you ever run into the dragon

39
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,860
that kicks it under Ljubljana Castle,

40
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,100
tell him wolf says he regrets calling him a girthy drake,

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,820
and I miss their earthy quakes.

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,580
I bet all that's just for Jeff.

43
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,240
Unless a few of y'all have read a book or two on Slovenia.

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,780
If you wanna write up something

45
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,060
for your trapped wolf to how,

46
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,340
and then make very specific references to,

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,900
tag at pretending pod on Twitter,

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,340
tag at pretending pod on Instagram,

49
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,740
tag pretending to be people on Facebook

50
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,700
or fuck Mark Zuckerberg,

51
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,900
or you can write a five star review on Apple Podcasts

52
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,620
and holler about it to pretendingpod at gmail.com.

53
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,660
Also, money.

54
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,660
We'll take it.

55
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,840
If you wanna join the Patreon exclusive t-shirt club,

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,040
head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod.

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,580
And remember, if you join our Patreon

58
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,260
or upgrade your tier during the month of November,

59
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,860
we're gonna take that money,

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,140
we're gonna match it,

61
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,060
and we're gonna buy blankets and tents

62
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,900
for folks who need them this winter.

63
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,380
You fine folks have already raised $185.

64
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,600
So with PTBP's matching contribution,

65
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,300
we have $370 so far to spend on needed supplies

66
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,080
to help our community get through this winter.

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,320
Only 11 days left, y'all.

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,780
And how about this?

69
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,260
If we hit $333 from y'all,

70
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,660
that would double on up

71
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,940
to the very cool number of $666.

72
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,340
If that happens, Wolf will give away

73
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,540
a couple fine t-shirts with the PTBP logo

74
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,220
to a couple of fine patrons.

75
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,220
So sign up for the Patreon this November, my babies.

76
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,620
You'll get a butt ton of bonus content

77
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,340
and the fuzzy warm feeling of helping others.

78
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,780
Speaking of fuzzy warm feelings, it's time for the news.

79
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,780
Last time, Incel accused a cool mom of being on drugs,

80
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,460
accused the sheriff of not caring enough

81
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,380
about a missing girl, accused the father of that missing girl

82
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,540
and Alderman of Grover'sville, Tennessee

83
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,020
of being produced by inbreeding,

84
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,180
and emailed Scott Adams, who is either a UFO guy,

85
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,220
the Dilbert guy, or both.

86
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,780
Finally, they called Merle's shut eye,

87
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,500
pretended to be a Clark County deputy,

88
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,420
and learned that Scott Adams has two rooms there

89
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,180
at the same motel they're staying in.

90
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,620
Two rooms for one dude?

91
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,420
Hm, Wolfie is skeptical,

92
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,900
but now for something absolutely impeccable,

93
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,820
it's Brat Pit with Miss Mary.

94
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,940
Psy moves out,

95
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,140
but the eyes hold one throw

96
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,860
I gotta work in the morning

97
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,020
And this shit's so important

98
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,500
So I can't get high

99
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,380
No, I can't get high

100
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,200
Theinge siega die

101
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,580
I can't get high

102
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,780
There must be something inside of me

103
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,500
Does anybody know why?

104
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,140
I can't get high

105
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,820
We're here with David Winters.

106
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,780
David.

107
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,620
Hi.

108
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,620
Luke has a question for you.

109
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,460
Oh, no.

110
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,700
Yeah, so let me set the scene.

111
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,860
We're not recording this though, are we?

112
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,500
No, yeah, we're recording.

113
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,300
Wait, did you get this question from a bigger podcast?

114
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,980
No, I just like thought of it.

115
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,940
I think I was like pooping and I thought of it.

116
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,780
So, all right.

117
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,100
If you make a lie gross enough, no one questions it.

118
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,940
You're accusing me and I resent that.

119
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,080
This is from the dome.

120
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,080
David, you can pick only one movie that Tom Hanks is in

121
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,020
and keep Tom Hanks in it,

122
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,160
but then you have to replace every other movie he's in

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,940
with a different actor,

124
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,060
but then you have to pick who that actor is.

125
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,420
So, three part question, two part question.

126
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,660
One, what movie is Tom Hanks going to stay in his role

127
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,760
and then what actor would you replace

128
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,860
every other Tom Hanks role with?

129
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,700
Oh, that's good.

130
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,960
He's gonna stay in Forrest Gump.

131
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,800
That's what I said.

132
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,100
Yeah, he's gonna stay in Forrest Gump.

133
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,420
I know that much.

134
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,240
As far as every other movie.

135
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,740
So like, what are some highlights?

136
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,420
What movies do we need to think about?

137
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,100
Philadelphia Castaway.

138
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,900
Terminal.

139
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Turner and Hooch, Terminal.

140
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,740
Sully.

141
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,560
Sully.

142
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,400
Sully.

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,720
Joe versus volcano.

144
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,420
You've got male, Sleepless in Seattle.

145
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,220
You're the captain now, Phillips man.

146
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,740
This is easy too then.

147
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,580
Nicolas Cage.

148
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,420
Oh, nice.

149
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,940
Perfect, perfect answer.

150
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,260
That's better than anything we ever came up with.

151
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,140
Yeah, that's the most chaotic answer you can give,

152
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,480
besides like Gary Busey.

153
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,900
Do you remember the scene in the terminal

154
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,340
where he's in the bathroom and he just starts screaming?

155
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,700
He does the scene for Mandy,

156
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,460
but in terminal. In every movie.

157
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
Let's kill some aliens.

158
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,860
What were your answers?

159
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,340
I heard Forrest Gump was a yes.

160
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,960
I said Forrest Gump and then Colin Hanks.

161
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,940
I was gonna keep him in Castaway

162
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,380
and maybe like Sam Rockwell.

163
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,100
Some character actor I think could do all of his oeuvre.

164
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,380
I think Sam Rockwell would be good.

165
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,500
I chose, the movie that I chose is that one

166
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,660
where he is the guy.

167
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,340
I feel like you don't know what you're gonna say yet.

168
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,340
I should have let Thomas go next.

169
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,420
Yeah, I'll give you some time.

170
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,220
I would keep him in the cinematic masterpiece, Cloud Atlas

171
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,780
and replace him and everything else with Danny DeVito.

172
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,100
There you go.

173
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,540
Danny DeVito is Forrest Gump.

174
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,760
That would be the greatest movie of all time.

175
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,940
I'm gonna keep him in That Thing You Do

176
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,300
just to keep that movie pristine as possible,

177
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,940
especially because I talked about that.

178
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,980
I don't want Vin Diesel playing that role,

179
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,460
which is who I'm gonna have play all of the other roles.

180
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,300
I do want Vin Diesel as Forrest Gump.

181
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,300
It's about family, Ginny.

182
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,380
Family is a life of box of chocolates.

183
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,900
You never know what you're gonna get.

184
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,260
Yeah, oddly enough,

185
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,900
the Chronicles of Riddick is all Tom Hanks now.

186
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,380
That would be awesome.

187
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,860
Tom Hanks goes down to Cuba and he's like,

188
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,860
that means we're family.

189
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,980
If the question is instead like whose careers would you flop?

190
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,980
Then Tom Hanks and Vin Diesel is a very fun answer.

191
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,420
And at the end of episode two.

192
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,540
We got some information from a hotel clerk

193
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,380
that Scott Adams was renting a room where we're staying

194
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,480
and there was also, he had a second room full of research.

195
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,340
The hotel clerk knew that that second room

196
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,660
was full of research, if I remember right.

197
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,260
It's amazing that that hotel employee knew.

198
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,140
Maybe he mentions it

199
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,820
at the continental breakfast every morning.

200
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,660
He's like, love this lobby coffee,

201
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,300
really helps me with my research,

202
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
which is what I use that second room for.

203
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,100
Did we learn the hotel clerk's name?

204
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,940
You did, it was Riker Yates.

205
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,060
That's right, strong name.

206
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,100
Riker Yates.

207
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,940
You live in New York.

208
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,120
Do you ever just go to Riker Island for fun?

209
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,460
No, not really.

210
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,980
There's better islands, including Manhattan itself.

211
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,620
But yeah, I generally avoid Rikers.

212
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,700
At least what the tourist guides say is try not to.

213
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,040
Do you ever get sent there against your will

214
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,580
for the crimes you've committed?

215
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,100
I don't have to answer that under advice from counsel.

216
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,900
Smart guy.

217
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,800
I plead the fifth.

218
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,700
Not a prereq for my appearance here.

219
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,900
You didn't read the fine print, David.

220
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,180
There's a reason why I have to record this remotely

221
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,100
and I can't fly in for the show.

222
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,940
I'm not allowed to leave the states.

223
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,020
That's the nicest sell I've ever seen.

224
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,020
Yes.

225
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,500
They let you have so many games.

226
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,380
It's true, it's true.

227
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,100
So we're at the hotel.

228
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,020
Well, not really hotel, it's a motel.

229
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,900
And I know that that's near and dear

230
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,900
to certain other detectives' hearts and another property.

231
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,580
This is Merle's shut eye is what you called,

232
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,100
or who you called, the place you called,

233
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,180
the person you called was Riker Yates.

234
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,420
You're still far away though.

235
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,580
If I recall correctly,

236
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,640
did you call on the fancy DEA Crown Victoria car phone

237
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
or did you call from the city hall?

238
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,580
I think we called from the office, yeah.

239
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,660
The city hall office, okay.

240
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,380
So you led away the alderman.

241
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,980
Right, I think we told him to fuck off.

242
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,340
Yes, like many of the other NPCs

243
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,620
that you've encountered so far,

244
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,860
you have thoroughly harassed them

245
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,020
asking about disappearing people

246
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,680
and you constantly bring up aliens for no apparent reason

247
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,580
even though that's a complete trigger point

248
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,240
for every resident around here.

249
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,220
Accurate, yep.

250
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,220
You've made a phone call.

251
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,940
It is what, around probably about midnight at this point

252
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,100
on thirsty Thursday night.

253
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,940
Oh yeah, that's right.

254
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,340
Oh yeah, so we could go down to the reservoir.

255
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,860
Thank you for bringing that up.

256
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,820
I had forgotten about it.

257
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,500
The question is, what do you wanna do next?

258
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,940
It's getting late, day one.

259
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,980
Do you guys, do you think we should...

260
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,460
I mean, we're gonna go back to the motel.

261
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,980
Anyway, we gotta stay there.

262
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,860
Should we go crash the kids party?

263
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,240
Go down to the reservoir?

264
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,780
I mean, we should at least drive by probably, yeah.

265
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,020
It would give us a chance to see if there's any connections

266
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,020
in the youth where all these missing kids are coming from.

267
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,540
So-called missing kids.

268
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,340
We have that raging Billy Ray just shouting in pain.

269
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,740
Who fucking knows if there's a lot of kids missing?

270
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,220
Yeah, but if Jane Allen is also missing

271
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,260
and then everyone seems to not be worried

272
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,180
about missing people.

273
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,700
I'm worried that these teens themselves

274
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,020
won't fucking be worried

275
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,580
that any of their friends are missing.

276
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,420
That's a worrying thought.

277
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,700
My theory is that we've only talked to grown adults.

278
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,420
Maybe the younger crew might actually be concerned about it

279
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,940
because it's their friends that are going.

280
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,740
Reservoir would be the place to go then.

281
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,300
What if there's like a scrappy group of role-playing nerds?

282
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,340
Then we kill them.

283
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,820
Who befriend a supernatural bald girl.

284
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,580
How many of them do you think there'd be?

285
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,980
The supernatural kind.

286
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,660
Well, just one, but her name would be Eleven.

287
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,420
Okay, all right, all right, I was just wondering.

288
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,820
Am I off-putting to you, the three of you in this room,

289
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,860
now that it was just the four of us in here,

290
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,180
do I come across as a little too fucking strong?

291
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,140
I like your tattoos, but that whole thing,

292
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,260
I'm not a fan of that.

293
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,100
Why?

294
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,940
I didn't like it.

295
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,420
Sometimes you do say things

296
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,140
that I feel put the investigation in jeopardy.

297
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,420
She's pulling on the sleeves of her cardigan

298
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,060
that she has on,

299
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,620
but she's not using her like cardigan persona currently.

300
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,500
And she kind of pulls the sleeves down over her tattoos.

301
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,700
She had them rolled up from the intensity of the phone call

302
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,980
and the email and the computer.

303
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,300
And as she rolls the sleeves down,

304
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,420
she looks at all of you and her face changes again.

305
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,260
And she's just like, okay,

306
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,940
Cindy Woodabaga is gonna be very, very nice.

307
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,580
Is that better for you?

308
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,820
Joe Dean's face falls, but he doesn't say anything,

309
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,940
but he looks like he's seen this before

310
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,660
and he's even more worried now.

311
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,580
Cindy, is this like a Bruce Banner Hulk situation?

312
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,600
Can we call on that other version of you if we need it?

313
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,800
Just rip my cardigan off

314
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,120
and I guess we'll see what comes out.

315
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
It's just, she's still a little flirty.

316
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,720
She runs her fingers down Harlan Nash's chest.

317
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,400
Is that okay?

318
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,640
Sure, for now.

319
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,280
It's better though than before.

320
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,120
Yeah.

321
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,600
Tan gets a little jealous.

322
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,280
How old are Harlan and Tan?

323
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,080
Tan is 38.

324
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,600
Harlan's 46.

325
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,840
I'll be good.

326
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,760
And she looks at her partner, Joe Dean

327
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,160
and her eyes get really big.

328
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,280
I'll be good.

329
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,680
And then we all hop in the car and go to the reservoir.

330
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,520
Yep.

331
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,340
Yeah.

332
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,180
Yep.

333
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,860
Okay.

334
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,360
We wanna make some prank calls on our car phone first though.

335
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,360
Bling, bling.

336
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,600
Hello, White House?

337
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,400
Yeah, let me talk to the president.

338
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,780
How did you get this number?

339
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,480
What are your thoughts on aliens?

340
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,880
We call Murrells County Bunker.

341
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,680
Yeah, grab your prop phone, David.

342
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,200
And I haven't heard the ring yet.

343
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

344
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,320
Hey y'all, it's Murrells.

345
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,400
Howdy, we're staying down at Murrell's shutout tonight

346
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,200
and we were wondering how long the bunker's open.

347
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,040
Huh?

348
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,120
Well, technically it's open till 12,

349
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,280
but if you say the password, it's open till two.

350
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,620
What's the password?

351
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,760
Big League Chew.

352
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,720
Big League Chew, that's cool.

353
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,560
Yeah.

354
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,320
Hey, ask him if Mr. Jazz is there.

355
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,400
Hey, is Mr. Jazz there?

356
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,280
Hugh Jazz.

357
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,120
Hugh Jazz?

358
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Hey, we got Hugh Jazz in here, anyone?

359
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,120
Oh, hang up, hang up, hang up.

360
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,880
Hey, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up.

361
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh my God, it's just like the Simpsons.

362
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,280
We don't got no Hugh Jazz.

363
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,960
I can't believe it worked, hang up.

364
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,800
I hang up, yeah.

365
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,840
It's just like that animated 10 year old boy

366
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,320
that's taken the nation by storm these last couple of years.

367
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,920
I'm just waiting for, once we get in like a gunfight

368
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,800
for David to just bring a gun out as a prop.

369
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,880
It's like, yeah, I got a phone.

370
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,960
He fires in and bullets come out of our TV screen.

371
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,520
Whoa.

372
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,340
4D.

373
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,200
Four dead.

374
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,140
All right, any more prank phone calls

375
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,120
before you go to the reservoir?

376
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,960
Sure, why not?

377
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,520
How many prank phone calls does it take

378
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,880
to get to the reservoir?

379
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Sorry, your car phone's out of minutes.

380
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,200
You only have the 30 minute monthly plan.

381
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,240
Two things, first, are we there yet?

382
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,640
And second, can I change Ice Cube to my answer

383
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,200
for switching with Tom Hanks?

384
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,320
Yes and yes, Ice Cube would be good.

385
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,720
Is Ice Cube in Law and Order or is that Ice T?

386
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,560
That's Ice T, Ice T.

387
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Which one's Ice Cube?

388
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,520
Ice Cube is the-

389
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,600
Are we there yet?

390
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,440
Are we there yet?

391
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,920
And 21 Jump Street, 22 Jump Street, Barbershop.

392
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,480
Man, Barbershop's a funny movie.

393
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,300
All right, let's go.

394
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,140
It'd be good.

395
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,980
What do we see?

396
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,800
Well, more importantly, what do you hear?

397
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,580
So in between your prank phone calls on the way there,

398
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,920
a bump in tune from 1990 comes on.

399
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby, just to get you in the mood.

400
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,360
All right, stop, collaborate and listen.

401
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,400
Ice is back with a brand new invention.

402
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,240
Something.

403
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,400
You guys are holding me tightly.

404
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
Flowing like a hot daily and nightly.

405
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,680
When will it ever stop, yo?

406
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,520
I don't know.

407
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,360
Turn out the lights and I'll glow to the extreme.

408
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,680
I rock the mic like a vandal.

409
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,360
Light up the stage and watch me shine like a candle dance.

410
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,880
Harlan, they really just had a little bonding moment there.

411
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,600
I think your chances with Cindy just went way down.

412
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,180
She knew every word.

413
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,580
She's good.

414
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,880
You go to the reservoir, you encounter,

415
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,720
hold on,

416
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
three teens loitering and a beat up Ford pickup truck

417
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,820
and pounding cans of, hold on,

418
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,600
I have to roll on my random beer table.

419
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,520
Oh, hell yeah.

420
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,360
Oh, that's an 11.

421
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,500
Is this 13 Mile Island?

422
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,340
Oh my God.

423
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,480
That's an 11.

424
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,320
They're drinking Milwaukee's Best Ice.

425
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,160
Excellent.

426
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,940
Six percenters getting it.

427
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,440
That is, they are partying.

428
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,680
David, is that a chart of your own devising?

429
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,680
Oh yeah.

430
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,620
Were you just going to say that no matter what you roll?

431
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,460
No, no, no, no.

432
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,000
There's other ones I can roll for you.

433
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,200
A two is Colt 45.

434
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,040
Oh my gosh.

435
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,740
Did you make sure all these beers were on the market

436
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,580
in 1990?

437
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,800
Anything you can buy in Tallboys in a gas station today

438
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,760
probably existed 20 years ago.

439
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,800
Like Steel Reserve, Colt 45.

440
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,400
Milwaukee's Best Ice.

441
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,860
Colt 45 definitely existed

442
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,260
because Lando Calrissian was effectively the spokesperson.

443
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,100
Yeah, I'm not saying you could have a better time.

444
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,540
David, what's your go-to shitty beer?

445
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,980
Hold on, let me roll for you.

446
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,300
That'd be Bud Light.

447
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,340
Missouri, baby.

448
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,480
Doody Doody.

449
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,540
Anheuser-Busch.

450
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,540
Wait, what did they say?

451
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,740
In Bev.

452
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,700
Wait, what?

453
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,640
Doody Doody.

454
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Doody Doody.

455
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,380
No, Diddy Diddy.

456
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,980
Right?

457
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,060
Poopy Poopy.

458
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,420
I forget.

459
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,740
Dilly Dilly.

460
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,560
Dilly Dilly.

461
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,400
Dilly Dilly.

462
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,240
Yes, there we go.

463
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,460
That's what we're looking for.

464
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,040
Those were bad commercials.

465
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,540
I liked the dog ones.

466
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,500
Those were good.

467
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,340
Anyway.

468
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,260
Oh, where the dogs say Budweiser.

469
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,620
We're at the reservoir, I guess.

470
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,460
Milwaukee's Best.

471
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,300
They're crushing Milwaukee's Best Ice.

472
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Yeah, the beast.

473
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,420
Tan gets out of the car,

474
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,180
finds the open 18-pack,

475
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,340
grabs one, cracks it open,

476
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,060
and just kind of wanders into where the kids are.

477
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,860
It's relatively warm.

478
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,200
They've been there for a little while.

479
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,860
It's a 30-rack.

480
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,140
It's about half consumed,

481
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,640
so there's about 15 warm cans left,

482
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,620
and it gives that distinct,

483
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,980
almost gasoline smell as you open it up.

484
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,240
And you walk over towards the kids.

485
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,620
They're averaging five units of alcohol per person,

486
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,780
depending on how long they've been out here.

487
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,620
Okay, Joe?

488
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,420
Yeah, and it's ice beer,

489
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,740
which means it's a little bit higher

490
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,540
than your normal three-two.

491
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,360
That's right.

492
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,120
Going with some loose sluices.

493
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,880
Guys, I'm actually,

494
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,360
this is kind of my realm,

495
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,440
ATF, you know?

496
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,800
Oh, that's right, that's right.

497
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,680
And he sniffs his beer.

498
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
This is a good one.

499
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,380
I know that is your realm.

500
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,760
I don't want to tell you how to do your job,

501
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
but it would be super cool

502
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,960
if you just walked over there

503
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,640
and poured it out in front of him.

504
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,640
No, he savors the beautiful taste of-

505
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,480
The beast ice.

506
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,760
Of the ice.

507
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,120
Hey, kids.

508
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,960
Hey.

509
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,920
This isn't super weird to you

510
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,960
that we're just here.

511
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,560
Well, it's the cool place to be.

512
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,760
We got some questions for you.

513
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,040
Who are you?

514
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,080
Hold on, these guys are clearly nerds.

515
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,000
Mine is-

516
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,420
Yeah, why are there four random adults here

517
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,720
at the reservoir at midnight on a thirsty Thursday?

518
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
Well, so, you know,

519
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,240
we haven't been out to the reservoir

520
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,920
for a thirsty Thursday in quite a while.

521
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,760
We figured we'd come down here

522
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,200
and we just ran into you guys.

523
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,840
You don't look like you're from around here.

524
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,680
Well, we are.

525
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,260
We're older than you, you know?

526
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,160
Do you know any- Are you sure?

527
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,320
Have any of your friends disappeared?

528
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,840
Maybe.

529
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,480
I guess they haven't been around.

530
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,320
Maybe.

531
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,160
Yeah, maybe.

532
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,320
What do you mean, maybe?

533
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,640
I mean, it doesn't mean they've disappeared

534
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,880
just because they're not around.

535
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,600
But some of your friends aren't around.

536
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,280
I don't know.

537
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,880
I'm only 12.

538
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
It's dark, we should have clocked that right away.

539
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,480
Is this kid actually only 12?

540
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,220
Give me alertness.

541
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,000
I pass, 42 on a 50.

542
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,040
I fail, 71 on a 70.

543
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,080
Jodine's like, what kid?

544
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,120
Which kid are we talking about?

545
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,600
I fail as well, 61 on a 60.

546
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,120
But only Cindy notices that these children,

547
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,760
sorry, these individuals might be children.

548
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,920
The rest of you are like,

549
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,480
yeah, they're probably adults.

550
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,200
It's fine.

551
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,800
You know Harlan, Tan doesn't know it yet.

552
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,040
But that alcohol, brushing through his system

553
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,640
is changing who he is as a person and making him worse.

554
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,800
You think he's a liability now?

555
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,640
Immediately.

556
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,760
Tan is standing there hearing you.

557
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,720
He is ATF.

558
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,920
It's called research.

559
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,400
He probably does know about alcohol.

560
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,560
I'm doing research.

561
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,240
I don't think you should be drinking right now.

562
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,000
I think you should pour that beer out like a hard ass.

563
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,940
He continues to take a sip and then says,

564
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,340
Jane Allen, what's that mean to you?

565
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,980
It's better than their faces.

566
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,300
She's an older girl around here.

567
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,580
I don't know.

568
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,580
You seen her in a while?

569
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,780
No, I don't really go to school.

570
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,020
Then what do you do?

571
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,840
Nothing.

572
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,300
Do you remember how you got here?

573
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,220
In a car?

574
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,180
Who drove?

575
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
Rocky did.

576
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,100
When was that?

577
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,380
30 minutes ago.

578
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,500
Oh shit, you pounded five fucking ices

579
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,420
in 30 minutes each.

580
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,540
And these kids are 12.

581
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
They're like, these kids are just on the ground.

582
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,380
Like one of them is already dead.

583
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,660
The one with the beard walks over.

584
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,100
Why are you bothering my friends?

585
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,860
Are you Rocky?

586
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,700
Yes.

587
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,940
Did you guys drink all of these beers in the last 30 minutes?

588
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,780
No.

589
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,600
No?

590
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,300
No, I'm the designated driver.

591
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,360
I would never.

592
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,920
They had seven and a half each.

593
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,040
Rocky, you know, it just doesn't look like

594
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,320
these kids have the body weight

595
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,880
for seven and a half Milwaukee's best ices.

596
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,920
They seem fine to me.

597
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,020
They're passing.

598
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,860
You're right.

599
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,320
They do seem rather coherent for what they've ingested.

600
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,220
Rocky, what do you know about aliens?

601
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,040
As he's frustratedly answering,

602
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,800
I grab his arm and look at it.

603
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,720
Oh my God.

604
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,840
Roll me a search.

605
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,360
Guys, I really don't think anyone who is around

606
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,720
is gonna have these little cuts.

607
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,480
Yeah, remember that came with some pretty telltale symptoms.

608
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,560
Yeah, I successfully passed.

609
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,640
Yeah, you don't see any.

610
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,560
The two younger kids, not Rocky,

611
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,440
does look like they've pounded seven and a half beers each.

612
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,840
However, there seemed to be no effects on them at all.

613
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,680
Well, that's odd.

614
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,640
Ooh.

615
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah, that's what I was talking, yeah.

616
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,400
That's fucking nuts.

617
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,600
All right, let's get the fuck out of here

618
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,760
and go on to the next place.

619
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,520
Could we, hey, could we get your names real quick?

620
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm Rocky Collins.

621
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,400
The younger gentleman you were talking to over there,

622
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,520
Chester Wisman.

623
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,220
I bet you have a lot of fun with that name, huh?

624
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,000
Lastly, the woman over there, young lady over there,

625
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
Chastity James.

626
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,380
How old are you, Mr. Collins?

627
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm 23.

628
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,840
Can we roll human on that?

629
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,680
Yeah.

630
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,520
Yes.

631
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,880
I pass. I pass a 60 on a 60.

632
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,080
I pass with a two.

633
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,420
39 on a 40.

634
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,260
Harlan fails.

635
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,000
He might be lying and is only 20 and he is just worried.

636
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,280
He just seems to be shifty

637
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,520
because he realizes you're adults and...

638
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,080
Kid, we don't really care how, you know,

639
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,320
that you're underage drinking.

640
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,480
It's not like we didn't do any of that ourselves,

641
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
but we just need to know the actual facts.

642
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,240
Like, how old are you, son?

643
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,680
I am legally obliged to arrest you,

644
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,560
but if you help us, I won't.

645
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,720
ATF agent, alcohol, tobacco, firearms.

646
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,780
It's just a relief.

647
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,040
I don't have to do that deep voice anymore now.

648
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm most concerned at this point

649
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,580
that these are actually adults

650
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,640
that are now have taken over these 12 year old bodies

651
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,400
based on the way that he said that-

652
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,440
They just pound in those ices?

653
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,200
A, pounding ices, number one, and B, two.

654
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,500
He said that woman over there,

655
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,380
and then was like, I mean that girl, right?

656
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,220
So I think-

657
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,080
It's almost like our DM is like respectful and chill.

658
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,760
No, that was just bad game.

659
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,960
That was bad handling though.

660
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,360
I just, I caught myself.

661
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,680
Don't read into that.

662
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,520
Sorry.

663
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,760
I thought I cracked the whole thing open.

664
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,600
Nope.

665
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,880
So, Mr., what was it again?

666
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,840
Rocky Collins.

667
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,660
Mr. Collins.

668
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,500
Rocky Collins.

669
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,320
Mr. Collins.

670
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,160
Yeah.

671
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,320
So, do you know Jane Allen?

672
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,440
No, I don't.

673
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,960
We're a couple years apart.

674
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,160
You make it sound like she's not around, that's sure a shame.

675
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,200
And you don't have any friends

676
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,480
that just haven't been around for like three weeks?

677
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,720
Not three weeks, no.

678
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,560
Two weeks?

679
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,380
Any amount of time.

680
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,220
One week?

681
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,060
Any amount.

682
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,280
Occasionally people go places.

683
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,120
Where do they go?

684
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,200
They go to the big city.

685
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,640
They go to the big city.

686
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
What do they do in the city?

687
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,400
They go to the big city shopping.

688
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,300
Shopping.

689
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,140
That checks out.

690
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,120
And they're gone for days, weeks at a time?

691
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,400
Oh, sometimes there's some big shopping to do in the city.

692
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,280
You gotta get your fancy clothes at the Gap

693
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,660
and, you know, back to town.

694
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,500
Rocky, has anybody you know ever not come back to town?

695
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,720
Not as far as I know.

696
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
And you were 20, that was correct?

697
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,560
Ish.

698
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,600
And how old are your associates here?

699
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,980
Mid teens.

700
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,500
Cindy walks back and gets in the DEA car.

701
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,940
Do you want to breathalyze the kids

702
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,940
or anything else while you're there?

703
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,540
Do you want to sobriety check them?

704
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,900
Yeah, let's send them back to Delta Green

705
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,100
for testing in there.

706
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,160
All right, you hop back in the car?

707
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,000
Where to?

708
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,820
Murrell's.

709
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,940
1 a.m., night one.

710
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,780
Murrell's?

711
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,980
Wait, the hotel or the bar?

712
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,820
I think the bar.

713
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,580
The bar, county bunker.

714
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,420
Oh.

715
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,620
The late night, Harlan, you gonna stay up?

716
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,180
What are we going to the bar for?

717
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,260
We're gonna have the same conversation we just had

718
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,380
but with older people at a bar.

719
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,820
Yeah, they gave us the password, so that's cool.

720
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,520
As David is just nodding thoroughly and vigorously,

721
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,660
Cindy falls asleep in the car as you guys are going.

722
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,340
Okay, what if we just leave her in here?

723
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,580
She got real calm earlier.

724
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,340
Again, this is a brilliant investigative mind

725
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,660
but her methods are pretty unorthodox

726
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,720
and I've seen her get like this before it really gets odd.

727
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,560
Tan rings a doorbell on the bar at the bar.

728
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,720
Waking Cindy up.

729
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,660
And you go to the door.

730
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,260
Murrell's county bunker is literally stylized

731
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,500
almost as if it's some sort of bunker.

732
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
It's a windowless bar, blocky.

733
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,260
The front door is almost like it's for a gang hideout.

734
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,980
It is a heavy door with like one of those slots,

735
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,820
like an eye slot.

736
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,660
Ooh, nice.

737
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,060
Cop knock, ring, ring.

738
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,240
There's a little doorbell on it.

739
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,420
Big League Chew.

740
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,020
Door slides open, he sees you,

741
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,060
Big League Chew closes it, door cracks open, you walk in.

742
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,540
It is a half, not liquor store,

743
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,860
but more of like a grab and go beer place and half bar.

744
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,460
Again, there's no windows, it's dark.

745
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,580
It's stylized with those tin branded beer signs

746
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,140
all over the place of every which brand.

747
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,540
Some of these brands are even now defunct

748
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,300
in the early 90s, some of them are more modern.

749
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,500
The place smells like that solvent

750
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,460
that a really cheap bar has that just permeates the air

751
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,980
and that's all you can smell.

752
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,820
You can't smell food, you can't smell the beer,

753
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,260
it's just that kind of ambient solvent smell everywhere.

754
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,700
And there's only the bartender,

755
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,260
there's no one else in there right now.

756
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,280
Can you roll for some of those signs?

757
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,700
Oh yeah.

758
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,700
Steel Reserve.

759
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,220
Oh look, good one.

760
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,060
Steel Reserve.

761
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,260
Oh, Rolling Rock, that's fancy.

762
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,620
Oh, from the glass line tanks of old Latrobe.

763
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,060
That's what they called me in high school.

764
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,600
They called you Rolling Rock?

765
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,440
That's right.

766
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,240
They called me Super Dork.

767
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,280
And lastly, Steel Reserve.

768
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,980
Oh, another Steel Reserve.

769
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,820
This one's a little fancier.

770
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,660
I like this one.

771
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,080
Yeah, it's a limited table.

772
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,480
It's only a D12 table.

773
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
All right, bartender behind the bar

774
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,760
says, well, hello there.

775
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,840
Have you ever been abducted by aliens?

776
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Every single time.

777
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,040
Why is it always the aliens?

778
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,360
Oh, sorry, we didn't know this town

779
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,720
had any kind of connection to that.

780
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,180
That's just kind of his new age pickup line

781
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,200
that he's been dropping out.

782
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,080
It sounds like you're really upset by this.

783
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,520
So how many times have you been abducted by aliens?

784
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,360
Me and my partner saw you from across the bar

785
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,520
and we thought that you were.

786
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,120
We're just the laughing stock, laughing stock of Tennessee.

787
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,440
Yes, we're all laughing.

788
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,360
I hate it.

789
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,200
Pointing and laughing.

790
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,840
I hate being the laughing stock of Tennessee.

791
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,680
Who hates it?

792
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,500
What's your name?

793
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,680
My name is Arthur Doyle.

794
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,600
Arthur C. Doyle?

795
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,480
Just Doyle.

796
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,600
But really, though, how many times?

797
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,520
Never.

798
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,600
People always ask that.

799
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,480
There ain't no abductions around her.

800
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,960
You don't know anybody that's been abducted or?

801
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,800
No.

802
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,240
Abducted from their Sherlock Holmes, maybe?

803
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,420
No, ain't nobody been abducted around here.

804
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,160
We have some Moriarty questions.

805
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,560
Okay.

806
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,480
Jesus Christ.

807
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,800
You Sherlock harassing the locals, I've noticed.

808
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,720
People have been talking about these agents

809
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,720
going around town, asking questions about the aliens.

810
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,240
And that upsets people?

811
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,560
Yes, sir.

812
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,400
Is it because you like these aliens and you don't want to?

813
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,680
No!

814
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,040
We don't like no aliens.

815
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,440
We just want to live in peace.

816
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,640
So you don't want the aliens to be here anymore?

817
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,840
What aliens?

818
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,960
The ones you don't want here.

819
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,200
What are you talking about?

820
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,140
What are you talking about?

821
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,240
Why do you just keep asking questions about aliens?

822
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,180
You tell us.

823
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,180
Hey!

824
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,900
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

825
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,880
Sorry to bring up the aliens.

826
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,840
Can I have a water?

827
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,720
Do you know who killed Jane Allen?

828
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,560
Yes.

829
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,120
You do know who killed Jane Allen.

830
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,080
He pours each of you a water

831
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,960
because the nice old lady asked for one

832
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,920
and you've been out all day.

833
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,100
I chug it.

834
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,940
You chug it?

835
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,760
Okay.

836
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,200
And I've still got my Milwaukee's Best ice

837
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,440
from the reservoir.

838
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,400
Hey, hey!

839
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,760
No outside beverages.

840
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,400
No outside beverages.

841
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,740
You gotta shop parrot.

842
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,600
Tan chugs it and then goes back to his line of questioning.

843
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
Who gives you the right to do that?

844
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,600
So did you kill Jane Allen or who did it?

845
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,440
Why are you accusing me of killing Jane Allen?

846
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,240
Well, so it sounds like somebody did kill her then, right?

847
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,060
Based off what you just said.

848
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,900
I don't know.

849
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,600
I didn't say that.

850
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,640
That's what I heard.

851
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,800
We just tried this with him and he did not crack.

852
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,440
So let me guess, nothing is happening

853
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,940
that is strange or unusual in this town.

854
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,780
Correct.

855
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,600
Everything is fine.

856
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,440
Yeah.

857
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,800
Any of your friends been out of town for a while?

858
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,640
No.

859
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,560
Oh good, any of your friends?

860
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,920
Got no friends.

861
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,220
I work hard.

862
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,100
I'm always here at the county bunker.

863
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,440
You don't make friends with any of the regulars?

864
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
No, they're my customers.

865
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,280
I get that.

866
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,100
You gotta keep that distance.

867
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Are you aware of a Billy Ray Spivvy, Spivvy?

868
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,320
Yeah, that boy.

869
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,300
Has he been in here?

870
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,080
Does he frequent this establishment?

871
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
No, sir.

872
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,080
I check IDs.

873
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,380
Thank you very much.

874
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,340
I see that guy over there with the ATF badge

875
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,840
trying to trip me up.

876
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,680
No, sir.

877
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,240
No children in this bar.

878
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,280
Can I humint that?

879
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,120
Sure.

880
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,840
Fail.

881
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,600
93 on a 60.

882
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,800
Everyone in the bar looks 12 now.

883
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,040
Does Scott Adams come in here much?

884
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,480
Oh, oh, that guy.

885
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,300
Yeah.

886
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,560
He's poking around just like you,

887
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,800
asking about them UFOs.

888
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,720
Told him he wasn't allowed to come back here.

889
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Is that, oh, you kicked him out.

890
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,440
He was harassing my customers.

891
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,720
Was his line of inquiry similar to ours,

892
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
or was he asking different things?

893
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,600
Basically the same stuff.

894
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,320
This is just a person.

895
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,760
Do you think it was the fella from Dilbert?

896
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,560
I ain't seen him making no comics while he was here,

897
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,800
if that's what you're asking.

898
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,480
What have you seen him doing while he's here?

899
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,120
Harassing my customers.

900
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,640
Asked and answered, fair enough.

901
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,520
Thank you very much for your time.

902
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,380
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.

903
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,220
That is what?

904
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,400
You have thoroughly wasted enough time,

905
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,560
and now this bar has to close.

906
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,840
Thank you, Z.

907
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,560
Ushers you out the front door.

908
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,860
Are we like right next to the motel?

909
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,880
You're very close, yeah.

910
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,340
Both are on the outskirts of town.

911
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,700
They're both owned by Murrells.

912
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,400
They're conveniently close enough

913
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,460
that you could walk from the county bunker to the motel.

914
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,920
And what time is it, like one in the morning right now?

915
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,740
Two.

916
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,580
Bar closed at two.

917
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,420
Yep.

918
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,440
Do you think it's too late to go try to talk to him?

919
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,480
I'm so tired.

920
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,860
I'm tempted to turn in myself

921
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,040
and get this with fresh eyes.

922
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,980
I've gotta sleep and shit and piss,

923
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,720
and eat, apparently.

924
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,280
Do we each have our own room

925
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,060
or are we all staying in the same room?

926
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,380
Are you gonna check in?

927
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,420
Yeah, let's go check in.

928
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,260
Yeah.

929
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,420
So you walk over to the hotel,

930
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,860
you go to talk to Riker Yates.

931
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,900
However, there's a sign up saying,

932
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,260
the manager is not on duty, please check in at 10 a.m.

933
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,700
You get to sleep in your cars now

934
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,220
because you didn't even bother to check into the motel.

935
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,820
I think Harlan saw the sign

936
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,980
and was already walking back to the Bronco.

937
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,460
Wait, do we know which hotel room?

938
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
No, we haven't checked in.

939
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,900
No, no, Scott.

940
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,620
Oh, that Scott was in.

941
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,780
We do?

942
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,220
No, we didn't get room numbers.

943
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,860
No, you didn't get the number out of them.

944
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,340
Can I do a search for a book that has customers?

945
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,240
So you're gonna break into the...

946
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,820
We're still on the outside.

947
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,140
We haven't made it into the lobby.

948
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,420
Oh, we're not inside the lobby?

949
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,260
No.

950
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,420
There's no lobby, so this is, I should say,

951
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,540
standard motel, doors open outward,

952
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,220
and it's actually, you know what,

953
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,220
I'm just gonna give you a map.

954
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,060
How about that?

955
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,500
Ooh. Perfect.

956
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,860
So, 11 room motel, L-shaped.

957
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,780
The rooms on one side of the L are kind of double units,

958
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,060
two double beds plus kitchenettes.

959
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,100
And then there's this, on the other side of the L,

960
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,940
it's just standard rooms where it's some beds

961
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,580
and then a bathroom, and that's pretty much it.

962
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,860
And then in between, in like the joint of the L,

963
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,300
there's a manager's office.

964
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Right, is that locked?

965
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,180
The office is locked, so it has that sign

966
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,700
saying basically, come back tomorrow.

967
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,540
Yeah.

968
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,180
I'm not gonna sleep in the car.

969
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,800
I don't know if Scott's a nice guy or not,

970
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,620
but I'm gonna go find him.

971
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,060
No, you're not.

972
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,580
I would not advise just knocking on doors

973
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,420
at two in the morning.

974
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,060
Hold on, real quick, who's in charge of this?

975
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,200
Oh, yeah.

976
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,440
Sorry, guys, you're not actually full Delta Green.

977
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,940
Oh, yeah, we're in charge of this task force.

978
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,380
You're the friendlies, we're the agents.

979
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,260
You're gonna sleep in your car tonight.

980
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,080
That's fine with me.

981
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,100
It's actually something I do pretty often

982
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,340
in my line of work.

983
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,140
Aw, that's sad.

984
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,260
It's not, it's just, we stake out places.

985
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,940
We have to make sure that we see the comings

986
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,420
and goings of people pretty often.

987
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,620
It's not sad they have steak.

988
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,980
I guess I'll do it.

989
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,780
Typically, when I sleep in my car,

990
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,620
it's cause it's like outside of the casino.

991
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,500
I had a bad night, so it's kinda not a great feeling

992
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,700
for me, but I guess I'll do it.

993
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,660
Well, you'll have a friend.

994
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,980
It's not a great feeling for anybody, bud,

995
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,540
but we're gonna be doing that for the next,

996
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,860
probably till like 6 a.m., it's only like four hours.

997
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,620
Yeah, he goes back to the Bronco.

998
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,420
Are you talking outside about all of this,

999
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,040
like standing outside of the office?

1000
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,140
Defo, yep.

1001
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,740
Okay, so as you're doing that,

1002
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,860
eventually towards the end of the conversation,

1003
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,940
the lights turn on on the inside.

1004
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,660
The manager's apartment was back there,

1005
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,300
so Riker actually lives inside the hotel,

1006
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,220
and he overheard you talking loudly.

1007
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,360
It's still September, he had his window open,

1008
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,520
and eventually all the bickering about cars

1009
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,600
and sleeping in the car and stuff woke him up.

1010
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,980
So he comes out in his pajamas,

1011
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,100
like a nice proper two-piece striped pajama suit,

1012
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,860
a very handsome gentleman comes to the door,

1013
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,180
all bleary-eyed.

1014
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,920
Let me guess, let me guess,

1015
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,100
you're those agents or whatever that call the hat, right?

1016
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,740
DEA Task Force, yep, investigating Superman.

1017
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,500
We're awfully sorry, sir.

1018
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,940
Come on, come on, come in, come in, come in.

1019
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,660
We appreciate you getting up out of bed for us.

1020
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,660
Your nation thanks you.

1021
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,360
Ah, I already, here, paperwork,

1022
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,580
what, I just, I wanna go back to bed.

1023
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,500
Just give us the keys, and we'll do it all tomorrow.

1024
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,340
How about that?

1025
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,840
All right, we got you in,

1026
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,180
we got four different double bedrooms.

1027
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,020
Perfect.

1028
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,820
Yeah, you're in rooms six to nine.

1029
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,500
I don't know why that's funny, but it got me.

1030
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,820
I'll take the six.

1031
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,860
I'll take the nine.

1032
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,740
Seven's my lucky number, so.

1033
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,540
I get the set leaves me with eight.

1034
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,700
Oh, infinity on its side, like that man's tattoo.

1035
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,180
Maybe it's lucky.

1036
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,580
Does everyone go to bed?

1037
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,060
Before we get to the rooms, I do wanna ask Riker

1038
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
just a bunch of questions.

1039
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,260
No, I just don't wanna ask him what rooms

1040
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,660
Scott Adams is staying in.

1041
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,260
Which rooms are the aliens in?

1042
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,100
Yep.

1043
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,820
Thank you for showing us to these rooms, Mr. Riker.

1044
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,700
Now, we understand you have a guest here

1045
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,820
staying with you, a Mr. Scott Adams.

1046
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,020
How, how do you know that?

1047
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,340
We heard from in town.

1048
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,900
We're investigators, this is part of our investigation.

1049
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,740
Oh.

1050
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,620
Into super myth?

1051
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,220
We're figuring it out, it'll be okay.

1052
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,060
Super myth.

1053
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,900
It'll be all right.

1054
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,720
We just need to ask him some questions.

1055
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,560
Just let us know which room he's in.

1056
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,100
Your hotel is not in danger.

1057
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,660
Room 10, you rented 10 and 11.

1058
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,780
10 and 11?

1059
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,620
Mm-hmm.

1060
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,440
Okay.

1061
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,940
Thank you so much for, I'm sorry to wake you up,

1062
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,220
but I was not looking forward to sleeping in that car,

1063
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,180
so thank you.

1064
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,460
It's fine.

1065
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,780
It's fine.

1066
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,660
He turns around, goes back in, lights off.

1067
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,860
Tan goes, goes to bed, he plays a little online poker.

1068
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,100
No, he doesn't.

1069
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,940
Yeah.

1070
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,540
Thomas, get it through your head.

1071
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,300
We don't know what existed in the 90s.

1072
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,140
I know you're 17, but.

1073
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,580
Oh, you're right, he doesn't.

1074
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,340
He plays one of those little handheld machines.

1075
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,180
Oh, yes.

1076
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,140
It's like a double A battery.

1077
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,980
Yeah.

1078
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,900
Every time you like hit something that's at least

1079
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,100
what, at least three of a kind or whatever,

1080
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,500
it plays that we're in the money tune.

1081
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,020
Yeah, monophonic.

1082
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,940
Yeah.

1083
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,260
He does that until he loses five times in a row,

1084
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,380
and then Zs.

1085
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,620
Anyone else doing anything before bed?

1086
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,260
Taking a shower, doing anything else?

1087
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,180
Harlan, he would flop on the bed fully clothed.

1088
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,020
Okay.

1089
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,340
Cindy puts away all of her clothes in each of the drawers

1090
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,860
in the motel room and then goes and sets up her toiletries

1091
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:01,540
at the bathroom sink and does her good night face wash,

1092
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,100
puts on a face mask and then heads to bed

1093
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,380
and has a full blown nightmare.

1094
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,860
Joe slash Thomas, any special plans?

1095
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,100
Yeah, Joe walks outside of his room and smokes a cigarette

1096
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,900
and he wants to take a look at the outside

1097
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,340
of rooms 10 and 11.

1098
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,780
What is your alertness skill?

1099
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,700
70.

1100
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,820
Okay, well, all right.

1101
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,940
Well, with a 70, you don't even have to roll.

1102
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,380
The one thing you notice between the two rooms,

1103
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,860
the room that was identified as Scott Adams' room,

1104
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,780
so that's room 10, there's a little bit of cloth

1105
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,260
sticking out from under the door.

1106
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,460
It looks like a towel, like a standard hotel towel

1107
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,220
kind of peeking out from underneath the door.

1108
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,700
It's getting blazed in there, dude.

1109
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,500
Like somebody had rolled one up under the door.

1110
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,980
Yeah, and other than that, you also notice

1111
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,100
the blinds are closed, but you can kind of see

1112
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,220
through the blinds, nothing on the other side.

1113
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,100
It's dark, almost as if there was a blanket put up

1114
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,580
over the top of the closed blinds.

1115
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,780
If I put my ear up to the door,

1116
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,620
do I hear any sounds or activities, movements?

1117
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,180
I'm not even gonna make you roll, you hear nothing.

1118
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,060
Okay.

1119
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,700
He uses the bathroom, takes a shower and goes to bed.

1120
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,540
Okay.

1121
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,860
Everyone sleeps through the night.

1122
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,340
You wake up, reasonable hour.

1123
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,940
You notice the office is back open up front.

1124
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,500
The lights are on again.

1125
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,020
There's a little bit of movement.

1126
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,500
However, there's not that many other cars

1127
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,340
in the parking lot.

1128
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,620
There's one van, your Bronco, your Crown Vic,

1129
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,940
and then another rental car.

1130
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,860
It looks to be a Ford Escort.

1131
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,580
Are either of those parked in front of 10 or 11?

1132
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,740
The Escort is.

1133
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,820
The van's towards the other side

1134
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,060
where the other rooms are on the other half of the aisle.

1135
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,500
And you said we could tell it was a rental?

1136
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,060
Escort is definitely a rental.

1137
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,740
It's unclear of the other one.

1138
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,860
When Tan wakes up, he goes into the office and asks,

1139
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,300
do you have any coffee or food

1140
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,460
or where should I go for that kind of stuff?

1141
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:03,180
I'd recommend the Mega Deuce if you want a big meal.

1142
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,220
But if you want a small meal, I got some coffee over here.

1143
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,740
You know, your offices are the law.

1144
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,860
I can cut you in on some donuts.

1145
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,060
I appreciate that, but I'm a little hungry.

1146
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:17,940
Tan leaves the office and knocks on your respective doors.

1147
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,780
Hey, you guys wanna go to the Deuce to get some breakfast?

1148
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,900
And maybe we can ask Scott to come with us.

1149
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,660
You hear a scream when you knock on room number six.

1150
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,380
And she's just like, ah!

1151
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,700
I try to open the door and get in.

1152
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,420
Cracks the door and she's like, sorry.

1153
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,660
And she is drenched in sweat.

1154
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,820
I mean, just like she jumped into a pool.

1155
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,140
And she's like, let me shower.

1156
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,100
I'll be right out.

1157
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,660
I'm sorry, Miss Woodabaga.

1158
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,500
Take a shower.

1159
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,460
I think maybe we could take Scott to breakfast.

1160
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,700
I think that's a great idea.

1161
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,740
Do you wake up Cindy?

1162
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,540
You wake up the other two as well?

1163
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,300
Yeah, I knock on their doors as well.

1164
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,900
Harlan just splashes some water under his pits

1165
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,020
and puts on a new black polo from his suitcase.

1166
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,940
That's the only difference.

1167
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,740
Tan did not really plan for an overnight stay,

1168
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,020
even though he totally knew that it was happening.

1169
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,620
So he's still wearing the baby blue polo shirt

1170
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,980
that the neck has been stretched out.

1171
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,260
But he's happy and he's stoked to go eat breakfast.

1172
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,580
Jodine is wearing a fresh white polo.

1173
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:20,980
He nods approvingly at Harlan's sharp, fresh black polo.

1174
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:24,340
And he puts on some sunglasses and says,

1175
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,340
yeah, let's get some grip.

1176
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,540
When Cindy comes out, the four of us stand at door 10.

1177
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,060
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

1178
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,580
No doorbells, unfortunately.

1179
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,980
Old fashioned knocking, no answer.

1180
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,100
We go to 11 and do the same thing.

1181
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,540
You go to 11 and knock and no answer.

1182
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,660
Scott, Scott, Scott.

1183
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,940
Mr. Adams.

1184
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,780
Nothing.

1185
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:00,140
So while you're shouting, the manager hears you.

1186
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,860
Riker peeks his head out, looks at you,

1187
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,140
realizes kind of what's going on,

1188
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,900
goes back behind the counter,

1189
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,000
grabs some keys and comes out to you.

1190
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,380
You're looking for Scott, you said?

1191
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,420
For Mr. Adams, yeah.

1192
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,020
Yeah, can you open his door up?

1193
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,940
Do you have a warrant?

1194
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,780
Do you have a warrant?

1195
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,220
Well, this is more of a safety check.

1196
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,500
Yeah, we believe he might be in some danger.

1197
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,420
Danger from what?

1198
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,580
Well, I think he might've fallen in his bathroom

1199
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,700
or something, but I heard a big clunk

1200
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,460
and it sounds like we need to get in there pretty quick.

1201
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,100
Yeah, you wouldn't want anyone to die in your motel,

1202
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:32,940
would you?

1203
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,900
No, no, no, no, that'd be really bad for business.

1204
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,580
It sounded bad, it sounded nasty.

1205
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,460
Goes in, unlocks the door and says,

1206
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,340
please, please, just go ahead.

1207
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,820
He was like, if I live, I'm gonna sue.

1208
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,180
We're like all like showing eyes to each other,

1209
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,020
like as soon as we get in there,

1210
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,160
we search everything as fast as we can.

1211
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,540
You open and the second that door cracks open,

1212
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,820
you catch a really bad odor.

1213
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,300
Yeah, it's that kind of bad odor.

1214
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,460
Yeah, okay.

1215
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,740
It's very, very dark because of that blanket

1216
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,500
that you can see now was duct taped over the window.

1217
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,740
Looking around, you see a couple of different things.

1218
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,260
You see the blankets that have been pulled off the bed

1219
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,300
and used for that, so clearly the bed is unmade.

1220
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,540
You see two piles of clothing.

1221
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,780
One of them is just kind of thrown in the corner.

1222
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,260
The other one is neatly folded on the table.

1223
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,680
You also see a Macintosh PowerBook.

1224
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,180
Is that like a laptop?

1225
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,100
That's a laptop.

1226
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,140
That's what laptops looked like in the early 90s.

1227
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,020
But you see one of those bad boys plugged into the wall.

1228
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,500
You see a series of documents,

1229
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,460
junk food containers on the floor,

1230
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,240
and that's pretty much all you can see

1231
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,180
as you walk into the room.

1232
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,780
Cindy failed her search check,

1233
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,660
and so with that smell, as soon as it hits her nose,

1234
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,020
she's like, nope, nope, not for me.

1235
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,260
Can't be around any of that,

1236
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,060
and just walks out back outside.

1237
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,460
Tan also failed his search role,

1238
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:59,380
and he feels physically sick and joins Cindy.

1239
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,060
I pass my search role.

1240
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,100
It's a 68.

1241
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,740
I passed with a 17.

1242
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,780
So Joe Dean and Harlan both pass.

1243
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,460
Most of this stuff is very obvious,

1244
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,140
kind of what you're seeing.

1245
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,620
You do see some journals sitting around

1246
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,540
that you didn't initially see on the first pass.

1247
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,480
Just those spiral notebooks that kids would use in school,

1248
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,420
and scrawled on the front of one of them

1249
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,500
is Grover'sville Notebook.

1250
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,220
He uses wide-ruled spiral notebook,

1251
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,620
which also makes you kind of question his sanity,

1252
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,700
why anyone would use the wide-ruled versus college-ruled

1253
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,500
as an adult, but you know, it happens.

1254
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,760
I also want to be clear.

1255
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,460
You've only checked the one bedroom area.

1256
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,660
There is still a rotten smell to be discovered.

1257
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,760
When Tan leaves the room,

1258
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,040
he's like, can't deal with that smell.

1259
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,100
Hey, hey, Cindy, maybe we go check out the other room?

1260
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,720
Yeah, we can go check out the other room.

1261
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,400
Let's let them keep working on this one.

1262
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,320
But in the meantime, that's what we'll be doing.

1263
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,880
Yeah, sure, but you know that all four of us

1264
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,680
can't talk all at the same time.

1265
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,120
Technically we could, but.

1266
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:06,960
I don't think so.

1267
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,780
Let's try it.

1268
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,620
We're doing it right now.

1269
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,460
Start talking.

1270
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,960
No one would want to listen.

1271
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,280
So two of you are going over to the furthest room,

1272
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,160
the storage room.

1273
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,860
Two of you are still searching

1274
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,520
in the Scott Adams primary room.

1275
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,760
You're in the bedroom.

1276
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,200
Are you checking out the notebook then?

1277
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,280
That's what you want to do?

1278
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,080
Well, I mean, so is there like a closed bathroom door

1279
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,240
staring at us or a lump under the covers?

1280
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,840
Slightly a jar bathroom door.

1281
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,000
There's nothing under the covers.

1282
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,120
The bed is definitely empty.

1283
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,880
Okay, I have picked up the notebook,

1284
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,760
but I do want to kind of kick open lightly with my foot,

1285
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,080
the bathroom door.

1286
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,160
And Harlan, where are you?

1287
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,680
So I just succeeded to search.

1288
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,520
Well, you told us there were two journals.

1289
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,100
What's the other journal?

1290
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,520
The other journal is just some like random UFO nonsense

1291
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,920
related to his watch the skies.

1292
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,240
It's like a log book.

1293
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,380
Those assorted documents.

1294
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,920
Can I look at those a little closer with that search rule?

1295
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,440
It's going to take you some time.

1296
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,300
So I'll let you kind of go through them in a little bit,

1297
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,880
but you're not going to be able to necessarily do it

1298
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,720
in real time.

1299
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,040
It's just, it's a mess.

1300
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,920
This room's been not necessarily like ransacked,

1301
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,540
but it's just in complete disarray.

1302
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,380
Yeah.

1303
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,000
Yeah, I'm sitting there looking through that stuff

1304
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,500
and he's going to the bathroom.

1305
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,400
So we'll kick off with Joe Dean

1306
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,600
before we get to the other room.

1307
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,920
So Joe Dean, you get to the bathroom

1308
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,780
and once the door is fully ajar,

1309
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,720
you see where the smell is coming from.

1310
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,680
You see a heavyset man in the bathtub,

1311
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,840
roughly 34 years old in age,

1312
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,200
curly black hair and a bushy beard.

1313
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,320
He's in boxer shorts and wearing a t-shirt

1314
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,760
Knoxville Fantasy Con 1989.

1315
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,900
He's up to his chest in water.

1316
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,840
Clearly the stopper is in the tub.

1317
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,040
To make matters worse, that water is deep red

1318
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,300
because you see numerous self-inflicted slashes

1319
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:02,720
all over his body, arms, legs, everywhere.

1320
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,640
Specifically the arms and legs.

1321
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,040
Specifically the arms and legs.

1322
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,760
You see floating in the water, just a single razor blade.

1323
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,440
If I look at back into the room,

1324
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,640
are there signs of an individual maybe like increasingly

1325
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,720
succumbing to this kind of pain?

1326
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,320
Is that how the room looks destroyed or?

1327
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,160
No, no pain medication.

1328
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,480
I guess what else did Billy Ray have

1329
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,560
that was kind of obvious?

1330
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,320
He talked about eating a lot and being hungry.

1331
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,820
You see some takeout containers, but nothing crazy.

1332
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,720
Yeah, not really a heck of a lot.

1333
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,340
Okay, well then I guess the last thing

1334
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:44,000
we wanna do in here is look at his computer.

1335
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,600
Are you gonna do anything with the body?

1336
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,560
I close the bathroom door and try to mitigate the smell

1337
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,280
and I kind of motioned to Harlan.

1338
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,680
I'm like, he's in there, you can have a look.

1339
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,140
Harlan, like even wordlessly is just like an affirmation.

1340
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,800
Like I knew he was gonna be in there.

1341
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,640
You should look.

1342
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,600
You wanna see a dead body?

1343
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,200
You wanna see a dead body?

1344
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,760
Do you need a second opinion?

1345
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,460
I will check, of course.

1346
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,880
I just, from Thomas to Joe,

1347
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,740
Harlan should see the insane way in which he died.

1348
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,120
And then either I can describe that to you

1349
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,740
or you can go look a look, take a look.

1350
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,780
Yeah, I mean, I'm researching documents,

1351
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,100
but I can go look in the bathroom.

1352
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,060
You wanna look at the body?

1353
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,400
I do, I guess I'll look at the body.

1354
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,220
You hear some noises in the bathtub.

1355
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,740
Ooh, like water sloshing or something else?

1356
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,900
You see, yes, at the surface,

1357
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,560
a little bit of bubbling coming up

1358
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,340
and the water's moving slightly.

1359
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,580
I called it, Jody.

1360
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,540
Did you notice this and I'm just pointing at the bubbles?

1361
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:47,220
Uh, Cindy, you guys wanna come take a look

1362
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,780
at this real quick?

1363
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,940
Cindy and Tanner are distracting Riker

1364
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,500
outside of both of these rooms.

1365
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,640
Yeah, we're really excited to try the Megaduce.

1366
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,480
Yeah.

1367
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,300
Everyone keeps telling us to go there.

1368
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,860
Well, what would you suggest that I order?

1369
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,900
Also don't breathe in through your nose.

1370
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,140
Jody and Ashley, he busts out the door.

1371
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,060
He says to Riker, strange question, maybe.

1372
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,340
You got a fishnet, a big fishnet, small fishnet.

1373
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,660
No, you know anybody with-

1374
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,340
I got toilet plunger.

1375
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,360
Can you bring me a fitted sheet?

1376
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,580
Okay, goes and gets you a fitted sheet.

1377
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,420
What's going on in there?

1378
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,660
Yeah, why a fitted sheet or a big net?

1379
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,100
Can we cut to the bathroom real quick?

1380
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,020
Harlan's still in there and I wanna see

1381
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,380
if the plug in the tub, is it a pull out?

1382
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,500
You have to reach in your hand in the water

1383
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,540
to pull it out or do you have to hit the switch on the side?

1384
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,380
There's no switch.

1385
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,640
So you have to press the button

1386
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,740
to get the spring to trigger or pull it out.

1387
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,580
It's one or the other.

1388
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,220
But it's reaching into the water either way.

1389
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,040
Yes.

1390
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,320
Could I find something long like,

1391
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,980
oh, can I pull the towel rack off?

1392
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,020
Like just to undo that and I wanna use that

1393
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,200
to push down on the thing to drain the tub.

1394
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,180
What if the thing goes down the drain?

1395
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,720
Ooh, that's why I wanted to like filter it out

1396
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,560
with the sheet.

1397
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,800
Yeah, I don't know.

1398
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,640
I see.

1399
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,680
Jodine, you looked initially at the body, right?

1400
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,560
And you left.

1401
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,400
Yes.

1402
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,240
And then you came back in with Harlan?

1403
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,080
Yes.

1404
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,240
Give me an alertness roll.

1405
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,940
11, a crit.

1406
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,800
With an 11, you notice something is different

1407
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,500
than when you were first in the room.

1408
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,000
And what's different was it looked initially

1409
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,240
like he had some sort of like large pimple

1410
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,520
or growth or something on his head,

1411
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,440
kind of right on his forehead.

1412
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,000
No hair on it, but it was like a growth on his skull.

1413
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,520
By the time you come back, it's gone.

1414
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,000
Harlan, step back.

1415
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,280
Get out of this bathroom.

1416
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,300
Harlan is holding the towel rack about to hit the thing.

1417
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,240
You hear from inside the pipes underneath the bathtub,

1418
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:06,240
bang, bang, bang, up against the stopper,

1419
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,040
something coming up from inside the pipes,

1420
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:14,640
going up into the bathtub, bang, bang.

1421
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,460
What do you do?

1422
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,840
Holy shit.

1423
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,920
If this is like fight, flight or freeze,

1424
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,040
we all just froze.

1425
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,640
Yeah.

1426
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,280
As you're standing there,

1427
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,160
eventually the clanging pushes through,

1428
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,440
the stopper bust out in this almost metallic looking liquid

1429
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,560
starts pouring up through the bloody water.

1430
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,660
So it starts cascading up into the ceiling,

1431
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,900
spraying bloody water everywhere.

1432
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,560
And then this metallic substance starts spraying

1433
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,640
all over the room.

1434
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,120
Oh my God.

1435
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,160
Those of you in the room, give me a Dodge.

1436
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,580
It's the Terminator.

1437
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,800
Holy shit.

1438
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,620
A one.

1439
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,600
I rolled a one.

1440
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,720
And I rolled a six on a 50.

1441
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,240
Oh, all right.

1442
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,060
So with both of those,

1443
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:16,260
you're able to just back out really quickly

1444
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,640
out of the bathroom,

1445
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,120
not getting wet from any of the either bloody water

1446
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,560
or this metallic stuff,

1447
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,360
but it sprays up as a geyser and then falls back down.

1448
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,200
And it's kind of mixed into this bloody water

1449
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,720
as the tub is draining.

1450
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,800
And everything that's sprayed up onto the walls and ceiling

1451
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,280
kind of conjoins together,

1452
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,200
almost like, you know, mercury beating together

1453
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,580
and starts going back,

1454
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,320
joining the rest of the stuff in the tub

1455
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,880
and starts swirling down the drain.

1456
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,560
Should we try to collect some?

1457
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,400
I don't know.

1458
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,040
I was not prepared for anything like this.

1459
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,180
Mr. Winners?

1460
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,560
Mr. Winners, I know it's the end of class,

1461
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,840
but you forgot to collect our homework.

1462
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,100
I don't want to be that guy,

1463
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:03,440
but can these guys roll a fucking sanity check?

1464
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
Oh yeah, shit.

1465
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,060
Yes, they most definitely can.

1466
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,200
Also, I have to pee so bad.

1467
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,320
Are we close to pee time?

1468
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,160
Yes, we are.

1469
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:15,980
That's a fail.

1470
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,600
Fail for me.

1471
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,960
Oh no.

1472
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,440
Oh yes.

1473
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,640
Oh yeah.

1474
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,600
Take four sanity damage each.

1475
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,400
We got it.

1476
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,220
Sorry, I was just, I was very much in the mood.

1477
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,320
Make them roll again.

1478
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,760
Do it, make them do it again.

1479
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,400
Oh, just wait till you two search room 11.

1480
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,400
Is it five for like temporary insanity?

1481
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,240
Yeah.

1482
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,280
Okay.

1483
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,100
Yep.

1484
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,440
You should have made it five.

1485
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:54,640
So a little bit of sanity damage,

1486
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
but you're not wet from the metallic oozy stuff.

1487
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,680
Yeah, I think that probably would have been a day

1488
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,680
for you and me, Joe.

1489
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,040
What do you do though as it's swirling down the drain?

1490
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,080
Yeah, I don't know.

1491
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:16,160
Joe Dean grabs one of like a cup from the fast food debris,

1492
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,400
a Wendy's cup or some shit, whatever's there.

1493
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,880
And he just tries to grab a drop that's falling down

1494
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,400
from the ceiling and like catch it in the cup.

1495
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,800
He catches it.

1496
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,800
It recognizes its path almost was obstructed.

1497
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:36,080
It rapidly expands from being just a couple drops in size,

1498
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:41,080
outward, super flat, super wide, shattering the cup.

1499
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,160
And then the glass and liquid falls back into the tub.

1500
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,320
Joe Dean like drops it as it shatters in his hands,

1501
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,640
walks out of the bathroom and closes the door.

1502
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,920
Thomas's eyes were so big as you were describing that.

1503
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,780
Keep Rekker out of here.

1504
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,360
Rekker, I go outside and I'm gonna say Rekker,

1505
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,700
this was not the right fitted sheet.

1506
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,640
Like why don't you, can we go,

1507
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,600
we needed something different.

1508
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,200
Maybe I don't know what a fitted sheet is.

1509
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,900
Could you just bring back a lot of things

1510
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,920
from like the deepest part of your linen closet?

1511
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,060
Oh, sure, sure.

1512
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,380
Maybe crack open room 12 real quick.

1513
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,180
That way we can do a safety check in there before you go.

1514
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,780
Oh, 11, I think, but yeah.

1515
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,340
12, if you have it.

1516
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,240
Yeah, you can just leave us that key if that's all right.

1517
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,480
We really do need those linens quite quickly.

1518
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,320
I'll unlock it.

1519
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,620
You can open it when you need it.

1520
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,960
Okay, thank you.

1521
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,900
He jets off.

1522
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,240
Nice guy.

1523
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,700
Yeah, he has one of the most prestigious jobs in town.

1524
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,820
He's managing a 11 room motel.

1525
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,840
Big time for Merle, the richest man in town.

1526
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,740
Yeah.

1527
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,740
Exactly.

1528
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,940
By this time though,

1529
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,400
you can reason that the entire tub is drained.

1530
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,240
Now you have this room with a computer,

1531
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,940
some journals, and also room 11.

1532
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,920
Now the other thing that you can't see on the map

1533
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,020
that I didn't mention,

1534
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,980
there's actually a door inside of this room

1535
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,460
conjoining room 10 and 11 as well.

1536
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,660
You can also try to go into room 11.

1537
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,180
There's a mech in that one closet.

1538
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:18,180
Well, when Riker lets us into room 11,

1539
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,420
Tanner and Cindy will go in there.

1540
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,260
Yeah.

1541
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,080
Into room 11?

1542
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,920
Yeah.

1543
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,500
Okay, you crack open the door,

1544
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,940
you see a second motel room.

1545
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,940
This one in much better condition.

1546
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,120
However, you do see it's been lived in.

1547
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,260
This is not in fact a room for storage.

1548
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,460
There is clothing, a couple of suitcases,

1549
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:41,460
and there is a young girl curled up in the fetal position

1550
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:47,380
in the corner of the room silently up against the wall

1551
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:51,340
listening to what was happening in Scott Adams's room.

1552
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,940
Jane?

1553
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,780
Jane?

1554
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,940
Yeah?

1555
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,060
Holy shit.

1556
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,860
Thank God that you're safe.

1557
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,420
And Cindy is gonna walk up,

1558
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,740
pull a second cardigan out of her purse

1559
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:12,320
and go to wrap it around the back of this poor girl.

1560
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,860
And Cindy's being real soft, taking a real gentle approach.

1561
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:21,780
Dear, can you tell us at all what happened?

1562
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,160
I disappeared.

1563
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,000
Yeah.

1564
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,820
And, yeah, and something happened to me.

1565
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,660
It was three weeks ago.

1566
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,500
Okay.

1567
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,020
And as she stands up, you look at her.

1568
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:39,460
She is about six months pregnant.

1569
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,020
Oh, shit.

1570
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,140
Jane, Jane, how long?

1571
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,820
You said you disappeared three weeks.

1572
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,340
How long were you gone?

1573
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,780
A couple of hours.

1574
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,760
Jane, I have a really strange question to ask you.

1575
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,700
And I want you to just be very serious.

1576
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,940
Take it calm, okay?

1577
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,600
How long have you been pregnant?

1578
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,860
That's the thing.

1579
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:08,700
Yeah.

1580
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:14,060
Maybe a month?

1581
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,380
Yeah.

1582
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,020
Is it Billy's?

1583
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:17,900
Yes.

1584
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,740
Okay.

1585
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,140
Do you remember the lights?

1586
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:23,980
Yes.

1587
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,500
Do you remember any sounds?

1588
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,860
No, no.

1589
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,260
Any smells?

1590
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,560
They put things in me.

1591
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,080
Yeah, I want to look at her arms.

1592
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,960
Well, actually, you don't see anything on her arms.

1593
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,160
What about her belly?

1594
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,000
Yeah.

1595
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,760
So you'll find those same kind of incisions

1596
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,000
all on her lower abdomen.

1597
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,680
She is just wearing a t-shirt inside.

1598
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,320
Another thing you'll notice in this room,

1599
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,600
there are food containers galore.

1600
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,340
Compared to Scott Adams' room,

1601
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:58,240
there are 10 times as many food containers.

1602
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,080
Any prescription, I assume?

1603
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,360
No pain meds.

1604
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,180
Tylenol?

1605
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,160
No.

1606
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,860
Doesn't seem like the muscle thing happened to her.

1607
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,480
You're one of those weak people

1608
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,520
who relies on pain medication, aren't you, Tan?

1609
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,040
Very odd way to phrase that, but yeah.

1610
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,480
Will you give this girl some?

1611
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,920
She's pregnant, I don't know if you're supposed to take that.

1612
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,760
Just ibuprofen, I don't know.

1613
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,320
I don't know much about pregnancy.

1614
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,380
You can roll medicine for me.

1615
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,160
Oh wait, none of you took medicine.

1616
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:31,600
How about this, I'll roll anyway.

1617
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,260
David's like, it's about drugs,

1618
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,600
and we're like, none of us will have the medicine skill.

1619
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,440
How about that?

1620
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,180
Yeah, it's not a crit fail, just a regular fail.

1621
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,020
Nice.

1622
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,800
You think it's fine.

1623
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:47,800
Hey, Cindy, I think we found our alien.

1624
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,400
Yeah, I think you're right.

1625
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,280
Jane, your mother is worried sick about you.

1626
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,560
I don't wanna see her.

1627
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,720
She can't see me like this.

1628
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,280
They're gonna be so disappointed in me.

1629
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,680
I don't know if they have the capacity for that.

1630
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,480
I just don't wanna see them.

1631
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,600
That's why I contacted Mr. Adams.

1632
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,640
Yeah, tell us, what's your relationship with Mr. Adams?

1633
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,740
Just needed help.

1634
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,000
What kind of help were you looking for?

1635
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,720
What could he offer you?

1636
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,160
Something to explain what happened to me,

1637
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,020
the lights and everything.

1638
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:28,020
And he was in town and asking about aliens and stuff,

1639
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,100
and I thought maybe that would be it.

1640
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,740
I don't know, but he paid for this room.

1641
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,460
He was bringing me food.

1642
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,340
Did he help with anything else?

1643
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,920
No, he just, he was keeping me safe.

1644
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:45,780
He was gonna take me to Nashville to see a doctor.

1645
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,620
He said, it's not safe here in town,

1646
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,100
and I have to go elsewhere.

1647
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,620
And when was the last time you saw him?

1648
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,860
I talked to him.

1649
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,060
Yesterday morning, he was supposed to bring me food,

1650
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,900
and I'm getting so hungry.

1651
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,060
So you didn't go next door?

1652
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,820
No, he told me to keep a low profile.

1653
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,700
And what did you do with him the day before that?

1654
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,620
He just told me to stay here.

1655
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,880
He said he was researching the town,

1656
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,700
and once he had enough evidence,

1657
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,340
we were gonna leave and go to Nashville.

1658
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:18,260
Did you guys physically touch?

1659
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,680
Did you shake his hand?

1660
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,420
Did you high-five him?

1661
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,220
He might've put his hand on my shoulder at some point,

1662
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,620
but I think maybe that's it.

1663
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:29,460
I don't know.

1664
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,940
I'm so hungry and scared.

1665
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:33,740
Well, we'll get you some food, okay?

1666
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,400
Okay.

1667
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,340
Now you can all roll me a sanity.

1668
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,180
Yeah.

1669
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:43,920
Having seen this young girl who is four weeks pregnant,

1670
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,020
but showing the signs of being around six months pregnant,

1671
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:47,860
seven months pregnant.

1672
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:48,780
Yeah, it's a fail.

1673
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,280
I had to fail for me as well.

1674
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:53,540
Three sanity damage.

1675
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,360
I am down to 44.

1676
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,900
I am down to 46.

1677
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,100
Ooh.

1678
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,860
Breaking point, 43.

1679
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,500
I'm at 36.

1680
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,420
I'm at a 45.

1681
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,740
Tanner feels sick,

1682
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:12,740
and he's just like Luke is not sure what to do next.

1683
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,100
Would we be able to say that in this time

1684
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,140
that they've been talking to her,

1685
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:19,820
that Jodine and Harlan have gone through the papers

1686
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,900
for Harlan and the computer for Jodine?

1687
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,140
Fact, we would be able to.

1688
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:25,980
Sweet.

1689
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,540
Let's go through the paper first.

1690
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,340
Would there also be cool information in there

1691
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,140
that they could learn that would be cool enough

1692
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,420
to end an episode on?

1693
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,000
Dude, I have to be so fast.

1694
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,980
Yep, right here.

1695
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:36,820
Sick.

1696
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,820
Yeah, you got any real prizes in there?

1697
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:39,980
It's in front of you.

1698
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,400
Read off some of it.

1699
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,240
Oh, shit.

1700
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,060
Be surprised.

1701
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:43,900
Gotcha.

1702
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,380
We've got a listing of number of livestock mutilations here.

1703
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,820
There were three cows, a goat, and 20 chickens.

1704
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:54,820
There's also livestock alterations.

1705
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,840
A cow was missing an udder, but otherwise in good health.

1706
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,180
Spotted three more in a roadside survey.

1707
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,740
Didn't know who the farmer was.

1708
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:07,080
We've also got accounts of missing time,

1709
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,620
chopper sightings, lights.

1710
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:14,100
Everyone's seen some, it says.

1711
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,780
Allen, Barn, Thomas, Jacobs, Cartwright, and Anderson

1712
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,420
never go home.

1713
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,440
Never go home.

1714
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,080
Do we know any of those names besides Allen?

1715
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,400
Barn is Merle.

1716
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,140
Cartwright is the family from Bonanza.

1717
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:30,980
Yep.

1718
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,800
And also.

1719
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,640
Those are all the aldermen.

1720
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,380
You would have seen their names on offices.

1721
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,540
When we were in the courthouse,

1722
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,500
we would have seen their names.

1723
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,980
Yeah, so Jane's dad, Merle Barn,

1724
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:43,020
and then you would have seen the other names too.

1725
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,180
Oh, this is, we did know.

1726
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:48,380
That's not like some ominous, mysterious thing.

1727
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,700
We knew he wasn't going home.

1728
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,260
Right, but never go home.

1729
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,100
Exactly.

1730
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,260
But I thought it was like,

1731
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:57,340
Scott Adams knows they'll never go home.

1732
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,380
Their story ends here.

1733
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:04,380
["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]

1734
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:16,180
I gotta work in the morning

1735
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:19,100
And this shit's so important

1736
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:23,100
So I can't get high

1737
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:29,100
No, I can't get high

1738
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:33,420
I thought this stuff helped anxiety

1739
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:36,620
It must be something inside of me

1740
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:40,740
Does anybody know why?

1741
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:45,740
I can't get high

1742
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,740
I can't sit though I can

1743
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:54,740
And I don't wanna try

1744
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:58,740
Please, my smile, won't you spare me

1745
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:03,500
Something more can be bought

1746
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,500
Where do you begin?

1747
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:12,500
I don't know how

1748
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,500
Hallucination's so big-time, but

1749
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,500
Spider's out the line

1750
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:25,260
Breathing

1751
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,260
I'm breathing

1752
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:33,260
I've been hiding in low, low places

1753
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,260
With some funny-looking dudes

1754
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,260
With some fucked-up faces

1755
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:40,260
And I can't help but feel it

1756
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:43,260
I'll always be at the bottom

1757
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,260
["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]

1758
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:07,260
I think I'm allergic or something

1759
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,260
Better go on with nothing

1760
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:14,260
So I won't get high

1761
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:19,260
No, I won't get high

1762
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:25,260
By all means, do it if it helps

1763
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,260
For me, it makes my brain melt

1764
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:32,260
Does anybody know why?

1765
