00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
Hello, good friends of the podcast called Pretending To Be People.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:13,760
It is the wolf, the dog, w-wolf the dog, with a special announcement this fine morn-vening.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,040
You may have noticed that this here episode is not episode 26 of season 2.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,880
In fact, it ain't even part of this here campaign.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,280
We'll be back in a couple weeks to pick up where we left off with the very precarious

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,520
situations we last left Julius Beck and Cal.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:44,360
But for now, it's a b-b-b-b-bonus episode from over on P-P-P-P-P-P-Patreon.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:51,600
In this premium, exclusive content from our contention-confidential feed is the episode

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,320
one of a six-part series that Thomas has entitled, The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,600
That's right, Thomas is the GM, and he's running a story set in the holler outside of contention

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,200
following the events of season one of Pretending To Be People.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,480
So if you haven't listened to season one, my delectable listeners, now is the time to

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:24,200
go back to where it all started, because there's, uh, spoilers and such in this ish.

14
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,280
Now if you have listened through season one, then boy oh boy, you are ready for what we've

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:38,080
been calling the Oops All Pettymores campaign, because Joe, Luke, and Zatch are all playing

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,280
members of the extended Pettymore family, and let me tell y'all the what, it's been

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,080
so got darn fun.

18
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:54,640
Just five dollars over at patreon.com slash pretending pod will unlock the saga that follows,

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,000
as well as the 30-something bonus episodes that came before.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,240
Now I'm not saying you need the bonus content, but I am saying that if you did need all this

21
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,320
bonus content, it's just five bucks to get what you need, and fittingly, Wolf is here

22
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:21,080
to provide an all-new, all-banging theme, provided by one of Joe's dad's bands.

23
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:43,200
It's the Morels with Get What You Need.

24
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,280
I need a boat.

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,440
I need a plane.

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
I need a car.

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
I need a train.

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
I need a pill.

29
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I need a drink.

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
I need a smoke.

31
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
I need a drink.

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,440
I need an eight-foot couch and a four-foot screen.

33
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,440
A big vacation and a dog that's mean.

34
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,440
I need a four-wheel drive and a three-piece suit.

35
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,440
A nine-millimeter that I know I can shoot.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,680
In the USA, it's not a question of greed.

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Cause everybody who is anybody agrees.

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,680
For followers the ones who lead.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
You get what you need.

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Brad's Monkey.

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Are you ready?

42
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,680
I'm ready.

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Five, four, three, two.

44
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Brad's Monkey!

45
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,920
The Funky Monkey!

46
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Brad's Monkey Monkey!

47
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
The Funky Monkey!

48
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Blam!

49
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Welcome to the Danov Show!

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Welcome to the Danov Show!

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,920
For episode 39 of the Patreon, which is a very fucking special episode.

52
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Is it not, Luke?

53
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
It is.

54
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,920
The title of this one is, remind me, Thomas?

55
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
The Hunt.

56
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
No.

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,160
The Lost Treasure of John Lee Treasuremore.

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,160
The Lost Treasure of John Lee Treasuremore.

59
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Episode 1, Bad Blood.

61
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Where we will be all playing Pettymore cousins or uncles or brothers or whatever it is.

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
You're all cousins to somebody.

63
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,160
The working title in all of my notes is Oops All Pettymores.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Oops All Pettymores.

65
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Exactly.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,400
So I think the Pettymores cousins are going to go on a treasure hunt.

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,400
But see, it's Thomas' job now, thank God, it's not my job for this one.

68
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,400
It's Thomas' job to make it serious and call episodes bad blood.

69
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
And it's up to us to say, Oops All Pettymores!

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Well, I did want to say, while tonight we'll be searching for treasure, you can find treasure,

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,640
especially for the holiday season, at Target.

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Target is the best destination for treasure.

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
That bit hasn't come out yet.

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
It hasn't come out yet.

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
You're right, this is a sneak peek.

76
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
It's a preview bit.

77
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
And it's real too.

78
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
So guys, go shop at Target.

79
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
That is what you get here in the Dennis Inn.

80
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,640
That's a bit from an episode we recorded yesterday, last night.

81
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,640
So it's some pretty fresh stuff for you.

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Some pretty hot sauce.

83
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Bleeding edge.

84
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Right off the lips of Luke.

85
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
We asked for some sins in the chat.

86
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,880
And I saw one that, it's already scrolled past now, but I had to mention it.

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,880
I think it was Zach said, that's a different Zach.

88
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
What did I say?

89
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
A different Zach.

90
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Zach with a K.

91
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Said that he accidentally put laxative in his boss's coffee.

92
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,880
I think that might take a week.

93
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Whoa!

94
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Accidentally?

95
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
What were they putting in their box's coffee?

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,880
An accident isn't a sin unless you don't apologize.

97
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,120
What if you don't need to apologize?

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Like this one?

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Because what's he going to do?

100
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Apologize?

101
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
You make fun of him.

102
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
There's a lot to take into account here.

103
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
How much does your boss hate shitting?

104
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
How much do you need your job?

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,120
How much do you personally value honesty as an individual?

106
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,120
How much is that going to eat you up?

107
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Are you the kind of person who, if you know you have to lie to your boss

108
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
about the fact that you made him shit his pants?

109
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Every day for the rest of your life until you die

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
because there won't be retirement for us.

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Exactly.

112
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Is that going to fuck with you?

113
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,360
One day you guys are sharing what the worst thing that ever happened to you was

114
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,360
and he was like, it was probably that time I shit my pants at work.

115
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
What about you?

116
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
That's when you tell him.

117
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Honestly, it was the day that I accidentally gave you laxative

118
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,360
and then I saw you shit your pants at work.

119
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,600
So if that would eat you up, just get it over with.

120
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Get it over with?

121
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Were there any other good...

122
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
I was setting this up.

123
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
I read the Brad's Monkey thing and then I kind of missed all of it.

124
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
There's somebody talking about that they found this cheap beer

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
called Montucky Cold Snacks

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
and just the name alone makes me want to taste it.

127
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Have you not had it?

128
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Totoro's Bang Bus has been recruiting people for a year

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
to drink it because it makes really good Brad's Monkeys.

130
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Brad's Monkey.

131
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
That funky monkey.

132
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Montucky Cold Snacks is well distributed here in our hometown of Springfield, Missouri.

133
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I feel like it's at every bar.

134
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Every bar?

135
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Is it in a grocery store where I've seen the cans before?

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
I don't go to that section.

137
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,840
It's like blue with a horse on it.

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
I haven't seen it, I don't think.

139
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
It looks like a retro NBA jersey.

140
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
I'll pick some up next time.

141
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
It does.

142
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
What else?

143
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,080
It looks like if they made Outrun Horse Show.

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Uh huh.

145
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
What's an Outrun Horse Show?

146
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Come on down!

147
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
See if you can outrun this horse!

148
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
No, it's like Knight Rider, but a horse.

149
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
The horse always wins.

150
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Yeah, every time!

151
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Who's faster than a horse?

152
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
It's Knight Rider, but it's a talking horse.

153
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Back in the day, they used to do

154
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
radio plays that had Superman

155
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
racing the Flash

156
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
And what I understand, Superman always won

157
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
and I always think that that sucks because

158
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
he does all the other things

159
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
The Flash has one thing and it's to be fast

160
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
And he's still not the best.

161
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
And if he loses to Superman, that's just sad.

162
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
That's such a bummer for him.

163
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Man, if you had that kind of power, wouldn't you become

164
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
I don't know, an authoritarian fascist

165
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
or just indifferent?

166
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
That might be interesting to explore.

167
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
That kind of Superman.

168
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Has anybody ever done a bad Superman?

169
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Who would try to put him down like some sort of

170
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
opposite?

171
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
It's probably going to have to be another group of

172
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
pretty shrewdly realized superhero

173
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
parodies.

174
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
No, Rorschach's not pretty.

175
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Wait, what?

176
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Who are we talking about?

177
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Well, a number of different IPs.

178
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
What was that recent one that came out, Bright Something?

179
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Bright?

180
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Where he's a kid?

181
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
It was not great, but I liked it.

182
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
I haven't seen it, but I remember the whole thing was that

183
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
it was bad Superman.

184
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Oh, Hancock.

185
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
No.

186
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Yes.

187
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Yeah.

188
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
He's right, Joe.

189
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
That's hilarious. Brightburn.

190
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Brightburn.

191
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
I liked it.

192
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Because it's like, oh, Superman, he's bad,

193
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
but what are you going to do?

194
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Evil.

195
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
He's a kid and he's bad.

196
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Oh, and he can do crazy stuff.

197
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
What are you going to do?

198
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Brightburn.

199
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Yeah, I've got Brightburn.

200
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm sorry to hear that, dude.

201
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
What are they going to do, though?

202
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
You're a kid.

203
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
It Brightburns when I pee.

204
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
What do we do?

205
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Like, neon.

206
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
What are you asking?

207
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
What do we do?

208
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
What do we do?

209
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Yeah, what do we do to get the fire back

210
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
within our loins?

211
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
They've got pills for that.

212
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
An uncle.

213
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
LMFAO. Put it on right now.

214
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Loins burning.

215
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
It's strange.

216
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
They're not that far apart

217
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
in age. It's not that weird.

218
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Thomas. Yeah.

219
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Almost ready. I'm ready.

220
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I'm rearing to go.

221
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
I'm ready to play a pettymore

222
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
for the nth time.

223
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
I've never played a pettymore.

224
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Are you excited? Yeah.

225
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
How do you get into the mindset of playing a pettymore?

226
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
It's a page-long introduction.

227
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Yeah, I saw how long it was.

228
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
You wouldn't let me read it, though.

229
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
No, of course not.

230
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Of course not. There's secrets in here

231
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
that I don't think you can handle.

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I've got my intro in mind, but

233
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
unless the story reads it, I think I should go first

234
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
so that the more thought-out ones

235
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
can go after me.

236
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Yeah, that's why you're going to go second

237
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
after Zach.

238
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Actually, we might sandwich Zach.

239
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Luke can go first.

240
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Joe, you told me you literally had dreams

241
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
about rehearsing yours.

242
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
It's not a page-long, is all.

243
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Okay, Luke can go first

244
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
and give Zach time to write his.

245
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm just looking up the questions you sent.

246
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
I don't know if you're

247
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
trying to be me as vengeance

248
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
or if we are the same person.

249
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Look on me, look on me.

250
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
If it's vengeance, I get it. If it's just you,

251
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
then...

252
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Welcome to my life.

253
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Did you get it?

254
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Is that how we're kicking off?

255
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Are we kicking off with all of this?

256
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
No, there's some stuff.

257
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Should we get some good intro stuff

258
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
about the episode for the Patreon?

259
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Let's get some intro stuff about the episode

260
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
for the Patreon.

261
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
For them audio listeners.

262
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Hello audio listeners.

263
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Hello audio listeners.

264
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
You guys have missed so much

265
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
that we talked about before

266
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
in the Patreon.

267
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
So go ahead and up those Patreons.

268
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Did you know Chris D'Elia died?

269
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
I saw that, dude.

270
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
We didn't talk about that on the stream, did we?

271
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
No, you gotta explain why you said that

272
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
though, because

273
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Joe's over here scrolling

274
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
on his phone.

275
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
I got the update, I got the CNN update

276
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
that Kirstie Alley had passed away

277
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
and I said that aloud.

278
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
And I really loudly was like

279
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
aww.

280
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Which confused Zach.

281
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Because I thought he said that Chris D'Elia died

282
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
and then Thomas goes, aww,

283
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
oh no.

284
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
But like genuinely?

285
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Like someone you cared about

286
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
or like cared that they died

287
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
and died? Well, you know, when I was younger

288
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
I watched that pervert episode of Workaholics

289
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
all the time before I went to bed.

290
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
No, I did watch Cheers like all the time

291
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
because it was just on like the nightbox

292
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
as I was going

293
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
to bed as a young one.

294
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
I'm going to rip Kirstie Alley

295
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
who will be long dead and decayed

296
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
by the time you hear this episode edited

297
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
as a Patreon listener.

298
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Okay, so what we're doing here tonight

299
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
is episode one

300
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
of The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

301
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
It's called Bad Blood.

302
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Bad Blood.

303
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Cause baby now we got

304
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
bad blood.

305
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
And everybody made me mad.

306
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Got it.

307
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Check.

308
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Nailed it. Nailed it.

309
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
And what this is is a

310
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
an oops all Pettymore arc where

311
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
all the boys are going to be playing

312
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
family members of

313
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
my character John Lee Pettymore

314
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
from season one. And we kind of

315
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
established during that season that he has a very big

316
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
extended family who are

317
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
kind of as crazy and wild as him.

318
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Big old wild family out there in contention.

319
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Big old blunts. In the surrounding

320
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
areas. Huge

321
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
smoking big doinks in Amish.

322
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Big smoking big doinks

323
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
in contention.

324
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
But we won't be in contention listeners

325
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
because some of you might remember

326
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
what happened at the end of season one.

327
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Spoilers. Spoilers. Spoilers.

328
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Which is Keith put a big old dome over everything.

329
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,320
And I

330
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
after seeing

331
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
the beautifully round shape

332
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
off riding into the sunset

333
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
of Planet Juggernaut

334
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
he looked at that shape and said

335
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
I like that.

336
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Now you know it has deeper roots than that right?

337
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Oh. I thought you did this

338
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
intentionally but I don't know.

339
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I was like damn I respect the fuck out of

340
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Luke when I listen to like episode

341
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
15 or 16 and

342
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Keith literally says like I'd like to

343
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
put a giant

344
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
dome over the whole city.

345
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
I think it's just something

346
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
I think about a lot.

347
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
That's just the Luke

348
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
preoccupation that you brought into

349
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
the character.

350
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Which is a great

351
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
no it's the who shot Mr. Burns episode.

352
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Oh. Did they do it in the movie too?

353
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
I think they did. It was like the whole

354
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
point of the movie.

355
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Oh they do a dome in the movie who shot

356
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Mr. Burns he just builds a giant thing

357
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
that blocks out the sun.

358
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
If you want to block out

359
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
any one of us your three sons

360
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
during this episode you can put up your hand

361
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
like that in a particular way

362
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
in front of that camera that can block

363
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
one of us from sight. Yeah.

364
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
That's me. I'm gone now.

365
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I was trying to block you all.

366
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
That's all of us.

367
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
Okay my three sons.

368
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
You're all going to be playing Betty Morris.

369
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
I cannot wait.

370
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
And times are a little tough for the

371
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Betty Morris.

372
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
They are not at their full power as you might say.

373
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
You all are friends of

374
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Jon in the way that cousins

375
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
often are. Some of you

376
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
are a little older. One of you is

377
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
pretty much right at Jon's age.

378
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
But he's been missing for a year at this point.

379
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
He's not the only

380
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
anymore missing.

381
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Don D. Pettymore is gone.

382
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Jimmy Sanders is gone.

383
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
There's some talk about

384
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Aloysius

385
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
and Edward. Some sort

386
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
of foul play that might have happened involving

387
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Jon but nobody really knows. You've only

388
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
heard rumors. And

389
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
when you were all growing up you would come

390
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
to Pettymore Holler at least

391
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
every year if you didn't actually

392
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
live there for the big family cookout.

393
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
A huge Pettymore reunion.

394
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
And it's been five or six years since

395
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
that's actually been put on.

396
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
But this year everybody gets

397
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
a call or an email

398
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
or a handwritten note from Ma

399
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Pettymore, the family matriarch.

400
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
We can work

401
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
out family trees and stuff later.

402
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
I think even though some of you are older

403
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
it's plausible you're all

404
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
within the same generation of cousins

405
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
of Jon. So we're going to say

406
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
she's your great-great-grandmother.

407
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
We have them young. Yeah, she's like

408
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
67.

409
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Wow.

410
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
The math on that

411
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
is horrible. It sucks.

412
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
She's like 77.

413
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
97.

414
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
She's turning 70.

415
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
That's what I wrote

416
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
on the Patreon is that it was her 70th birthday.

417
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
She's turning 70.

418
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Great-great.

419
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Great-great-grandmother. Okay, she's your great-grandmother.

420
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Okay, that helps

421
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
a little bit.

422
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Put in a second grade. Make it weird.

423
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
No.

424
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
She's your great-grandmother and she's called you all here

425
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
today for the first Pettymore

426
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
cookout, hoedown, get-together,

427
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
hootenanny

428
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
family reunion that you've had in

429
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
five years. And usually this is at

430
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
her place. This is at Ma

431
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Pettymore's house, kind of the heart

432
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
of all the family property

433
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
in Pettymore Haller, which is where

434
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
John lives on the edge of.

435
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
And the unusual thing about her letter this year is

436
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
that it mentions this is going to be at John's

437
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
place. She says, it's not just

438
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
a birthday celebration. This is

439
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
about family, remembering,

440
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
and our future. And so

441
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
in one way or the other, you all make your way from

442
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
wherever it is you live to

443
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
John Lee Pettymore's house on the outside

444
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
of contention. And it's not

445
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
really the same as you remember

446
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
getting there last time. The Haller itself

447
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
is located in between,

448
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
um, I've actually got something written

449
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
for this. I could just start reading.

450
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Yeah, you should do that.

451
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
Do a good voice.

452
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Like Liz.

453
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
Welcome to

454
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
the puddle.

455
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Do a baby voice.

456
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
The home and property of John Lee Pettymore.

457
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
The home and property of

458
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
John Lee Pettymore sits just above the cleavage

459
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
that separates the two local prominences

460
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
known as big and little beans

461
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
teat.

462
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
A cleavage that, for as long as

463
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
anyone can remember, has borne your family's

464
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
name. Pettymore Haller.

465
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Generations of Pettymores have lived and died

466
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
between the teats, tending to the land,

467
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
themselves, and generally honoring

468
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
the bounty the good Lord has seen fit to bless them

469
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
with. That's at least how the Pettymore tells it.

470
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
But God doesn't make bras big enough

471
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
for mountains.

472
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
And you know as well as every outsider

473
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
within 50 miles that the Haller

474
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
has never truly contained your rowdy,

475
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
wild, and extremely prolific

476
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
clan. You're all driving.

477
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
There's one way into contention, pretty much.

478
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
The highway. And

479
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
you're driving down some familiar farm

480
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
farmland, wide

481
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
open spaces. As you get closer to

482
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
contention, the land becomes more treed

483
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
and hillier. And about 10 miles outside

484
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
of town, there is a massive

485
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
construction barricade across

486
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
the highway, diverting you onto

487
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Farm Road 67.

488
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Damn. Too way.

489
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Just wait.

490
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
As you get to that

491
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
construction

492
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
detour, roll an alertness

493
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
check for me.

494
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Ooh. Already rolling.

495
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Right off the bat.

496
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Mine's a fail. Fail.

497
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
I pass. 18 on a 50.

498
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Okay, you two grumble a little bit and take the detour.

499
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
But Luke, you

500
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
would notice, and we'll get to who you are

501
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
in just a second, but you would notice that

502
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
pretty much as far as you can see past the

503
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
barricades, you don't see any

504
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
signs of construction. There's no

505
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
equipment. There's no

506
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
upturned earth. It just seems like

507
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
abandoned highway for as long

508
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
as you can see until it disappears kind of

509
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
behind the bend and some hills. And

510
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
you think that's odd, but you've read about

511
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
it being a pretty extensive

512
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
project, so maybe it's just further on down

513
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
closer to contention itself.

514
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
And you all take Farm Road 60

515
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
in your own ways.

516
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
Through these woody hills,

517
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
beautiful picturesque dreams,

518
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
gorgeous oaks, mighty

519
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
pines, stout

520
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
sycamores.

521
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Everything the Ozarks

522
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
has to offer, all the natural beauty you

523
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
grew up with, or at least spent time

524
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
around as children, like to some extent.

525
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
And you're actually, you're gonna pass through

526
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Pettymore Hauler itself, on the back way

527
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
to John's pretty much. Give me just a second.

528
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
I'm liking it. I'm there.

529
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
I'm in the hauler. I'm there. I'm a drone right

530
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
now. I'm a drone in some cleavage.

531
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
In between the teats. I'm a titty fucking

532
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
hauler. Hell yeah.

533
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
Hey Keith, you're

534
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
named after the pair of tits?

535
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
No, it's named after me.

536
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
You come to the

537
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
crossroads of Farm Road 67

538
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
and Jiminy Road, which sits

539
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
pretty much directly at this

540
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
small unincorporated

541
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
community known as Jiminy Station.

542
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
There's a little gas station

543
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
and bed and breakfast there

544
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
and a couple of like abandoned

545
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
mid-century commercial buildings.

546
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
You would know that, you know,

547
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
if 50 people lived in Jiminy Station

548
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
in the 70s, maybe less than

549
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
two dozen do now. You take Jiminy

550
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Road past Farm Road 68

551
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
to Farm Road 69.

552
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Which leads to the heart of

553
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Pettymore Hauler.

554
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
And you see, you see all the ancestral

555
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
fiefdom. You see

556
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Ma Pettymore's house.

557
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
You see some frankly

558
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
less well camped properties.

559
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Sites you're pretty familiar with though.

560
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
A lot of pettymoors don't like to get rid of things.

561
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
They like to keep them around in case they need them.

562
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
So if you prefer that to a yard, you know,

563
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
whose business is that but yours?

564
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
And when you get to

565
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
the gates of John's Farm, you see

566
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
the front field is

567
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
completely packed with parked

568
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
cars. And there's already

569
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
a pretty broad gathering.

570
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Dozens and dozens of pettymoors

571
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
all around these tables and

572
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Bunch of ladies. Ladies.

573
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Guys. Broad gathering.

574
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Kids. Got it. Oh, broad gathering.

575
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Boom. It's a real broad city.

576
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
BC, you see your

577
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
whole family there. For the first time in years.

578
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
Relatives you haven't seen

579
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
since you were small. Some you might have

580
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
seen more recently. But everyone is

581
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
so happy. Luke, we're gonna do

582
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
you first. Okay.

583
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Tell me and then I'll go.

584
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
As your character

585
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
pulls in to this cookout, you park

586
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
and you get out of your car. And who

587
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
gets out? Who are you? Where are you from?

588
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Well, why are you here?

589
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Many creatures

590
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
are born in and roam the

591
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
hollers near contention. Bears,

592
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
coyotes, bobcats, and pettymoors live their

593
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
entire lives there until they're eaten,

594
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
shot, or hit with a truck. The latter two

595
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
spell the end of Bernie Pettymore but only

596
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
after he fathered his first and only son

597
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Peter Bernard Pettymore. Peter Bernard

598
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Pettymore, known around the hollers as

599
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
PDB, was raised by his

600
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
was raised by his now single

601
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
mother along with plenty of help from

602
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
the rest of the Pettymore clan. Upon

603
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
graduating high school, a relatively uncommon

604
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
accomplishment in his neck of the woods,

605
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
Petey left the comfort of the

606
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
holler to pursue his dream. Flying.

607
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Peter packed up the few belongings

608
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
he had, hitchhiked his way to Colorado,

609
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
and joined the United States Air Force

610
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Academy. After four long years of

611
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
intensive study and training, Pete joined the

612
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Air Force and at long last took to the

613
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
skies. Although a handful of Pettymoors

614
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
had taken trips in planes and even more

615
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
had conquered the land and sea,

616
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Petey was the first of his name to make a home

617
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
in the wild blue yonder. After

618
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
fulfilling his duty to the United States military,

619
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Peter set his sights on the final

620
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
frontier, Florida. Petey accepted

621
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
a position at NASA honing his scientific

622
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
skills and offering his perfected

623
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
piloting prowess for the furtherance of

624
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
humanity and safety of the planet.

625
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Pete successfully manned many missions,

626
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
retiring with full benefits and the knowledge

627
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
that he made a measurable difference.

628
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
The stories Pete's friends and family hear about

629
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
his tenure at NASA seem exaggerated,

630
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
outlandish, and often completely

631
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
fabricated. But Petey knows

632
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
the truth and that's all that matters to him.

633
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
I flew a

634
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
secret rocket ship to shoot a missile

635
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
bomb at a giant accumulation

636
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
of space trash that was headed right

637
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
for Kilimanjaro.

638
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Would have wiped out the whole eastern hemisphere

639
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
but we nailed that sucker and blew

640
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
it back to Alpha Centauri.

641
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
What was some poor alien's fucker's problem

642
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
now? When we got home,

643
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
I cracked open a little intergalactic

644
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
pale ale, which is the secret beer we

645
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
brew at NASA. Yep,

646
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
that was the best beer I ever had.

647
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
What about you? Petey Pettymore takes

648
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
a long sip from his Miller Lite and size,

649
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
looking over at his conversation partner,

650
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
a young disheveled Pettymore boy concentrating

651
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
on his Game Boy. Without waiting for a response,

652
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
Petey chugs his beer, stands up,

653
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
and crushes the beer under his black combat

654
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
boots. The camera pans up from the

655
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
crushed can and we see a blue jumper

656
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
adorned with a NASA patch, an American

657
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
flag, and an embroidered

658
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
name tag that reads Commander

659
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
Petey B. Peteymore. The top of the jumper is

660
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
unzipped, revealing a black graphic t-shirt

661
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
emblazoned with a cartoon astronaut eating

662
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
a peach and the text that says

663
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Eat NASA.

664
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,320
Laughter

665
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Petey runs his hands through his

666
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
slick-backed red hair, the sides

667
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
still shaven in the military fashion,

668
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
but the top long enough to

669
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
slick back and settle on his back a few

670
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
inches below the shoulders. His piercing

671
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
green eyes dart around, searching for a familiar

672
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
face in the curious sea of

673
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Pettymores. It's good to be home,

674
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
Petey BP says as he turns his

675
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
gaze to the sky.

676
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
At least for now.

677
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
Hey Petey.

678
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
Hey there. Hey, it's your

679
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Uncle Ron. Ron, of course.

680
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
You remember me? And you

681
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
see a very, very

682
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
almost impossibly skinny old

683
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
man who kind of just comes hobbling

684
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
over to you and he's wearing

685
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
a camo fatigue vest

686
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
and he's got a Vietnam veteran's

687
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
cap and he just grins

688
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
at you with these yellow teeth

689
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
that are, you know, what's left of him and

690
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
this huge, huge tobacco-stained

691
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
white beard. And he says, Petey, I've been

692
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
really wanting to talk to you about

693
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
your experiences at NASA.

694
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Yeah, Ron, I haven't seen you

695
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
since I went to space.

696
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Well, since you've seen me, I've been to

697
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
space too, my friend.

698
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Really? More than once or twice have the

699
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
grays abducted me.

700
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
I'd like to pick your brain a little bit about what's

701
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
been going on up, you know, up in the

702
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
government because they don't answer my letters none.

703
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
Well, you know, I'm retired now so I

704
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
can mostly just tell you about blowing stuff

705
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
up in space as far as the

706
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
government's concerned. I never saw any aliens.

707
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
Yeah, the official story is

708
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
you blew up a ball of trash in space.

709
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
But who put it there, man? The aliens!

710
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
I don't, well, how

711
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
about we circle back to this

712
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
later. Okay, I will catch

713
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
up with you later because I, well, have you heard

714
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
from, have you heard from Trey?

715
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Trey wants to talk to you and

716
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
some of the others. I haven't seen him yet

717
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
but I think you're done with your government work.

718
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
You ain't afraid of making a little money,

719
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
are you? Well, no, that's, I mean

720
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
one reason I tried to move back around here

721
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
was, you know, make a little

722
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
money and have a little fun. That's good to

723
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
hear, that's good to hear because I think we can do both.

724
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Okay, well. Trey's gonna fill you

725
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
in on more. Okay, I'll go find him.

726
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
It was really good to see you, Beatty.

727
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
I'm gonna get you to talk. I'm gonna

728
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
get you to tell me about them grays.

729
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
Ron, we'll talk about it. So, yeah, Ron

730
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
hobbles off to refill his beer.

731
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
You wander off to go mingle with the rest of the party

732
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
and Joe, you pull up next.

733
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
There's a man already kind of

734
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
standing by the keg

735
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
and he's got a red solo cup full

736
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
and he has a cigarette in his other hand

737
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
and he's got a mullet.

738
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
It's a gray mullet and the front

739
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
of the mullet is feathered out

740
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
kind of Rod Stewart style mullet.

741
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
Hell yes. And he's wearing these

742
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
kind of gaudy big glasses

743
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
with a gold rim

744
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
around the edges. Maybe little circles

745
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
embroidering the arms of the

746
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
sunglasses. And he's wearing

747
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
a cowboy shirt

748
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
and it's a white cowboy shirt with white

749
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
pearl snaps and the filigree on it is

750
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
embroidered white. So it's

751
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
kind of shimmers in the sun and catches shadows

752
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
and it's cut off at the sleeves

753
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
and he's got no shirt underneath. It's open.

754
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
He's got a big

755
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
beer belly hanging out the front

756
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
but his legs are like in

757
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
skinny jeans. He's kind of

758
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
like a rooster looking almost

759
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
with his big belly and his swoop

760
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
back hair and his rooster legs

761
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
is actually a highly desired

762
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
trait in a petty more man.

763
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
If you can

764
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
get them jeans that tight and that.

765
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
He's been cultivating the look for a while.

766
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Probably nailed it a long time

767
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
ago and stuck with it.

768
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
You're

769
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
I love you're describing like so

770
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
many guys that we used to see at

771
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
your dad's shows.

772
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
So

773
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
the camera kind of zooms in on him and

774
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
he's already talking to somebody and he's

775
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
saying it's me.

776
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
It's Arlo Pettymore.

777
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
I don't blame it. It's been years. I kind of keep to

778
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
myself anyways. I'm back there in the

779
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
laboratory. I mean yes

780
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
it's my shed of course but it's my

781
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
laboratory. You probably sampled my

782
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Saturday morning cartoon.

783
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
You probably had

784
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
a taste of that SMC. That's what the kids

785
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
were calling these days. People think it's called

786
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
that because it makes you see Looney Tunes.

787
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
That's not what it's called that.

788
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
It's about the ingredients. That's what I make

789
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
it out of. I make it out of

790
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
it's frosted corn flakes and milk.

791
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
And then there's a little gasoline

792
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
in there of course. You got to give yourself

793
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
a little kick or something there.

794
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
I don't mind telling you the recipe

795
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
because it's all about the proportions of

796
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
them chemicals. That's kind of the whole thing.

797
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
Use chemicals. I use chemicals.

798
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
Use all chemicals. It's just a matter of the

799
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
proportions of them chemicals. It's just something I've always

800
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
been able to tell in a person is the chemical makeups

801
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
of them. Some people say I'm a genius.

802
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
I don't say about myself much though.

803
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
But yeah that's that Saturday morning cartoons.

804
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
It'll fuck you up for sure. It's real good.

805
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Hey I'm just kind of cooped up in that lab

806
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
back there. It's got a cot. It's got a real

807
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
nice cot. It's one of my favorite cots.

808
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
I bought it myself. Well I didn't

809
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
buy myself. Ma bought it for me. But it's mine.

810
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
She said it's all mine.

811
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
You having a

812
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
good day? Camera pans down.

813
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
It's the same kid that he was

814
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
talking to. Yeah that's the game boy.

815
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
It's a little kid.

816
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
Well I'm going to go see who else

817
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
is here today. Okay yeah.

818
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Well it sounds like you really got a lot

819
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
going on and I feel like there's a lot of

820
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
people here and kids are really

821
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
more into like TikToks and

822
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
streaming content. I don't think it's like

823
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
cartoons have to strictly be on like a

824
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Saturday morning anymore. You can

825
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
kind of watch it at your own schedule.

826
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
But it didn't really sound like you were talking about cartoons.

827
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
My mom

828
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
said I should meet you. I got to meet all my

829
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
else's but I hope you

830
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
enjoy talking to someone else. Yeah

831
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
of course and if you ever want a free sample you

832
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
come on back. Okay bye. And that

833
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
brings us. The little boy wanders

834
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
through the party with his game boy.

835
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
And he's

836
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
been told to meet people

837
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
as much as he can but he's basically relying

838
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
on them to shout out to him.

839
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Pretty game boy focused otherwise.

840
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
And he runs straight into the legs

841
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
of... Well he'd run into

842
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
some bedazzled jeans that might do

843
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
that boy some harm because they are

844
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
shiny these jeans.

845
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
And above them a big old

846
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
belt buckle. White tank top

847
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
tight and tucked in

848
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
under a pearl snapped unbuttoned

849
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
cowboy shirt. Joni

850
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
Pettymore the first is

851
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
wearing some high top Nikes

852
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
to bottom out that whole situation

853
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
clothing wise.

854
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
She's got a bleached

855
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
blonde perm

856
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
with super dark roots. And her

857
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
eye shadow gives

858
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
raccoon. Oh it's giving raccoon?

859
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Oh it's totally giving raccoon.

860
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
And immediately

861
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
upon this kid

862
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
bumping into her she just pushes

863
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
him away from her.

864
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
He looks up from his game boy and he's like Mom

865
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm not your mother.

866
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Do you hear me? Oh I'm sorry

867
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Go on get running then.

868
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Okay okay bye.

869
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Joni Pettymore the first

870
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
is a

871
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
fucking wreck.

872
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Flash back to

873
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
you see her

874
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
in the exact same outfit

875
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
climbing out of a second story

876
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
window and like

877
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
kind of reaching out for the drain

878
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
pipe on the left side

879
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
and she just kind of makes

880
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
a jump for it and as she's shimmying

881
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
down someone's hollering

882
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
from out the window. You

883
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
get back here Joni.

884
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Zips on down. She's like

885
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
What do you fucking know? Come on down

886
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
here. How about that? And she

887
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
dips off running off into

888
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
the distance. We flash back

889
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
previous to that. You see

890
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
her she's going through the

891
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
metal detector to get into

892
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
high school and then immediately

893
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
heads to the bathroom

894
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
goes into one of the stalls. She's

895
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
wearing the exact same outfit that I

896
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
described before but she is

897
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
six years younger ish

898
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
and she opens up her

899
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
backpack pulls out a

900
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
ziplock bag that has

901
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
like a is it dehydrated urine

902
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
she shoves a straw into

903
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
it and starts

904
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
pulling on this straw like it's

905
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
her job sucking down liquid

906
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
in this bag and then

907
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
giving it that kind of

908
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
breath like she's just

909
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
barrel proof whiskey through that

910
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
ziplock bag.

911
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
She puts it back in the backpack

912
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
and heads back into

913
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
the high school there

914
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
and as she walks through the hallway

915
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
she runs into her boyfriend

916
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Jared Krinklehoff

917
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
wearing a

918
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
letterman's jacket and

919
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Thomas just gave me

920
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
big eyes. I was

921
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
preparing. Okay.

922
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
He's wearing a letterman's

923
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
jacket and immediately he puts

924
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
his arm around her and he's like

925
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Joni hey Joni how's it going?

926
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
She's like don't do that

927
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
voice don't do it.

928
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Immediately is like transformed

929
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
by the presence of this young man

930
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
and the little love that

931
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
they have and it flash forwards to her

932
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
slamming a screen door

933
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
closed and is like I say

934
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
that Joni is yours for

935
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
the weekend I gotta go to

936
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
a family function and based on

937
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
the way you acted last time

938
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
you're not allowed so you're gonna be

939
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
here alright and she

940
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
walks out the door and as she's walking out she's

941
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
eyeing the muscle car that's

942
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
half renovated that's what they

943
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
call renovated for cars

944
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
in the driveway and she pulls

945
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
out a little butterfly knife

946
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
and she just runs it

947
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
down the whole side of the car

948
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
as she heads out with

949
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
a screech.

950
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
She cracked your key into the

951
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
side.

952
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
And then yeah she's on

953
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
the way out to the Pettymore Holler today

954
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
by herself in a car

955
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
that you are considerably

956
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
worried about how it's running

957
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
and whether it would pass an inspection

958
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
and she goes into a

959
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
gas station and

960
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
she steals

961
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
a water bottle and as

962
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
she uh. Empty or full? A full

963
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
water bottle that's

964
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
theft. Oh right

965
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
yes.

966
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Yes. She goes in to

967
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
steal a water bottle but as

968
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
she's heading out.

969
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Roll to steal the water bottle? Yeah okay.

970
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
23

971
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
on a criminology

972
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
of 80.

973
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Oh yeah she's bad.

974
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
She's bad. Oh look at

975
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Joanie she's bad. And as she's on her way

976
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
out she actually catches a glimpse

977
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
up at the front of

978
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
the register.

979
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
There are these prepackaged

980
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
bags of whiskey

981
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
being sold right there at the register.

982
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
When did this start?

983
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
We've had them in for

984
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
six or so months now they seem pretty popular.

985
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Would you like a bag?

986
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
No.

987
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
I think I just

988
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
want a pack of smokes.

989
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Yellows. Okay. And when he turns

990
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
around she's gonna grab

991
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
a bag of whiskey.

992
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Actually you know what

993
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
I gotta quit. I gotta quit.

994
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
I keep telling myself I gotta quit. Lord's gonna help me

995
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
this time. I gotta go. Well bless

996
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
you much ma'am and good luck in

997
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
your journey. 36 that's it.

998
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Hey didn't I

999
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
have five bags

1000
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
of whiskey? He says as the door closes

1001
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
on him.

1002
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Go on then run.

1003
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
And then she goes to the party?

1004
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
Yeah that was me flashing back to the kid.

1005
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1006
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Oh okay I thought maybe I was your

1007
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
kid but you established that you left

1008
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
your kid at home. You must just

1009
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
a lot of the women here look like you.

1010
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
I'll

1011
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
go find my mom.

1012
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Thank you for talking with me.

1013
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
Goodbye. Oh I'm sorry I'm sorry

1014
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
we got off to a wrong start. You gave me a scare there

1015
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
cause I didn't know you were gonna be in front of me when

1016
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
you were walking backwards. You best expect

1017
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
me to be everywhere. Oh that's fun.

1018
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Yeah I'm a pettymore same as you.

1019
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Okay I like that spirit.

1020
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
I like that spirit. God damn right you do.

1021
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
And he kicks your shin really hard and he runs off.

1022
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
The

1023
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
pettymore way. That's how you say

1024
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
bye in pettymore.

1025
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
As you've all arrived

1026
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
you see Arlo around the drink

1027
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
table. Joni I assume you might be heading

1028
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
in there too. A lot of pettymores are actually

1029
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
the first stop traditionally. You gotta get

1030
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
your lubrication, get your libations

1031
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
and then you can talk to your god damn family

1032
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
right?

1033
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
Cause that's what family's for.

1034
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
You see Ma kind of deep in conversation

1035
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
like on the other side of the party with some older

1036
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
older relatives you haven't seen in years

1037
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
and immediately around you

1038
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
you notice a few people. It's all

1039
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
kind of mysterious

1040
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
what exactly is going on

1041
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
here. Why did Ma call everybody?

1042
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Kind of, you know, you've left the

1043
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
hauler, you've gone on to different sort of lives

1044
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
it kind of seems like maybe we're leaving this whole thing

1045
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
behind. Maybe we had finally stopped

1046
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
killing and dying for this way of life.

1047
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
Killing ourselves trying to

1048
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
wring a way of life out of this hauler.

1049
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
I've been prepared a way for you to meet each other.

1050
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Is that Joni I see over there?

1051
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Oh hey Arlo how's it going?

1052
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
It's been a minute. Joni's been here.

1053
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,320
You still up to all the mess?

1054
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Just making a living. Doing what I can.

1055
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Guys I'm here too. You got all ten fingers?

1056
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
The camera pans down to the five foot three

1057
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
uh

1058
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
PDP

1059
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
Hi. Hey

1060
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
Petey. Hey Petey. Petey this man

1061
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
I don't want to see you. I was just going to pick your brain about

1062
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
something. You reckon there's a way I could get a

1063
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
hold of some of that rocket fuel?

1064
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
I mean, yeah.

1065
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
I'd be willing to, you know,

1066
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
cut you in mate, let's say five

1067
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
percent of the SMC.

1068
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
I mean how much you need cause uh, who's to say

1069
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
I didn't take any with me? Oh it just takes

1070
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
a drop per batch. We can

1071
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
send this shit into orbit right

1072
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
here. It's been so long since I've tried

1073
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
some of your, what are you calling it again?

1074
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
It's uh, it's Saturday morning

1075
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
cartoons. Saturday morning cartoons. There was a kid

1076
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
earlier who told me that they don't do that anymore.

1077
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
So I'm maybe thinking about a new name for it.

1078
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Well SMT, it's been a while since I had

1079
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
some of your SMT but if I can

1080
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
I'll do any, I got some. I took

1081
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
a gallon with me. Hell yeah.

1082
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
We in business. Well I've just been sitting out

1083
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
there just waiting for some kind of

1084
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
use and here we found it I think.

1085
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
Arlo spits in his hand and holds it out to you.

1086
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Petey does the same and

1087
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
sticks it there. Match made in heaven.

1088
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Pleasure doing business with you. Well I

1089
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
cannot wait. Anyway

1090
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Joni was up. Where them rugrats

1091
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
yours? Junior? I left

1092
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
her uh, back with um,

1093
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
you know, Jared. I was talking

1094
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
to some kid who I thought could be yours

1095
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
but I guess it's not. Oh yeah

1096
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
they thought they were mine.

1097
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
Who's kid is that? Well I don't know that

1098
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
kid's about as, he's about

1099
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
as old as long as I've seen you so I figured

1100
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
who knows, probably Joni popping one out.

1101
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
No.

1102
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
This old thing? That kid?

1103
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
As she does

1104
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
the uh, like full blown

1105
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
throws both of her karate

1106
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
chop hands down

1107
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
to the groin. You can't tell if it's the

1108
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
same kid or not but a

1109
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
small slender toe headed child pops

1110
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
out from underneath the tablecloth on

1111
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
like the keg table

1112
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
and just runs out holding

1113
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
a comical amount of

1114
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
solo cups full of beer

1115
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
and disappears

1116
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
off into a group of other kids

1117
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
who all just start cheering.

1118
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
You did it! You did it!

1119
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320
Run Luke! Just run!

1120
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Remember back when we were kids

1121
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
and we used to play Tipsy?

1122
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
I recognize

1123
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
you sent me down a path.

1124
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Well I'm a good one cause you're

1125
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
look, you're making deals for rocket fuel.

1126
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Hell yes! Damn.

1127
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
What about you Joni? As far as what?

1128
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Making deals, rocket fuel

1129
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
going to outer space like me.

1130
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
I mean I'm curious about learning more

1131
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
from each and every one of you

1132
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
I guess but you know I think there's

1133
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
a lot of skills that I'm bringing to the table

1134
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
these days that could be of use

1135
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
to you as well. You know you're talking about

1136
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
maybe losing some

1137
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
rocket fuel you know if you need to lose

1138
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
something from something where you don't have

1139
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
the sort of connection where you can get

1140
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
in there I might be the kind of gal who

1141
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
could acquire such situations.

1142
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Heck I reckon if I didn't have to buy

1143
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
any of them frosted flakes anymore

1144
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
bring that cost of goods

1145
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
way to hell. You know why they call me jungle style?

1146
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
They call you jungle style?

1147
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Yes I remember that.

1148
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Cause I'm in and out.

1149
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
Is that that? Is that that?

1150
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
Did I do it? They called you

1151
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
the flying detriment as far as I remember.

1152
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
So at that moment this woman with

1153
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
the crazy like bleached blonde

1154
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
perm and electric

1155
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
like acid wash denim vest

1156
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
full like tiger leggings

1157
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
she runs

1158
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
up and she says oh my goodness

1159
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
hello y'all it's so good to see

1160
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,320
all of you. It's been years since we've

1161
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
been together. Isn't it kind of strange though?

1162
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
John not being here we're on his land.

1163
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
We're as hell. I mean what's

1164
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
the deal with that? You know he'd shoot us all.

1165
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
He'd shoot us all in a heartbeat. He'd shoot every last

1166
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
one of us. He was a shooting

1167
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
son of a bitch. He sure

1168
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
was. He sure was. Catch a stray

1169
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
an hour later falling from the sky.

1170
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
You can still see his shooting tree right

1171
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
back there.

1172
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
That's an actual season

1173
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,320
one callback. That is

1174
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
a bonafide season one callback right there.

1175
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Bonafide callback. I'm

1176
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
sorry sometimes I don't make any sense when I'm

1177
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
grieving. Somebody told me that he

1178
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
shot just would go out in public and

1179
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
shoot his gun in the air when he was a police

1180
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
officer. Grieving? But now hey I

1181
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
I mean he's gone. So many

1182
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
of our boys are gone.

1183
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
I ain't wearing black you ain't wrapped up.

1184
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
Oh Johnny we've talked

1185
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
about this before. Six months.

1186
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
I mean how many times has a petty moor

1187
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
boy ran off though? I think it's been closer to a year.

1188
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
No it's weird to

1189
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
be weird about it after six months.

1190
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,320
I don't remember how much time exactly though.

1191
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
More than six months and that's strange

1192
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
to me. It just feels like no one's

1193
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
heard a word and. Well

1194
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
what about the other petty moors I heard gone

1195
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
missing? Sounds like they got out.

1196
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,320
I mean I guess they still

1197
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
their Facebooks haven't been posted on.

1198
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Nobody's heard from them in the family

1199
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
group texts or via mail.

1200
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
But we hold I guess we got to hold out hope that's right

1201
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,320
that's right. I don't know if I want to hold

1202
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
out hope for John though because have you

1203
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
heard about well have you heard about his

1204
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
good fortune? I mean if you believe

1205
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
them tales I guess I don't know if I do. You really

1206
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
think it's out there somewhere? The tales

1207
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320
are he was a very rich man.

1208
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,320
I think that it's talking out of school. I will

1209
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,320
say that uh. I haven't

1210
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
been to school in a very long time Joni.

1211
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
That's why you're few years older than you.

1212
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
It's more like school's your butt talking

1213
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
out of it. I will say that Gregy's boy

1214
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
said he knew that

1215
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
his cousin Freddie was

1216
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,320
at the thing. At what thing?

1217
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
When things went down.

1218
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
I heard they loaded it all into

1219
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
a trash truck and they drove

1220
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
that trash truck all the way across

1221
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
the country but it got blown up.

1222
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
I heard that petty moors for as long as

1223
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
they've been around have been telling

1224
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
stories about lost treasures to keep

1225
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
themselves busy and not minding

1226
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
their actual capitalistic ventures.

1227
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
Huh. Hmm. Well

1228
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
I mean but it is a good story Joni.

1229
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
Why are you such a downer? This is

1230
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
a cookout. Why are you being so so

1231
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
odd about all this?

1232
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
No reason mom.

1233
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
I don't know.

1234
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
I just you know

1235
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
you could call me more

1236
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
baby. Yeah I could. Oh hell do you

1237
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
need a drink? Yes I will have what I'm

1238
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
having. Which is?

1239
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
And she points to the table

1240
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
which has a water bottle filled

1241
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
with whiskey.

1242
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Joni just like

1243
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
your grandmother.

1244
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
She gives you a huge hug.

1245
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
And she goes

1246
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
just like grandma and she stabs

1247
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
just like a tiny pencil sized hole

1248
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
on the top of it and then squeeze bottles

1249
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
into her mouth.

1250
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
Wait did you bring more of those girls?

1251
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Do you have

1252
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
one for your mother? I probably got a spare in the

1253
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
car I guess. I could go get it.

1254
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
Yeah. Alright. Cause you know there are

1255
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
some missing boys which means there's some

1256
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
wait. Never mind. That joke

1257
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
doesn't work.

1258
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,320
There's a couple missing

1259
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
girls too of my generation

1260
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
which means there's some

1261
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
you know eligible bachelors here. Oh.

1262
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
This again. Great. Well

1263
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
honey it's been five years since

1264
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Steven died and I

1265
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
just think you know it's time for your mom to

1266
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
get out there. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.

1267
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Well Arlo, Peter

1268
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
it was wonderful to see you all. Honey do please

1269
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,320
call me more. I'm sure I'll see you around the party.

1270
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,320
Well what about the treasure

1271
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
though? You know she's probably right.

1272
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
There's no treasure. Where are people saying it is?

1273
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
You know. Like if there was

1274
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
one like. Oh honey

1275
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
some people say it's in the barn.

1276
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,320
Some people say it's buried under the floorboard.

1277
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,320
Some people say it's at the bottom of the ocean.

1278
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
Others say it's deep deep deep

1279
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
in the woods. I heard it got blown up in a

1280
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
trash truck is what I heard. A number of people

1281
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
are pressing the trash truck

1282
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
theory yes. Which I do

1283
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
admit has a ring of truth to it.

1284
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
It's so oddly specific. More

1285
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
thing about it more trash truck makes sense.

1286
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,320
Blown up a trash truck. I lean over

1287
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
to Arlo and hey I heard

1288
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
Trey might know something about this or

1289
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
he's got a secret. A secret? Have you

1290
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
seen Trey? I ain't seen him. Johnny.

1291
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
You seen Trey?

1292
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
What are you two whispering about?

1293
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
Oh we were wondering where cousin Trey was

1294
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
I just hadn't seen him since I went to space.

1295
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,320
She steps on your foot.

1296
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
Nobody's seen Trey. I mean you know

1297
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
he's always late to these things. Oh yeah

1298
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
okay. I'm sure he'll be here if he wants

1299
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
to. And um she excuses herself

1300
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
she sees um what was the name of your

1301
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
husband? Jared. She sees like his

1302
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,320
uncle. Whoa whoa why the fuck is he

1303
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
there? Because his uh. He's married in?

1304
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Yeah he married in but

1305
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,320
he's ex married in. He's here for the kids.

1306
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Nice. She runs up and goes uh

1307
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
did I say what his name was? No.

1308
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
Hi Sylvester.

1309
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
Hey how's it going?

1310
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
What a god.

1311
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Hey how you look? You look lovely

1312
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
today. Hey. It's been so

1313
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
long since I've seen you Dawn. Thank you for noticing

1314
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
I do look lovely. She's gone.

1315
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
You can't hear this. Not a day

1316
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
over 40.

1317
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,320
Ha! You!

1318
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
Yeah so

1319
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
you know that it's gonna be maybe

1320
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
30 minutes before y'all sit down to eat so you

1321
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
can continue to mingle. As soon as she walks

1322
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
away Joni looks at the two of them and she's

1323
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
like you two are the kind of people that I was hoping

1324
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
to talk to about all this maybe without

1325
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
the addition of more people who make

1326
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
the cut smaller. Oh I like

1327
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
where this is going. Ron. Uncle

1328
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
Ron you remember him? Yeah.

1329
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
He told me that Trey was looking

1330
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
for me. He might be planning something.

1331
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
If you guys are thinking about

1332
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
getting in on something with Trey I'd like to

1333
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
get along. Oh yeah.

1334
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
The more the merrier and only this

1335
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,320
case and no more.

1336
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
That's right we're keeping it to

1337
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
four. We'll keep it well Trey's

1338
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
gotta tell us and then we'll try to kick out

1339
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
whoever he's already talked to. That's smart. At that

1340
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
moment Uncle Ron hobbles up.

1341
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
Hey! Oh wait no I sounded like this

1342
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
didn't I? Hey

1343
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
it's good to see that you ran into these two

1344
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,320
cause they're exactly the folks that Trey's looking

1345
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
to help you up with. Where's Trey at?

1346
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
Don't know he's learning late he should be here

1347
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,320
soon. Gotta go bye. Bye.

1348
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
Aliens

1349
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
are real.

1350
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
What? What?

1351
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,320
That's all you get for now I'll tell you after.

1352
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,320
Come flab it.

1353
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
So yeah

1354
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
you've got an opportunity now to

1355
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,320
look around the property maybe poke around

1356
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
if you want to get a little frisky but

1357
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
you could also talk to some more people here.

1358
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,320
There's a few interesting

1359
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
characters that you might see around

1360
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
you. Maybe they're highlighted if this was a video

1361
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
game. Maybe it seems like there's some more

1362
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
conversation options with them.

1363
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,320
Peter remembers the last time that he was

1364
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
at John's house. John

1365
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,320
was like starting his DVD

1366
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
collection and so he wants

1367
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
to go snoop around and see how

1368
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
big John got that collection.

1369
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
Yeah well did he have all of prison

1377

Don and Han

1413
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
a woman who may or may not have been your mother

1414
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
I named Maxine

1415
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
moments before I invented her

1416
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,320
but then we ran with the fact that she was your mom

1417
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,320
I like

1418
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,320
yeah Don Maxine

1419
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,320
Don Maxine Pettymore

1420
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,320
she's run off to go

1421
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,320
to go to court

1422
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
and

1423
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,320
Uncle Ron just confirmed

1424
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,320
you were the three that Trey wanted to see

1425
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,320
Trey you would all know

1426
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
he's the cool

1427
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
pettymore

1428
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,320
Joe and Luke

1429
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,320
Trey is a little bit younger

1430
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,320
than you guys he's right in between

1431
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,320
John who was

1432
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
26 at the time of his disappearance

1433
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,320
and your generation so he's in like

1434
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,320
his late 30s he was a

1435
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
he was maybe a rough kid to love

1436
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,320
depending on who you were if

1437
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,320
you were the object of like

1438
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,320
his charm and his magnetism

1439
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
he lit up the whole world

1440
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,320
it sounds like Jesus everybody loves this kid

1441
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,320
it does sound like Jesus

1442
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,320
so far it's Jesus

1443
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,320
don't spoil my Christ narrative

1444
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,320
everything's a Christ

1445
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,320
narrative some of you

1446
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
if maybe you got in the way of something

1447
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
that Trey wanted you might have seen a different

1448
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
side of him and he left

1449
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
the family pretty early he was not around

1450
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
for the long slow

1451
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
decline of Pettymore Holler

1452
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
he in fact is one of the original

1453
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,320
exedees he left

1454
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
out on his own into the world

1455
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,320
short of it is Trey does his own thing

1456
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,320
you don't know when he's going to show up

1457
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
you know when he does it'll probably be pretty loud

1458
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
you know when he do it's going to be loud

1459
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
you know when he do it's going to be loud and that's Trey

1460
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
but Luke what's your character's name?

1461
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,320
Petey Petey had just asked to go see

1462
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,320
inside the house to check on

1463
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
John's DVD collection

1464
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
so you walk in through the front door

1465
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,320
and there's a lot of Pettymores

1466
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,320
in the kitchen cooking food and

1467
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,320
getting things ready there's a lot of hustle and bustle

1468
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,320
and you get caught up for a minute as people are saying

1469
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,320
oh hi Lexel hello

1470
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,320
I haven't seen you in years what are you doing?

1471
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,320
how you been? oh my god

1472
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,320
what's your spice?

1473
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,320
I'm crying I'm crying I'm actually

1474
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
crying it's the three of you

1475
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,320
you brush past all that

1476
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
you get into the living room

1477
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
which is eerily quiet considering

1478
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320
the size of this party nobody really

1479
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,320
wants to hang out in the

1480
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,320
house besides the kitchen because

1481
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
it's exactly as John left it

1482
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,320
in the living room you see the DVD collection

1483
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,320
the shelf that they're on

1484
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,320
looks like it was broken and half repaired

1485
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,320
at one point all of them are there but

1486
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
Petey the first time you saw it

1487
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
you were amazed it was the most organized

1488
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
thing in John's house and now you see

1489
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,320
it's kind of been hastily shoved back on

1490
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,320
you know Smokey 3 before Smokey 2

1491
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
it wasn't

1492
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,320
what? that's embarrassing

1493
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,320
sacrilege

1494
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,320
one of the reasons nobody's really sitting anywhere

1495
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,320
is that you can see

1496
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
a lot of bullet holes in the ceiling

1497
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,320
and the couch

1498
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
is covered in drywall debris

1499
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,320
and some foam insulation

1500
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,320
from the attic that's wafted down through the bullet holes

1501
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,320
while he's looking at the DVD collection

1502
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,320
Petey sorry sorry real

1503
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,320
quick sorry not insulation

1504
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,320
popcorn actual popcorn

1505
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
you can see some

1506
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
leaking out of a little plastic

1507
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
bag and you remember that

1508
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
John used to take home

1509
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
the huge plastic bags of

1510
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
popcorn that they stocked concession stands

1511
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,320
with at the Raceway and he

1512
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,320
he filled his attic with that

1513
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,320
to use as insulation

1514
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
and it's cold in here because the squirrels

1515
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
have eaten most of his popcorn

1516
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,320
Petey

1517
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
is looking at the

1518
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,320
DVD collection and is

1519
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,320
just a little sad looking at it

1520
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
thinking about John but also just sad

1521
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,320
that it's not as perfect as he remembered

1522
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,320
but he kind of

1523
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,320
fixes it up a little bit and then from

1524
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,320
the inside of his jumper pulls out a signed

1525
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
he has signed a copy of

1526
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
Space Cowboys

1527
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,320
and then

1528
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,320
slips it in alphabetically

1529
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
where it should go

1530
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,320
so in between Space Cowboys and

1531
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,320
Space Cowboys director cut

1532
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,320
so now he's got one

1533
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
one regular Space Cowboys

1534
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
one Space Cowboys signed by an

1535
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
astronaut right very cool

1536
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
Peter you probably would have been

1537
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,320
someone you wish John had looked up to

1538
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
I think you probably tried to put him on the straight and narrow

1539
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
a little bit or at least you know show him that

1540
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,320
with hard work and dedication you can

1541
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,320
join the Air Force get through Air Force Academy

1542
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
go to the become an astronaut

1543
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
and John thought it was cool that

1544
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,320
you were an astronaut but he thought it was

1545
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
a lot cooler that Trey had a dope car

1546
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,320
yeah Petey is content

1547
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
in the fact knowing that John

1548
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,320
also wore blue though

1549
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
just like Pete

1550
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
I always picture them wearing kind of a tan

1551
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,320
it's funny I did too

1552
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,320
well the cop in the

1553
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
season one thing is wearing blue but

1554
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,320
even if they didn't wear blue you know

1555
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
they're wearing blue

1556
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
I actually pictured you wearing blue

1557
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,320
because then when Clark changed into

1558
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
the 70's CPD uniform

1559
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,320
and it was tan

1560
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,320
so yeah they both wore blue

1561
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,320
also I pictured Keith wearing that light

1562
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
blue shirt so you know he's like

1563
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
not his cop

1564
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
even though he was probably the most cop of all

1565
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
them

1566
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,320
but yeah he's

1567
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,320
sticks it in there looks back and is thinking

1568
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,320
like you know

1569
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,320
maybe if we find him we can

1570
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
set him set him straight

1571
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
somewhere perhaps through like the rustling

1572
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
wind through the bullet holes in the attic

1573
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,320
you just hear a it sounds like a comforting

1574
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,320
sigh and you think

1575
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
maybe somewhere John would like

1576
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,320
what I just did with his DVDs

1577
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,320
Pete feels good are you fucking with John's DVDs

1578
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,320
over there Petey I was just fixing them they're

1579
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,320
all messed up which is unlike

1580
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,320
John we'll write that one down as

1581
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
maybe he did go missing and

1582
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,320
didn't run away

1583
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,320
you guys look back and Joni's

1584
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,320
not there because while Jon

1585
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,320
is family Joni's a thief

1586
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,320
and right now she's

1587
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,320
very much interested in one

1588
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
thing and that is getting

1589
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,320
an undershirt of John's

1590
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,320
that has that manly manly

1591
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,320
smell on it that she can

1592
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,320
put in her car to piss

1593
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
off Jared later

1594
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Joni as

1595
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,320
you head back to the bedroom

1596
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,320
to the bad room

1597
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,320
that's what

1598
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,320
John always called it

1599
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,320
depends

1600
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,320
on what time of day it is sometimes

1601
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
after a night

1602
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,320
a night of Miller lights and beer

1603
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,320
pretzels the bathroom's the bad room

1604
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,320
you know what I'm saying

1605
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,320
got to do some bad things

1606
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,320
like a good thick one

1607
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,320
Joni you would see in the hallway on the way to the

1608
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,320
bedroom a number of

1609
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,320
framed pictures of John and

1610
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,320
lots of your family but you see

1611
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,320
a few of you and John

1612
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,320
he was about three years older

1613
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,320
than you so like just

1614
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,320
in that sweet spot

1615
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,320
for cousin friends

1616
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,320
but older enough to be cool

1617
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,320
and influential you guys were pretty close

1618
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,320
I tried to drive a cool car cause he did but I

1619
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,320
can't afford a cool car

1620
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,320
dated a guy with a cool car cause he had a cool car

1621
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,320
when you say you want a cool car

1622
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,320
the picture falls off the wall

1623
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,320
she catches it

1624
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,320
ooh can I catch it

1625
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,320
you can roll to catch it

1626
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,320
what should I roll

1627
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,320
dexterity or athletics

1628
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,320
that's a 40 on an 85

1629
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,320
dexterity you catch it

1630
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
it says my distinguishing feature is wiry

1631
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,320
like a live wire

1632
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,320
like a live wire

1633
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,320
wire like a live wire

1634
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,320
you can feel the back of the frame feels a little weird

1635
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,320
it's kind of bulging out like

1636
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
there's something stuck back there

1637
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,320
she immediately is going to go for the bulge

1638
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,320
looking back in the picture

1639
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,320
there's something stuck between the picture itself

1640
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,320
and the backing

1641
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,320
she does all the little clips

1642
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,320
around the back edge of it

1643
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,320
which is easy cause only two of them are holding

1644
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,320
the whole thing on and she kind of slides it out

1645
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,320
what's back there

1646
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,320
there's a little note and it says

1647
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,320
hey Joni

1648
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,320
she smiles

1649
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,320
big

1650
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,320
it's your old cousin Jon Jon

1651
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,320
I thought you might be one of the ones who could

1652
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,320
seek out some of these clues that I've left behind

1653
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,320
here's the deal Joni

1654
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,320
I came into a treasure

1655
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,320
and I don't know if I'm going to be able to enjoy it

1656
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,320
in this life

1657
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,320
so I want my family

1658
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,320
at least whoever in my family deserves it

1659
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,320
and aside from my clues

1660
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,320
it might be you

1661
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,320
and you know any team you might assemble ocean style

1662
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,320
to aid you in this process

1663
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,320
oceans 12

1664
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,320
oh yeah she's folding up this note

1665
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,320
is there a clue at the bottom?

1666
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,320
there's more

1667
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,320
I was like that is a shit first clue unless there's

1668
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,320
like some coded message in here

1669
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,320
yeah or it's the world's greatest clue

1670
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,320
I buried the treasure

1671
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,320
at these coordinates

1672
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,320
man

1673
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,320
alright I just got to figure out

1674
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,320
what coordinates are

1675
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,320
I always did like

1676
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,320
you Joni you reminded me of myself

1677
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,320
she's in the bathroom at the door shut

1678
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,320
there were certain things

1679
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,320
she sits on the toilet that's not actually

1680
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,320
one of the sentences I'm riffing this all

1681
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,320
uh

1682
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,320
there was one thing

1683
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,320
in particular we loved

1684
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,320
about Smokey and the bandit

1685
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,320
one thing find that thing

1686
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,320
and you'll find your next clue

1687
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,320
and you remember you guys always just talked about how

1688
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,320
fucking sweet it would be to have the uh

1689
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,320
77 black Trans Am

1690
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,320
his dad's car

1691
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,320
Jon's dad's car? yeah

1692
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,320
is that a thing? yeah

1693
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,320
of course it is I'm Jon talking to you in this letter

1694
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,320
I know what car my dad drives stupid

1695
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,320
it was in the flashback to

1696
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,320
when they went and stole

1697
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,320
the baby uh fuck yeah

1698
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,320
in the back of that 77

1699
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,320
anyway Joni

1700
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,320
I really hope it's you

1701
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,320
or your team again if you have assembled one

1702
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,320
who finds my treasure

1703
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,320
absolutely not just me

1704
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,320
me and me alone can do this

1705
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
the next clue is somewhere

1706
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,320
on this property the clue after that

1707
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,320
is gonna be harder good luck

1708
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,320
and there's a little winky smiley face

1709
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,320
and if you look down the line of pictures on the wall

1710
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,320
you see actually a lot of them are bulging

1711
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,320
oh I grab those

1712
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,320
I grab all of those

1713
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,320
they're not coming off

1714
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,320
uh fuck

1715
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,320
unnatural yeah that's a fail 92

1716
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,320
your cousin Jon was apparently

1717
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
Peter naturally good

1718
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,320
at attaching pictures to walls

1719
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,320
it looks like it's just

1720
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,320
should be just a simple wire

1721
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,320
but try as you might you can't get

1722
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,320
any of the other pictures to come off

1723
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,320
the wall and you see one um

1724
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,320
Peter these are Peter naturally

1725
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,320
put on the wall do you think you can

1726
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,320
handle it? what the fuck are you talking

1727
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,320
about? and you

1728
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,320
see Petey's fumbling

1729
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,320
around with a DVD he's

1730
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,320
decided that it would be a good ambiance to have

1731
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
smoking the bandit on in the background

1732
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,320
what? if you come into the

1733
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,320
hallway and if Arlo follows

1734
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,320
Arlo let's go see what she's screaming about

1735
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,320
back there Jon are you down there taking

1736
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,320
she shoved the note in her pocket

1737
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,320
Jon are you down there taking a

1738
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,320
trip down memory lane?

1739
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,320
let me see some of them photos

1740
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,320
what you got over there? while they're on their way real quick

1741
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,320
take a

1742
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
sanity roll for me

1743
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,320
I rolled a 76 on a

1744
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,320
45 it's not right

1745
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,320
it ain't right it's not right

1746
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,320
it ain't right it ain't right Jon was good

1747
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,320
but nobody's better than Joni

1748
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,320
no fucking wall is gonna keep

1749
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,320
these pictures on here if you want them

1750
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,320
so why can this wall not

1751
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,320
give you it's picture? Arlo try to take that

1752
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
try to take that picture off this wall look at this

1753
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,320
look at this and she's like grabbing onto

1754
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,320
it and she's gonna try to like put her feet

1755
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,320
up on the wall

1756
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,320
to show that it's really

1757
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,320
stuck on there

1758
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,320
as Arlo and Peter walk in

1759
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,320
and look at this

1760
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,320
a picture actually of all three of you and Jon

1761
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,320
like on a float trip

1762
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,320
plops off the wall

1763
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,320
and it's also bulging

1764
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,320
can I try to catch it?

1765
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,320

1770
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,320

1771
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,320

1772
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,320
fireplace

1773
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,320

for a while but you'll be alright

1810
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,320
man what the

1811
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,320
what's that? is there anything

1812
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,320
amongst the shattered glass?

1813
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,320
there's blood everywhere but um

1814
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,320
but Arlo is able before

1815
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,320
it just gets like

1816
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,320
fire hosed with your blood spray

1817
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,320
to nimbly grab a note that's in there

1818
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,320
and it's essentially the exact same

1819
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,320
note as before it says hey

1820
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,320
Arlo, Peter, and Joni

1821
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,320
I feel so much

1822
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,320
less special now

1823
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,320
do I lose any

1824
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,320
grip or? yeah you're gonna have to take a

1825
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,320
you're gonna have to take a little grip roll for

1826
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,320
what do I lose? uh just one

1827
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,320
just one I only lose one

1828
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,320
you lose one nice

1829
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,320
welcome to the hunt for my

1830
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,320
lost treasure

1831
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,320
fuck dude

1832
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,320
it comes out at the bottom like

1833
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,320
Joni is this what you're talking about?

1834
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,320
yeah I guess so

1835
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,320
right about now Joni you're probably feeling

1836
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,320
pretty unspecial

1837
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,320
but if this picture came off the wall

1838
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,320
it means all of you are here god dammit

1839
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,320
I couldn't happen to know who might

1840
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,320
stumble into my house or why

1841
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,320
I figured you might try to rob me

1842
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,320
hell I figured all three of you might try to rob me

1843
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,320
yup but the fact of the matter

1844
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,320
is you're some of the only petty mores who have

1845
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,320
the smarts, know how, gumption

1846
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,320
and the character

1847
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,320
to deserve my treasure

1848
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,320
hell yeah hell yeah

1849
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,320
remember when we all used to watch Smokey and the Bandit

1850
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,320
together? oh I love that car

1851
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,320
remember how cool that car was

1852
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,320
didn't his daddy have one of those?

1853
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,320
yeah daddy drove one right up until the day he

1854
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,320
disappeared and then that car went missing

1855
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,320
shortly thereafter

1856
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,320
he rebuilt the son of bitch from the ground up too

1857
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
well what's the rest of this note here say?

1858
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,320
yada yada yada

1859
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,320
treasure treasure treasure treasure

1860
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,320
series of clues

1861
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,320
oh hey we gotta find that

1862
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,320
car I think

1863
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,320
good luck to y'all I love you lots

1864
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,320
Arlo looks up into the sky

1865
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
but it's a couple bullet holes

1866
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,320
looking at popcorn

1867
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,320
love you too John

1868
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,320
there's a breeze of warm loving air

1869
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,320
through those holes

1870
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,320
that's what she said

1871
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,320
hey Arlo you know there's nothing up there but stars right?

1872
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,320
I just farted

1873
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,320
was that Johnny saying that? yup

1874
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,320
uh

1875
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,320
I've been up there

1876
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,320
Arlo there's nothing

1877
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,320
so you know you know you pass right through heaven

1878
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
and Peter thinks about the time

1879
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,320
spent piloting jets and stuff

1880
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,320
and that was heaven

1881
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,320
you can probably smell it now

1882
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,320
punched a hole right through that thing

1883
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,320
well shit boys and Joni

1884
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,320
we gotta do something let's go

1885
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,320
yeah we gotta find the car 77

1886
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,320
you know where you said it got lost

1887
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,320
stolen something? what do I remember

1888
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,320
about the car? I bet Ma knows

1889
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,320
I bet she does

1890
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,320
I didn't remember that John's dad had that car

1891
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,320
it's pretty cool

1892
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,320
it is pretty cool that he did

1893
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,320
somebody

1894
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,320
somebody else

1895
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,320
I'm not talking about my dad's car

1896
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,320
I thought of literally saying that

1897
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,320
not my dad's car

1898
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,320
well if that car got stolen

1899
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,320
you flip the note over

1900
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,320
I bet you chuckle

1901
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,320
folks were thinking of my dad's car

1902
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,320
by the way I know my dad had a cherry

1903
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,320
trans amp

1904
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,320
but that's not the car I'm thinking of

1905
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,320
his was black

1906
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,320
I'm sorry I was misremembering

1907
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,320
his daddy had a black one

1908
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,320
the one from the show

1909
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,320
was cherry

1910
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,320
is that right? no it sure ain't

1911
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,320
and is it a movie?

1912
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,320
little Joni

1913
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,320
I thought somebody would teach you more about cars

1914
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,320
cherry just means it was real nice

1915
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,320
right

1916
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,320
I haven't seen it

1917
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,320
looking at my phone

1918
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,320
probably not timeline wise

1919
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,320
I was looking at my phone

1920
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,320
I was looking at the phone on the wall

1921
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,320
waiting for Jared to call

1922
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,320
there you go

1923
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,320
can I go over and look at the DVD's

1924
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,320
and search that

1925
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,320
little area over there

1926
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,320
17 on

1927
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,320
a 40 for search

1928
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,320
yeah you know that there's

1929
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,320
no clue in the DVD's

1930
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,320
you open them up and they're all smashed

1931
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,320
except one does have

1932
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,320
a note that says go back to the

1933
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,320
hallway

1934
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,320
guys I found something

1935
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,320
it says go back to the hallway

1936
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,320
what do you think is going to happen there?

1937
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,320
you want to edit?

1938
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,320
do you have an ending spot

1939
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,320
coming down the line?

1940
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,320
I mean we're like 20 minutes from it

1941
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,320
I don't care for that as much

1942
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,320
ok

1943
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,320
well, tough titties

1944
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,320
I'm the DM

1945
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,320
this episode will be out in January

1946
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,320
not December

1947
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,320
yeah you go back to the hallway

1948
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,320
you pick one of those letters back up

1949
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,320
you keep reading the back it says

1950
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,320
I'm not talking about my dad's cherry trans am

1951
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,320
I'm talking about a sprint car that I was building in my garage

1952
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,320
with a sweet

1953
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,320
smokey and the bandit paint job

1954
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,320
well shit guys

1955
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,320
why don't you go take a look at it

1956
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,320
why don't you go take a look at it

1957
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,320
why don't you go take a look at it

1958
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,320
after Ma's speech

1959
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,320
cut to

1960
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,320
Ma's speech

1961
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,320
you hear a dinner bell

1962
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,320
a big loud dinner bell

1963
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,320
and Ma Pettymore

1964
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,320
you hear a voice in the distance say

1965
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,320
come on y'all

1966
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,320
it's time to eat

1967
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,320
yeah

1968
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,320
Pete runs

1969
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,320
you all take your seats

1970
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,320
wherever the fuck you want to sit do you sit together

1971
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,320
yeah I think so

1972
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,320
Joni just has a cigarette hanging out of her mouth

1973
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,320
unlit

1974
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,320
unlit

1975
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,320
normally Arlo sits at the kids table

1976
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,320
he's done it all his life

1977
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,320
and he doesn't know where else to sit

1978
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,320
this time he's kind of

1979
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,320
like you're gonna go sit over there

1980
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,320
Joni who's 24

1981
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,320
and just started sitting at the adults table

1982
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,320
no didn't even sit at the adults table

1983
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,320
the last time she was here

1984
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,320
five years ago

1985
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,320
he feels so much injustice

1986
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
Arlo

1987
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,320
you reckon I could sit with y'all

1988
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,320
yeah I guess I could do that

1989
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,320
I've got a little flow chart here

1990
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,320
and if at the start of this

1991
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,320
whole cookout you had decided not to

1992
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,320
mingle or investigate Jon's place

1993
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,320
and instead just be dicks

1994
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,320
you would have been sent to the kitty table

1995
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,320
and

1996
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,320
we would have heard mom's speech about

1997
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,320
45 minutes ago

1998
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,320
well we weren't dickheads

1999
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,320
we searched the house

2000
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,320
I didn't want you to be but there were contingencies

2001
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,320
contingencies

2002
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,320
contingencies

2003
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,320
here you go Arlo and I pulled the chair out for him

2004
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,320
much obliged

2005
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,320
everybody's

2006
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,320
everybody's sitting down too

2007
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,320
there are two huge

2008
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,320
long tables that stretch

2009
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,320
almost as wide as

2010
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,320
Jon's barn which they're in front of

2011
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,320
and Ma, it's her 70th birthday

2012
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,320
she kind of comes out

2013
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,320
from the kitchen wearing a

2014
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,320
long white dress

2015
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,320
and she's beaming

2016
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,320
she's smiling to everyone

2017
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,320
she shakes some hands

2018
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,320
she hugs the little children

2019
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,320
and two or three of them follow her

2020
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,320
as she goes and sits down

2021
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,320
at the table

2022
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,320
and she raises a glass

2023
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,320
and she says please, please, everyone, everyone

2024
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,320
be seated

2025
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,320
and as everyone sits down

2026
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,320
do we all roll for our anti

2027
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,320
yeah roll to see if you can sit

2028
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,320
what were you saying before?

2029
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,320
anti-authoritarian

2030
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,320
we were told to do something?

2031
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,320
yeah, if you get told by

2032
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,320
we can make this a mechanic actually

2033
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
if you get told by a person

2034
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,320
in authority to do something

2035
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,320
even

2036
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,320
even if you want to do it, you're going to have to roll

2037
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,320
against your oppositional defiance

2038
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,320
which we're going to say

2039
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,320
means Joni

2040
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,320
you're going to have to beat a 40 or above

2041
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,320
on all oppositional defiance

2042
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,320
I have to roll above?

2043
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,320
you have to roll 40 or below

2044
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,320
I don't know how you want to do it

2045
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,320
you've got a 60% chance

2046
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,320
of not doing it

2047
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,320
I have a 60% chance of not doing it

2048
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,320
yes, you two have a 60% chance

2049
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,320
of doing it

2050
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,320
but there is an exception in every

2051
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,320
Pettymore's heart

2052
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,320
for Ma, who is not

2053
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,320
thank god

2054
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,320
man's authority, she is

2055
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,320
as far as you're all concerned

2056
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,320
a direct agent of the Lord

2057
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,320
like, this is

2058
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,320
this is the mouthpiece of

2059
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,320
the universe

2060
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,320
as far as you guys are mostly raised to be concerned

2061
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,320
and she's currently beaming

2062
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,320
and she's tapping her glass

2063
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,320
thank you, thank you all so much

2064
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,320
thank you all so much for coming

2065
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,320
here today, for joining me here today

2066
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,320
on my birthday

2067
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,320
happy birthday Ma

2068
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,320
she clinks her glass

2069
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,320
thank you, thank you, quiet down

2070
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,320
it's been so long

2071
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,320
it's been so long since

2072
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,320
we were all here today as a family

2073
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,320
together as a family I mean

2074
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,320
we're here today obviously, listen to this old lady

2075
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,320
but it

2076
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,320
touches me to see

2077
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,320
see all my Pettymore's

2078
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,320
and I know you're not all Pettymore's

2079
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,320
you know, we got the extended families here

2080
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,320
boo

2081
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,320
laughing

2082
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,320
laughing

2083
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,320
laughing or leaving

2084
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,320
laughing

2085
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,320
the Pettymore's, the Pettybones

2086
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,320
the Kenmore's, the Bradleys

2087
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,320
the Sanders

2088
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,320
the Joneses, the Joneses Pettymore's

2089
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,320
the Pettymore Joneses

2090
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,320
no matter what your last name is

2091
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,320
I'm thankful you came out for my birthday

2092
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,320
you see the Krinklehoff uncle just kind of like

2093
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,320
bow his head

2094
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,320
laughing

2095
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,320
what did we say his name was?

2096
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,320
Sylvester

2097
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,320
I see you Sylvester

2098
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,320
you know our families may have had some problems at one time

2099
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,320
but Krinklehoff is

2100
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,320
well there's worse things in this world than the Krinklehoff

2101
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,320
am I right?

2102
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,320
clearly

2103
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,320
but I'm also

2104
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,320
I'm also sad y'all

2105
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,320
because it didn't used to be so hard

2106
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,320
to get this family together

2107
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,320
it didn't used to be so hard to get the

2108
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,320
Pettymore's to have a party in Pettymore

2109
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,320
Holler woo woo

2110
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,320
times have changed

2111
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,320
the outside world is creeping in

2112
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,320
and I understand in some ways so many of our

2113
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,320
cherished young ones

2114
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,320
they leave a Holler for a better life

2115
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,320
they think they deserve and they'll find out there

2116
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,320
but others, others have been

2117
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,320
cruelly taken from us

2118
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,320
where is our John Lee?

2119
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,320
where is our Don?

2120
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,320
our Edward?

2121
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,320
Aloysius? Where is our Samuel?

2122
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,320
somebody goes

2123
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,320
I'm right here Ma

2124
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,320
she says shut your damn mouth Sammy

2125
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,320
I was talking

2126
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,320
about your cousin

2127
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,320
Burt you keep your boy in line

2128
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,320
sorry Ma

2129
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,320
now I'm asking you

2130
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,320
who took our boys?

2131
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,320
who took Ma's boys?

2132
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,320
I glance over at Ron

2133
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:48,320
laughter

2134
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,320
she says well it's no great mystery

2135
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,320
is it? it doesn't take Dick Tracy

2136
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,320
to solve this one it's as plain

2137
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,320
as the straps on a skunk

2138
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,320
the pernicious parasites

2139
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,320
who live on the other side of our teat

2140
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,320
have broken the peace

2141
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,320
boo

2142
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,320
who took our boys?

2143
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,320
you know who I'm talking about

2144
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,320
who took our boys?

2145
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,320
and every petty more screams

2146
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,320
the McRibs

2147
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,320
the McRibs

2148
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,320
the McRibs

2149
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,320
the McRibs

2150
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,320
I want them to never return

2151
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,320
laughter

2152
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,320
we had peace between

2153
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,320
the Hollers for nearly 20 years

2154
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,320
Beauregarde McRib

2155
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,320
has shattered that peace

2156
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,320
with no provocation

2157
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,320
boo boo boo

2158
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,320
Ben microscopic

2159
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,320
alright

2160
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,320
quiet down there

2161
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,320
she's like

2162
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,320
she's like Stuart

2163
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,320
a jokeful comment is fine

2164
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,320
but it has to land

2165
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,320
laughter

2166
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,320
also sweetheart

2167
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,320
I'm in the middle of something

2168
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,320
keep your good boy

2169
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,320
in line

2170
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,320
laughter

2171
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,320
who took our boys?

2172
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,320
McRibs

2173
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,320
we had peace for 20 years with the McRibs

2174
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,320
the Beauregard shattered that peace

2175
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,320
what do you think?

2176
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,320
think we wouldn't notice?

2177
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,320
he wouldn't think?

2178
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,320
we'd notice our son's missing

2179
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,320
Ma's son's missing

2180
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,320
he thought that we'd let the loss of our kin

2181
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,320
go unanswered?

2182
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,320
he thought the Pettimores would just let him spill our blood?

2183
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,320
no

2184
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,320
no way

2185
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,320
where is John Lee Pettimore?

2186
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,320
the McRibs got him

2187
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,320
where is Don D. Pettimore?

2188
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,320
the McRibs got him

2189
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,320
who killed Aloysius?

2190
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,320
the McRibs

2191
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,320
who killed Edward?

2192
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,320
the McRibs

2193
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,320
who killed Samuel?

2194
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,320
the McRibs did it all

2195
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,320
everybody but Joni

2196
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,320
give me an alertness roll

2197
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,320
oh my god I pass

2198
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,320
I fail

2199
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,320
a 6 on a 20 because I don't have alertness

2200
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,320
you know there's been rumors about

2201
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,320
Edward and Aloysius

2202
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,320
some of the cousins said they were up to something with John

2203
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,320
you're not really sure

2204
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,320
but their bodies were found in a shallow grave

2205
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,320
not too far from here

2206
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,320
just outside the borders of the Hauler

2207
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,320
Edward and Aloysius' brother

2208
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,320
whose name is Jonathan

2209
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,320
when she says who kills Aloysius

2210
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,320
who kills Edward

2211
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,320
he kind of kicks the ground and spits

2212
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,320
but Ma goes on

2213
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,320
Noor Guard, Beauregard, that's what they call him

2214
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,320
did he forget his history?

2215
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,320
Pettimores have

2216
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,320
the

2217
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,320
Pettimores have licked the McRibs

2218
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,320
time and time again

2219
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,320
I see why they call him Noor Guard

2220
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,320
because he has forgotten

2221
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,320
but his hubris won't save him

2222
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,320
he's taking on one hell of a debt

2223
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,320
and it's a debt that cannot be repaid

2224
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,320
in treasure

2225
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,320
it must be paid in blood

2226
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,320
everyone knows you won't want to be in debt to a Pettimore

2227
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,320
everybody knows you don't want to be in debt to Ma

2228
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,320
you know what we say

2229
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,320
gas, grass, or ass

2230
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,320
no one rides for free

2231
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,320
Big Bo wants to ride your ass for free

2232
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,320
no free rides

2233
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,320
no free rides

2234
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,320
no free rides

2235
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,320
I say let his hubris

2236
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,320
be his downfall

2237
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,320
let it be the downfall of his whole godforsaken

2238
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,320
clan

2239
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,320
Big Bo may have started this feud again

2240
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,320
but Ma is gonna end it

2241
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,320
for good

2242
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
who's with me

2243
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,320
I'm fucking in

2244
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,320
I'm in

2245
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,320
that's

2246
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,320
everybody's murmuring and then shouting

2247
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,320
yes Ma we're with you

2248
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,320
we're with you

2249
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
fuck the McRibs

2250
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,320
no free rides

2251
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,320
fuck Mark Zuckerberg

2252
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,320
and in that moment you hear

2253
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,320
booming up the driveway

2254
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,320
the powerful engine

2255
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,320
of a 77 black

2256
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,320
Pontiac Transam Firebird

2257
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,320
which rolls to a stop

2258
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,320
in the driveway

2259
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,320
right in front of John's house

2260
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,320
and you'll see who gets out next week

2261
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,320
I bet it's Trey

2262
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,320
I think we found

2263
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,320
our clue

2264
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,320
weirdly a letter

2265
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,320
falls from the sky

2266
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,320
delivered by an owl

2267
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,320
an owl swoops

2268
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,320
down and it's got another scribbled note

2269
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,320
in John's handwriting

2270
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,320
and it says

2271
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,320
I couldn't

2272
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,320
I tried to prepare for every contingency

2273
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,320
with my animal friends

2274
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,320
contingency

2275
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,320
and one of those

2276
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,320
contingencies was me forgetting that my daddy

2277
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,320
drove the kind of car that I was talking about

2278
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,320
Trey drives one it's also not the clue

2279
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,320
again it's the sprint car

2280
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,320
in my shed

2281
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,320
why don't you go check it out next month

2282
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,320
hell yeah dude

2283
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,320
hell yeah man

2284
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,320
fuck yeah

2285
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,320
I cannot wait to fight some fucking McRibs

2286
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,320
bring on the McRibs

2287
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,320
them sweet and tangy bastards

2288
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,320
I said I did not

2289
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,320
want to spoil that joke for you guys

2290
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,320
so when the McRib came back for that farewell weekend

2291
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,320
I was like we should maybe go get a picture

2292
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,320
of us eating it for social media right

2293
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,320
and you guys were like

2294
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,320
fuck no

2295
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,320
we should go get some McRibs

2296
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,320
never

2297
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,320
that probably doesn't have anything to do with anything

2298
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,320
we talked about the fish fillet for like 10 minutes

2299
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,320
yeah we did

2300
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,320
oh I'd go for a fish fillet

2301
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,320
oh man it's not cheddar is it

2302
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,320
oh it's not cheddar is it

2303
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,320
it's not

2304
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,320
I need a pill

2305
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,320
I need a drink

2306
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,320
I need a smoke

2307
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,320
