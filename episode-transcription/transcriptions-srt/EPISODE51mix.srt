00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Greetings, listeners, this is an introduction of myself, Wolf the dog, and this introduction

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,940
is introducing itself as hard as it can, live from 694.2 PTBP.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,340
Speaking of meet and greets, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week, ain't that special.

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,780
It goes, hey there, Crystal, yes, you, coat rack, just keep working and act normal, they'll

5
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,560
know we're talking, they're always watching, where do you think the glowing flamingo really

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,420
came from, the kitchen light flashes and cold but I've started to crack it, we'll talk soon,

7
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,820
see you in the car, from Millhouse, hmm, this seems like a message that may not have been

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,640
meant for y'alls truly, but y'all, I think the postal service is a lie, so I always open

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,600
up anyone's mail I see, it's like I have access to infinite gifts year round, it's

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,500
always someone's birthday somewhere and I'm usually in that someone's dumpster when the

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,520
mailman goes walking by, happy birthday to me, baby, glowing flamingo do sound pretty

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,520

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,680
The most recent one is the recently unearthed recording of session zero for this whole damn

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,680
campaign in which the town of contention is created and the cast discusses their plans

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,720
for the podcast, well, everybody makes plans, but only what actually happens becomes the

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,320
news.

22
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:18,000
As of right before sundown, Liz Lonklin had spoken with a strange rambling man in a clearing

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,860
surrounded by sigils in a circle of a white powder before she ran into Ash Hornbeam, arm

24
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,000
still stuck in the tree, coming up with no solution, Ash freaked out and pulled his arm

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,440
halfway out, his extreme pain tolerance the only thing keeping him conscious.

26
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,600
Liz bailed to go look for help and she found Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krenkelhoff with

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,120
a naked, bloody, muddy man tied to a tree, Jeremy was feeding him sausage toe beans in

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,920
an attempt to calm his new friend he called Rusty, Ken was not on board with this situation.

29
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,040
Judy Krenkelhoff ran off into the woods after losing her shit and calling Shadow a tree,

30
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,240
the two of them almost fell into a pit trap but instead found a rather gregarious raccoon

31
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,680
that charade style told them to avoid the hand sanitizer and to all get the absolute

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,760
fuck out of the woods, the three of them walked back to the trailhead where they found Krista

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,200
Krenkelhoff in the ranger's shack, she gave Judy more hand sanitizer before the three

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,200
came to the conclusion that the best next course of action is for Krista and Shadow

35
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,920
to go back into the woods to find Liz while Judy stays at the ranger's shack with the

36
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:44,200
raccoon and then Judy Krenkelhoff opened the door to the bathroom and she learned exactly

37
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:51,200
why it is blue false indigo with moon dance, she runs, the sun is sleeping soon, she knows

38
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:30,200
she knows she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow

39
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:45,200
of the moon.

40
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,440
You guys are walking through the woods looking for Ash Hornbeam who Liz has told you has

41
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:58,600
his arm stuck in a tree and the sun goes down behind the trees of the woods and you are

42
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:06,200
now walking through total darkness, you are not on the path of the trail any longer because

43
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,820
that is not where Ash Hornbeam resides in the mind of Liz Lonklin and as you're walking

44
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:19,920
through you all begin to realize that you have no fucking clue where you are or where

45
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,960
you're going.

46
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,440
Rusty no, Rusty, you eat smokies but don't bite the fingers, leave my fingers alone.

47
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,480
He's looking at your fingers and like doing that thing where he wraps his lips around

48
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,800
your fingertips like a horse might looking for a carrot, see I feed him palm down from

49
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,880
now on, palm up like you do a horse and then he immediately like looks over at Ken Krenkelhoff

50
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:58,360
and like yeah, he's being a turd, huh?

51
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,600
I pick up my pace ahead of that.

52
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,200
Liz you said he was this way, where is he?

53
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,900
I don't know, I swear to god he was just over here like just over around this corner.

54
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,960
And as you guys pass that corner you see that amongst these trees you can make it out in

55
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,240
the moonlight, it happens to be not a full moon but like so close to a full moon that

56
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,040
you might be like that's a full moon but then you look it up and you're like it wasn't a

57
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
full moon.

58
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Yeah it's just waning.

59
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,280
Does this ever happen to you where you think it's a full moon and you say oh that's a full

60
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,840
moon and someone corrects you because they know when the full moon is?

61
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,520
No but I correct people because you can just fucking look and see when it's a circle or

62
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
not.

63
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,720
Sometimes it's really close to a circle.

64
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,120
So this moonlight is shining down and ahead of you you see glinting from the moonlight

65
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,360
is a frame like of a painting and it's hanging from a tree.

66
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,400
Let's just turn around y'all, fuck that.

67
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,320
What if we just went the other way immediately?

68
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,960
And with that I'm gonna need Thomas and Lindsay to leave the room.

69
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:23,920
Hey Joe.

70
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,360
Hey Zach.

71
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,480
We're gonna cut to a quick flashback here.

72
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,560
Oh boy.

73
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,280
It's a couple years ago and it also happens to be the evening that Kane Krinklehoff, Ash

74
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,660
Hornbeam, and Jeremy Pettymore are out in the woods.

75
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,340
Looking for Madge.

76
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,860
Simpler happier times.

77
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,860
Of course.

78
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,460
You actually felt one when you were with him.

79
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,220
They were, they're my buds.

80
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,340
The look in your eyes when you say that is so like nostalgia killing.

81
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:09,580
Kane Krinklehoff pops away to go pee, finds a spot in the woods, behind a tree, something

82
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,060
else that rhymes.

83
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:21,340
As you're looking up from your stream of urine, you see the frame of a painting hanging in

84
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,980
the woods.

85
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,620
Can I make out what is within the frame?

86
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,820
How far away is it from me?

87
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,660
It's about 25 yards away from you and you can see that it looks as if there is nothing

88
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,900
within the frame.

89
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,180
You see the trees on the other side.

90
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,740
I'm going to approach it a little bit, that's weird, who put a frame out here in the woods?

91
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,380
Go ahead and roll alertness for me.

92
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,700
I pass a 27 on a 50.

93
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,300
Kane Krinklehoff notices that somewhere around the edge of the frame, something doesn't line

94
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
up.

95
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,020
It looks almost as if what's behind this frame that's hanging isn't the same as what you

96
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,340
can see through it.

97
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:17,780
And so you move to the side and you walk, you strafe, is that how you say that word?

98
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
You straffy.

99
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:26,820
When I was a kid, I always said straffy because I didn't, I didn't, I was a fucking idiot.

100
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:38,060
You slam and as you walk to the side, you see that beyond this frame is a cabin sitting

101
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,020
in the woods.

102
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,720
Ken wants to push his hand through the frame, can he?

103
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,580
Go ahead and roll a survival check for me.

104
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,060
Oh fuck, that's a fatal mistake.

105
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
What's your survival?

106
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,060
A 50.

107
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,620
I pass a 24 on a 50.

108
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:04,220
As you approach the frame, you make a misstep and your foot is about to land on a wire.

109
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,720
There's a wire that is going across the ground that's right in front of the frame and you

110
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,100
almost step right on it and you see it's connected to like a stake in the ground and then it

111
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,820
goes off to a tree and ties off.

112
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,060
Oh shit.

113
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,340
Okay, I want to abort my mission of the hand through the painting and I want to step back

114
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,540
and grab a branch or a rock, anything that's nearby and try and toss it in from where I'm

115
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,540
standing.

116
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:35,940
You toss it onto the wire and a giant wooden spear comes flying through the canvas of this

117
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,420
painting and strikes directly into a tree that is five feet away from you and you think

118
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,900
if you would have been standing there when you stepped on this wire, you would have gotten

119
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,140
a face full of splinters and probably a back of the head full of splinters as well.

120
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,080
And it came out of the frame, like I couldn't tell where it came from.

121
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,940
You couldn't, but it busted through the frame.

122
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,340
Go ahead and roll a retroactive sanity.

123
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
Yeah.

124
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:11,260
I fail a 78 on a 34.

125
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,960
What's going through your mind as you race back to your campsite?

126
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
It can't be real.

127
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
It can't be real.

128
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,480
I've just not gotten enough sleep tonight and it doesn't exist.

129
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,100
Jeremy Pettymore, Liz Lonklin, and Ken Krenkelhoff.

130
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:53,100
As well as this large, bloody, muddy man who is at the end of Jeremy Pettymore's rope.

131
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Rusty.

132
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Rusty.

133
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm so sorry.

134
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Rusty.

135
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,540
Are all standing in this clearing looking at this frame that is glinting in the moonlight.

136
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,540
Jeremy!

137
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
Elizabeth stop!

138
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,540
Yeah, don't stop.

139
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,540
Okay.

140
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Don't.

141
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
Go.

142
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
Near it.

143
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,540
You recognize that frame?

144
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,020
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't think it was real.

145
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,300
I didn't think it was, I just thought I was, just hadn't had enough sleep that night.

146
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,520
It's, look, and I point at the thing on the ground.

147
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,300
Looking down where Ken Krenkelhoff is pointing, you see that right before this frame that's

148
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:38,840
hanging there is a trip wire on the ground tied to a stake in the ground and the other

149
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,900
end of the wire goes to a tree that is nearby.

150
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,360
So they wanted to distract us with the frame and trip us up with the wire.

151
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Stand back, stand back.

152
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,920
And I push them where I know it is a safe place.

153
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,320
Rusty, come here boy, come on.

154
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,680
And I go ahead and throw a log and show them.

155
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:04,160
When Ken Krenkelhoff throws a small log onto this trip wire, a long wooden spear flies

156
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,200
through the canvas of the frame and directly into a tree 10 feet away from you guys.

157
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,080
Whoa, that was cool.

158
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,600
Holy shit.

159
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
That was awesome, Ken.

160
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,360
How'd you know it would do that?

161
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:28,200
I, a couple of years ago, I was, I had to pee and I came over here to pee and I saw,

162
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,520
I saw it then.

163
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
I didn't think it was real.

164
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,280
I didn't, I didn't, I just pushed it out of my memory.

165
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,680
I didn't, but it's real.

166
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
It's there.

167
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
You guys see it, right?

168
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,560
The painting, the frame there where the giant spear came through the canvas.

169
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,240
You now see there's a cabin in the woods on the other side of the frame.

170
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Oh my God, Zach.

171
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
That's already a movie.

172
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I think it's a lot of movies.

173
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Did you not know?

174
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,560
Zach, that's a name of a literal movie.

175
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Wait, what?

176
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
There's a movie called.

177
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Fucking beautiful idiot.

178
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Cabin in the woods.

179
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
That's a very popular movie.

180
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Are there any eldritch gods in it?

181
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
I think so, yeah.

182
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Actually, kind of.

183
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Oh, fuck.

184
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,400
I think that's like the whole deal.

185
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
If you want to start over, we can.

186
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Let's just go back.

187
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
This is so embarrassing for you.

188
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
Do you guys want to make middle schoolers this time?

189
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
Sure.

190
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Yes.

191
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
You'd like that.

192
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Gah, again?

193
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,920
Oh, it's super cool when you do that.

194
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,040
It makes me feel good.

195
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,040
No, it makes me feel good.

196
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Oh.

197
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Got him.

198
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
FBI.

199
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Come on, inside.

200
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Got him.

201
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Ew.

202
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Busting makes me feel good.

203
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Busting makes me feel good.

204
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Oh, that was good.

205
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Busting makes me feel good.

206
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Sorry.

207
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
All together now.

208
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Busting makes me feel good.

209
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
It's all about ghosts now.

210
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
It's middle schoolers and ghosts.

211
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,200
Hey, Jeremy Pettymore, how do you feel about the fact that Ken saw something out in the

212
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,560
woods a couple years ago and didn't say anything to you?

213
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,040
Jeremy is probably just a little too excited by all this.

214
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,040
And if he really processed it, he'd put one and two together and he'd be like, what the

215
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
fuck, man?

216
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,040
But right now, he's very much in the moment.

217
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,040
You're the treasure hunter who has found a chest at the bottom of a hole.

218
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Yeah, of course this woods is full of freaky frames.

219
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Freaky frames?

220
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Cabins in the woods?

221
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,040
I grab Jeremy, I grab him and kind of move him to show him that there's no cabin over

222
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
there.

223
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
It's just when you look through here.

224
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Nope.

225
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Oh, that's not the case?

226
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,040
When you look through on the other side this time, there is a cabin.

227
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Oh, that freaks Ken out.

228
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

229
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
There's obviously a cabin there, dude.

230
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
It wasn't there.

231
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
It wasn't there.

232
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
I fail hard.

233
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
A 93 on a 34.

234
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Go ahead and roll a D6 for me.

235
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Oh, boy.

236
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Oh, boy.

237
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
A five.

238
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Yeah.

239
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,040
That's what I wanted to happen.

240
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
So, you lose five sanity.

241
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Go down to 29.

242
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
What the fuck?

243
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Oh, we hit a lot, relatively.

244
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,040
And we're playing a slightly different sanity mechanic for this game.

245
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,040
It's come through a couple of times, maybe just once earlier, but you have not seen it.

246
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
We're going to do bouts of insanity.

247
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Do you remember earlier in one of our other campaigns, maybe both of them, what I would

248
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,040
have you do is rank fight, flight, and feint.

249
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Oh, yeah.

250
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,040
From most likely to least likely for your character.

251
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
So, which would be most likely?

252
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Flight.

253
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
And next would be?

254
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Fight.

255
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
And the third would be?

256
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Feint.

257
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
All right.

258
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,040
So, if you roll a one, two, or three, you will flight.

259
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,040
If you roll a four or a five, you will fight.

260
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,040
And if you roll a six, you will feint.

261
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
It's a four.

262
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
That's a fight, baby.

263
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
What?

264
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Oh, God.

265
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
So, here's what I'm thinking.

266
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,040
You just start punching that cabin.

267
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Yeah.

268
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Dump cabin.

269
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,040
I don't know exactly what you look for in a fight response, but could I like maybe grab

270
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
the spear and be ready to fight?

271
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Like, I'm amped and stoked to be doing damage now.

272
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Not only are you going to grab the spear and be stoked to do damage now, but also flight

273
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
was going to be run away.

274
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,040
So, fight is going to be run toward.

275
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,040
We got to kill this cabin.

276
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,040
And why do you hate some home so much?

277
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Someone built that with their hands.

278
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
They lived there.

279
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
They lived there for all we know.

280
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
It didn't used to be there.

281
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Lindsey, what is Liz Conklin doing?

282
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Liz Lonklin, first of all, how dare you, is she's just confused.

283
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,040
She's like, it's a cabin.

284
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Why is it that crazy that there's a cabin there?

285
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
I'm sure that person that lives there put this frame there.

286
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I don't know.

287
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,040
It just seems to me like somebody's being a douche who's trying to keep me from performing

288
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
voodoo on the girl that I'm-

289
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Out here to perform voodoo on.

290
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Yeah.

291
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Damn, she has such a cooler reason for being in the woods than us.

292
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I'm just pissed.

293
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Why the fuck am I here with these fucking freshmen right now?

294
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,040
It's just a spell written by Fufuzuzu Voodoo is a book they found in the library.

295
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Jeremy Pennymore, what are you doing?

296
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Ken, wait, hold up.

297
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Come on, Rusty.

298
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
I follow after him.

299
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Can't stop, got to fight.

300
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Can't stop, got to fight might be your last words.

301
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Roll an alertness check at a negative 40 for being insane.

302
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,040
I was going to say that there might be more traps, but I was running.

303
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Yeah, there might be.

304
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
What am I rolling?

305
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Alertness at negative 40.

306
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
At negative 40.

307
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,040
For being absolutely out of your mind.

308
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Absolute fail.

309
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
It's a 76.

310
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:49,040
And you run directly into a pile of leaves on the ground that is not a pile of leaves

311
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
on the ground.

312
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,040
It's a motherfucking pit trap.

313
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:02,040
And I need, once again, Thomas and Lindsay to leave the room.

314
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Don't worry, guys.

315
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm going to get out of it.

316
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Busting makes me feel good.

317
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Busting makes me feel good.

318
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Busting.

319
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,040
You guys actually see him as he's running.

320
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:17,040
You just fucking, he's on your level and then he's not anymore.

321
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Leaves papa behind.

322
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Ash Hornbeam, you're standing in the middle of the woods.

323
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:48,040
No fucking clue direction wise where you are from anything in the contention woods.

324
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Your arm is halfway in the hollow of a tree.

325
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
We figured it out.

326
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
I looked it up while I was editing that episode.

327
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,040
I looked it up literally like three days ago because I was like, what is a knot but not

328
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
a knot?

329
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Not a knot.

330
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Well, I looked it up.

331
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:13,040
It's a hollow and we both used the word hollow within 30 seconds of not knowing what it is.

332
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Okay.

333
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Well, perfect.

334
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Your arm is halfway into this hollow of this tree.

335
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:29,040
The rest of your arm that you can see up to your elbow is muscle and a thin layer of membrane

336
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
that is, what's it called?

337
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
What's in between muscle?

338
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,040
You were in nursing school for like four months.

339
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Well, between your, I mean, there's like layers of skin and then your muscle.

340
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
What's that sin you called the white stuff?

341
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Aphasia.

342
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Aphasia.

343
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
No.

344
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Fascia.

345
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
F-A-C-I-A.

346
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
F-A.

347
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Yeah.

348
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Fascia.

349
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Fascia.

350
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Fascia.

351
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Doesn't matter.

352
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Let's move on.

353
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
It's not like that would have been ripped away.

354
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
It would not be there.

355
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Like the brine of an orange or the pith.

356
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
I mean, so.

357
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Oh yeah.

358
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Ew.

359
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Gross.

360
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
You can see this juice.

361
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Think about that.

362
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
This juice of your arm.

363
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Think about a blood orange that you didn't really take the peel off of very well.

364
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:16,040
And the sun goes down behind the trees in the distance.

365
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,040
And you are standing all alone in moonlight.

366
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,040
I really don't know where to go from here.

367
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,040
You hear a branch crack in the distance.

368
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Someone is nearby.

369
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,040
I wait silently.

370
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
What's bothering you is a man.

371
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,040
He's wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a bolo tie.

372
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,040
He is in his late 20s, early 30s maybe.

373
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,040
He has a very, very bitchin' mustache.

374
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
He's pretty fit.

375
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,040
His pants are a little too tight.

376
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,040
And he flashes an FBI badge as he approaches.

377
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Name's Agent Kevin.

378
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,040
I need you to tell me what you're up to with your arm stuck in this tree out here in the

379
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
woods.

380
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Ash just looks down at his arm.

381
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
A tear rolls out of his eye.

382
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Just help me.

383
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
I'm here to help.

384
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
I need a little bit of information before I can help you.

385
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
My arm is stuck.

386
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Why?

387
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Because I put it in here.

388
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Why can't you get it out?

389
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,040
It feels like there's barbs in here.

390
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,040
And the more I pull out, the more skin gets ripped off.

391
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,040
I just, I don't know what to do.

392
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:35,040
He pulls some cloth out of one of his pockets, and he wraps it around your arm, if you're

393
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
willing.

394
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Whatever you want to do.

395
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,040
So he begins, he has some ointment that he puts on your arm, and then he wraps a cloth

396
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,040
around it, and he's like, that should help start the bleeding for now a little bit, but

397
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I need some more information.

398
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
What were you doing out here in the woods?

399
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
You know there's people missing, right?

400
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
I know, I gotta...

401
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Why'd you decide to become one of them?

402
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:02,040
It hurts me a little bit, but I kind of pull my arm away from the tree, and I let the light

403
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,040
shine out, and I just point to it, and I look at him with wide eyes.

404
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Yeah, that's wild.

405
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
That's not an answer, though.

406
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Why'd you come out to the woods, anyway, in the first place?

407
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Well, we come out here, me and a couple of friends, we come out here every year, and

408
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
we just camp.

409
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I was just trying to camp, but we found...

410
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
You decided to camp when there were people missing in the woods?

411
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,040
You decided to come out here and camp, anyway?

412
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Doesn't seem very smart.

413
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,040
I'm in high school.

414
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
I see that.

415
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
I didn't think through...

416
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:44,040
I wasn't going to stop camping every year if people are missing.

417
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
I don't...

418
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
I'm invincible.

419
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Roll a persuade.

420
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,040
He's going to roll human against you.

421
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
49 on a 50.

422
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,040
I rolled a 69, which in our house rules is a critical success.

423
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Is a critical success.

424
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
You're not telling me the whole truth, son.

425
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
I can see it in your eyes.

426
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Something scared you.

427
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,040
You knew about something like this before you came out here.

428
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
What's your deal?

429
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
We come out here every year to find something.

430
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,040
We haven't found it yet, but...

431
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
What are you looking for?

432
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
I don't know if I can tell you.

433
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:24,040
You have to trust me or you're going to die tonight.

434
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Ash looks down at his arm and he sees the first aid, basically.

435
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Sure.

436
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:35,040
What this guy has done to him and he looks up at the FBI.

437
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
He says, I'm looking for Madge.

438
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Who's Madge?

439
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:45,040
It's just a while back we heard about a woman in the woods and at first it was just kind

440
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:51,040
of an excuse to come out and camp every year, but every year we started believing in it

441
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:59,040
a little more and with all this stuff going on, I think I finally believe it.

442
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,040
And we're out here looking for her.

443
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
I got a couple friends.

444
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Two of my buddies are, I don't know where they are now.

445
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,040
I don't know where I am, but I came with them.

446
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Alright, well...

447
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Shit.

448
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Alright.

449
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Thank you.

450
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:32,040
And he walks up behind you and you feel the metal of a gun up against the back of your head

451
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
and his hand is trembling.

452
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
An instinct kicks in.

453
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
His left arm, which is...

454
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
His right arm is in the tree.

455
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,040
His left arm reaches into his pocket, pulls out a lighter and then he reaches in to his

456
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:52,040
inside of his jacket, pulls out a handful of firecrackers and in one quick motion lights

457
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,040
the lighter, lighting five or six firecrackers.

458
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:04,040
He reaches behind him and he holds the firecrackers on this guy's head, knowing that his hand

459
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,040
is going to get hurt, holds the lit firecrackers on this guy's head and waits for them to explode.

460
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Alright!

461
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I'm going to go ahead and roll some dice here to see what Agent Kevin decides to do.

462
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:25,040
As soon as you do that, he pulls the gun back down, grabs the firecrackers in your hand

463
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:32,040
and he throws them with your hand and then he stands up in front of you face to face.

464
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Alright, you're a fighter.

465
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
We could actually use another set of hands.

466
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Well, I guess maybe just one will do.

467
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
I'll be back.

468
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Ash kind of chuckles because he gets the little joke that this FBI agent made.

469
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,040
He reaches back into his jacket and stares him in the eye.

470
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:58,040
The tiny explosion happens from these fireworks that you guys have thrown off away from you

471
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,040
and he turns back and looks at you with this wry smile.

472
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,040
You look familiar.

473
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,040
You're that kid from around here who had the troubles with them robbers, yeah?

474
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Yeah, that's me.

475
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
And you fought them off, didn't you?

476
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Oh yeah, real good.

477
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
I knew you were a fighter.

478
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
How'd you do that?

479
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,040
I pulled a lot of pranks, kind of used my past knowledge of pranks that usually were harmless

480
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,040
but I added a little element to them to do some harm.

481
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Yeah, we're going to need some thinking like that for tonight.

482
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Well, I'll come with you if you can get me out of this tree.

483
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,040
And then we flash back into the history.

484
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:47,040
The pages on the book turn backwards as this, you know, fluttering music happens behind us

485
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:54,040
and we travel back into time when Ash Hornbeam is an even younger boy

486
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,040
and we see the front of the Hornbeam home.

487
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
What kind of house do the Hornbeams have?

488
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,040
It's like a two story, just kind of like Victorian.

489
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,040
And right there on the front steps we see Ash Hornbeam.

490
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:12,040
He's wearing one of those like crisis blankets and he's got some hot cocoa in his hands

491
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,040
and there's an officer from the contention police force there talking to him.

492
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Now, Mr. Hornbeam, what was it? What time did this all begin this evening?

493
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:32,040
I started hearing some noises in my basement around 5.30.

494
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Around 5.30, okay. And what kind of voices were these?

495
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,040
I think it was two voices, maybe three, but I'm pretty sure two men's voices.

496
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Two men's voices, okay. And did you get a good look at these men?

497
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Not a great look, but one was tall and skinny and one was short and fat.

498
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Classic two man robbery team.

499
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Mm-hmm, trench coats.

500
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,040
What is it that they seem to have been looking for and or have stolen?

501
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Well, I think they were after, my dad's got a real big coin collection that's pretty well known.

502
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,040
He takes them to coin shows and shows them off and he's got some real valuable stuff down there.

503
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,040
He keeps them locked up in the basement.

504
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Locked up in the basement, okay.

505
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:23,040
And then we flash back to Ash Hornbeam in his home all alone a few hours earlier.

506
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Ash Hornbeam is home alone watching TV and he sees an ad, made for TV ad kind of thing,

507
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:36,040
for something he really wants to buy. It was like a CD player, I think, that he wanted.

508
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Three disc changer.

509
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Three disc changer for how much it cost. His allowance was not going to pay for it.

510
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,040
So he hatched an idea to try to get into those coins.

511
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Get into the coins?

512
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Yeah, to get into the lockbox the coins were in so that he could sell them and buy that new CD player.

513
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
So how did he pull this off?

514
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:02,040
He kind of rummaged through his parents' room. He didn't know the code to it, but looking for maybe clues of what it could be.

515
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,040
He didn't really find anything, so he went down there and just started typing in birthdays.

516
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
And eventually?

517
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
It was my birthday.

518
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Aw, your parents love you so much.

519
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Yep, and I'm taking their stuff.

520
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:20,040
So there was in the lockbox the entire coin collection valued at $40,000.

521
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Yeah, some real nice stuff. And then a handgun.

522
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,040
He knows which ones were more valuable, so he just took a handful, not the whole thing.

523
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
He didn't need $40,000.

524
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,040
But he takes about $600 worth of coins.

525
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,040
And then we flash back to this officer talking to you.

526
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:44,040
And he's like, so we walked through the house and we saw there's just a mess all over the place.

527
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,040
I mean, you got paint cans that are hanging from strings.

528
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:54,040
You know, when I heard them down in there I figured, you know, I gotta defend myself and get them out of here.

529
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:01,040
So yeah, I found some paint cans in the garage and some hammers and tied strings to them.

530
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,040
I learned how to do a trip wire when I was in the Boy Scouts.

531
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:13,040
So I did that by the stairs and when they were coming up I threw marbles down the stairs and they fell down and then they were mad.

532
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
So they were coming after me.

533
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:24,040
And then, yeah, the first one, the tall one, he tripped the first wire and the paint bucket swaying right into his face covered him with that paint that's all over the ground.

534
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:29,040
And then the second one came up, the shorter one came up and the other trip wire.

535
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Yeah, the second trip wire that I did, the hammers came and whacked him on either side of the head and he fell back down and got paint all over him.

536
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,040
And then I yelled that I was going to call the police and that I had a gun.

537
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,040
And then, yeah, then I called you guys.

538
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:51,040
And then the front door swings open and walking out is another police officer from contention.

539
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,040
And the first one that you're talking to is like, no, no, no, hold on.

540
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:02,040
And before he can stop him, a bucket falls down on the top of this guy's head and he's like, oh no.

541
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Yeah, it was a bucket that I had made that goo stuff out of.

542
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,040
But it went all over him and the buckets on his head so he can't see anything.

543
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
He walks into the wall and falls down.

544
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:18,040
And I'm like, well, you know, they must have gone out the back door because I set that one up for the front door.

545
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Okay, well, we're going to talk to your parents and then we'll have a report written up and we'll see if we can find these fellas.

546
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Yeah, I said one, they're both tall. They were both tall.

547
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Okay, so the short fat one was tall.

548
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
He wasn't as tall. That's why I said short.

549
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Less tall, still tall. Okay.

550
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,040
One was ugly. The other one was even uglier.

551
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Well, the most important thing is that-

552
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
And a beard.

553
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Oh, he's got a beard too.

554
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Yeah.

555
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Okay, well, this is really narrowing it down.

556
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Well, the most important thing I believe is that you feel safe here.

557
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Yeah, I think I've got to unbuby trap the rest of the house.

558
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
So don't go walking upstairs or anything.

559
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,040
But yeah, I feel safe now.

560
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
I think I can defend myself.

561
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
I think my parents are on their way back home too.

562
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Hey, Luke.

563
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Yeah.

564
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Did you get that three disc CD player?

565
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Yeah, he's got it.

566
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,040
He carries it everywhere he goes.

567
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
He's got Def Leppard on there.

568
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Of course. Def Leppard's really fitting.

569
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,040
He's got Def Leppard. He's got Ramone's album.

570
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
And then he's got a Madonna album in it too.

571
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Yeah, that's very important.

572
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Fucking Def Leppard.

573
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Alrighty, cutting back to present day or whatever your present day is.

574
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Cutting back to Ash Hornbeam with his arm stuck halfway into the hollow of this tree.

575
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,040
This man's smile fades as he turns.

576
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Agent Kevin walks away from you back into the darkness of the woods.

577
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Ash stands there dumbfounded, wishing that that would have been a rescue.

578
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:06,040
But he looks back down at his arm, looks at the tree, and just punches it with his left arm and looks down and defeat.

579
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Ash Hornbeam, you're standing still halfway the forearm out of this tree.

580
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:34,040
And you see from the direction where Agent Kevin walked away, he's walking back and there's another figure with him.

581
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,040
And as they come into focus, you see that it is a woman.

582
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:48,040
She is wearing a black suit, a white shirt, black tie, and she is holding a machete that is glinting in the moonlight.

583
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:58,040
And as she's walking toward you, you can hear she is chanting while she rubs one of her hands over this blade.

584
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:09,040
And as she gets closer, you see she is smiling a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs that are covering one of her eyes.

585
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,040
And the two of them finally get up to you.

586
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:21,040
As they approach, he doesn't want to do it, but Ash just instinctually winks at them.

587
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Finger guns with his free arm and the hand that is stuck inside of the tree also finger guns.

588
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Ash winces a little bit from using his muscles in the tree. It kind of digs in just a little bit.

589
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:45,040
But the wink and the free hand finger gun make up for the pain.

590
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,040
Please don't make me roll.

591
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,040
In two quick movements, Agent Kevin says, this is Agent Karen.

592
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:01,040
And she lifts this machete that is glinting in the moonlight over her head and she brings it down swiftly right at your forearm.

593
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:09,040
And you step back away from the tree and immediately out of shock reaction, you look at your forearm.

594
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,040
And not only is the end of it completely cauterized, but it starts to grow back.

595
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:22,040
And your forearm literally remolds itself into this kind of long stump at the end.

596
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:28,040
So you don't have your hand, there's just this kind of long stump, but it's still this well-formed skin.

597
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:35,040
And then from halfway up your forearm to about your wrist, it's still raw and red.

598
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,040
And like, you know, you can see the muscle and tissue and stuff.

599
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,040
She says absolutely nothing.

600
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,040
She just like smiles at you and then turns around and starts walking the other way.

601
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
Agent Kevin throws his arm around you.

602
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,040
All right, we're going to need some more of that firecracker hand quickness, triggery fingers where we're going.

603
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:05,040
And he leads you along with Agent Karen to a black sedan sitting next to a four-wheeler in the middle of the woods.

604
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:14,040
And you can see through some of the brush and trees, there is a cabin and it's a stakeout, baby.

605
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Hell yeah.

606
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Taylor, Shadow, Sharon Berryman, if you will, is walking down the trail of the contention woods with Krista, the Krinklehoff matriarch.

607
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,040
And I believe she was singing a song about death.

608
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Death is all around us, et cetera.

609
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Et cetera. And Krista is like not having any of it.

610
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:01,040
She's like folded arms walking and the sun goes down behind the trees in the distance.

611
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:11,040
And she pulls out a flashlight and begins leading the two of you on this dirt path of roots and rocks and only lit by the light of a flashlight.

612
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,040
And then, oh, oh my goodness. Do you see that?

613
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:22,040
And she points the flashlight over to the side like in the thick of the woods and she points the flashlight out there.

614
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,040
She's like, oh, is that Liz?

615
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Krista immediately takes off into the brush of the woods with the flashlight kind of bouncing off these trees.

616
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Total darkness except for the moonlight and this flashlight.

617
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:42,040
I run after her giggling because I see no importance in any of this and I'm having a great time.

618
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Yeah, absolutely. You've got the things dangling from your hands and you're like waving them back and forth and just kind of like whimsically running through the trees.

619
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:02,040
And so since you don't care, I'm going to have you roll your alertness at negative 40 as you just put no effort into running through all these woods.

620
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
What's your alertness normally?

621
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
40.

622
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,040
Oh, bummer town. So you have a zero. So, uh, let's see if you, if you roll an art one, that's a success.

623
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,040
And if you, your dice matches a crit fail, so go ahead and roll those dice.

624
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Excellent odds.

625
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
Nine 95.

626
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
All right, so that is a fail.

627
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:31,040
And you see the flashlight go completely dark as you feel a rope tighten around your ankle.

628
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:44,040
And in this moonlit darkness, you lose control of your body and you lose your bearings completely as this rope hoists you up into the air upside down, hanging by one foot.

629
00:39:44,040 --> 00:40:01,040
The blood immediately begins rushing to your head and a bright light blinds you momentarily before Krista Krinklehoff turns the flashlight on herself under her chin like it's spooky story time.

630
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:12,040
My darling, it is certifiably unfortunate that your demise is seemingly necessary, despite my finding your demeanor so appropriate for your kind.

631
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:20,040
From your personal hems, I can assume and do hope that a lack of existence is your preference.

632
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,040
And then I whispered to myself, finally.

633
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:35,040
And you see a long silver tendril grows from the back of Krista Krinklehoff's neck.

634
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Then another, then another and another as the limbs extend toward your pinata like hanging body.

635
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:53,040
The camera pans down to watch the long shadows play out this grizzly scene on the detritus below.

636
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,040
One of the shiny tentacles slices into the soft tissue on the back of your neck.

637
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Another snaps your head forward and you feel the fracture as a third reaches in gripping the top of your spine and it rips your entire spinal cord down out of your body in one swift motion, promptly delivering you to your lack of a destination.

638
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,040
And you feel nothing.

639
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,040
Allie, you just told me something horrifying about your mom.

640
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:52,040
I did. She used to hide under my bed and when I would run out from the bathroom at night, she would reach out and grab my ankle.

641
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,040
That is wholly fucked up.

642
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
It is so bad.

643
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:16,040
So just imagine that feeling inside that you have like when your ankle would get grabbed is the exact horror that you feel as you're standing at the entrance of this bathroom that is attached to this shack at the trailhead of the contention woods.

644
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:24,040
And the sun goes down and it's dark outside and it starts to rain behind you.

645
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Looking ahead, you see this body that is crumpled, folded even, wearing the state trooper uniform.

646
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:41,040
And the body is Buzz Woodrow, if you will, and it is lifeless.

647
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,040
So do you have forensics or SIGINT?

648
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
I have a 20 in SIGINT.

649
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Oh yeah, go ahead and roll that.

650
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
Okay.

651
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,040
I got a 20.

652
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,040
No way. That's incredible. That's a success.

653
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Oh yay. Good.

654
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:07,040
Yeah. So you can tell looking around this bathroom, there was a tussle in here and you're like Sherlock Holmesing around the place.

655
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,040
And what is something small from Krista Krinklehoff's purse?

656
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,040
Something small. Chapstick?

657
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:27,040
You see the exact brand of chapstick your mother, Krista Krinklehoff uses, has rolled behind the toilet of this place.

658
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,040
Oh my god.

659
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,040
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

660
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
I got a 14 on a 32.

661
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
That is also a success.

662
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
Wait, you had a 32 in first aid?

663
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
No, you said sanity.

664
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
Oh, I did say sanity?

665
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
Do you mean first aid?

666
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
How'd you do that?

667
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:51,040
No, so you succeed. I think maybe inside you knew all along that your mom was a fucking bitch.

668
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,040
I always knew. Krista.

669
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
So now roll first aid for me.

670
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,040
I was one roll ahead in my head.

671
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,040
Okay, I got a 66 on a 50.

672
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:14,040
You have absolutely no idea what happened here or why he's like this, but you feel a poke behind you as you're looking around this room.

673
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:26,040
And the raccoon is standing in the doorway motioning like, let's get the fuck out of here.

674
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
That's what the raccoon says with its arms.

675
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,040
He says let's get the fuck out of here with his arms.

676
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
Let's get the fuck out of here.

677
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,040
Cool. I follow him.

678
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,040
Okay.

679
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
I'm losing my mind.

680
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,040
That absolutely makes sense.

681
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:46,040
Judy, you follow this raccoon out into the rain, into the darkness.

682
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:52,040
There's one light that overshadows the entire parking lot and it's flickering.

683
00:44:52,040 --> 00:45:02,040
You turn the corner on the other side of the shack and looking down the trailhead, a lightning bolt flashes in the distance.

684
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:14,040
And it's just enough to light up a blood-covered Krista Krenkelhoff who is walking directly toward you.

685
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:42,040
The sun is sleeping soon.

686
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:53,040
She knows that the time has come.

687
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:22,040
To dance beneath the shadow of the moon.

688
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:33,040
She moves with the howling wind.

689
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:45,040
The sun has come again.

690
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:56,040
Her eyes have seen it all.

691
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:05,040
The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
