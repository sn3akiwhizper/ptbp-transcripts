Cut that shit out now. the only radio station currently being run by an in-prison DJ Wolf the Dog? Now, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf, y'all. And this week's comes from Nathan, who claims he is either deep in the heart of Texas or deep in the hell that is Texas.
44.56 53.28 speaker1  bone-digging buddy one could ask for in this dirty business.
48.80 65.20 speaker0  And to my wife, Erin, who is so good at wrangling all those werepuppies and kitties, I'm so glad you're diving
63.44 75.60 speaker1  Oh, shit.

186.32 258.00 speaker0  There's a pregnant girl in this motel room that we all thought was meant for storage. It's Brat Pit with Ms. Mary. Mary, yeah. There must be something inside of me. Does anybody know why? I can't get high. It's not.
255.40 262.24 speaker2  But also every time I drink it, I go through, I don't like it, it's fine. I don't like it.
261.40 267.16 speaker1  And of course, we're talking about
265.12 283.64 speaker2  Sparkling Water from La Croix. That is true, until then, fuck La Croix and fuck every brand that doesn't. Yeah, we will keep talking shit about you It's like a vanilla lemon thing. There's too much vanilla in it, though.
281.64 287.04 speaker3  No, it's kinda gross.
283.64 296.48 speaker2  We're here with David Winters!
292.48 302.28 speaker3  Winter is coming, now is the winters of your discontent. What's up, man?
301.44 316.92 speaker2  Have you enjoyed this? These are like those one-word answers when your parents call and you are in the middle of something and you pick it up.
314.76 322.80 speaker3  Is this like when you're at like a con
321.96 333.20 speaker2  Yes.
332.36 340.80 speaker3  Yes. It does, yeah. Who's your favorite?
339.96 369.88 speaker2  Really short. Glass cannon. To the point. No. Okay, so if you had to pick only one Colin Hanks movie and then replace him with every. That's the end of my list, too.
366.20 379.00 speaker3  We just learned a lot of information, so much information. Well, you learned some of the information.
375.32 385.00 speaker2  right at the about halfway point of an info dump. I'm willing to keep dumping if you're willing to keep receiving the dump. Oh, please dump on us. Dump all over us.
384.16 391.72 speaker3  Please dump on us.
388.40 483.60 speaker2  Steam and hot info. Yeah, you made it into like scat or something, that was weird. You just cracked open his notebook and got a dump of several different happenings that he has seemed to have researched in the area. Things like livestock mutilations, livestock alterations, some missing time, some helicopters being sighted, including some muzzle flashes, lights being sighted in the hills, some crop circles, some notes about J.A. being Jane Allen. Pregnant three weeks equals six months. Exactly, and the aldermen who never go home. That was in the notebook, his wide ruled school notebook. Freak. You, again, should be questioning his sanity. And you still see his Macintosh power book in front of you plugged into the phone outlet as you had learned earlier when you tried to dial them. Is there anything you'd like to do? Can I ask a kind of retroactive question? When I was looking at Jane Allen, did she seem older than she should be? Nope, she's still a high school senior, looks like a high school senior, actually looks very similar to some of those photos that you saw of her family in her house when you were there, right? When her mom was dressed to kill.
481.84 492.20 speaker3  At least one of you,
488.16 500.44 speaker2  all the family photos and she looks as you would expect. So back to the computer.
495.44 510.80 speaker3  Jodine goes over and turns it on and we saw he had AOL.
506.12 529.92 speaker2  it does still ask for a password as you open it. Does anyone have an often underused skill? SIGINT, signals intelligence. I don't. Exactly.
528.32 542.56 speaker3  Can we negotiate with you here? Luke, we need to seriously have a conversation about the fact that I took special training in parachute.
540.76 553.72 speaker2  and I didn't want to connect them yet, but I know what's going to happen. You don't need SIGINT. SIGINT is one option, but fortunately there's a second one
552.24 564.06 speaker3  which is computer science.
562.42 575.64 speaker2  you've invested in knowing computer science. You know, in the early 1990s, people don't use the most secure passwords.
574.12 584.18 speaker3  Love, one, two, three.
583.36 588.24 speaker2  That's all it was. Well, I didn't try that one, so.
587.40 589.06 speaker4  Cindy.
588.24 601.38 speaker2  I'm sorry, Joe. Oh, Cindy's not there? Oh, oh, okay. I'm sorry, Joe. Sorry, it's not, so did purple work?
600.00 616.20 speaker4  I try watch the sky's two. I accidentally hit caps lock. because I thought I might have mis-hit that one.
614.30 663.66 speaker2  and the computer catches on fire due to 10 failed password attempts. No, I'm just kidding. I'll give it to you. until you got to football one, two, three was the correct answer. Hey, I was on the backtrack. Go team, you were, you were. It cracks open. You find a document on the desktop, and I am going to display it in front of you now. If you check out your television, it's long. It looks like it's,
661.58 666.34 speaker3  that the brain translates information in terms of the extra sensory.
665.50 673.86 speaker2  He literally told us not to read this.
672.02 686.38 speaker3  and then we can talk about what it says? Yeah, it gets just insane. Yeah.
684.66 688.70 speaker4  but it gets a little rambly.
686.38 694.94 speaker3  Oh, we get into some Jesus stuff.
692.62 700.50 speaker4  Yeah, it's French, just sweetie.
698.62 775.32 speaker2  and the reason why I said not to read it all out loud is it would make no sense. And people would have to rewind several times and be like, what the hell are these guys talking about? But suffice to say, this is something presumably that was written by Scott Adams on his computer stream of consciousness, talking about extra sensory perception and existence and seeing things and consciousness and all sorts of nonsense related to thought and the sensory experience. He should have stuck to Dilbert. He's branching out, okay? You have to try new things. Yeah, the file title was S-Z-E comma T. Of course it was, of course it was. But now you have that, that's thing number two from this steamy dump. Thing number three, you see a file on the desktop. It's simply titled message. It's a wave file. And I am going to need an alertness roll from everyone.
773.02 781.00 speaker3  I got a 36 on a 50, nice. All right.
778.76 789.18 speaker2  The other two of you, please take your headphones off and then we will swap. Dude, Zach, we can literally say anything about these guys
787.88 802.40 speaker3  Fucking idiots. I love them both a whole lot. Me too.
800.56 817.96 speaker1  and we have many things to do
815.28 831.92 speaker3  because he doesn't know what he's dealing with. Is that right, Luke? Wow. One in the same.
830.28 839.36 speaker4  we do this on our screens. We did it when we were remote because we couldn't. People can fly away at home.
836.98 841.28 speaker3  You could see on the screen if we needed them back.
840.20 855.24 speaker2  Well, I've got you two now and now it's time for you to fire up this metallic squawky voice.
852.40 861.96 speaker1  and you are not sure what you are doing.
859.72 869.70 speaker3  Tone Brown, is that like the Brown note? He did say duty. He just said duty.
868.86 872.14 speaker2  Let's see if it works.
870.64 880.16 speaker4  We often combat that, yep. Oh, it worked, it worked.
877.92 923.48 speaker3  So we, Joe and I like sat there like rubbing our ears vigorously for like a minute and a half. Saw that, yeah. So we couldn't hear anything and you two chuckle fuckers are just like sharing memes and laughing and faking. Luke has some really funny pictures on his phone. Yeah. Okay. do you think he's working on the Brown note, the tone that makes people shit their pants? The Brown, what?
921.66 929.22 speaker4  That's not what I heard at all. What do you mean? We all heard it. Play it again.
928.38 936.92 speaker3  Here's the deal.
935.84 939.24 speaker4  Yeah, we heard a man's voice, right? It was kind of garbled.
937.92 947.26 speaker3  We missed some words. But it mostly just said, you don't know what you're dealing with. What did you hear?
946.44 951.64 speaker4  Over and over and over.
950.06 953.32 speaker3  well, I think you took it down pretty well, huh?
951.64 962.88 speaker4  You didn't hear a name. They said Billy Webb. They said a name?
962.04 965.28 speaker3  A Brown tone.
962.88 967.12 speaker4  They said to talk now.
965.28 985.38 speaker3  Who's Billy Webb? Was he on the list of the, in the notes we got of all the different events? Doesn't look like it. Like a web of Billys.
984.06 993.10 speaker4  back then, but is there anything that we can click on that shows us when the file was made, like created?
991.22 1020.60 speaker2  As far as this audio file goes, the ranty dream of consciousness file, that's only about two days old. That seems to be a little bit more fresh. And then obviously the notebook is handwritten. So you'd have no idea exactly when stuff was written. However, there are various dates over the last month and a half. or maybe which of those bits of information he collected himself. There's nowhere a way to delineate between the two.
1019.76 1029.44 speaker4  That's it. They said Billy Webb and then they kind of broke up. And then there was a...
1028.20 1032.24 speaker3  for the Ohio state?
1030.84 1038.84 speaker4  USO backwards?
1034.24 1071.44 speaker3  Tan goes to the office and asks Riker for a phone book. Nice. Jeez. Okay. and you heard another?
1069.88 1089.52 speaker4  and there's no Billy Webb here, I mean, we all heard the same thing. You just misheard.
1086.44 1101.72 speaker3  cause he's in the office asks Riker, Okay, that's it.
1100.16 1106.76 speaker4  Is there anything else that we should look in this computer for?
1104.52 1153.24 speaker2  You can go through all the other notebooks and notes. He has notebooks for various other towns all over the place. He's based out of Tennessee. So most of these towns are all related to sightings in the area. However, the Grover's Ville notebook is chock full of stuff. It's just page after pages. These are kind of the more recent pages, but you go back and there are just progressively more outrageous things that he has records of. Little gray people walking through Main Street and sighting of eight flying saucers. And it goes back years actually of this Grover's Ville stuff. It's only more recently when you're seeing specific things about choppers or weird things about pregnant girls.
1151.36 1157.14 speaker3  or sighting in Grover's Ville?
1155.22 1171.04 speaker2  but it's similar to his other notebooks. Most other places go back two or three years. You can reason that's probably when he kind of got in the UFO game. Gotcha, okay. He stopped writing comics and then got into the UFO game.
1167.84 1179.42 speaker3  Tan goes back to the room and signals Cindy to like come outside. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he doesn't know anything about Webb. I got an idea though.
1177.82 1181.10 speaker4  Well, that's because Webb wasn't a thing. What's your idea?
1180.26 1202.64 speaker3  Yeah, I got an idea. Okay, you know, everybody in the town's weird. Yeah, for sure. Probably an alien. Sure. They're covering something up. Yeah, yeah. make a big scene, and then we see who comes out to deal with it. Then we got our main suspect.
1200.04 1211.08 speaker4  That seems horrible to do to this poor girl.
1209.92 1219.80 speaker3  Plus the aliens, their whole deal is that they're acting like people. They're gonna be really,
1217.52 1224.36 speaker4  like they've been blase about everything.
1222.52 1279.00 speaker3  in this town and take them out because they are provoking, they are threatening, they are going around dealing in stuff that they don't want other people poking their heads in. And what do we know, Joe, about people who don't want people poking their heads in, who threaten other people? It's always about... Money. Money. It's always about money. Joe is like looking at you intently and he kind of like holds up a cardigan and hands it to you. She puts on a second cardigan and calms down. I only got one more, fellers. As she's calming down,
1276.48 1284.16 speaker4  I don't fault you for that.
1280.84 1290.80 speaker2  Next time you have a victim like myself in this similar situation, only use your four names scrambled between them.
1289.64 1300.68 speaker4  There you go. There you go.
1298.32 1316.52 speaker2  I want to talk to Joe the human being. Real life, Joe. Everyone else, wait for the bird signal. It is just me and you. And really, you know, I just wanted to take a break. I'm good with you, yeah. And really just, yeah, just relax without those chuckleheads. That's really kind of the main thing.
1315.48 1318.36 speaker4  What you getting for dinner tonight?
1316.52 1370.48 speaker2  Bad thing about saying that is at some point, someone's going to be editing this and I just called them a chucklehead, so, you know. I hope it's you editing this episode and not anyone else. However, I have news for you. And I have news for your character. I guess not you, but for whatever reason, you're incredibly thirsty. You just feel like you're always dehydrated. You always need to be drinking something, thinking about where you're getting your next drink. Not necessarily an alcoholic beverage, just water, coffee, anything, but you can't quite quench that thirst. we were discussing earlier, you can still urinate, but there's no more number two for you in your future.
1369.08 1372.08 speaker4  or I just don't feel the need to?
1370.48 1442.60 speaker2  You don't feel the need to. Yes, I'm sorry. I don't want to make it sound like you have suddenly just become constipated and you need, yeah, you need to go to a drug store and get, You have absolutely no urge to. And that's pretty much it. That's all you know. Just the standard, last night was thirsty Thursday. Today's Friday. You know, it happens. Some Fridays you just need to drink a lot of fluid All right, I'll do the bird thing. It is an early nineties Lincoln town car, in fact. hops out of the car with a large duffle bag and comes up towards the office, towards Riker's office, kind of asks where you guys are. Riker's in that office, points kind of down your way towards the Scott Adams, Jane Allen room. And he gets there and knocks on the ajar door.
1440.88 1446.70 speaker3  quiet and then knocks on the door? Yeah, we're outside.
1445.88 1452.36 speaker2  They're inside. Cindy and Jane are outside. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. I thought everyone was inside.
1449.20 1455.20 speaker3  So we're like waving at him as he comes towards us.
1454.36 1458.76 speaker2  No, just kidding. He stops you. Sorry.
1457.52 1466.48 speaker4  Zach's head whipped to us. He's like, that's fair. What's that mean?
1464.96 1484.78 speaker2  You're now invisible. Hello? And he whips out a badge. Agent Jordan Cook. You are the agents, right?
1483.70 1490.42 speaker3  Excellent, excellent.
1489.58 1508.62 speaker2  Thank you. Yes. Gives you an envelope and gives you a duffel bag. He looks around back and forth, makes sure Riker's not listening or anyone else. Bubble gum tree.
1507.78 1510.14 speaker4  Bubble gum tree.
1508.62 1517.22 speaker3  Bubble gum tree.
1515.46 1530.14 speaker2  It's about 20 pounds. And then you have one of those envelopes, kind of an inner office mail sort of envelope. One of those big yellow ones with like the string. Manila envelope. Vanilla envelope. Vanilla envelope.
1528.46 1544.02 speaker3  It smells like fresh vanilla. These new Limoncello La Croix envelopes And then I look at it a little more and I'm like, I don't like that.
1543.18 1548.94 speaker4  I just don't know about it.
1546.18 1552.22 speaker3  I also unzip the duffel bag a little bit.
1551.38 1583.92 speaker2  Sure. So in the envelope is a single piece of paper with some stuff typed out on it. And then in the bag is a bunch of liquid. Six gallons of liquid with two spray bottles. Almost the same kind of spray bottles you would use to clean with. What does the liquid look like? It just looks to be slightly foamy and bubbly, transparent. Does anyone else have a high pharmacy? I have a 50.
1583.10 1584.76 speaker3  In the envelope.
1583.92 1586.16 speaker2  Yeah, maybe we do that.
1585.00 1587.98 speaker3  Let's do some rolls first.
1586.16 1593.70 speaker4  Yeah, let's do some rolls first.
1592.60 1595.88 speaker3  We read the paper.
1594.54 1598.38 speaker2  I mean, you can just mess around with the liquids if you want. We can also go that route.
1597.54 1604.00 speaker3  Let's talk to the liquid for a while. Slap these bags real quick.
1603.16 1610.24 speaker2  You can. Spray fight. You can.
1607.16 1626.02 speaker3  It's gonna be acid to break down a fucking body, dude. and about to touch one of the containers.
1623.14 1640.82 speaker4  from being aware of what we're about to do, Your eyes look pretty big.
1638.74 1644.42 speaker2  Yeah, I'll read the note to you because there is no note for you to read.
1642.22 1646.14 speaker4  How is it gonna talk to David?
1645.30 1700.32 speaker2  Yeah, let me tell you what it says. And it's a memo from Derringer, typed out on a typewriter. He didn't even want this thing to hit the computer network or be saved anywhere. The tissue test came back on the muscle tissue in Billy Ray's body. And they're not really sure exactly what it is. It's some sort of matter, extraterrestrial substance that basically replaced his muscles. And they're not sure exactly how it works, but they've developed a detecting compound that they've rushed together for you. That's what's in the duffel bag. You can spray it on things. And when you spray it and it detects this matter, things will turn purple. Oh my God.
1699.14 1709.54 speaker3  I spray everybody.
1708.62 1743.26 speaker2  I did indeed. Last night? Yep. Your entire face turns purple. Harlan, you splashed water under your armpits and threw on a fresh polo. Your upper arms turn purple. your mouth, your lips, the inside of your mouth turns purple. Oh shit. if you wash your hands after going to the bathroom. Joe, I know that you stopped washing your hands
1741.06 1757.32 speaker3  on purple hands years ago. No, I said he used the bathroom. I said he has a drink. I don't know if surely he drank some water, but we could also just have him back away in terror from all of you.
1755.76 1759.62 speaker4  It's just picking up sweat.
1757.32 1779.66 speaker3  These are sweat glands, obviously. Yeah, my face is really sweaty and purple.
1778.24 1788.84 speaker4  The first one's a fail.
1786.94 1791.88 speaker3  I failed as well. Otherwise it's zero.
1788.84 1837.40 speaker2  That's the unnatural though, so no check boxes for that. The second though, realizing it's in your body and the fact that to some extent, you have ingested something in this town, washed your hands in this town, it's basically in the water supply. You know that much so far. Okay, that's gonna be one on a success, four on a failure. And what about a crit fail? I believe that is gonna be eight, no? at the slightest sight of anything so far, right? First, what was the, I forget the first time you puked. Was it in? It was at the office, the first video. Was it the office, right?
1836.56 1838.72 speaker3  Yeah.
1837.40 1859.04 speaker2  Yeah, it was at the office the first video and it got progressively worse when you caught the smell of that dead body. And now on your very first mission, you recognize that it's not going particularly great for you.
1858.20 1879.18 speaker3  Or did you pass that one? I did, I took one. So you took nine total? I took nine total. Yeah. So I'm quite a bit past that. Okay, so technically- And I'm feeling good.
1876.90 1923.30 speaker2  you're gonna go temporarily insane. You can potentially suppress that by projecting that onto one of your bonds if you so choose or not. You can just go temporarily insane. It's totally up to you. Tan really likes his bonds, so he just takes it himself. Your temporary insanity is going to manifest in you fleeing. Realizing this, you're just going to run away from the hotel without saying much while everyone else is there also feeling pretty bad about things. You just start to run away. You will kind of come to after booking it, losing your breath and kind of turn around
1918.30 1932.34 speaker3  Tan, he chokes down some vomit and then just runs away and he runs right towards the mega deuce.
1929.74 1938.34 speaker4  Harlan hit a breaking point in that sanity loss also.
1937.06 1958.76 speaker2  I didn't hit a breaking point, but I did lose five sanity. Cindy is gonna submit, curl up, just disconnect from everyone, maybe go back into her room. she's seen in the field.
1956.74 1988.20 speaker3  and as she goes to touch the knob to turn the hot water on, she like freaks out, hits the wall behind her. And as she hits the wall behind her in this small motel bathroom, up against the wall of a small motel bathroom. And then she shakes her head and goes and lays down in the bed.
1985.02 2006.96 speaker2  when it comes to mealtime. The thought of putting anything in your body at this point is going to be somewhat anxiety provoking, at least in the immediate term before you seek any professional help.
2003.52 2017.76 speaker3  that hits him and he gets scared again and runs away from the Megaduce
2014.48 2030.64 speaker2  that got injected into Billy Ray, presumably it's elsewhere in this town. Clearly it's in the water supply
2027.96 2052.96 speaker4  Harlan's going to make eyes with Jodine. It's in the water supply. That makes sense now. That's what we saw. Real quick, I think that makes this the EPA's problem.
2051.00 2058.02 speaker3  around the parking lot right now.
2054.80 2070.34 speaker4  But it looked like mercury. But it seemed conscious. It seemed like it was moving of its own accord, right?
2069.00 2081.16 speaker3  I don't know. I don't know if what I'd saw, I'd call consciousness as we know it.
2078.24 2083.40 speaker4  It flattened itself out to break it, right?
2081.16 2097.84 speaker3  Yeah, I guess that is pretty thoughty. Hey, I don't want to eat anything from the diner. Should we get just a bunch of like little Debbie's and stuff that comes in plastic from the gas station?
2095.64 2105.72 speaker4  I want to hit the vending machine. I'm parched. The idea of not being able to drink the water here, that scares me. I need to top up.
2104.82 2120.36 speaker3  Well, let's get you a Coke. Everybody knows in 1992 that it's fat that makes you fat, not sugar.
2119.52 2131.28 speaker2  You can do that though. There is a vending machine right near the manager's office. Soda, little Debbie's, little Dorito bags.
2127.58 2157.70 speaker4  Harlan buys a Coke and he cracks the top on it and he downs the Coke without it getting away from his lips. Yeah, I'm thirsty. I don't want to drink the water here. We can't drink the water here.
2154.68 2164.32 speaker3  Would some of this mealtime anxiety be alleviated when we do have like these prepackaged foods? Yes, yes.
2161.32 2192.00 speaker2  You feel safe enough that eating this, it's more any food that someone else prepared for you. Would be very suspicious to us. Yeah, that is not a multinational corporation trying to jack you full of low quality calories through advertisement and other things. That's kind of what I'm getting at. No food trucks, no diners, you know. All right, yeah, I love little things. That tracks, dude.
2188.08 2215.16 speaker3  So yeah, Joe Dean gets a couple sprites for himself. He ran towards the Mega Deuce and then ran away from the Mega Deuce. And he's still got like one of the spray bottles in his hand
2212.52 2219.24 speaker4  Well, hold Tan, Tan, Tan, Tan.
2216.96 2225.48 speaker3  He stops spraying cars in the parking lot.
2223.50 2233.94 speaker2  nothing's really turning purple.
2231.56 2265.30 speaker3  to kind of put her hands on her hips, which reveals the baton and pepper spray she has on either side on her belt. So Cindy, we do need to talk to him, but you know, you were talking earlier about just taking him out. I don't think we're quite at that place yet, are we? We'll find out. So Joe Dean has brought back some snacks and he hands a candy bar to Cindy.
2263.18 2272.34 speaker4  Here, have a Snickers. Hey, that's a good, they should use that.
2271.14 2309.76 speaker3  No, that's nothing. That won't ever be nothing. She takes a couple of bites and the camera whips back up to her face, which has little granny glasses on it all of a sudden. We just left Jane in that room, right? You did. Let's give her some food. And this dude, the Delta Green, the FBI guy, he took off once he gave us the duffel bag and the... Yep. He just bounced.
2307.90 2327.86 speaker2  and just starts pounding them. Much in the same way that Agent Nash just pounded that soda, she does the same thing with the little debbies, the Doritos, the Funyuns. Whatever you put in front of her, she just houses all of it.
2326.86 2355.08 speaker3  Housed them. I've never heard that, but I like it. There's someone even in charge of it at a government level. I was all for going to Merle, but now that I've had the Snickers, I'm up for whatever you guys are up for. Well, we should just go to Merle,
2353.02 2364.30 speaker4  you mentioned that Merle had been harassing people. Did we get that from somebody?
2361.10 2378.18 speaker3  from someone was harassing Scott Adams, and she just assumes that it's the person
2376.26 2397.22 speaker4  Billy Webb and something garbled, and then What Your Duty and something garbled, and they said, talk now. It sounded like a command, talk now. They also said, I'm sorry, I'm talking like Clark. And that ending, it said Tone Brown. It wasn't actually Brown Tone.
2395.74 2413.94 speaker3  Do your voice though, I like your voice. Tone Brown and Duty. Well, what did you hear? Stop now. Not sure what you're dealing.
2413.12 2418.66 speaker4  Stop now, stop now. You're not sure what you're dealing with, stop now.
2417.60 2420.12 speaker3  So it does.
2418.66 2430.14 speaker4  Putting our notes together, one of the things I got was talk now. So you're hearing stop now.
2429.32 2433.80 speaker3  and you passed it. And I don't wanna, obviously role-playing wise, it'd be great if we just-
2432.96 2437.16 speaker4  No, I know it's hard for- I can't believe in that.
2435.24 2439.80 speaker3  But I was wondering if we could put anything together from it and really glean the truth.
2438.96 2441.46 speaker4  Yeah, sure. If you wanna try-
2440.62 2443.68 speaker3  But we do gotta keep this moving.
2441.46 2450.06 speaker4  Adult men can never admit that they're wrong. Yeah, yeah.
2449.12 2467.24 speaker3  We heard it right. I believe that's a mundane day.
2464.68 2500.64 speaker2  You've already gone and questioned the mother of the missing girl, who you have found and just happens to be very pregnant. You've talked to the sheriff. You've talked to one of the aldermen. You've talked to the guy who runs the only bar with a liquor license in town. You've talked to a bunch of random kids at the reservoir. You've talked to the manager of this hotel. We've gotten a lot done. You got a lot done. You've talked to, this is only a 1200 person town and you're starting to near the double digit percentage of people interrogated.
2499.80 2504.68 speaker3  Yeah, we are.
2503.00 2509.38 speaker2  and we just go down the line.
2508.40 2511.96 speaker3  Shame.
2511.00 2516.60 speaker2  Where do you wanna go? It's an investigation. Merle.
2513.86 2552.68 speaker3  Yeah, I think that's our last big. He's the papa. Oh, you think Merle is? No, I think it's aliens. Yeah, I think it's aliens too. That does bring up an interesting question. That's literally not what I was thinking. Okay, I was thinking maybe. She kinda puts her hands on Tanner's shoulder
2551.84 2558.10 speaker4  What? Then what is your solution?
2555.96 2565.36 speaker3  to her parents' house.
2563.32 2571.08 speaker4  This is a real 12 Angry Men situation
2567.84 2603.72 speaker3  I'm still leaning towards parading her down Main Street and seeing who gets pissed off about it. Your two options are taking her back to her loving parents or publicly humiliating her, but never killing her and the aliens spawn inside of her. which basically makes her an alien. So I don't know if she can feel human emotions. So who cares if we parade her downtown? I don't think we can- But what we can say is that we're gonna do it and then let everybody line up. Here's the deal, the optics don't matter because we're not supposed to even be here.
2602.48 2611.96 speaker4  So nobody's gonna hear. What, no, just because, no.
2608.16 2638.20 speaker3  All I'm saying is I suggested that you told me not to. I have accepted that we're not gonna do that. So what, I mean, what, we leave her in the hotel. I say drop her with Nancy. and see what he advises? Oh, I thought he said, do call me if you have any trouble. Cause it wouldn't be handy-
2635.88 2649.22 speaker4  He said they would only use a courier. We should have sent a message to him. Wait! He's like, so gone.
2646.80 2661.02 speaker3  We hop in the Bronco and tear off after him.
2659.40 2668.48 speaker4  What if we threw in some snack foods and figured this out later?
2666.40 2678.64 speaker3  She doesn't seem to have the muscle stuff going on. She's just got the alien baby.
2675.00 2683.24 speaker4  if what you told me was true happened in that bathroom.
2681.68 2859.04 speaker3  You know, I'm not going to disagree with you there. That does seem, yeah. Oh, I don't like Delta Green. I refuse to be a part of this. but I'm not killing, That's what I'm saying. I'm not going to. Go home. I'm going to go talk to Merle. and just like sits down on the sidewalk outside the motel and it's like fucked up. And he lights a cigarette and offers it to Tanner. and lights one up. What's your brand? He smokes Palmalls. for seven teams. Oh my God. And he says, on my first time as a friendly. Do you want to kill that baby? I don't want to kill that baby, but we have to. Tanner, what's inside that girl's belly is a danger to the entire world. Our participation in this organization is kind of precipitated on that understanding. Tanner is literally just like frowning and like dry crying. And not only does she have to die at Tanner, Cindy's gonna kill you too. She's nice though. We have tattoos together. Cindy's not nice. That's all we're saying. You actually do have to kill this alien baby. There are rules in place, yeah. So when you guys look up from this conversation, you see, hopefully, as long as it's cool with you, David, maybe even the comforter off the motel bed wrapped around her. And she's gonna walk her out to the Bronco. Wait, what about,
2856.08 2864.76 speaker4  in one of those hardcore metal fonts where you can't really read what it says.
2863.28 2868.88 speaker3  We were talking junkie graveyard.
2866.92 2875.24 speaker4  These are good things.
2870.36 2886.56 speaker3  No, but surely there's a crooked doctor around here, a midwife who, I mean, look, these, I had a baby. Does that mean you know how to? We're in some dangerous territory right here.
2884.24 2898.44 speaker4  This doesn't feel like it was already iffy when we were killing somebody. Okay, hold on, hold on.
2896.48 2901.76 speaker3  instead of trying to save her life at all.
2900.60 2905.68 speaker4  isn't it, to cover up?
2902.84 2950.88 speaker3  Okay, but then you can't call the episode alien abortion. Tan is having like a serious- When he sees Cindy Woodabaga walking Jane out, he's like crying and he pulls the 44 off his hip and like looks at Joe and like aims it at Jane and is like looking for some sort of approval. Yeah, Joe lowers your hand. I don't trust you not to wing Woodabaga and then she would kill you. Yeah, Tan breaks down once again and just starts crying.
2947.88 2967.76 speaker4  You just seem a little shaky in your gun hand right now. This whole time, Harlan has been kinda solemn into himself, but he is definitely walking toward the Bronco with no objection.
2964.64 2994.02 speaker3  We'll take the DEA, the DEA cruiser. outside of town where there's no one in sight. You have to deliver the squid, baby. It's minute black, it's minute black.
2992.10 3002.24 speaker4  sometimes where it's now a shot at the top of trees and there's the birds fly off, a bunch of birds fly.
2999.86 3021.02 speaker2  Just the crack in the distance. And then it cuts abruptly to the two of you at town hall, rolling up in that sick DEA cruiser, the self-driving Knight Rider DEA cruiser. You've not been using that functionality for whatever reason.
3020.18 3059.62 speaker3  Thank you, CopNet. Yeah, I think it does, but really the main, the shining beauty of this particular model but it scared me to even think about doing that. I hand him a couple of moon pies. I eat both of them very quickly. Great. And then I look at myself in like the mirror and see is there like still purple around my mouth? There is still purple around my mouth and I wipe it off. And I guess theoretically,
3058.66 3068.34 speaker2  as you were crying,
3066.54 3115.26 speaker3  30 seconds of silence for Prince. I barely knew him. and well, should we? I don't think their business is gonna take too long. Why don't you eat another moon pie After eating two moon pies, he takes a third one and just like eats the marshmallow out of the middle and then contently sits there.
3113.38 3118.02 speaker2  out of town and presumably meet you there?
3115.26 3126.98 speaker3  As soon as he eats the marshmallow out of the middle, they hear a very distant faint gunshot.
3125.66 3140.42 speaker2  You wait long enough, a Ford Bronco comes speeding into town.
3138.18 3144.66 speaker4  He's obviously tried to clean himself up a little bit before getting here.
3141.26 3178.50 speaker3  You see some really like dirty shovels in the back. Joe takes Cindy aside. You eliminated Jane and the Vector. He's doing all right, When you go back to the car, you find Tan just like cleaning, like taking apart and cleaning his 44. He's prepared himself.
3176.54 3184.06 speaker4  Well, they said the aldermen never leave work. Oh, he's an aldermen, that's right.
3182.38 3199.86 speaker3  So I get out of the car and I go ring the doorbell of City Hall. Where we are greeted by, what was her name? Jennifer Kahn.
3199.02 3210.42 speaker2  Just chilling. I go pee real quick just in case, you know. Hey, there's a bathroom right there. Yes, just in case. You are more than welcome to go to the bathroom. And there's still a water.
3208.54 3221.30 speaker3  Should I role play this out?
3219.78 3245.68 speaker2  the first time you were in town hall and then you shook hands with Bradley Allen and it was wet and then you tried to lie. It was horrible. And he saw right through it. Cindy loved that so much. So everyone at this point is assuming you didn't wash your hands. So, you know, the aspect of the role play is strictly if you want to make peace with the fact that maybe you should start washing your hands
3243.56 3254.88 speaker3  now that you have this stuff all over you. imagines purple flowing out of the sink and he's like, no.
3253.40 3272.36 speaker4  While you guys are waiting for him to get back from the bathroom, you look over and Harlan is gulping down from the water fountain. Oh, and he starts wiping his mouth. Sorry, I forgot.
3271.36 3274.32 speaker3  Here, have another Coke.
3273.48 3275.64 speaker4  Yeah.
3274.32 3292.80 speaker3  Did you like Pavlov-ing him? like a map directory thing on the wall anywhere?
3291.00 3331.88 speaker2  So you, if you remember, you're going between the offices to see, you know, which one had the evasive answers, which one had the direct answers. Those are all downstairs. And there's actually one for each of the aldermen that were mentioned kind of in that note. So Merle has one, Bradley Allen. So Jane's father had another, that was the room you were in where he used his computer. So that's one hallway downstairs. Upstairs is like the conference room, the big boardroom where all of like the aldermen kind of bigger meetings happen. And then kind of the other side of town hall are the municipal things like the county court and things like that.
3329.40 3337.20 speaker3  Cindy pushes past Jennifer Kahn and says,
3336.20 3342.68 speaker2  No, no, no.
3340.52 3347.16 speaker3  It seems like they almost do nothing but work, but we should have to take a moment of their time.
3344.52 3350.68 speaker4  Do you guys wanna all flash our badges at the same time? Yeah.
3349.84 3362.20 speaker3  Flip, flip. US Marshall. I-T-A. The E-A. Oh, was that the, that was the county of Grover?
3359.80 3375.30 speaker4  You're not in a bureau, that's right. All right, thank you.
3372.00 3391.52 speaker3  he remembers the name of the color of lipstick that he found in her purse.
3390.24 3420.56 speaker2  And we turn and walk. And your arm too, right? We have arms. You're also, you're- Two of them.
3417.08 3429.84 speaker3  A little drip of piss falls off the barrel of the gun. I was holding the gun while I pissed
3427.68 3441.92 speaker4  and it just got a little bit on there.
3439.36 3445.60 speaker2  She stops in her tracks silently.
3444.76 3454.44 speaker3  I thought we were gonna- I said we knew where we were going. Are we going to Merle's office?
3452.76 3480.44 speaker2  They're all upstairs. The offices are all empty. They all seem to be upstairs. Just like last night, if you remember. Bradley Allen came down from that room and based on what she said here, she's saying like they're upstairs. Yeah, we go upstairs. Okay. You get to the conference room. It's double doors, double wooden doors, labeled Aldermen Conference Room.
3479.32 3487.40 speaker3  Should we knock?
3486.40 3573.04 speaker2  And I knock anyway. You knock as you walk in. when you're ambushing a bunch of Aldermen. because as you open the door, you notice presumably what the conference table was in the middle of the room has been hacked into pieces. And those pieces have been put up, basically boarding up the walls. All the bookshelves are turned over. The bookshelves are also used to block the windows. There's very little light coming into this room. And in the center of the room, occupying almost half the floor is a big pile of goo. And that big pile of goo has about eight bodies extending out of it. You see legs kind of coming out of the bottom, some arms, a few heads. They look like suited humans, just stuck in this pile of goo. And this is a metallic goo, very similar to the stuff from the water supply. And outside of that, the only other thing you see in this room is a very high-tech looking computer, up against the wall, plugged in, and also wired into the internet, in a giant pile of metallic goo.
3571.74 3574.54 speaker3  could we interrupt your meeting to ask you a few questions? I can't get high.
