Hey there y'all, it's your little ol' Wolfie boy again here on 694.2 PTBP

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
Now I know y'all have been missing me even though my last broadcast was only about a half hour ago

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
It is currently 11 a.m. on December the 6th

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
Today on Howlin' with Wolf we got ourselves an announcement from user totorosebangbus over on the subreddit

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Who posted about the show and tagged at pretending pod on Instagram

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000

Hello folks, Patreon here and I just want to say that I don't understand why you keep mentioning me

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
But I would like to thank you for the influx of money that has come my way recently due to this show

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
Thanks to you all, I am one step closer to getting my mushroom restaurant shiitake on me up and going in the city

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
I'd like to offer everyone a 15% coupon off for when we do open

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
Man, I can't wait to use that 15% off coupon to get me a steaming bowl of some of that dirt fungus

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
My favorite part of the mushroom is all that nasty mud

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I hope they don't wash them off too much

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
My producer has a note here

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Apparently a vast and overwhelming number of wolf pups are android users

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
This makes it all the more necessary to steal the iPhones from your parents' nightstands, your co-workers' desks, your children's hands

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
And write a 5 star review for pretending to be people on Tim Cook's bondage fetish machine

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Man, I can't stop thinking about all those delicious funky mud babies that I'm gonna get at that mushroom diner

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
The fungus that dwells as a morel

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Give me that mushroom stew, baby, and give it some extra stank

02:09.000 --> 02:18.000
Speaking of blasphemous smells like rot and greed and cirrhosis piss, it's the hemorrhoids of truth, it's the news

02:18.000 --> 02:28.000
John Lee Pettymore or Kevin Lee Pettymore or whatever he's called himself now had a vision and is now convinced he has the second sight

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
Keith Vigna desperately wanted to call the number left to them by Agent Kennedy

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Agent McKinley and Billy Harrison

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
Oh shit, Kennedy, McKinley, Billy William Harrison?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I definitely get it now

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
Clark Bishop was called out by a strange humanoid figure that just appeared on top of a nearby crypt

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
And taking us to that scene now, using the unnatural power to roll back time

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
It is kudzu with no backbone

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And now

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
You hear this massive noise erupt from behind you

03:25.000 --> 03:35.000
You see standing and materializing all at once on top of this crypt that is overlooking the clearing that you are standing in for the funeral of Ari Manstein

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
There is this figure, this large, like six and a half foot tall humanoid figure with translucent skin

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
It's got giant gaunt features wearing a black suit and it looks at Clark Bishop directly in the eyes and says

03:51.000 --> 04:03.000
Hello subject 15225181955018 please give me the book

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
How scared am I of this thing just by appearance?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Go ahead and first off, everyone roll sanity for me

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
It's like a man in black kind of thing, like a grey man

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Exactly

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
What are we doing? Sorry?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Everyone roll sanity for me

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Oh hell yeah, I got a 53

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I fail

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I have 14 so I fail

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I fail, 34 on a 20

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Everyone lose one sanity and did any of you roll over your power?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
No

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I did

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah, I rolled a 90

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I've rolled a 53 on a 50

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Also I need to borrow a pencil

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, same

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Shit

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Fuck

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Why did you have to get this nice soft desk? I can't write anything on it

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
This is like a test in Men in Black

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
There's no proper surface on which to write

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
What just happened? We lost one sanity?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
You each lost one sanity

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
And you and I both rolled over our power

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
That is correct, so keep that in mind

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Okay, very close

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
I've got a 19 with a breaking point of 18

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Oh boy, and Thomas?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
A 21 with a breaking point of 20

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Oh boy

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Luke, where's Keith at?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm at 13 with a breaking point of 8

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Alright, we are down to the end

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
I want it that way

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
That was tight

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
For $50 a month on our Patreon you can get the

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
The acapella

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
It's the PTBP acapella

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, that's hard to say, Justin has to say it like every week

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
PTBP, PTBP

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Anyway, we recorded a 45 track album

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Covering every boy band

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Well, we just do a lot of interpretations of Tell Me Why

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Tell Me Why

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
We've got Dixieland, we've got hip-hop

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
It took us a lot of takes, but we put them all on there

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
There's the Bread Street Boys

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Tell Me Why

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Oh my goodness

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Oh, we even have parodies

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Well, you have to get into parodies when you do that many versions

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Okay, so you each lose one sanity

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
And the figure, the towering gaunt figure

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Is just staring at you and it slowly begins to hold out

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
One of its overtly long hands

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Clark is going for his gun, but as he's doing it

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
He's yelling at the thing

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
What, what, what book, what are you?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And as I finish that, what are you, my gun is pointed at him

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Okie dokie

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Kevin John has very little left to live

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
And he just reaches out a hand

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
In greeting

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
You're about 20 yards, 20 feet away

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
You're gonna try to shake its hand

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I mean, it's got a long arm, but I don't know if it's that long

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
How long is the arm?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I would say the arm itself is 5 feet long

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Too long

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
What is Keith doing?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Keith runs behind a

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Anything

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
What do you call the above ground

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
A mausoleum?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
A mausoleum

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I run behind the closest mausoleum, pull my gun out and hide

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Alrighty

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
You hold out your gun pointed at it

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
I need you to roll power for me

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I pass a 50 on a 60

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Alright

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
You feel internal struggle within yourself

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
But overcome it in your ability to continue pointing this gun

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And the creature says

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Please, I would not like to ask again

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Please give me the book

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
I don't know what book you're talking about, evil thing

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
It turns its attention to Kevin John Lee Pettymore standing next

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
And it says

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
What is your name?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Roll power

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Pass, 20 on a 60

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
You have the ability to do whatever you would like to do here

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
As it asks you your name

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Well I'm Kevin John, that's a long story

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
What's your name?

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
43629 and I am here for the book

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
Well, we don't know what book you want but

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
I can feel the book is nearby

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Clark is looking for Keith

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Keith is hiding behind the closest mausoleum

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I peek around the corner

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Aim my gun at the guy and take a shot

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Oh shit

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Roll firearms

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
It's a 32 on a 70

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
Alrighty, roll a 2d10 for damage as you fire your small powerful pistol at this creature

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
That is a 4 and a 2, 6

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
4 and a 2, 6

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
You fire this gun and you wing it in the arm

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
And you see as the bullet flies through

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
This arm just kind of like dissipates and then begins to slowly reform

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
And before you have even smelled the smoke off of your firearm

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
This creature is standing next to you with its hand on your throat

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
And it lifts you up against the mausoleum

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And it says, what is your name?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Roll power

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
That's cocked

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
59 on a 50

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Keeping them honest

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
You immediately respond with your name

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Keith Vigna, what are you doing here?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I was here for the funeral

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Why are you shooting?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I'm just scared

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
It slowly places you back down on the ground and says

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Do not be scared

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And you are not

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh dope

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
This guy's cool

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
When it was not on the mausoleum and was then at Keith

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Did we see it do anything or did it just blink?

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
It's as if you stood completely still while it moved there in a normal fashion

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
But it was all sped up

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
This is likely what you think

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
The other perspective was

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Like what the audience saw

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Super duper cool

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I am only here for the book

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And then I will go

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
Subject 1522518195518

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
There will be no trouble

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Give him the book man

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I don't

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
John I don't know what book it wants

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I don't have a book

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I don't have a book

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I came here with the clothes on my back and a gun

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I don't have a book

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I don't have a book

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Oh shit I'm not near you sorry

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Keith you got a book?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
What?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Give him a book

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't read

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I don't have any books

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Clark is trying to address the thing

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Is it looking at me when I do?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Immediately

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
We do not possess a book

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
A book

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
This creature walks up to you

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
And begins tilting its head

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
To the side

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Back and forth like a dog

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
When you say squirrel

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
And it says

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
No book

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
No no book

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
What you do

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
It is here you are

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Subject

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
And it's kind of like

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Freaking out it's getting really upset

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
It doesn't understand

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Why you don't have this book

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
And especially why you're not just

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Giving it to it

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Where are you?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I'm here

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I'm at a cemetery in the city

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
The city cemetery

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I am where the book is

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
You should be here with

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
The book

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I walk over to

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Ari's coffin and open it up

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And see if there's a book in there

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Roll search

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
84 on a 40

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
You've merely horrified her

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Few remaining relatives

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
If anyone else is here from their funeral

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
They are fucked up

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
There's one old lady who has been sitting there

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
She can't leave

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
She's in a wheelchair and she just

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
On top of all this she sees you open her granddaddy's

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
She can barely see

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And she's completely deaf

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
She's just like where did everybody go?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Clark is kind of not

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
He's holding his gun up

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
To be not threatening now

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Can you describe

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
The book?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
What book is it?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
The book is necessary

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
For me to take

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Away from you

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
You are not to be in

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Possession of the book

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Your time with it

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Has come to an end

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Now and

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
We do not want you

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Using it any further

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I guess good news we don't have it anymore

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
That is not good news

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I need to bring it

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
What do you mean by

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
You're where it is but we're not where it is

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
The book is here

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
When?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I take another shot at this thing

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Damn it

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Keith

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Roll firearms

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
10 on a 70

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Roll damage 2d10

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Oh no

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
18

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
2 nines

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Ok

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
As you fire

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Through this thing

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Oh right

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Sorry you mentioned earlier that it went through

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Like dissipated so maybe you're not hurting it but anyway

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
The blasts

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Go through its body

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And it falls

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Never mind

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Every single part of its body

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Dissipates into smoke as it hits the ground

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Including its suit

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And it is no longer

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Standing or existing

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
In front of you I need all three of you

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
To roll sanity

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
58

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Fail

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Oh I pass

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
A fucking 14 on a 19

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Congratulations

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
98 on a 13

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Is that over your power?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
You each lose one sanity

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And Luke I need you to dive deep

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Ok so that's my breaking point

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
The next time that you

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Go unconscious you will wake up

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
With a new

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Disorder

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I run over to Clark

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And I tackle him

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
And I want to pin him down

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
And ask him

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
What fucking book was he talking about?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Alright I need you both to roll

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Unarmed combat

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Just to see who

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
See what happens here

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Keith

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
You're fucking fucked

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I rolled a 40

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
On a 40

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I rolled an 11

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
A crit success

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
But we're not contested

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Crit beats a 40

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Automatically

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Crit beats a regular success

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So as Keith comes running at Clark

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Clark you can describe what you want to do with his body

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
As he is yelling

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
At you about the book

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
What do you want to do with his body?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
If you're diving at me I'm just gonna try to spin you past me

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You just whiff on me

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Maybe I'll throw you to the ground

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Fuck Keith

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I'm looking up at you from the ground

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Eyes wide

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Probably pupils

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Dilated and I'm

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Shaking in like fear

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Keith, Keith it's alright

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
What's going on?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I just

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I start to approach him hands up

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Kind of like a calm down kind of gesture

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I approach him from behind

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And slap him twice on both cheeks

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
To try to calm him down

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I've calmed down a little bit but I get up

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
And I just start backing away from the both of you

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Keith it's gone, it's gone

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
It looks like you got it

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I don't

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Did you summon that thing here?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Summon that thing?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
How did you?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I don't know Keith I don't think I did

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I keep walking back

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And my back gets up

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Into one of the mausoleums and I kind of bump into it

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
And I still like looking back between

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
The both of you and I just

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I just faint

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Oh shit

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Keith

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Keith

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
John he's out, he's out cold

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Let me slap him

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
A few times to make sure

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Slap, slap Keith wakes up

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Let me slap him, I don't think he's quite awake

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Let me slap him two more times

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Slap, slap Here I'll give it a shot, slap

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
So I'm slapped awake and then

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Slap, slap five times

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
While I'm awake and I

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Keith you alright? I'm so sorry

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Did we slap you out of it?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
You know what?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Came over me

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm sorry

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I didn't

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
My heart is beating like a thousand miles a minute

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I'm sitting down

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I look up at both of them

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I'm really sorry

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Something in my brain just triggered

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I don't

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I'm really sorry I didn't mean to

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Attack you or accuse you but

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
That thing just fucked me up

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
What you did?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Oh

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I don't know

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
The alien thing yeah the

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
The gray man Was he gray?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Translucent He's a

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
He's a man in black right?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Did that

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Did that thing not remind you

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
A little bit of marfing glass?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Translucent skin

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Too big and small

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
At the same time Not enough lipstick

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
What the fuck are we dealing with?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Do you have

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Any idea what book he was talking about?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Fellas I mean I don't have

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Any book

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I did find a bunch

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Of papers and documents and books

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
At Jim Cook's house

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Maggie's father

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Maggie's father Maggie's father was part

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Of the circle of knowledge Did you find anything

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Books that

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
You think he might have been talking about

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Maybe Do you have them on you? No

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
No they're back at his house I just

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Left them there where I found them

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Maggie walked in on me so

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
You didn't pick up any way Maggie walked in on you

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
That's where she found me

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
At Jim's house

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So it turns out that

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Maggie's dad was in the circle of knowledge

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
As I was raveling through his papers I did find a leather

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Bound book that

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Boy it was

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
It was freaky deaky Like a grimoire

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Was there anything on the front of it?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
It was extremely grimoire-ish

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
It was leather bound

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
It was just the circle of knowledge

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
You didn't think that one super weird book

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
You found was the book that fellow was talking about?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I mean I didn't have it he kept asking for it

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I was racking my brain for books

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
That's the one that just now came up

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Are you sure you don't have it? I don't have it

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Clark I know where it is

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Is it on your person right now?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
No but we can go get it

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Clark

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Alright you got me Do you have it?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
No I don't have it

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Well so

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
After I shot this thing

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Did it dissipate too? Yes

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Did you flip through that book?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Did you see what was in it?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
The thing was that book it was freaky deaky

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I could only open it to the last page

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
And I mean I could only

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Open it Was it like

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Magnets almost?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
That's what it felt like

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Magnets you nailed it What did the last thing say?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
The last page was

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
It had this drawing

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
This hooded figure with light

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Coming out of its mouth but it wasn't actual light

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
It was just drawn

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
And written over the top of that

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Over and over and over the entire page

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
It said

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
It is only through death that he may rise again

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
That's all I could see

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
So the drawing

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
What did it look like?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
It was like black

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Like if you were to draw black scribbles

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
In the shape of a hooded figure

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And then leave the middle of it

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Emanating light out of its mouth

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I used an eraser there

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
In that part

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Clark's an artist

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Whoever drew this picture

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Clearly had some skill

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
They knew how to use negative space

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
They had a command of negative space

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
That is unrivaled in contention

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I saw the contention

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
High school art programs

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Fucking yearly fucking exhibition

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
There's no motherfucking kids in that class

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Who can do that shit?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
None of them have command of negative space

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Fucking balance, color palettes

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Point of view

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Perspective

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
As much as I love talking about artwork right now

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I think we should get the fuck out of this cemetery

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
That's my whole point is that it's fucking terrible

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
If we take it as fact that that's the book it was looking for

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I might need to tell you a little more about it

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah, tell us about this

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I'd love to hear about it

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
This grimoire

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
It's some kind of

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Word text of some sort for the circle of knowledge

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And uh

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
It has to do with the revelation

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Of the overseer

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
What does that mean?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Yeah, expand on that

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
From what I've gathered

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Essentially the circle of knowledge

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Is hoping to

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
The overseer's maybe a good guy

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Who lays peace on the world

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Or something like that

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Anyway, it's not the big thing I saw

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
The big thing I saw was a scary thing

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
That maybe combats it or something

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
There's some reason they want the overseer

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Is this the creature you were talking about?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
It's not, that's what I mean

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
The overseer is maybe the good guy

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And the thing I saw is the bad guy

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I don't know, I'm piecing it together as I go

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Well so, where is this book right now?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
It's at Jim Cook's house

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Can I take him there? Do I remember how to get there?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Would I remember?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I could bring you guys there if you wanted to see it

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Is that in contention?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
It's in the city

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
John, I'm remembering something about what I saw

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
When I was John

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
Keith, you got dragged off by those fish men

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
But

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Clark

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
Old you looked a lot like the fellow you described in that book

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
Robed and with light coming out of the mouth

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Oh shit

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Old Clark?

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah, old Clark made this Clark come back to life

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Wait, I've been meaning to ask you

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
Where did you get them old fashioned contention PD digs?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
The circle had them

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
The circle had a beautiful rim that gave me anything I wanted

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
I think that was more mechanical than me

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
They gave you retro like off

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Keith is looking at both of them

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I have no fucking idea what you're talking about right now

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
What do you mean by old Clark?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I believe Keith Vigna was

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Fingers deep into boiling water

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Fishing for crawdads when you guys were discussing this one on one

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I don't know what you mean by old Clark

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
I was trying to figure out how the hell I'm around since

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Kevin seemed to know that you were around

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I asked him

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
How am I alive?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
And Kevin let me know that he thinks he saw

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Old me is what he said

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Old you? What does that mean?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Did you say plural?

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
It was an older Clark

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
And he was wearing them ropes

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And his mouth lit up

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
Just like the figure he was just talking about

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
In the grimoire

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Like a future version of Clark?

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
Or like a non-bubblegum tree Clark?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Old Clark

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Aged

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Aged Clark

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Aged Clark

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Clark in the future

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Old Clark

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
I know what old Clark means but is it a future Clark or is it a

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
This is the first I'm hearing about this I'm super confused

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
I'm looking for definitive answers in the middle of this horrifying circumstance

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Well it seems like both of you know

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Have heard of this before

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
We just know

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I mean I don't know about Kevin but I just know that

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
That apparently old Clark

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Dragged me into a room or something like that

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Drug me away

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
An older version of you drug you away?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Now what happened is

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
An older version of you

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Showed up, that light came out of his mouth

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And he reached into you

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
And then you both disappeared

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Oh

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Well that makes total sense

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I get it

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
So we can move on

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Well thank you for clarifying

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
That does jive

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I mean if the circle of knowledge

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Has something to do with the light mouth in the book

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And then I woke up and then

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Maggie found me and took me into the circle of knowledge

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
It sounds like they orchestrated it in some way

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
To bring me into the fold

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I'll accept that for now

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
If you said I blipped out of existence

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Maybe old me blipped into existence

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Well if you blipped out of existence

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Don't you think maybe

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Is that something like Stan Manstein did?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Kinda similar yeah

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Oh nice

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Did you see them blip out?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Was it the same way that Stan Manstein blipped out?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Not quite

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Did you see where old me came from?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
No you was

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
You was just approaching

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Your dead body

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Old you was

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
And then you did the thing and then you guys were gone

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
Hey well you look good buddy

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
You're looking good yeah

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Thanks John

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
If none of us know really

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Let's turn back to the task at hand

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Somebody's trying to get this book

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Do you think we should try to go

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Find that book?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I mean

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
We can drive there

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
We can certainly go and get it

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I don't understand its significance is the only thing

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
It was asking for it

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
That's the book that it wanted

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I mean we can grab it just to make sure it's in our possession

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
It's in the city

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Let's get it and then let's go deal with Marvin Glass

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
We ought to drive over there get the book

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
On the way we can call the

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Quote unquote FBI

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Oh good idea

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
On the way over there and then we get the book and then

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
You think we go to Glass?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Yeah I think we settle business in the city

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I think so too

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
So we head toward the book we call the FBI

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And then after that we do the Chewbacca plan with me

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
We take care of business

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I like it

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
And break

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Joe roll alertness for me is

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Clark has the highest

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Alertness in the group

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Damn

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
What's a DM4 but for wrecking plans

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Fuck you Seth

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Oh that's a hella fail

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
What was I rolling on?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Anyway alertness

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
It's a 96 on a 70

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Well that is a fail indeed

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Well that was fun with your plans

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
That will certainly happen right now

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
We're already out of the cemetery goodbye

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
So wait how did

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Both of you arrive here

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I drove the police car that we took

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
To Glass

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Oh nice the circle provided me a car

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Silver Honda Accord

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Cool okay

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
I came with Rosemary

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Well do you guys want to take the two cars

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Or do you just want to hop in the police cruiser

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Hold on real quick

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I haven't checked on where Rosemary

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Is this whole time

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Are you with Rosemary?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I was she was on Overwatch

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
On one of these mausoleums

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
You see her anywhere? She was here

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Who's got the best search between the three of you

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I have 40

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
50 I think Clark has the best search

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
No I don't have the best search

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
It's under S

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I have the baseline I have the 20%

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Oh shit I have the best search

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Alright Thomas go ahead and roll

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Top's bad at searching

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Okay you look up exactly where she

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Was and you don't see her

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Looking around you might even

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Put your fingers on top of one of these mausoleums

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
And lift yourself up and looking around

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I do that

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
You see that she's not on any of them

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
But what you do see

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Is two city police officers

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Heading straight your way

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Hey boys

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Rosemary's not up here but

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Two city PDR

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
They're hoofing it our way

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
We might want to fucking skedaddle

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Okay guys follow me back to the police cruiser

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Let's get the fuck out of here

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Take the same car? Yeah

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I think my police cruiser is a little better than your civic

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
So let's get the fuck out of here

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I wait for John Lee Pettymore

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
To get down from the mausoleum

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
And I start booking it towards

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Where I parked the police cruiser

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Okay are you guys just going out the same way you came in

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Through the normal route

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
That one would take to get from the parking lot

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
To this clearing?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Taking directly the route away from the cops

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Like straight away from them

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Even if we have to double back

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
We're taking the route that will get us out of sight

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Of the fuzz

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Okay I'm going to go ahead and roll real quick

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
As you guys begin to recollect yourselves

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And head out through the back way

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
You hear

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Freeze! City PD!

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
We are now in combat order

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Thank you

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I turn around

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Everything's fine fellas

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I think you have a gun in your hand still?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I mean

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I don't know if I would have had that still in my hand

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Everything's fine here fellas

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Contention PD

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
We're getting out of your hair

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Your jurisdiction is far away from here sir

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Keep your hands in the air

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Where we can see them

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I was gesturing to the coffin

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Which is open

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Because I had opened it up

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
We lost a good one in the contention ranks

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I'm kind of frankly disappointed that you're crashing it like this

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
They both have their guns up

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
And they say

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Yeah we heard there were some shots

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
That went off during the funeral here

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I got it under control

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
It was the 21 gun salute you mother fuckers

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I need you to roll persuade for me Clark

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Oh I pass

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I fucking pass a 16 on a 40

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Alright the police officers

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Put their guns down and they say

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I'm glad to see that you got everything under control

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
And they look at

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Keith who's wearing just these absurd

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Clothes

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Is he the one who did it?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Nope he's with us he's a member of the Contention PD as well

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Traditional Contention PD morning clothes

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I pull my

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Contention police badge out and I say

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
When I hung out with Ari

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
We always like to go boating

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
These officers

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
They want to know more

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
They start walking up toward you guys

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
And they're like alright well uh

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Let's get this down here

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And they pull out a notepad

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And they're like we need to take statements from all of you

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
I want to move up to intercept him

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Okay you do so

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Does Kevin have any kind of identifying information on him

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Anything that ties him to Marvin Glass

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
You would probably have

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah you would probably have

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Like a dirty dog keypad

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Something like that

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Okay I pull the dirty dog grooming keypad

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Out of my chain and I'm like boys

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I don't think we need to have this conversation

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I'm with Mr. Glass

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Oh and they kind of look at each other

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Oh oh oh

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And then they start whispering to each other

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
And

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
We are certainly sorry

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Please give our deepest apologies

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
To Mr. Glass and

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Actually they cover up their names

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
And badge numbers

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
And they turn

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
And they're like we are so sorry to bother you

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Also Rip your fallen

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Police officer sorry to hear about that

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Sir again

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Deepest apologies please don't say anything

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
To Mr. Glass we weren't even here

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
That's god damn right

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And they turn around and they

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Hoof it

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Kevin I thought that would work

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
What's the keychain do

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Oh that's a fun one so the keychain

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
The dirty dog grooming keychains

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
They like open up the door to the fucking

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Den of Sin and maybe some other

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Places in his things

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
The Den of Sin?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Oh the Den of Sin you know where we were

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Held as cage fighters

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I saw a whole rowdy

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Bunch of degenerates

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Open up a door on the floor

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Just in the fucking street

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Dirty dog grooming keychains

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
That's what John Peters had on him right

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Yeah that's exactly what John Peters had on him

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
And John Peters we know hung out

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
In the Den of Sin

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Well he was a dirty degenerate that couldn't

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Bet for shit

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Am I the only one who heard that?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
The Den of Sin is a name I don't know but I do

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Oh that's where we were

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
The Den of Sin was the name of the place we were at

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Yeah

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
We found those bedding stubs at John Peters house

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
That tied him to the place

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
And John Peters he was telling a big story

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
He was saying he was all important

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
There wasn't really happening for him

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
There's more to that than I remember

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Well as these police officers

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Walk away I look

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Back at both of my

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I would say former co-workers

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
And now I think we're

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Co-workers now again but in a different

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Capacity and I say

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Hey well I'm parked over here

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
As you guys begin leaving the

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Funeral do you want to do anything

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Here in the clearing before

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
You head out there are three

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Corpses of basically androids

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
That are laying out

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
And then also the body of Ari

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Manstein is in her coffin

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
But not in a tomb

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I believe the funeral might have ended with

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Placing the coffin in the tomb

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I want to pay my respects to the androids

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
And

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And then we probably

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Need to get on that crank and lower Ari

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Down

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Keith walks over to the corral fish boil again

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
And grabs three four more

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Lose a hit point

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I think it's cooled down by this point

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Whoever was manning the fire

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Has been gone for a minute

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
These are all above ground mausoleums

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Around us right? Is there one that's obviously

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
The one she was heading toward?

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
There is one with an open door

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Tomb doors to the mausoleum

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
That is right nearby

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I grab one of the things that the pallbearers hold

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
The bars on the side of the coffin

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Let's get her rested

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Go ahead and grab the other side

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
You pick up the coffin

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Of Ari Manstein

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
And you begin walking her

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Into her crypt

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
That she will stay in

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
For the rest of her time

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Hold on, hold on, hold on

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Before we take her in here

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Let's look through this coffin

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I think Keith

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I saw Keith run over there earlier

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
We've done this twice already

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I looked for the book

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
And then I also opened it up earlier

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
To see if she was even in there

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
She was? She is in there

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
And there is no book in there

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Oh good, okay let's bury her

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I grab one of the bars

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
And I close the coffin

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
And I think the three of us

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Start walking into the mausoleum

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
The mausoleum is

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Completely dark

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
And as you walk in

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
You hear a voice

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Clark, it's a voice

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
You might recognize

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Maybe a little bit quicker

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Than the other two

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Because it sounds

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
So much like you

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
And looking up

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
You see these little sparks

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Of light as a voice

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Rings out chanting

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
In the darkness

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
You see these flashes and sparks

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Ignited seemingly by this

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Steady chant

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
It emanates a piece of parchment

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Held by an old Clark

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Bishop wearing a dark cloak

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
That is covering almost all of his

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Face as light begins

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Emanating from his mouth

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
And the words he's chanting

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Begin to ignite

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
And the fire lifts off the page

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
And begins to dance in a circle

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Around you

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Looking up

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
You all see his lifted hands

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Are cut open

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Pouring onto the ground

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
And actually go ahead and roll

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Sanity for me

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Fail

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Over my power

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Or constitution

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I fail a 76 on a 19

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I got a 1

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Baby

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Alrighty, so

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Luke, Keith, he loses

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
No sanity whatsoever

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
He rolled a 1, correct?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
And then Thomas, John

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Loses one sanity

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Clark, you also lose one sanity

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
So this blood is

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Pooling on the ground

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Clark and John, both failing their sanity

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Checks, both drop their load

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Of the coffin, leaving Keith

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
As the sole support

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
And the coffin hits the ground

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Ari's corpse, limply plopping

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Into the muddy blood puddle

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
In this dusty

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Cold crypt

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Alternatively, this

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Logically sashaying fire

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Surrounds you and bathes

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
All three of you

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
In a comforting, warm

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Light that feels familiar

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
But the look on Joe's face says

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Otherwise

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I am diving directly at old Clark

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Trying to get him to the ground

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
And as you do so, you grab

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
On to an empty cloak

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
And hit your face directly

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
On the back of this

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Mausoleum

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
And you just hear his

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Clark, that's the guy I was talking about

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
How can you

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Have enough

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Drowning out

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
All I know

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Is

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
There's no

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I don't know

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I don't know

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I don't know

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I don't know

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I don't know

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I don't know

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I don't know
