Hey there y'all, it's your little ol' Wolfie boy again here on 694.2 PTBP

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now I know y'all have been missing me even though my last broadcast was only about a half hour ago

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It is currently 11 a.m. on December the 6th

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Today on Howlin' with Wolf we got ourselves an announcement from user totorosebangbus over on the subreddit

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000

Hello folks, Patreon here and I just want to say that I don't understand why you keep mentioning me

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But I would like to thank you for the influx of money that has come my way recently due to this show

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Thanks to you all, I am one step closer to getting my mushroom restaurant shiitake on me up and going in the city

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'd like to offer everyone a 15% coupon off for when we do open

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Man, I can't wait to use that 15% off coupon to get me a steaming bowl of some of that dirt fungus

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
My favorite part of the mushroom is all that nasty mud

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I hope they don't wash them off too much

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
My producer has a note here

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Apparently a vast and overwhelming number of wolf pups are android users

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This makes it all the more necessary to steal the iPhones from your parents' nightstands, your co-workers' desks, your children's hands

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And write a 5 star review for pretending to be people on Tim Cook's bondage fetish machine

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Man, I can't stop thinking about all those delicious funky mud babies that I'm gonna get at that mushroom diner

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fungus that dwells as a morel

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Give me that mushroom stew, baby, and give it some extra stank

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Speaking of blasphemous smells like rot and greed and cirrhosis piss, it's the hemorrhoids of truth, it's the news

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
John Lee Pettymore or Kevin Lee Pettymore or whatever he's called himself now had a vision and is now convinced he has the second sight

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Keith Vigna desperately wanted to call the number left to them by Agent Kennedy

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Agent McKinley and Billy Harrison

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh shit, Kennedy, McKinley, Billy William Harrison?

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I definitely get it now

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Clark Bishop was called out by a strange humanoid figure that just appeared on top of a nearby crypt

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And taking us to that scene now, using the unnatural power to roll back time

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It is kudzu with no backbone

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And now

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You hear this massive noise erupt from behind you

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You see standing and materializing all at once on top of this crypt that is overlooking the clearing that you are standing in for the funeral of Ari Manstein

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There is this figure, this large, like six and a half foot tall humanoid figure with translucent skin

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's got giant gaunt features wearing a black suit and it looks at Clark Bishop directly in the eyes and says

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hello subject 15225181955018 please give me the book

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How scared am I of this thing just by appearance?

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Go ahead and first off, everyone roll sanity for me

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's like a man in black kind of thing, like a grey man

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Exactly

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What are we doing? Sorry?

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Everyone roll sanity for me

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh hell yeah, I got a 53

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I fail

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I have 14 so I fail

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I fail, 34 on a 20

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Everyone lose one sanity and did any of you roll over your power?

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I did

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, I rolled a 90

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I've rolled a 53 on a 50

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Also I need to borrow a pencil

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, same

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Shit

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Fuck

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why did you have to get this nice soft desk? I can't write anything on it

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is like a test in Men in Black

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There's no proper surface on which to write

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What just happened? We lost one sanity?

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You each lost one sanity

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And you and I both rolled over our power

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That is correct, so keep that in mind

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay, very close

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I've got a 19 with a breaking point of 18

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh boy, and Thomas?

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
A 21 with a breaking point of 20

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh boy

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Luke, where's Keith at?

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm at 13 with a breaking point of 8

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Alright, we are down to the end

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I want it that way

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That was tight

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
For $50 a month on our Patreon you can get the

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The acapella

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's the PTBP acapella

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, that's hard to say, Justin has to say it like every week

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
PTBP, PTBP

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Anyway, we recorded a 45 track album

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Covering every boy band

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, we just do a lot of interpretations of Tell Me Why

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Tell Me Why

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We've got Dixieland, we've got hip-hop

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It took us a lot of takes, but we put them all on there

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's the Bread Street Boys

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Tell Me Why

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh my goodness

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh, we even have parodies

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well, you have to get into parodies when you do that many versions

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, so you each lose one sanity

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And the figure, the towering gaunt figure

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is just staring at you and it slowly begins to hold out

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
One of its overtly long hands

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Clark is going for his gun, but as he's doing it

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He's yelling at the thing

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What, what, what book, what are you?

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And as I finish that, what are you, my gun is pointed at him

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okie dokie

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Kevin John has very little left to live

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And he just reaches out a hand

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
In greeting

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're about 20 yards, 20 feet away

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're gonna try to shake its hand

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I mean, it's got a long arm, but I don't know if it's that long

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How long is the arm?

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I would say the arm itself is 5 feet long

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Too long

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What is Keith doing?

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Keith runs behind a

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Anything

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What do you call the above ground

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
A mausoleum?

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
A mausoleum

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I run behind the closest mausoleum, pull my gun out and hide

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Alrighty

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You hold out your gun pointed at it

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I need you to roll power for me

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I pass a 50 on a 60

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Alright

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You feel internal struggle within yourself

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But overcome it in your ability to continue pointing this gun

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And the creature says

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Please, I would not like to ask again

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Please give me the book

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know what book you're talking about, evil thing

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It turns its attention to Kevin John Lee Pettymore standing next

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And it says

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What is your name?

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Roll power

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Pass, 20 on a 60

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You have the ability to do whatever you would like to do here

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
As it asks you your name

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well I'm Kevin John, that's a long story

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What's your name?

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
43629 and I am here for the book

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, we don't know what book you want but

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can feel the book is nearby

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Clark is looking for Keith

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Keith is hiding behind the closest mausoleum

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I peek around the corner

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Aim my gun at the guy and take a shot

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh shit

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Roll firearms

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a 32 on a 70

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Alrighty, roll a 2d10 for damage as you fire your small powerful pistol at this creature

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That is a 4 and a 2, 6

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
4 and a 2, 6

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You fire this gun and you wing it in the arm

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And you see as the bullet flies through

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This arm just kind of like dissipates and then begins to slowly reform

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And before you have even smelled the smoke off of your firearm

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This creature is standing next to you with its hand on your throat

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And it lifts you up against the mausoleum

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And it says, what is your name?

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Roll power

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's cocked

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
59 on a 50

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Keeping them honest

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You immediately respond with your name

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Keith Vigna, what are you doing here?

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I was here for the funeral

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why are you shooting?

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm just scared

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It slowly places you back down on the ground and says

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Do not be scared

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And you are not

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh dope

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This guy's cool

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
When it was not on the mausoleum and was then at Keith

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Did we see it do anything or did it just blink?

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's as if you stood completely still while it moved there in a normal fashion

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But it was all sped up

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is likely what you think

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The other perspective was

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Like what the audience saw

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Super duper cool

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I am only here for the book

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And then I will go

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Subject 1522518195518

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There will be no trouble

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Give him the book man

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
John I don't know what book it wants

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't have a book

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't have a book

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I came here with the clothes on my back and a gun

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't have a book

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't have a book

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh shit I'm not near you sorry

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Keith you got a book?

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What?

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Give him a book

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't read

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't have any books

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Clark is trying to address the thing

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Is it looking at me when I do?

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Immediately

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We do not possess a book

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
A book

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This creature walks up to you

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And begins tilting its head

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
To the side

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Back and forth like a dog

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
When you say squirrel

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And it says

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No book

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No no book

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What you do

210
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It is here you are

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Subject

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And it's kind of like

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Freaking out it's getting really upset

214
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It doesn't understand

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Why you don't have this book

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And especially why you're not just

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Giving it to it

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Where are you?

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm here

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm at a cemetery in the city

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The city cemetery

222
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I am where the book is

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You should be here with

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The book

225
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I walk over to

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Ari's coffin and open it up

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And see if there's a book in there

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Roll search

229
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
84 on a 40

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You've merely horrified her

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Few remaining relatives

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If anyone else is here from their funeral

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They are fucked up

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
There's one old lady who has been sitting there

235
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
She can't leave

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She's in a wheelchair and she just

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
On top of all this she sees you open her granddaddy's

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
She can barely see

239
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And she's completely deaf

240
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
She's just like where did everybody go?

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Clark is kind of not

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He's holding his gun up

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
To be not threatening now

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Can you describe

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The book?

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What book is it?

247
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The book is necessary

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
For me to take

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Away from you

250
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You are not to be in

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Possession of the book

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Your time with it

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Has come to an end

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Now and

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We do not want you

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Using it any further

257
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I guess good news we don't have it anymore

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That is not good news

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I need to bring it

260
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What do you mean by

261
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're where it is but we're not where it is

262
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The book is here

263
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When?

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I take another shot at this thing

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Damn it

266
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Keith

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Roll firearms

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
10 on a 70

269
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Roll damage 2d10

270
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh no

271
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
18

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
2 nines

273
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Ok

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
As you fire

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Through this thing

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh right

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Sorry you mentioned earlier that it went through

278
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Like dissipated so maybe you're not hurting it but anyway

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The blasts

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Go through its body

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And it falls

282
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Never mind

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Every single part of its body

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Dissipates into smoke as it hits the ground

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Including its suit

286
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And it is no longer

287
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Standing or existing

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
In front of you I need all three of you

289
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
To roll sanity

290
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
58

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Fail

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh I pass

293
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
A fucking 14 on a 19

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Congratulations

295
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
98 on a 13

296
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Is that over your power?

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You each lose one sanity

298
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And Luke I need you to dive deep

299
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Ok so that's my breaking point

300
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The next time that you

301
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Go unconscious you will wake up

302
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
With a new

303
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Disorder

304
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I run over to Clark

305
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And I tackle him

306
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I want to pin him down

307
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And ask him

308
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What fucking book was he talking about?

309
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Alright I need you both to roll

310
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Unarmed combat

311
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Just to see who

312
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
See what happens here

313
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Keith

314
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're fucking fucked

315
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I rolled a 40

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
On a 40

317
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I rolled an 11

318
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
A crit success

319
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But we're not contested

320
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Crit beats a 40

321
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Automatically

322
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Crit beats a regular success

323
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So as Keith comes running at Clark

324
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Clark you can describe what you want to do with his body

325
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
As he is yelling

326
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
At you about the book

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What do you want to do with his body?

328
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If you're diving at me I'm just gonna try to spin you past me

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You just whiff on me

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Maybe I'll throw you to the ground

331
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Fuck Keith

332
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm looking up at you from the ground

333
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Eyes wide

334
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Probably pupils

335
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Dilated and I'm

336
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Shaking in like fear

337
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me

338
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Keith, Keith it's alright

339
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What's going on?

340
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I just

341
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I start to approach him hands up

342
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Kind of like a calm down kind of gesture

343
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I approach him from behind

344
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And slap him twice on both cheeks

345
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
To try to calm him down

346
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I've calmed down a little bit but I get up

347
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And I just start backing away from the both of you

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Keith it's gone, it's gone

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It looks like you got it

350
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't

351
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Did you summon that thing here?

352
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Summon that thing?

353
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
How did you?

354
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't know Keith I don't think I did

355
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I keep walking back

356
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And my back gets up

357
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Into one of the mausoleums and I kind of bump into it

358
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I still like looking back between

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The both of you and I just

360
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I just faint

361
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh shit

362
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Keith

363
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Keith

364
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
John he's out, he's out cold

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Let me slap him

366
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
A few times to make sure

367
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Slap, slap Keith wakes up

368
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let me slap him, I don't think he's quite awake

369
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let me slap him two more times

370
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Slap, slap Here I'll give it a shot, slap

371
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So I'm slapped awake and then

372
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Slap, slap five times

373
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
While I'm awake and I

374
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Keith you alright? I'm so sorry

375
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Did we slap you out of it?

376
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You know what?

377
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Came over me

378
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry

379
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I didn't

380
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
My heart is beating like a thousand miles a minute

381
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sitting down

382
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I look up at both of them

383
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm really sorry

384
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Something in my brain just triggered

385
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't

386
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm really sorry I didn't mean to

387
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Attack you or accuse you but

388
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That thing just fucked me up

389
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What you did?

390
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh

391
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't know

392
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The alien thing yeah the

393
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The gray man Was he gray?

394
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Translucent He's a

395
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He's a man in black right?

396
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Did that

397
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Did that thing not remind you

398
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
A little bit of marfing glass?

399
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Translucent skin

400
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Too big and small

401
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
At the same time Not enough lipstick

402
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What the fuck are we dealing with?

403
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Do you have

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Any idea what book he was talking about?

405
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Fellas I mean I don't have

406
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Any book

407
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I did find a bunch

408
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Of papers and documents and books

409
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
At Jim Cook's house

410
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Maggie's father

411
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Maggie's father Maggie's father was part

412
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Of the circle of knowledge Did you find anything

413
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Books that

414
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You think he might have been talking about

415
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Maybe Do you have them on you? No

416
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No they're back at his house I just

417
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Left them there where I found them

418
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Maggie walked in on me so

419
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You didn't pick up any way Maggie walked in on you

420
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's where she found me

421
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
At Jim's house

422
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So it turns out that

423
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Maggie's dad was in the circle of knowledge

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
As I was raveling through his papers I did find a leather

425
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Bound book that

426
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Boy it was

427
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It was freaky deaky Like a grimoire

428
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Was there anything on the front of it?

429
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It was extremely grimoire-ish

430
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It was leather bound

431
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It was just the circle of knowledge

432
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You didn't think that one super weird book

433
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You found was the book that fellow was talking about?

434
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I mean I didn't have it he kept asking for it

435
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I was racking my brain for books

436
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's the one that just now came up

437
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Are you sure you don't have it? I don't have it

438
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Clark I know where it is

439
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Is it on your person right now?

440
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
No but we can go get it

441
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Clark

442
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Alright you got me Do you have it?

443
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No I don't have it

444
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well so

445
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
After I shot this thing

446
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Did it dissipate too? Yes

447
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Did you flip through that book?

448
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Did you see what was in it?

449
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The thing was that book it was freaky deaky

450
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I could only open it to the last page

451
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And I mean I could only

452
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Open it Was it like

453
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Magnets almost?

454
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's what it felt like

455
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Magnets you nailed it What did the last thing say?

456
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The last page was

457
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It had this drawing

458
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This hooded figure with light

459
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Coming out of its mouth but it wasn't actual light

460
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It was just drawn

461
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And written over the top of that

462
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Over and over and over the entire page

463
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It said

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It is only through death that he may rise again

465
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's all I could see

466
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So the drawing

467
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What did it look like?

468
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It was like black

469
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Like if you were to draw black scribbles

470
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
In the shape of a hooded figure

471
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And then leave the middle of it

472
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Emanating light out of its mouth

473
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I used an eraser there

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
In that part

475
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Clark's an artist

476
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Whoever drew this picture

477
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Clearly had some skill

478
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
They knew how to use negative space

479
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
They had a command of negative space

480
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That is unrivaled in contention

481
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I saw the contention

482
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
High school art programs

483
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Fucking yearly fucking exhibition

484
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
There's no motherfucking kids in that class

485
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Who can do that shit?

486
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
None of them have command of negative space

487
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Fucking balance, color palettes

488
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Point of view

489
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Perspective

490
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
As much as I love talking about artwork right now

491
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I think we should get the fuck out of this cemetery

492
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's my whole point is that it's fucking terrible

493
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If we take it as fact that that's the book it was looking for

494
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I might need to tell you a little more about it

495
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah, tell us about this

496
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'd love to hear about it

497
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This grimoire

498
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's some kind of

499
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Word text of some sort for the circle of knowledge

500
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And uh

501
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It has to do with the revelation

502
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Of the overseer

503
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What does that mean?

504
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah, expand on that

505
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
From what I've gathered

506
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Essentially the circle of knowledge

507
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Is hoping to

508
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The overseer's maybe a good guy

509
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Who lays peace on the world

510
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Or something like that

511
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Anyway, it's not the big thing I saw

512
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The big thing I saw was a scary thing

513
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That maybe combats it or something

514
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There's some reason they want the overseer

515
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Is this the creature you were talking about?

516
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's not, that's what I mean

517
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The overseer is maybe the good guy

518
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And the thing I saw is the bad guy

519
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't know, I'm piecing it together as I go

520
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Well so, where is this book right now?

521
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's at Jim Cook's house

522
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Can I take him there? Do I remember how to get there?

523
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Would I remember?

524
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I could bring you guys there if you wanted to see it

525
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Is that in contention?

526
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's in the city

527
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
John, I'm remembering something about what I saw

528
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When I was John

529
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Keith, you got dragged off by those fish men

530
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But

531
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Clark

532
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Old you looked a lot like the fellow you described in that book

533
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Robed and with light coming out of the mouth

534
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh shit

535
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Old Clark?

536
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah, old Clark made this Clark come back to life

537
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Wait, I've been meaning to ask you

538
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Where did you get them old fashioned contention PD digs?

539
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The circle had them

540
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The circle had a beautiful rim that gave me anything I wanted

541
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I think that was more mechanical than me

542
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They gave you retro like off

543
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Keith is looking at both of them

544
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I have no fucking idea what you're talking about right now

545
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh

546
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What do you mean by old Clark?

547
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I believe Keith Vigna was

548
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Fingers deep into boiling water

549
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Fishing for crawdads when you guys were discussing this one on one

550
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't know what you mean by old Clark

551
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I was trying to figure out how the hell I'm around since

552
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Kevin seemed to know that you were around

553
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I asked him

554
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
How am I alive?

555
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And Kevin let me know that he thinks he saw

556
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Old me is what he said

557
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Old you? What does that mean?

558
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Did you say plural?

559
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It was an older Clark

560
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And he was wearing them ropes

561
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And his mouth lit up

562
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Just like the figure he was just talking about

563
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
In the grimoire

564
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Like a future version of Clark?

565
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Or like a non-bubblegum tree Clark?

566
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Old Clark

567
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Aged

568
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Aged Clark

569
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Aged Clark

570
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Clark in the future

571
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Old Clark

572
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I know what old Clark means but is it a future Clark or is it a

573
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is the first I'm hearing about this I'm super confused

574
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm looking for definitive answers in the middle of this horrifying circumstance

575
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Well it seems like both of you know

576
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Have heard of this before

577
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
We just know

578
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I mean I don't know about Kevin but I just know that

579
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That apparently old Clark

580
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Dragged me into a room or something like that

581
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Drug me away

582
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
An older version of you drug you away?

583
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Now what happened is

584
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
An older version of you

585
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Showed up, that light came out of his mouth

586
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And he reached into you

587
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And then you both disappeared

588
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh

589
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Well that makes total sense

590
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I get it

591
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So we can move on

592
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Well thank you for clarifying

593
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That does jive

594
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I mean if the circle of knowledge

595
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Has something to do with the light mouth in the book

596
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And then I woke up and then

597
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Maggie found me and took me into the circle of knowledge

598
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It sounds like they orchestrated it in some way

599
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
To bring me into the fold

600
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'll accept that for now

601
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
If you said I blipped out of existence

602
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Maybe old me blipped into existence

603
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Well if you blipped out of existence

604
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't you think maybe

605
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Is that something like Stan Manstein did?

606
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Kinda similar yeah

607
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh nice

608
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Did you see them blip out?

609
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Was it the same way that Stan Manstein blipped out?

610
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Not quite

611
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Did you see where old me came from?

612
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
No you was

613
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You was just approaching

614
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Your dead body

615
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Old you was

616
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And then you did the thing and then you guys were gone

617
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Hey well you look good buddy

618
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You're looking good yeah

619
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Thanks John

620
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
If none of us know really

621
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Let's turn back to the task at hand

622
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Somebody's trying to get this book

623
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Do you think we should try to go

624
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Find that book?

625
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I mean

626
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We can drive there

627
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We can certainly go and get it

628
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't understand its significance is the only thing

629
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It was asking for it

630
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That's the book that it wanted

631
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I mean we can grab it just to make sure it's in our possession

632
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's in the city

633
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Let's get it and then let's go deal with Marvin Glass

634
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
We ought to drive over there get the book

635
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
On the way we can call the

636
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Quote unquote FBI

637
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Oh good idea

638
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
On the way over there and then we get the book and then

639
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You think we go to Glass?

640
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah I think we settle business in the city

641
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I think so too

642
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So we head toward the book we call the FBI

643
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And then after that we do the Chewbacca plan with me

644
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We take care of business

645
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I like it

646
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And break

647
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Joe roll alertness for me is

648
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Clark has the highest

649
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Alertness in the group

650
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Damn

651
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What's a DM4 but for wrecking plans

652
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Fuck you Seth

653
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Oh that's a hella fail

654
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What was I rolling on?

655
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Anyway alertness

656
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's a 96 on a 70

657
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Well that is a fail indeed

658
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Well that was fun with your plans

659
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
That will certainly happen right now

660
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
We're already out of the cemetery goodbye

661
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So wait how did

662
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Both of you arrive here

663
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I drove the police car that we took

664
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
To Glass

665
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh nice the circle provided me a car

666
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Silver Honda Accord

667
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Cool okay

668
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I came with Rosemary

669
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Well do you guys want to take the two cars

670
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Or do you just want to hop in the police cruiser

671
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Hold on real quick

672
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I haven't checked on where Rosemary

673
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Is this whole time

674
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Are you with Rosemary?

675
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I was she was on Overwatch

676
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
On one of these mausoleums

677
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You see her anywhere? She was here

678
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Who's got the best search between the three of you

679
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I have 40

680
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
50 I think Clark has the best search

681
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
No I don't have the best search

682
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's under S

683
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I have the baseline I have the 20%

684
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Oh shit I have the best search

685
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Alright Thomas go ahead and roll

686
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Top's bad at searching

687
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Okay you look up exactly where she

688
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Was and you don't see her

689
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Looking around you might even

690
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Put your fingers on top of one of these mausoleums

691
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And lift yourself up and looking around

692
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I do that

693
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You see that she's not on any of them

694
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But what you do see

695
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Is two city police officers

696
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Heading straight your way

697
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Hey boys

698
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Rosemary's not up here but

699
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Two city PDR

700
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
They're hoofing it our way

701
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We might want to fucking skedaddle

702
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay guys follow me back to the police cruiser

703
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Let's get the fuck out of here

704
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Take the same car? Yeah

705
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I think my police cruiser is a little better than your civic

706
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So let's get the fuck out of here

707
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I wait for John Lee Pettymore

708
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
To get down from the mausoleum

709
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I start booking it towards

710
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Where I parked the police cruiser

711
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Okay are you guys just going out the same way you came in

712
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Through the normal route

713
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
That one would take to get from the parking lot

714
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
To this clearing?

715
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Taking directly the route away from the cops

716
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Like straight away from them

717
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Even if we have to double back

718
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We're taking the route that will get us out of sight

719
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Of the fuzz

720
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Okay I'm going to go ahead and roll real quick

721
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
As you guys begin to recollect yourselves

722
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And head out through the back way

723
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You hear

724
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Freeze! City PD!

725
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We are now in combat order

726
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Thank you

727
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I turn around

728
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Everything's fine fellas

729
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I think you have a gun in your hand still?

730
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I mean

731
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't know if I would have had that still in my hand

732
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Everything's fine here fellas

733
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Contention PD

734
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We're getting out of your hair

735
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Your jurisdiction is far away from here sir

736
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Keep your hands in the air

737
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Where we can see them

738
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I was gesturing to the coffin

739
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Which is open

740
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Because I had opened it up

741
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We lost a good one in the contention ranks

742
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm kind of frankly disappointed that you're crashing it like this

743
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
They both have their guns up

744
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And they say

745
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah we heard there were some shots

746
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That went off during the funeral here

747
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I got it under control

748
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It was the 21 gun salute you mother fuckers

749
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I need you to roll persuade for me Clark

750
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh I pass

751
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I fucking pass a 16 on a 40

752
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Alright the police officers

753
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Put their guns down and they say

754
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm glad to see that you got everything under control

755
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And they look at

756
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Keith who's wearing just these absurd

757
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Clothes

758
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Is he the one who did it?

759
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Nope he's with us he's a member of the Contention PD as well

760
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Traditional Contention PD morning clothes

761
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I pull my

762
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Contention police badge out and I say

763
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
When I hung out with Ari

764
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
We always like to go boating

765
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
These officers

766
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
They want to know more

767
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
They start walking up toward you guys

768
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And they're like alright well uh

769
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Let's get this down here

770
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And they pull out a notepad

771
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And they're like we need to take statements from all of you

772
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I want to move up to intercept him

773
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Okay you do so

774
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Does Kevin have any kind of identifying information on him

775
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Anything that ties him to Marvin Glass

776
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You would probably have

777
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah you would probably have

778
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Like a dirty dog keypad

779
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Something like that

780
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Okay I pull the dirty dog grooming keypad

781
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Out of my chain and I'm like boys

782
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't think we need to have this conversation

783
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm with Mr. Glass

784
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Oh and they kind of look at each other

785
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh oh oh

786
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And then they start whispering to each other

787
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And

788
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
We are certainly sorry

789
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Please give our deepest apologies

790
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
To Mr. Glass and

791
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Actually they cover up their names

792
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And badge numbers

793
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And they turn

794
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And they're like we are so sorry to bother you

795
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Also Rip your fallen

796
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Police officer sorry to hear about that

797
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Sir again

798
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Deepest apologies please don't say anything

799
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
To Mr. Glass we weren't even here

800
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That's god damn right

801
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And they turn around and they

802
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Hoof it

803
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Kevin I thought that would work

804
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What's the keychain do

805
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh that's a fun one so the keychain

806
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The dirty dog grooming keychains

807
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
They like open up the door to the fucking

808
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Den of Sin and maybe some other

809
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Places in his things

810
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
The Den of Sin?

811
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Oh the Den of Sin you know where we were

812
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Held as cage fighters

813
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I saw a whole rowdy

814
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Bunch of degenerates

815
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Open up a door on the floor

816
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Just in the fucking street

817
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Dirty dog grooming keychains

818
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That's what John Peters had on him right

819
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah that's exactly what John Peters had on him

820
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And John Peters we know hung out

821
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
In the Den of Sin

822
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Well he was a dirty degenerate that couldn't

823
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Bet for shit

824
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Am I the only one who heard that?

825
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The Den of Sin is a name I don't know but I do

826
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Oh that's where we were

827
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The Den of Sin was the name of the place we were at

828
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah

829
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
We found those bedding stubs at John Peters house

830
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
That tied him to the place

831
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And John Peters he was telling a big story

832
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He was saying he was all important

833
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
There wasn't really happening for him

834
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
There's more to that than I remember

835
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Well as these police officers

836
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Walk away I look

837
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Back at both of my

838
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I would say former co-workers

839
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And now I think we're

840
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Co-workers now again but in a different

841
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Capacity and I say

842
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Hey well I'm parked over here

843
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
As you guys begin leaving the

844
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Funeral do you want to do anything

845
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Here in the clearing before

846
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You head out there are three

847
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Corpses of basically androids

848
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
That are laying out

849
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And then also the body of Ari

850
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Manstein is in her coffin

851
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But not in a tomb

852
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I believe the funeral might have ended with

853
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Placing the coffin in the tomb

854
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I want to pay my respects to the androids

855
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And

856
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And then we probably

857
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Need to get on that crank and lower Ari

858
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Down

859
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Keith walks over to the corral fish boil again

860
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And grabs three four more

861
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Lose a hit point

862
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I think it's cooled down by this point

863
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Whoever was manning the fire

864
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Has been gone for a minute

865
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
These are all above ground mausoleums

866
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Around us right? Is there one that's obviously

867
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The one she was heading toward?

868
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
There is one with an open door

869
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Tomb doors to the mausoleum

870
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
That is right nearby

871
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I grab one of the things that the pallbearers hold

872
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
The bars on the side of the coffin

873
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Let's get her rested

874
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Go ahead and grab the other side

875
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You pick up the coffin

876
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Of Ari Manstein

877
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And you begin walking her

878
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Into her crypt

879
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That she will stay in

880
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
For the rest of her time

881
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on

882
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Before we take her in here

883
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Let's look through this coffin

884
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I think Keith

885
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I saw Keith run over there earlier

886
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
We've done this twice already

887
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I looked for the book

888
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And then I also opened it up earlier

889
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
To see if she was even in there

890
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
She was? She is in there

891
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And there is no book in there

892
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Oh good, okay let's bury her

893
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I grab one of the bars

894
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And I close the coffin

895
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And I think the three of us

896
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Start walking into the mausoleum

897
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
The mausoleum is

898
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Completely dark

899
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And as you walk in

900
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You hear a voice

901
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Clark, it's a voice

902
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You might recognize

903
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Maybe a little bit quicker

904
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Than the other two

905
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Because it sounds

906
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So much like you

907
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And looking up

908
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You see these little sparks

909
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Of light as a voice

910
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Rings out chanting

911
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
In the darkness

912
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You see these flashes and sparks

913
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Ignited seemingly by this

914
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Steady chant

915
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It emanates a piece of parchment

916
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Held by an old Clark

917
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Bishop wearing a dark cloak

918
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That is covering almost all of his

919
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Face as light begins

920
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Emanating from his mouth

921
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And the words he's chanting

922
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Begin to ignite

923
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And the fire lifts off the page

924
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And begins to dance in a circle

925
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Around you

926
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Looking up

927
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You all see his lifted hands

928
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Are cut open

929
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Pouring onto the ground

930
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And actually go ahead and roll

931
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Sanity for me

932
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Fail

933
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Over my power

934
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Or constitution

935
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I fail a 76 on a 19

936
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I got a 1

937
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Baby

938
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Alrighty, so

939
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Luke, Keith, he loses

940
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
No sanity whatsoever

941
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
He rolled a 1, correct?

942
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And then Thomas, John

943
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Loses one sanity

944
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Clark, you also lose one sanity

945
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So this blood is

946
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Pooling on the ground

947
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Clark and John, both failing their sanity

948
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Checks, both drop their load

949
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Of the coffin, leaving Keith

950
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
As the sole support

951
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And the coffin hits the ground

952
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Ari's corpse, limply plopping

953
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Into the muddy blood puddle

954
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
In this dusty

955
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Cold crypt

956
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Alternatively, this

957
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Logically sashaying fire

958
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Surrounds you and bathes

959
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
All three of you

960
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
In a comforting, warm

961
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Light that feels familiar

962
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But the look on Joe's face says

963
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Otherwise

964
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I am diving directly at old Clark

965
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Trying to get him to the ground

966
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And as you do so, you grab

967
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
On to an empty cloak

968
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And hit your face directly

969
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
On the back of this

970
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Mausoleum

971
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And you just hear his

972
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Clark, that's the guy I was talking about

973
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
How can you

974
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Have enough

975
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Drowning out

976
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
All I know

977
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Is

978
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
There's no

979
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I don't know

980
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I don't know

981
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't know

982
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I don't know

983
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I don't know

984
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I don't know

985
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I don't know
