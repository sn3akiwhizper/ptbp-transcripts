00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,060
Howdy partners, it's your ding-dang big bang shooting rowdy son of a gun wolf the dog

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:14,380
Can I get a yee-howl? I am sauntering at you live from six nine four point two

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,980

some other

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,060
time

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,440
While dealing with the unfamiliar time, let's check in with a familiar old standby

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,880
This week's Helen with wolf comes from Luke aka vegan amigo who wrote a fantastic

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:41,580
Five-star review of this show over on Apple podcast, which is a hell of a sweet thing to do they write

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,340

Damn, that was weird Luke aka vegan amigo, which reminds me

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:14,480
Let me look outside real quick. Like yep. I'm definitely some time weird again. God damn it

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,840
Hey you yeah, you listen to get your hand out of your mouth and focus for one goddamn second here

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,180
Thank you all Wolfie gets lonely on his travels through both time and space

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,520
The knowledge that you folks are out there

17
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,000
Metaphysically keeping me company brings me warmth both in my esophagus and in my loins

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,240
I'm not sure how this community keeps growing my producer assures me we are doing the absolute bare minimum in terms of

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,360
Advertising I guess bare minimum means none whatsoever

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,880
So, please keep up the beautiful word of mouth

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:59,320
It seems to be working keep telling your friends your enemies your frenemies even and keep writing up sweet

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,680
Recommendations and reviews on reddit just keep doing what you're doing

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,920
sweet baby listeners unless you're not doing the doing then join the doers in the

24
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,640
Doing this fuck Nike y'all ready for a new jam that makes Smuckers feel like suckers a jam

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,640
That truly squelches the likes of Welch's this track is so sweet y'all

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:30,660
It'll make the fruit green with jelly. It's the creek rocks with can't you hear them wolves are howling?

27
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Oh

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,080
Standing behind a heavy wooden lectern is a young man wearing a thick

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,780
Hand-stitched suit at the neck of his white shirt

30
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,060
He sports the collar of a preacher and

31
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,300
Pinned on his breast pocket. There is a shiny gold star

32
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,300
words along the bottom of the screen read

33
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,260
contention

34
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,220
1880 something

35
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,340
This fresh-faced kid steps back from the pulpit and begins to walk down the aisle of this

36
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,420
His house of the Lord as he speaks

37
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,140
directly into camera

38
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,540
Howdy there folks. My name is Bobby custard. Welcome to contention

39
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:58,020
Nuzzled here in the middle of prosperous farms and ranches this dusty mining town of contention sits

40
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:06,100
We were doing a okay for a mining town, but then this fella no, no not a fella bona fide genius

41
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,540
Well, he came along and turned contention not only into one of the most successful

42
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,580
Mining operations this side of the long wet one, but one of the most modern pounds of round

43
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:26,020
Silas Cole showed up one day is just a minor and before long he was inventing and doing all sorts of business

44
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,120
After he bought the mine, he electrified my church here and the courthouse and the schoolhouse, too

45
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:40,060
Mr. Cole surely is a gift from above you'll meet him eventually if you stick around long enough

46
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,500
but don't

47
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,380
Don't make eye contact or any sudden movements

48
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,640
He's real skittish like always on the edge of another brilliant discovery

49
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,900
I'd imagine and his wife Mary what a gem she founded contentions first library

50
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:07,060
contentions got more learned folks than ever before which is a big asset in my humble opinion being there is far less crime and

51
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,940
I don't have to do all the Bible reading during service. I

52
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,700
Will say though. This is a bit of an unfortunate time to be here in contention. See

53
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,780
We done had a handful of disappearances lately

54
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,660
nothing wild

55
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,940
usual suspects the whole saloon staff and the bartender miss kitty piano player a few gamblers the town drunk

56
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,340
You know if half of them went missing in one go not sure anyone will bat an eye

57
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,740
but almost ten folks

58
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,740
within the span of a week

59
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,340
Well, a few of the townsfolk are getting a little worrisome

60
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,300
Not that I blame them. So we're hosting a town hall meeting today here at the church

61
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,940
So anyone with information can talk open and we can have a vote on the best course of action moving forward now

62
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,380
I got a dust before this place is full, but we'll see you real soon. Yeah

63
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,620
Welcome to contention in the 1880s. It's the Old West boys

64
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Giddy up

65
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,020
Giddy up in what in tarnation everybody's saying yeehaw, but not asking hi

66
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,380
But I love it well, hey Luke, how are you I'm doing real good

67
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,380
Cool mess

68
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,900
No, I've never been but it's gonna it'll come out. Yeah, that's same. Oh good. You guys didn't practice

69
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,060
We're on we're on for I practiced. I yelled in the shower at myself

70
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,200
And then I just assumed mine would come out when it started. So yeah same but it's always worked for all of us before

71
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:04,180
Like to let the voice find me generic southern accents have taken us this far as X. Yeah

72
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Yeah

73
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,460
I'm doubling down on it tonight. That's that's my my only inspiration

74
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,860
The Old West scenario, I'm gonna be method acting so we're gonna have to find a way to record without audacity or laptops or anything

75
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,800
You just need to get Luke some some like mule blinders

76
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:33,020
Close my eyes all time. I'm down boy. Calm down now. Stay focused. Just talk straight forward. Don't look now. Oh, he saw a computer

77
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,460
Hail is that he's going wild as hell y'all for whole sanity roll sanity. Why is that picture so bright?

78
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,460
That's what horses do right? Yeah

79
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:56,200
Invented when were donkeys invented Mountain Dew Mountain Dew but what sound donkeys make whilst they drink a do

80
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,780
It might have been around in the 1880s. It's one of the older ones. Let's see Mountain Dew was introduced in 1940

81
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,020
Yeah, but wasn't Mountain Dew a slang term for not

82
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,780
Dude disambiguation. Yeah moonshine cuz that's why they called it that because it tastes like

83
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,760
Everyone knows when you slug down some Mountain Dew

84
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:28,060
Notes of moonshine hit you in the mountain do is not smooth at all. It's so fucking aggressive

85
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,880
There's a song from 1882 called the rare old Mountain Dew

86
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,220
And there's also a 2011 song called diet Mountain Dew by Lana Del Rey

87
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,500
Sing the first one for us. Okay, let me find it. We should see if we can get the second one for the theme

88
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,580
Hey Lana Del Rey, she's from Missouri, right? Yeah, Jad counts, right?

89
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,060
She's from Sykes ten has Brad Brad Pitt wrote any songs that we can throw him on

90
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,380
Local musician Brad Pitt. He's an actor

91
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,740
Okay, I'm about to listen to the rare old Mountain Dew see what it's like no, no, no don't listen sing it

92
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Okay, let me look up the lyrics

93
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,360
No, no, no, don't look up lyrics sing it

94
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,620
Well, I already looked at memory

95
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,580
I don't know. I can't do it

96
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,260
Have you seen my Mountain Dew

97
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
It's rare

98
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
Real bad real bad

99
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,080
It's rare you gotta put more well you're never that is damn good keep going. I don't know the rest of the lyrics

100
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,780
That's the only ones. Oh, well, the chorus would be easy to sing. Hi. Di diddly diddle arm diddly doodle

101
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,900
I don't um diddly do ride diddle of my day. Did you look at him? Yeah

102
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,820
For it fills the air with a perfume rare and betwixt both me and you as home

103
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,220
We stroll we can take a bowl or a bucket of the Mountain Dew

104
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,460
Mountain

105
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,160
Bring me my spits bucket. I wanted to taste the Mountain Dew fresh. Oh, that's Justin talking right now

106
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Oh

107
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Yeah, Thomas

108
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,900
It's very Irish sounding the song. Oh, I thought you were talking about Justin. I was like, he's not

109
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,600
Well, he did hatch from a space egg

110
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
You guys found me outside

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The

112
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,920
Remember that is because we have the VHS tape that was sent to us of us finding him

113
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,600
Since it's like a planted memory. Yeah, but thankfully that tape included a great montage of the four of us raising him

114
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,480
So even if we didn't have the memories

115
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,360
It's kind of like we got to see what it was like and let me tell you there was a lot of love

116
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,760
I remember when you guys when Zach got a big green egg to smoke meat in and I just tried to climb on in that

117
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Bad boy. Oh my god

118
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Got so singed

119
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,520
That was sex nickname for for Justin hams

120
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:42,280
Hamilton has just come out. Of course, right? Yeah, it's a good year for ham related content

121
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
and

122
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,400
Justin just wouldn't stop with this political rap

123
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
He also made us go see

124
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Shit, what's that pig called?

125
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,120
babe

126
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
No the cartoon

127
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Peppa Peppa Pig. Yeah

128
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
It would have been better if I could remember

129
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,960
I was gonna say a pig but it's that's Looney Tunes

130
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
indeed

131
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,720
Looney Tunes indeed. Did you ever bartend a Peppa Pig show? No, I didn't

132
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, I made the mistake of doing that once I always signed up for the ones that I thought were country singers

133
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,240
But then one dude's name sounded so much like a country singer and it turned out to be a Christian magician

134
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
So I made no money

135
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,000
Did he try to give you was he like here's your tip and when you reach for it, he like made it disappear and you're like

136
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Along with my face

137
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:49,720
It was like Peppa Pig I guess did some kind of tour like a live music thing was like a hologram

138
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
No, it was like people

139
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,520
Peppa Pig dying brutally

140
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,580
Anyway, it was like mostly candy and popcorn sales and then like the same seven dads getting really drunk

141
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,240
Tips were not great except from those guys

142
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,760
Christian magician was just a lot of homeschool jokes. All right

143
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,040
All right, everybody get off the fucking call except Joe do we just leave

144
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,840
Just go ahead and leave and I'll text you one at a time

145
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Okay, just go ahead and just go and leave. He's next. I'll send text. It'll go

146
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,600
Joe and then it'll be Justin and then it'll be

147
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,000
Thomas and then it'll be Luke cool. I can play a game

148
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,320
Just text me. Bye. Bye. Okey-dokey. Joe. I'm gonna go pee real quick

149
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,560
Alrighty, Joe. I don't have my headphones on but I had no idea you're so fucking humongous. You're a monster

150
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,400
Wait, sorry, it's Luke. It's humongous. Not you. Oh, that's what you're referring to

151
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,520
I thought you were talking about like me positioned in my camera or something. No, I was talking I was reading the characters

152
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,800
He is he's a bit. I thought I was reading yours, but it looks for the audience and he's a monster man

153
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Zach don't put this in

154
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,320
Joe Terry

155
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,280
Tell me what you know, what time counter is your audacity yet?

156
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,040
My time counter on audacity is at 19 minutes and almost 30 seconds cool

157
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,520
Have any missing time no missing time the missing time like we had when we found

158
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Justin's egg pod. I

159
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,080
Do miss when he was suckle at my teat I

160
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Just pictured it I'm like looking at him on the chat and he doesn't know we're talking about it. It's just like

161
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Picturing him all up on that nip and

162
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Oh

163
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,280
Well, we can play hard right yeah

164
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,200
Did that make sense did you understand what I meant nope Edie didn't exist in the 1880s, let's get going

165
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,720
your character's name is

166
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:31,340
Everett Pace, I've asked you to give me a rundown of who your character is and you wrote something so beautiful. Thank you

167
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,240
I was I was

168
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,580
Taken by surprise you asked you we have a group chat and you asked for us to present a day in the life of a

169
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:44,300
Character and Luke was actually the first one to present one and it was the best written thing. I'd read in a long time

170
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,380
It made me think oh shit. I gotta write something now

171
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,160
I actually he sent it to me, you know

172
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,220
Like a private message and I was like you have to send this to the group so that they know what they're up against

173
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,960
Yeah, I did not meet the challenge, but I did write a good couple paragraphs

174
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,980
Oh, I absolutely love what you've written and let's dive into it. Yeah, okay

175
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,900
So no one knows how long Everett Pace has been in that old

176
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,240
Low slung sod house on the bald spot of the hill just outside of town

177
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,360
He's just always been up there old Everett folks

178
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,820
don't see him too often in town except for the few times he wanders in to restock his coffee and

179
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,920
Ammo supply and once or twice a year when he ventures to the saloon for a drink as though he's celebrating something

180
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,840
No one ever bothers him though

181
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:38,140
He just looks off an unruly mess of long gray beard and an attempt at a greasy comb over on top

182
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,700
He's got a sickly dirty complexion and walks with an uneasy slightly hunched shuffle

183
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,960
But his eyes are bright and wild and fiery and only add to how off-putting his whole presence can be

184
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,500
The town folk do catch glimpses of him up on the hill though

185
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,660
He's often tending to a sprawling garden

186
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Butchering the day's hunt or chopping wood

187
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,980
he looks so old and frail but each pull of the hoe a cleave of the cleaver a

188
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,540
Swing of the axe reveals muscles that have been at least tuned to the work for ages

189
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,060
Mothers in town use Everett as a boogeyman telling their children if they wander too far at night

190
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:21,980
He might snatch them and can them up like the radishes and Brussels sprouts in his cellar and the kids believe it because they can't

191
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,980
tell when or if

192
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,980
Everett sleeps a

193
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:32,260
flicker of a lantern in the wee hours of the night and the occasional but sudden crack of a rifle being fired off towards something

194
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,400
Unseen and unheard makes the kids pull the covers up extra tight at night

195
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,200
And so while these kids are pulling their covers right above their chins up over their noses

196
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,900
Like you're supposed to wear your fucking masks

197
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,980
Sorry

198
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
So many under the nose

199
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,580
Just right over the nose they're holding their their sheets tight and

200
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,500
They're thinking about Everett

201
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:08,060
Who is what is he doing at night when he's got his lantern out? Does he have his rifle?

202
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,380
With him like what? What is he what is he doing? Is he out on his property? Is he inside the house?

203
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Can they see the lantern just bobbing along the lantern flickers from within the house?

204
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,380
I mean that's what the kids are definitely questioning if you want the answer

205
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,060
It's that he's uh, he's he's lived his life on this land protecting it as his own

206
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,980
it's it's his his parcel in this world and

207
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,100
He he guards it

208
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,260
he he'll uh, he'll stay awake at night to make sure the crops don't get to and he'll he'll shoot a wolf if he sees

209
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,260
one coming up or a

210
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,780
Raccoon or any sort of thing that

211
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,500
Threatens his and it's exactly on one of these nights

212
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
Everett hears a

213
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,500
Grumbling in the distance and it's on his land and Everett

214
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,180
Everett knows exactly what direction it's in. It's not it's not where the animals are. It's not where his garden is

215
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:08,000
Ever doesn't have animals just for the record. Oh, sorry. No animals you kill you kill by the day

216
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,380
He lives off the land

217
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,200
So he's he's doing a lot of his own gardening and stuff

218
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,780
But he hunts at when he can and then just like keeps the meat until he's like needs to go back out and restock up

219
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,380
Yep, damn, that's fucking cool. We're

220
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,820
different now as

221
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
humans

222
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,140
So I'm hearing a low rumbling somewhere and you hear scratching and you hear earth

223
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:40,100
Moving and you know that it is coming from the direction of a spot in the ground

224
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,500
Where there is a cross made out of sticks

225
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,620
Planted what is that spot Everett? Well, that's where that's where I'm up

226
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,260
That's where that's where Claire is buried. That's what

227
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,580
Why would there be a sound over there?

228
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,900
He's you know, maybe shuffle over there a little bit and in the darkness

229
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,740
your old eyes

230
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,940
Do you have anything that would let you like? Yeah, I've got a decent spot hidden

231
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:17,060
I've got a decent listen either one of those. I'll do my spot hidden. I mean I say decent it's 45

232
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,600
Did I mention in my description that my guy is an old man? Oh

233
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:26,900
No, I don't think you did. He's 65 or 68 years old and he's kind of frail in general

234
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
I

235
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,660
Thought there's a chance for a birthday at some point in this

236
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:44,220
Okay, I'm doing spot hidden at a 45 and I pass 20 you can't

237
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm not sure you can go ahead and roll sanity

238
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:57,140
That's also a cool character quirk of this guy he's already kind of weird in life people already assume that he's weird

239
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,660
He thinks of himself as kind of a loner and a weirdo. He's kind of open to weird shit

240
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,660
So he's got the highest sanity of a character. I've ever played at 80

241
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,380
80. Oh, yeah

242
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,500
And I pass a 26 well your eyes don't lie, you know what you see

243
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,180
You see Miss Kitty one of the saloon workers who had gone missing

244
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,740
He'd gone missing about a week ago. Yeah. Okay. The town is all

245
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,300
Ah

246
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,100
Half up in arms about it

247
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,260
Some of them don't give a shit because it's a lot of the ruffians that have gone missing

248
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,460
but there were a fair amount of disappearances to the point to where people are

249
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,220
Starting to kind of maybe get concerned

250
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,980
concerned

251
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,740
concerned

252
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:47,740
The sound is actually another degree higher. So that's exactly exactly because now they know that it more of

253
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,740
them

254
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,860
Miss Kitty is digging with her hands into the grave

255
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,540
Miss Kitty, what are you? What are you doing? Miss Kitty get up. How far off is this?

256
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:08,460
And where are you in your house? I'm curious. He was probably standing at his doorstep when he heard the sounds. Mm-hmm

257
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,060
So the grave is I would I pictured it. It's like I said, he's on a bald spot

258
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:18,500
I would picture it near the tree lines. So maybe like 20 yards like he's got a good plot up there

259
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,140
Sure, so maybe 20 yards away up by the tree line. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and roll listen for me as you haul her out

260
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:36,860
Fuck I fail a 47 on a 40. There's some sort of murmuring happening underneath the breath of Miss Kitty

261
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,140
just kind of like

262
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
I

263
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,340
Keep approaching

264
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,020
Miss Kitty, they're looking for you in town in there. Where are you being?

265
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,580
Get out of there. You don't need to be digging around in there. She hears you coming looks up wide-eyed

266
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:01,940
Looks down and then she's just gonna run away away ever. It's fine with that. That was just a yeah, it's weird

267
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,060
Miss Kenny come back there. Look they're looking for you in town. Where are you?

268
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,740
Miss Kenny and as ever it goes back into his home. Does he wrap up? Does he sleep?

269
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,180
No

270
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,740
So this is based on a real thing

271
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,380
I read that they think that

272
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,900
Back in the day of a person's sleep cycle was much more of a farming cycle that they would take like a lot of naps

273
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
But be awake for a lot of the night

274
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:32,320
Because they had to protect their areas. So he's he's a he's awake a lot of the night. I love it

275
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,820
I love it. Yeah, I love you. I love you too that

276
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,340
I'm getting in the car baby. I'm getting in the car. I'm coming over there

277
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Wear your fucking mask

278
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,980
For the beginning

279
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:02,860
Justin is my friend and he's got headphones on and he's on the podcast and I'm very happy

280
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,140
What the fuck just happened?

281
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,460
Welcome to Pretending To Be People

282
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,020
What kind of show is this?

283
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,300
This is the show where we talk to each other

284
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:25,740
But not as each other because even in our friendships we rarely talk about things that matter

285
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,700
It's always bullshit. So we may as well have a podcast where we're completely different people

286
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,140
I've never known the true Zach. So why I'd start getting to know him now

287
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,020
Please don't what's your character's name? You won't love me if you know me

288
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,720
Old Zach, you don't want no one to know him real good

289
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Get get a heart hurt again

290
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Oh

291
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:04,540
My character's name is Jack Perlman. Oh, yeah, that's a sexy name. I know right it kind of sounds like a porn name

292
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,620
Absolutely sounds like a porn name just like

293
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,520
Ron Perlman. Oh, is that who you've based his character off of? No, just the name Ron Perlman's great

294
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:21,800
He's great fan. My man isn't a lumbering giant with a bellowing voice like Ron Perlman

295
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
documentary he was in

296
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,920
Hellboy

297
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:32,040
And then the second documentary Hellboy 2 and then the comic based on the documentary. I

298
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,400
Love it when people make comics based on documentaries. I can't wait for that March of the Penguins graphic novel to come out fine

299
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:49,020
I've been reading some non-stop. Oh, yeah. I heard the I heard the Watchmen guys doing the March of the Penguins. So

300
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,120
So I asked you all to write a thing about your character

301
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,880
Day in the life if you a quick description day in the life kind of situation. Yes

302
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Tell me about

303
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Jack Perlman

304
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,720
Jack every time every time the name Jack Perlman has said I'm gonna edit in those two noise

305
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,440
Yeah, that's both at the same time. Like yeah combined

306
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,280
So we same time it same time it like we always

307
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,920
Okay, yeah, oh I thought we were gonna be truthful with oh, yeah, it's we're working on we're trying to get in sync

308
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,260
It's hard. Oh god. Okay. Yeah, Jack Perlman. He's a

309
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,560
He's just hit his 40s graying ever so slightly

310
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,520
Dark tan skin from manual labor. He's a he's a rancher

311
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,920
But unlike a lot of other ranchers he tends to do a lot of stuff by himself

312
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
He hasn't really found

313
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,080
Help that he would consider up to his his standards

314
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:04,160
Basically runs the whole shindig himself. He wakes up quite early in the morning probably 4 or 5 a.m. At the crack of dawn

315
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,480
Mm-hmm feeds his two dogs Chuck and Bob who are scruffy mutts that he took in

316
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,680
Makes a strong pot of coffee and a big ol

317
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,220
Biscuit breakfast to start his day off, right?

318
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,000
He mainly raises and trains horses, which he which he loves dearly

319
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:30,680
Few cows here and there and some goats just for the extra cash, but he really loves the the majesty of a big ol horse

320
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,640
He often a lot of the day is like, you know maintaining raising them

321
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,040
Checking him out making sure their health's good

322
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,800
He patrols the area for any trouble cuz I assume he has like a big swath of land that he has to you know

323
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,480
mend fences

324
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,920
Wrangle a lot of mending a lot of wrangle in a lot of mending

325
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,000
But at the end of the day, he either goes to the bar to grab a drink or seven

326
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,640
having an excellent time or

327
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,040
Alternatively, he stays completely home with a book sitting on his porch with his dogs

328
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
only lit by the light of the lantern and

329
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,640
The the glow that reflects off a bottle of whiskey

330
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:22,760
So let's cut to a scene about a week ago on one of the nights where you ended up at the saloon to have

331
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,880
one or two or

332
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,400
seven

333
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,800
It's hard to keep track after roll a d10. Let's see how many drinks you've had at this point. Oh

334
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,280
Oh

335
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,880
Where the fuck did I put my dad up Justin?

336
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,560
Justin you amateur we're playing a role-playing game Justin the role stands for you roll the dice

337
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Can you talk about voice from now on

338
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
I

339
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Can't stop smiling

340
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,520
Help me Justin has me trapped here

341
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,720
Boom d10 five drinks in five drinks in a good number. That's a fair amount of drinks now

342
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,200
Just say now roll a d4 for how many hours it's been

343
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,520
Three hours, that's actually not bad. That's not bad at all. I'm averaging about two per hour. Yeah, that's a that's a fun night

344
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Yeah, that's that's his preferred

345
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,680
Jack's preferred is to do that, but it doesn't always go down like that

346
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:38,660
Sometimes people bet you like, you know that you can't do ten shots in a row and you really need four dollars

347
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,960
Hey, man, it's 1880 something four dollars

348
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,720
Four dollars is mad money. I don't know. I don't know the conversion

349
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,440
I should I bet it's real good

350
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,960
I played Red Dead Redemption and it seemed like four dollars was a lot of money

351
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,720
some of the guns on here were like nine dollars, so I'm gonna say four dollars here is a

352
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,800
105 100 bucks. That's I'd yeah, would you do ten shots for a hundred bucks? No

353
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,280
Not now, yeah, yeah cuz I know I just get extremely sick

354
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,880
How many hours do I know one of waste $100 for a day gone like a whole day?

355
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,520
I would be useless maybe even two these days

356
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,920
I can't keep up when I was a young man ten shots

357
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,680
Did you mean when we a hundred dollars when we first met each other?

358
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Four years ago. Yeah

359
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,960
Child

360
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,520
Four years ago. Let's dive in here. Yeah, you're kind of leaning up against the piano

361
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,880
in the saloon and the piano player is not playing right now cuz no one's paid him is that he's a jukebox and

362
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,880
He needs to get money in order to play song. So it's dead silent right now

363
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,280
So he's just talking to one of the gamblers who's around here and he's like, oh, yeah, no, I swear to God bad

364
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,960
It's a girl teenage girl walking around the new mine over there at night

365
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:13,080
Not a chance married be happy about that and the other guy's like no shit

366
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,000
You saw a teenage girl over there at that new mine

367
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,120
I don't think Silas had to have the balls do something like that and the other piano players like

368
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,920
He owns this town and do whatever he wants if he wants to have a new girl ever done the walk

369
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,120
That's right. What's random and

370
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:40,040
The guy's like I just don't see it happening that Mary Cole is a stand-up woman a good

371
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,160
Smart head on top of them their shoulders that she's got nice broad strong

372
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:51,200
like could easily take a man like Silas cause she truly wanted to and there's no reason she

373
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,320
would want to deal with that kind of nonsense in his

374
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,480
Blessed life praise be Lord

375
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Does Jack join in the conversation at all

376
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:15,080
Jack's not a big fan of gossip of any kind gosh just slinging on and there's here but he does he does like listening

377
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,320
He just doesn't like

378
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,640
Participating so he's kind of he's keeping an ear on because he wants to know what's going on in the town

379
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,560
But he also so cutting back to this night. You've got your option here. Are you out at the bar again?

380
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,360
This is about a week later, or are you hanging out on the porch with your dogs lantern and bottle of whiskey a week later

381
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,840
What's the what's the weather like this? Oh, it's a buggy muggy motherfucker. I

382
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,420
Think he just goes to the bar if if the weather's not like nicer sitting outside then he'll head to the bar

383
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,000
There's a nice cool breeze. He'll take it outside and kind of chill but you know, you know how

384
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Ranchers in the Old West love to chill

385
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,040
Take it mad easy. Keep it mad posse

386
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
It's the Old West bro

387
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,720
Yeah, I heard that they they they had a net that they would have to keep the bugs out

388
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,320
There was on a stick and they were just you know

389
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,340
Net stick and chill

390
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Oh my god

391
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
That was a bad one

392
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,460
But I appreciate it cuz you put a lot of thought into it I put a little thought into it

393
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,920
So as you're coming home from the bar

394
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,000
What do you ride I think just like a good old strong

395
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,960
I can't remember the differences between the horses. I used to actually kind of know from old red dead

396
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,160
But it's like it's like one of those like it's a larger than average like strong

397
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,520
Horse a good like worker horse. That's like my I don't care about that. What's its name? Oh, what's its name?

398
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:01,320
No, I do care. But also what's its name Jeremiah? Oh, yeah, so you're riding Jeremiah back and you hear a

399
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Oh

400
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,440
Coming from the field that you own and you know

401
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,840
It's the right here attempted a horse. It's the crying of a horse

402
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
I don't know what they sound like

403
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,320
Was that a sound of a horse or is that yeah, you're you're okay

404
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,840
You know, I didn't know there's an old man dying

405
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,320
All right, so you hear this as you're approaching your home

406
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,480
What do you do I kick up the speed swords the source of the noise roll alertness for me?

407
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,560
Oh, is there alertness in this game? Fuck we're playing down darker trails, which is the Old West

408
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,560
Setting for Call of Cthulhu and spot hidden baby old spot hidden, okay

409
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Well, I rolled a 10

410
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,240
That'll probably be 16. Yeah. I was like I rolled a dick. Why was I doing?

411
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
amateur hour over here

412
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,040
Welcome to the show Justin get your shit together

413
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,520
You roll a 16 on spot hidden and as you're approaching

414
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,960
You're riding toward the noise and looking off into the distance. You see a thin

415
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,920
silhouette

416
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,400
dipping off

417
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
fast into the distance

418
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,360
40 50 yards away from this horse that is still 20 to 30 yards away from you

419
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
So almost a football field away

420
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,240
You see this this very slight figure that is just

421
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:56,400
Running and with that roll. You can see it's a humanoid but it's running like

422
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,900
Like a wild animal and you said it's like a football field away almost. Yeah. Hey, what'd you do to my horse?

423
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,720
Stop it will not stop it only continues

424
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,040
Is it cooking at a speed that I could catch up with it on horseback

425
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,240
Or is it so far away that it's like scurrying into the the wild it's heading into the wild at this point

426
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,560
But you could chase it through the wild if you could track it

427
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,040
Yeah, I don't feel comfortable doing that. I'm gonna go to where the horses are. I can kill you tonight if that's what yeah

428
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm good. I don't have tracking and it's the night and there's a ghoulish

429
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,240
ghoul of some kind

430
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:42,640
No, but I'll go to the horse to go ahead and roll sanity for how fast this it's like it's inhumanely

431
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
exactly unhumanly fast

432
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,960
Well, I need to roll two dice, please

433
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,360
That's that's a 98 baby that's not gonna pass there does it though

434
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
No, I got no

435
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,080
Lose one sanity as you realize

436
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,440
There's something in contention that is not human and you look up at the stars

437
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,280
and it's a clear night sky and as you're kind of like

438
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
Toward this

439
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
Old man or sound

440
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,800
You know

441
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,120
The world isn't what you thought it might have been if something like that

442
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:34,720
Exists here and when you make it up to your horse, I need you to roll another sanity check because I'm surprised at how

443
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
injured it is

444
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
40 I pass whatever this thing was

445
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,160
It clearly was here for meat

446
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,600
It knew exactly where to shred the skin of

447
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,640
This horse to pull out the most muscle the quickest and there are

448
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,120
Just holes on the haunches and in the shoulders of this horse that is on the ground

449
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,720
You can kind of see through where its chest is

450
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:14,880
The muscle is completely missing and you can just see it's that the top rib on its left side

451
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
Where it's laying on its right?

452
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
I

453
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,040
Gently hop off my horse my damn dandelion. No, I

454
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,240
Walk up to it with my revolver and

455
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,140
I cock it and I look at it

456
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:47,280
I'm sorry, I couldn't be here for you when you needed me and with that I put dandelion out of its misery

457
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Jack looks away

458
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,640
Sheathing or whatever he caught putting his gun back in his holster

459
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,480
wipes a couple tears away from his face and gets back on his horse to make the rounds to make sure

460
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Everybody else is safe

461
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
I

462
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,880
Tell us Cox, what are your thoughts about the situation now? I can hear I said Thomas Cox

463
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,840
What are your thoughts about the situation at hand?

464
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,960
I don't know a whole lot about it Zack. It's the Old West

465
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,760
That I like that tell me about your character people are missing and that that won't stand

466
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,840
That's the thing we're gonna try to get to the bottom of here I bet it'll work out for us

467
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:52,160
I bet it will too. I've set this whole thing up to where you guys can look at Justin. I see meditating

468
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,200
That's what I thought too, but we're gonna look like assholes when we're talking about this on the podcast and he's just dead

469
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,860
There he goes

470
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
He moved

471
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
Thank God

472
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,500
Yeah, so hey I'm playing

473
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,860
Hold on I realized I never googled my character's name I

474
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,100
Did anybody terrible? Nope?

475
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:23,660
Okay, the guy who came up with the the he's the doctor who came up with the like air pathway

476
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,260
Thing where you shove a pin in somebody's throat and EpiPen or a trachea

477
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:36,780
Trachea and it's not spelled the same way. I immediately thought Horace Grant Oh Horace

478
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:45,820
Green oh shit is the school from rock. Okay. Well, I am I'm playing a professor Horace Green and he is a

479
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,620
Naturalist a paleontologist

480
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:57,420
He searches for ancient creatures from the past and they're fossils and and and they're remnants

481
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,540
Sick, does he just put bones together and call it what he thinks it is

482
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,580
some some

483
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,380
Huxters in his like profession do that, but he is a trained naturalist

484
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:17,300
he he's at the cutting edge of modern of modern theory when it comes to paleo biology and he

485
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:23,140
I don't know if that's a word back then but that's that's what he does man. That's what he lives and breathes

486
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:29,780
It's a word now. Mm-hmm. I'm not in character yet, so I can say it's not exactly I'm just trying to I'm just trying to

487
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:35,380
Clean it exactly who can say that before he was terribly killed by whatever

488
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,860
Delta green monsters Zach has in store for us that professor Horace Horace Green

489
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:47,300
Does not did not coin the term paleo biology and I asked you to write me a

490
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,140
Like a day not just for me

491
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,860
but also for you to get to learn about your character even more through the

492
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:02,500
Practice of writing this was actually helpful and also for the listeners to get to know your character even more

493
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,460
I was telling Joe earlier. This is the best decision we've ever made for

494
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,980
For writing new character direction, yeah instead of just doing it

495
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:21,180
Exactly, I really dig it. So yeah any give me what you got any DMS or GMs listening. This is a really good

496
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:27,340
This is a cool mechanic before you run a game that being said I didn't know it would be read publicly

497
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:33,180
So I will have to self-edit and clean this up as I go along because I sent Zach just a filthy

498
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,620
Version so it was mostly pictures crude

499
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:43,620
Crude scribblings really I was like wow. I know exactly who this character is

500
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,780
Professor Horace Green leaves his bed at 530

501
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,060
Although he has generally been awake for an hour or more at this point

502
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,920
Staring at the ceiling or the curtains or a sleeping cat easy it

503
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,560
Observing but not quite seeing these things as he lets his jumbled rush of thoughts flow freely

504
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,720
Until they have sorted themselves into something like order

505
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,120
He picks his way through the stacks of books that litter his floor and heads downstairs to the parlor

506
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,680
Where the widow Anderson is already waiting with coffee

507
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,880
He stayed at the hotel the first few months he was in town

508
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,520
But he found himself in frequent disagreement with that establishment over payments and acceptable level of cat excretions

509
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,020
Returning from his shell one day. He found the hotel and employed the washer woman's daughter to clean his room

510
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:32,100
He opened the door to see her rearranging his table of vertebrae and promptly fled to the washroom to weep

511
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,340
Since then he has stayed at the widow Anderson's boarding house

512
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,760
She rises as early as he does and enjoys stiff coffee and silence in the mornings

513
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,780
The other boarders are young men

514
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,740
They leave quickly in the morning to make their shifts at the mine and stay out of the saloons until late at night

515
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,040
The widow is content to leave Horace to his vertebrae and his cat enjoys her company when he is away

516
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,660
After drinking his coffee and reading the papers Horace heads to his shale

517
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,440
Following the creek a short distance out of town

518
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,600
He comes to the rocky outcropping that he hopes holds the answers to his most burning questions

519
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
And so Horace begins his work

520
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,360
He chips and digs at his shale looking for signs of the monsters who once roamed this land

521
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,480
It has been months and he has found nothing like the vertebrae that first brought him here

522
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,920
They plainly belonged to a mosasaurus, but he had never seen or read of any specimens so large

523
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,400
Local children will sometimes come down after their morning chores to help the crazy old professor sift through his rocks and mud

524
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,600
But on this day is alone by the early evening

525
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,540
He has found no signs of his mosasaurus and returns to town

526
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,440
Making a point to stop by the hotel restaurant to enjoy his supper before changing out of his muddy clothes

527
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,520
He cleans himself at the boarding house and reads the evening papers with the widow while he's he had sleeps in his lap

528
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,080
He retires to his room where he will read or respond to one of his many professional

529
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:54,120
Correspondents or diagram as vertebrae hearing the young boarders returning from the saloon. He knows it is time to retire

530
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,360
He tells easy at good night

531
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:02,880
Scratches his head and turns out his lamp and as soon as it's dark you hear one of your young minor

532
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,800
neighbors drunkenly going on about one of his ex-colleagues a

533
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,400
Regular gambler at the saloon who is counted among those recently missing in

534
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,120
contention I

535
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
Swear God is my witness

536
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,400
Thomas told me in confidence. He said he he said found oil down there

537
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,500
But like it was alive

538
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,240
Like moving and breathing in the light

539
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,760
Last week last we all saw of him. He was arguing loudly up in mr. Cole's office

540
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,300
And then it was it was just silent. No, I'm not saying shit to

541
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,940
Anyone about that cuz I don't want to be the next one missing

542
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:54,540
So that's why I'm not gonna die. I'm not going to that meeting. No, I'm not gonna go

543
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:01,860
I'm not but that I'm not telling anyone. No, no, no, no one I wouldn't tell I I mean, yeah

544
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,780
I might know more but I'm not telling anyone am I know I'm not

545
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:12,740
Just cuz Thomas is all missing and shit cuz he's arguing with mr. Cole

546
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:19,060
Hmm seems a fellow named Thomas is missing from from his normal gambling

547
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:26,180
Habits and and mine working after finding a living oil and arguing with mr. Cole

548
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,900
I'll file that away

549
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,820
living living oil

550
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:37,020
That could be something that's what dinosaurs are now dinosaurs are birds Zach. Fuck wait

551
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,720
So does that mean dinosaurs aren't real? Yeah

552
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,040
If birds came from dinosaurs, then why are they still dinosaurs?

553
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,680
Luke

554
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,160
What up, what are you learning learning like larva Joe said

555
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,800
It's fucking nasty Joe said they're wiggling around your

556
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,920
Character description day in the life writing assignment

557
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,400
Was so good that it like made him feel like he had to take it up a notch when he wrote his good

558
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,840
I'm glad yours is still the best one though. Do you want to describe your character? Yeah, my

559
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,840
My character is Ephraim Cortland

560
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,320
Judge Ephraim Cortland. He is a very tall large man

561
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,480
43 years old but looks

562
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,200
Looking at him. You don't you couldn't really tell how old he is. He's just

563
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,740
Just a disgusting. He's a slop of a human. He's a slop. He barely takes care of himself

564
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,720
Just soars all over him from like barely washing and not washing his clothes

565
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:01,400
Always has like grease and food in his mustache and on his face. He's always sweaty

566
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,680
Greasy hair dirty fingernails and

567
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:14,820
Hands just fucking gross is his guys deal. Why is he so nasty? Well, he was a well-respected judge

568
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:21,960
Fair and well respected but about six years ago his wife and his daughter died from cholera

569
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,380
And that pretty much is a redone. Yeah, he always

570
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,000
Boils his water before he drinks it now. Does he have taste buds?

571
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:37,560
He probably not because he smokes he smoked cigars. He smokes hand-rolled cigarettes

572
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,960
He chews tobacco. He's known to make he's known to make tea with tobacco. Oh

573
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,400
He uses that as a chaser for his whiskey

574
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,640
He always keeps iced fully stocked bar with really nice whiskey

575
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,720
But he he buys nice stuff so that people don't think he's a drunk

576
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:04,000
Yeah, so people think he's classy but he is a drunk drinks heavily throughout the day always has a he's got a

577
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,520
flask on him

578
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:11,240
It's a metal flask like bound with leather and on on the flask. It says

579
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,360
to EC

580
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,360
from our EC with love

581
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,560
Ruth Ruth Courtland was his wife

582
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,380
So he keeps that it's very special to him always filled with whiskey

583
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:29,540
How big is it how big is the flask yeah think of like a regular flask

584
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:35,820
Four times that big so it's like it can fit a hell of a lot of whiskey in it

585
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:41,380
So I needed to buy a flask when I was 16 years old. Yeah, not for drinking purposes

586
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,060
But because I was playing

587
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,700
Taney Zuko in Grease at my high school's production, of course

588
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:54,180
and I needed a flask got that lead as a sophomore baby, and so I

589
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,740
And so I went to an antique store and I bought a flask and I thought to myself this is kind of a big flask

590
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:05,460
But I didn't I didn't drink that much so you didn't really know when I was 16. It was like

591
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:12,900
Stealing nips from people's parents basements and such right, but I learned later when I used that flask

592
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:17,020
It held half a fifth of shit. Yeah, that's

593
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:23,780
375 milliliters, I'd say that's about yeah half a fifth is what this can can hold

594
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,780
He always has it on him his clothes that he wears since he is a judge

595
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,500
Usually like three-piece suits and stuff, but they have not been washed or taken care of

596
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:37,460
He has no intention of buying any new clothes. So they're ratty and holes and stuff in them

597
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:43,400
He always make sure there's an inner pocket for his flask though. Of course. All right, read me this read me this thing, baby

598
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,740
Judge Ephraim Courtland wakes up in his comfy puffy leather chair

599
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,640
The greasy plate is broken on the ground beside him missing the half pound of bacon

600
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:00,520
It held the night before which was eaten far too quickly by the judge and washed down with a half a bottle of expensive whiskey

601
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:08,280
Ephraim wipes his face with the back of his sleeve smearing grease and bits of bacon into his salt and pepper horseshoe mustache

602
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:15,060
His stomach churns out a low gurgle like the sound of that sweet black gold when it bubbles up from the earth

603
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:22,120
Ephraim struggles to stand up from his chair the effects of the whiskey from the night before have not yet worn off and his weight does

604
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,040
Not help the cause as he rises up from the chair

605
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,600
His top hat scrapes the roof of his modest home

606
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:35,660
His 43 year old bones hold him up at 6 foot 10 and carries a little over 300 pounds of booze and pork filled fat

607
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:43,980
The man looks like he's falling apart as if his skin was one paper cut away from expelling the rotten insides and decaying flesh

608
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:50,560
he takes his top hat off and bends over holding the makeshift barf bag expectantly in front of him a

609
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:57,700
Minute passes but the only bodily fluid in the hat is sweat that is profusely dripping off the man's balding head

610
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,420
He tosses the hat to the ground and strips down naked

611
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:06,900
He boils water for a bath buying some half-cooked bacon left on the dining table from the night before

612
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:14,660
Against his better judgment. He finishes the undercooked fatty pork before the flies can after breakfast

613
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,640
He decides against a hot bath. It's much too hot already

614
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:23,520
He half-heartedly washes himself in a cool bath just enough to be almost presentable for court

615
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,620
He comes as long graying patchy hair across his head and oils up his mustache

616
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,580
He picks up an earthy tweed three-piece suit off the floor and dresses himself

617
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,380
Bending over to put on his socks and shoes

618
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:43,760
He feels dizzy his top hat finally fulfills its purpose as he empties his guts into his felt and silk wastebasket

619
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,540
He straightens himself up feeling much better and removes a flask from his jacket

620
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:53,020
He drains the flask in one goal that fills it with a half empty bottle from the night before

621
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,980
He takes one last swig from the bottle switches it around his mouth

622
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:03,220
Gargles and spits it into the top hat he tucks his flask back into his suit jacket and heads toward the door

623
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,540
As he walks outside, he figures it to be around noon

624
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:12,260
He was due at the courthouse at 9, but he knows he will be fine as he is the only judge for miles

625
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:18,920
Plus the townsfolk won't get too upset if they can't pay their fine for not hitching their horse or getting unruly at the bar

626
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,400
Did he put his hat back on no, thank God

627
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:31,360
It's like what the fuck no, does he wash out his hat? No, I just leave it just leaves it on the floor

628
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:36,640
Okay, so we're gonna cut back to about a week ago. This is a few days before

629
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,240
one of the gamblers

630
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,760
disappeared and

631
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,400
A couple of them got into a got a pretty unruly

632
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:50,080
Unruly enough to where one of them was locked up at the courthouse and

633
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,920
Courtland is walking through and this guy

634
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,360
completely

635
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,040
He's got mine face not mine

636
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,120
Yeah, but he's kind of my main because his hands are up against the bars in front of him

637
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,640
But there's actual bars there. So he's really good at miming, right?

638
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,740
And he sticks his head in between two of the bars

639
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,940
His eyes get really big and he's like, you know

640
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,260
Mrs. Cole she ain't human

641
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,100
Ephraim just looks at the guy and

642
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:41,360
like the guys holding on to the bars of the prison cell and he just punches his fingers into the

643
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,320
bar of the

644
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,280
Cell and you just hear the laughter continue as this man

645
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,520
backs away into the darkness of his cell

646
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:00,840
He kind of eyes the guy and just stops for a second and then continues walking

647
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,920
back to the day in question

648
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:10,080
Ephraim still gazing up at the blaring Sun whistles a long loud note and clicks his tongue a

649
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:17,200
Colossal shiny brown and white Clydesdale saunters over and looks at the judge. We're late. Hey, mister

650
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:25,600
Let's go the juxtaposition of this elegant well-groomed horse and the off-putting nauseating giant of a man confuses the locals

651
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,880
How could a man like that own that horse?

652
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,980
Ephraim Courtland mounts the horse effortlessly his grace opposite of everything else in his life

653
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:41,300
He takes off at breakneck speed on his steed kicking up an enormous dust cloud as he races towards the courthouse

654
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:47,980
As he rides, there are only two things on his mind his horse and how many men he wants to hang today

655
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,060
And when Ephraim gets to the courthouse

656
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:01,820
When he walks in he goes to flip on the lights the new electrical system has made

657
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:10,000
Electrical lighting possible here in the courthouse. Thanks to all Silas Cole the genius and contention and as you flip them on there's nothing

658
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,820
What's wrong what oh oh gosh, oh no, I'm sorry mister

659
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:29,540
Um, it's just that it seems to be that the the copper wiring has been stolen paralegal comes running up

660
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:35,100
Yes, no, um, it seems to be that all the copper wiring has been stolen out from the courthouse

661
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:40,820
Nighttime why I don't know but it might be worth it to bring it up at the meeting today

662
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:44,900
How do you know who told you what is this and I grab it out of her hands?

663
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,940
And you see that there's a letter

664
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,900
Requesting your presence at the town hall meeting at the church to discuss

665
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:58,420
Disappearances what time is the meeting? You're already late. Well, I'm

666
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,980
As I'll be going over there and

667
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:10,380
Fix the fucking lights and I walk out and get back on my horse and right over to the town hall meeting

668
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,060
quickly fast

669
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,420
Oh

670
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,420
Oh

671
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,420
You know

672
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,420
Oh

673
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,420
Oh

674
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:29,340
Can't you have wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around my poor little darling

675
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,860
I'm afraid they'll get my darling

676
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:39,300
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around my poor little darling

677
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,860
I'm afraid they'll get my darling

678
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,340
You
