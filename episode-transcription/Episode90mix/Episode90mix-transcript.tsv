167640	169640	Oh
183120	189080	Standing behind a heavy wooden lectern is a young man wearing a thick
189840	193780	Hand-stitched suit at the neck of his white shirt
193840	197060	He sports the collar of a preacher and
197580	203300	Pinned on his breast pocket. There is a shiny gold star
204420	208300	words along the bottom of the screen read
209260	211260	contention
211340	213220	1880 something
213220	219340	This fresh-faced kid steps back from the pulpit and begins to walk down the aisle of this
219380	222420	His house of the Lord as he speaks
223140	225140	directly into camera
225660	230540	Howdy there folks. My name is Bobby custard. Welcome to contention
231300	238020	Nuzzled here in the middle of prosperous farms and ranches this dusty mining town of contention sits
238460	246100	We were doing a okay for a mining town, but then this fella no, no not a fella bona fide genius
246100	250540	Well, he came along and turned contention not only into one of the most successful
251060	257580	Mining operations this side of the long wet one, but one of the most modern pounds of round
258340	266020	Silas Cole showed up one day is just a minor and before long he was inventing and doing all sorts of business
267060	273120	After he bought the mine, he electrified my church here and the courthouse and the schoolhouse, too
273700	280060	Mr. Cole surely is a gift from above you'll meet him eventually if you stick around long enough
280860	282500	but don't
282500	286380	Don't make eye contact or any sudden movements
286380	291640	He's real skittish like always on the edge of another brilliant discovery
291640	297900	I'd imagine and his wife Mary what a gem she founded contentions first library
298580	307060	contentions got more learned folks than ever before which is a big asset in my humble opinion being there is far less crime and
307100	311940	I don't have to do all the Bible reading during service. I
312780	318700	Will say though. This is a bit of an unfortunate time to be here in contention. See
319580	322780	We done had a handful of disappearances lately
323460	324660	nothing wild
324660	331940	usual suspects the whole saloon staff and the bartender miss kitty piano player a few gamblers the town drunk
331940	336340	You know if half of them went missing in one go not sure anyone will bat an eye
337060	338740	but almost ten folks
338740	340740	within the span of a week
340740	344340	Well, a few of the townsfolk are getting a little worrisome
345020	350300	Not that I blame them. So we're hosting a town hall meeting today here at the church
350300	357940	So anyone with information can talk open and we can have a vote on the best course of action moving forward now
357940	362380	I got a dust before this place is full, but we'll see you real soon. Yeah
367860	372620	Welcome to contention in the 1880s. It's the Old West boys
375460	377460	Giddy up
380260	385020	Giddy up in what in tarnation everybody's saying yeehaw, but not asking hi
391300	396380	But I love it well, hey Luke, how are you I'm doing real good

405900	411060	We're on we're on for I practiced. I yelled in the shower at myself
411380	417200	And then I just assumed mine would come out when it started. So yeah same but it's always worked for all of us before
418460	424180	Like to let the voice find me generic southern accents have taken us this far as X. Yeah
424180	426180	Yeah
426620	430460	I'm doubling down on it tonight. That's that's my my only inspiration
431460	437860	The Old West scenario, I'm gonna be method acting so we're gonna have to find a way to record without audacity or laptops or anything
440320	443800	You just need to get Luke some some like mule blinders
445660	453020	Close my eyes all time. I'm down boy. Calm down now. Stay focused. Just talk straight forward. Don't look now. Oh, he saw a computer
454820	460460	Hail is that he's going wild as hell y'all for whole sanity roll sanity. Why is that picture so bright?
462580	465460	That's what horses do right? Yeah
469260	476200	Invented when were donkeys invented Mountain Dew Mountain Dew but what sound donkeys make whilst they drink a do
476200	482780	It might have been around in the 1880s. It's one of the older ones. Let's see Mountain Dew was introduced in 1940
482780	486020	Yeah, but wasn't Mountain Dew a slang term for not
487460	493780	Dude disambiguation. Yeah moonshine cuz that's why they called it that because it tastes like
495140	497760	Everyone knows when you slug down some Mountain Dew
502260	508060	Notes of moonshine hit you in the mountain do is not smooth at all. It's so fucking aggressive
508220	511880	There's a song from 1882 called the rare old Mountain Dew
512780	517220	And there's also a 2011 song called diet Mountain Dew by Lana Del Rey
519740	524500	Sing the first one for us. Okay, let me find it. We should see if we can get the second one for the theme
526880	531580	Hey Lana Del Rey, she's from Missouri, right? Yeah, Jad counts, right?
531580	537060	She's from Sykes ten has Brad Brad Pitt wrote any songs that we can throw him on
537500	540380	Local musician Brad Pitt. He's an actor

553620	555620	Well, I already looked at memory
556460	559580	I don't know. I can't do it
561260	563260	Have you seen my Mountain Dew
564660	566660	It's rare

571900	578080	It's rare you gotta put more well you're never that is damn good keep going. I don't know the rest of the lyrics
578080	584780	That's the only ones. Oh, well, the chorus would be easy to sing. Hi. Di diddly diddle arm diddly doodle
584780	589900	I don't um diddly do ride diddle of my day. Did you look at him? Yeah
590620	596820	For it fills the air with a perfume rare and betwixt both me and you as home
596820	602220	We stroll we can take a bowl or a bucket of the Mountain Dew
603460	605460	Mountain
609960	616160	Bring me my spits bucket. I wanted to taste the Mountain Dew fresh. Oh, that's Justin talking right now
616160	618160	Oh
621120	623120	Yeah, Thomas
623800	628900	It's very Irish sounding the song. Oh, I thought you were talking about Justin. I was like, he's not
633360	636600	Well, he did hatch from a space egg
640520	642520	You guys found me outside
647000	649000	The
650120	654920	Remember that is because we have the VHS tape that was sent to us of us finding him
656120	663600	Since it's like a planted memory. Yeah, but thankfully that tape included a great montage of the four of us raising him
665080	667480	So even if we didn't have the memories
667480	672360	It's kind of like we got to see what it was like and let me tell you there was a lot of love
672360	678760	I remember when you guys when Zach got a big green egg to smoke meat in and I just tried to climb on in that
678760	680760	Bad boy. Oh my god
681240	683240	Got so singed
689120	693520	That was sex nickname for for Justin hams
695620	702280	Hamilton has just come out. Of course, right? Yeah, it's a good year for ham related content
702360	704360	and
704880	707400	Justin just wouldn't stop with this political rap
709920	711920	He also made us go see
712640	714640	Shit, what's that pig called?
714920	716120	babe
716120	718120	No the cartoon
718400	720400	Peppa Peppa Pig. Yeah
720960	722960	It would have been better if I could remember
723760	726960	I was gonna say a pig but it's that's Looney Tunes
727880	729880	indeed
729880	735720	Looney Tunes indeed. Did you ever bartend a Peppa Pig show? No, I didn't
735720	741000	Yeah, I made the mistake of doing that once I always signed up for the ones that I thought were country singers
741000	748240	But then one dude's name sounded so much like a country singer and it turned out to be a Christian magician
750880	752880	So I made no money
752880	758000	Did he try to give you was he like here's your tip and when you reach for it, he like made it disappear and you're like
760560	762560	Along with my face
763280	769720	It was like Peppa Pig I guess did some kind of tour like a live music thing was like a hologram
770120	772120	No, it was like people
774280	776520	Peppa Pig dying brutally
776640	783580	Anyway, it was like mostly candy and popcorn sales and then like the same seven dads getting really drunk
787040	789240	Tips were not great except from those guys
790120	793760	Christian magician was just a lot of homeschool jokes. All right
796600	800040	All right, everybody get off the fucking call except Joe do we just leave
801040	803840	Just go ahead and leave and I'll text you one at a time
804360	809360	Okay, just go ahead and just go and leave. He's next. I'll send text. It'll go
810240	815600	Joe and then it'll be Justin and then it'll be
816120	819000	Thomas and then it'll be Luke cool. I can play a game
820000	823320	Just text me. Bye. Bye. Okey-dokey. Joe. I'm gonna go pee real quick
824360	831560	Alrighty, Joe. I don't have my headphones on but I had no idea you're so fucking humongous. You're a monster
833160	837400	Wait, sorry, it's Luke. It's humongous. Not you. Oh, that's what you're referring to
837400	842520	I thought you were talking about like me positioned in my camera or something. No, I was talking I was reading the characters
842520	847800	He is he's a bit. I thought I was reading yours, but it looks for the audience and he's a monster man
849880	851880	Zach don't put this in
865480	867320	Joe Terry
867320	872280	Tell me what you know, what time counter is your audacity yet?
872280	877040	My time counter on audacity is at 19 minutes and almost 30 seconds cool
877640	884520	Have any missing time no missing time the missing time like we had when we found
884840	886840	Justin's egg pod. I
888760	891080	Do miss when he was suckle at my teat I
895640	901640	Just pictured it I'm like looking at him on the chat and he doesn't know we're talking about it. It's just like
904400	906400	Picturing him all up on that nip and
907040	909040	Oh
909800	912280	Well, we can play hard right yeah
914000	920200	Did that make sense did you understand what I meant nope Edie didn't exist in the 1880s, let's get going
920520	922720	your character's name is
923880	931340	Everett Pace, I've asked you to give me a rundown of who your character is and you wrote something so beautiful. Thank you
931340	933240	I was I was
933240	938580	Taken by surprise you asked you we have a group chat and you asked for us to present a day in the life of a
938580	944300	Character and Luke was actually the first one to present one and it was the best written thing. I'd read in a long time
944960	947380	It made me think oh shit. I gotta write something now
947380	950160	I actually he sent it to me, you know
950160	957220	Like a private message and I was like you have to send this to the group so that they know what they're up against
957560	961960	Yeah, I did not meet the challenge, but I did write a good couple paragraphs
962000	966980	Oh, I absolutely love what you've written and let's dive into it. Yeah, okay
967080	970900	So no one knows how long Everett Pace has been in that old
971340	975240	Low slung sod house on the bald spot of the hill just outside of town
975600	978360	He's just always been up there old Everett folks
978360	982820	don't see him too often in town except for the few times he wanders in to restock his coffee and
983120	988920	Ammo supply and once or twice a year when he ventures to the saloon for a drink as though he's celebrating something
989200	990840	No one ever bothers him though
990840	998140	He just looks off an unruly mess of long gray beard and an attempt at a greasy comb over on top
998400	1003700	He's got a sickly dirty complexion and walks with an uneasy slightly hunched shuffle
1004000	1009960	But his eyes are bright and wild and fiery and only add to how off-putting his whole presence can be
1010360	1013500	The town folk do catch glimpses of him up on the hill though
1014100	1016660	He's often tending to a sprawling garden
1017180	1019180	Butchering the day's hunt or chopping wood
1019580	1023980	he looks so old and frail but each pull of the hoe a cleave of the cleaver a
1024180	1028540	Swing of the axe reveals muscles that have been at least tuned to the work for ages
1029540	1035060	Mothers in town use Everett as a boogeyman telling their children if they wander too far at night
1035060	1041980	He might snatch them and can them up like the radishes and Brussels sprouts in his cellar and the kids believe it because they can't
1041980	1043980	tell when or if
1044260	1045980	Everett sleeps a
1045980	1052260	flicker of a lantern in the wee hours of the night and the occasional but sudden crack of a rifle being fired off towards something
1052420	1056400	Unseen and unheard makes the kids pull the covers up extra tight at night
1056400	1062200	And so while these kids are pulling their covers right above their chins up over their noses
1062200	1064900	Like you're supposed to wear your fucking masks
1065980	1067980	Sorry
1070020	1072020	So many under the nose
1072700	1077580	Just right over the nose they're holding their their sheets tight and
1078460	1080500	They're thinking about Everett
1081020	1088060	Who is what is he doing at night when he's got his lantern out? Does he have his rifle?
1088660	1093380	With him like what? What is he what is he doing? Is he out on his property? Is he inside the house?
1093700	1098700	Can they see the lantern just bobbing along the lantern flickers from within the house?
1098700	1103380	I mean that's what the kids are definitely questioning if you want the answer
1103380	1108060	It's that he's uh, he's he's lived his life on this land protecting it as his own
1108540	1111980	it's it's his his parcel in this world and
1112700	1114100	He he guards it
1114100	1119260	he he'll uh, he'll stay awake at night to make sure the crops don't get to and he'll he'll shoot a wolf if he sees
1119260	1121260	one coming up or a
1121540	1123780	Raccoon or any sort of thing that
1124540	1127500	Threatens his and it's exactly on one of these nights
1128140	1130140	Everett hears a
1130420	1135500	Grumbling in the distance and it's on his land and Everett
1136020	1142180	Everett knows exactly what direction it's in. It's not it's not where the animals are. It's not where his garden is
1142620	1148000	Ever doesn't have animals just for the record. Oh, sorry. No animals you kill you kill by the day
1148100	1149380	He lives off the land
1149380	1152200	So he's he's doing a lot of his own gardening and stuff
1152200	1158780	But he hunts at when he can and then just like keeps the meat until he's like needs to go back out and restock up
1158900	1161380	Yep, damn, that's fucking cool. We're
1162020	1163820	different now as
1163820	1165820	humans
1167900	1173140	So I'm hearing a low rumbling somewhere and you hear scratching and you hear earth
1173940	1180100	Moving and you know that it is coming from the direction of a spot in the ground
1180740	1184500	Where there is a cross made out of sticks
1185300	1190620	Planted what is that spot Everett? Well, that's where that's where I'm up
1191460	1194260	That's where that's where Claire is buried. That's what
1195500	1197580	Why would there be a sound over there?
1198540	1202900	He's you know, maybe shuffle over there a little bit and in the darkness
1203780	1205740	your old eyes
1205740	1210940	Do you have anything that would let you like? Yeah, I've got a decent spot hidden
1211340	1217060	I've got a decent listen either one of those. I'll do my spot hidden. I mean I say decent it's 45
1217060	1219600	Did I mention in my description that my guy is an old man? Oh
1220120	1226900	No, I don't think you did. He's 65 or 68 years old and he's kind of frail in general
1227580	1229580	I
1229620	1232660	Thought there's a chance for a birthday at some point in this
1239020	1244220	Okay, I'm doing spot hidden at a 45 and I pass 20 you can't
1245180	1248140	I'm not sure you can go ahead and roll sanity
1251260	1257140	That's also a cool character quirk of this guy he's already kind of weird in life people already assume that he's weird
1257220	1261660	He thinks of himself as kind of a loner and a weirdo. He's kind of open to weird shit
1261660	1265660	So he's got the highest sanity of a character. I've ever played at 80
1266380	1268380	80. Oh, yeah
1269700	1274500	And I pass a 26 well your eyes don't lie, you know what you see
1275020	1280180	You see Miss Kitty one of the saloon workers who had gone missing
1280620	1284740	He'd gone missing about a week ago. Yeah. Okay. The town is all
1285420	1286300	Ah
1286300	1288100	Half up in arms about it
1288100	1292260	Some of them don't give a shit because it's a lot of the ruffians that have gone missing
1292260	1295460	but there were a fair amount of disappearances to the point to where people are
1296180	1298220	Starting to kind of maybe get concerned
1298860	1299980	concerned
1299980	1301740	concerned
1301740	1307740	The sound is actually another degree higher. So that's exactly exactly because now they know that it more of
1307740	1309740	them
1313100	1317860	Miss Kitty is digging with her hands into the grave
1318380	1322540	Miss Kitty, what are you? What are you doing? Miss Kitty get up. How far off is this?
1322540	1328460	And where are you in your house? I'm curious. He was probably standing at his doorstep when he heard the sounds. Mm-hmm
1328460	1333060	So the grave is I would I pictured it. It's like I said, he's on a bald spot
1333060	1338500	I would picture it near the tree lines. So maybe like 20 yards like he's got a good plot up there
1338500	1344140	Sure, so maybe 20 yards away up by the tree line. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and roll listen for me as you haul her out
1348820	1356860	Fuck I fail a 47 on a 40. There's some sort of murmuring happening underneath the breath of Miss Kitty
1357140	1359140	just kind of like
1359140	1361140	I
1362660	1364340	Keep approaching
1364340	1368020	Miss Kitty, they're looking for you in town in there. Where are you being?
1368740	1373580	Get out of there. You don't need to be digging around in there. She hears you coming looks up wide-eyed
1374300	1381940	Looks down and then she's just gonna run away away ever. It's fine with that. That was just a yeah, it's weird
1382420	1386060	Miss Kenny come back there. Look they're looking for you in town. Where are you?
1386980	1392740	Miss Kenny and as ever it goes back into his home. Does he wrap up? Does he sleep?
1392740	1393180	No
1393180	1394740	So this is based on a real thing
1394740	1396380	I read that they think that
1396380	1402900	Back in the day of a person's sleep cycle was much more of a farming cycle that they would take like a lot of naps
1402980	1404980	But be awake for a lot of the night
1405300	1412320	Because they had to protect their areas. So he's he's a he's awake a lot of the night. I love it
1412320	1415820	I love it. Yeah, I love you. I love you too that
1416380	1419340	I'm getting in the car baby. I'm getting in the car. I'm coming over there
1420860	1422860	Wear your fucking mask
1423980	1425980	For the beginning
1435900	1442860	Justin is my friend and he's got headphones on and he's on the podcast and I'm very happy
1442860	1446140	What the fuck just happened?
1448460	1450460	Welcome to Pretending To Be People
1451020	1453020	What kind of show is this?
1455540	1458300	This is the show where we talk to each other
1459220	1465740	But not as each other because even in our friendships we rarely talk about things that matter
1466100	1470700	It's always bullshit. So we may as well have a podcast where we're completely different people
1470700	1474140	I've never known the true Zach. So why I'd start getting to know him now
1478460	1483020	Please don't what's your character's name? You won't love me if you know me
1484460	1488720	Old Zach, you don't want no one to know him real good
1490100	1492100	Get get a heart hurt again
1492100	1494100	Oh
1496980	1504540	My character's name is Jack Perlman. Oh, yeah, that's a sexy name. I know right it kind of sounds like a porn name
1506140	1508620	Absolutely sounds like a porn name just like
1509200	1515520	Ron Perlman. Oh, is that who you've based his character off of? No, just the name Ron Perlman's great
1515560	1521800	He's great fan. My man isn't a lumbering giant with a bellowing voice like Ron Perlman
1522200	1524200	documentary he was in
1524300	1525920	Hellboy
1525920	1532040	And then the second documentary Hellboy 2 and then the comic based on the documentary. I
1533200	1540400	Love it when people make comics based on documentaries. I can't wait for that March of the Penguins graphic novel to come out fine
1541920	1549020	I've been reading some non-stop. Oh, yeah. I heard the I heard the Watchmen guys doing the March of the Penguins. So
1552400	1558120	So I asked you all to write a thing about your character
1558640	1562880	Day in the life if you a quick description day in the life kind of situation. Yes
1563760	1565760	Tell me about
1566000	1568000	Jack Perlman
1569880	1575720	Jack every time every time the name Jack Perlman has said I'm gonna edit in those two noise
1575720	1578440	Yeah, that's both at the same time. Like yeah combined
1578760	1581280	So we same time it same time it like we always
1583000	1588920	Okay, yeah, oh I thought we were gonna be truthful with oh, yeah, it's we're working on we're trying to get in sync
1589320	1594260	It's hard. Oh god. Okay. Yeah, Jack Perlman. He's a
1594880	1598560	He's just hit his 40s graying ever so slightly
1599200	1604520	Dark tan skin from manual labor. He's a he's a rancher
1604880	1608920	But unlike a lot of other ranchers he tends to do a lot of stuff by himself
1609680	1611680	He hasn't really found
1612240	1616080	Help that he would consider up to his his standards
1616880	1624160	Basically runs the whole shindig himself. He wakes up quite early in the morning probably 4 or 5 a.m. At the crack of dawn
1624600	1630480	Mm-hmm feeds his two dogs Chuck and Bob who are scruffy mutts that he took in
1630840	1633680	Makes a strong pot of coffee and a big ol
1634560	1637220	Biscuit breakfast to start his day off, right?
1637960	1642000	He mainly raises and trains horses, which he which he loves dearly
1642720	1650680	Few cows here and there and some goats just for the extra cash, but he really loves the the majesty of a big ol horse
1654560	1659640	He often a lot of the day is like, you know maintaining raising them
1660200	1662040	Checking him out making sure their health's good
1662040	1667800	He patrols the area for any trouble cuz I assume he has like a big swath of land that he has to you know
1667800	1669480	mend fences
1669480	1672920	Wrangle a lot of mending a lot of wrangle in a lot of mending
1673600	1679000	But at the end of the day, he either goes to the bar to grab a drink or seven
1679640	1681640	having an excellent time or
1682880	1689040	Alternatively, he stays completely home with a book sitting on his porch with his dogs
1689680	1691680	only lit by the light of the lantern and
1692000	1695640	The the glow that reflects off a bottle of whiskey
1695640	1702760	So let's cut to a scene about a week ago on one of the nights where you ended up at the saloon to have
1703640	1705880	one or two or
1706560	1708400	seven
1708400	1712800	It's hard to keep track after roll a d10. Let's see how many drinks you've had at this point. Oh
1712800	1714280	Oh
1714280	1716880	Where the fuck did I put my dad up Justin?
1717520	1724560	Justin you amateur we're playing a role-playing game Justin the role stands for you roll the dice
1728920	1730920	Can you talk about voice from now on
1730920	1732920	I
1735720	1737720	Can't stop smiling
1739920	1742520	Help me Justin has me trapped here
1744760	1751720	Boom d10 five drinks in five drinks in a good number. That's a fair amount of drinks now
1752440	1756200	Just say now roll a d4 for how many hours it's been
1757200	1764520	Three hours, that's actually not bad. That's not bad at all. I'm averaging about two per hour. Yeah, that's a that's a fun night
1764520	1766520	Yeah, that's that's his preferred
1767040	1771680	Jack's preferred is to do that, but it doesn't always go down like that
1771960	1778660	Sometimes people bet you like, you know that you can't do ten shots in a row and you really need four dollars
1780120	1783960	Hey, man, it's 1880 something four dollars
1783960	1788720	Four dollars is mad money. I don't know. I don't know the conversion
1788720	1790440	I should I bet it's real good
1790440	1794960	I played Red Dead Redemption and it seemed like four dollars was a lot of money
1795040	1800720	some of the guns on here were like nine dollars, so I'm gonna say four dollars here is a
1802000	1806800	105 100 bucks. That's I'd yeah, would you do ten shots for a hundred bucks? No
1809160	1813280	Not now, yeah, yeah cuz I know I just get extremely sick
1813960	1819880	How many hours do I know one of waste $100 for a day gone like a whole day?
1819880	1823520	I would be useless maybe even two these days
1823520	1827920	I can't keep up when I was a young man ten shots
1828120	1831680	Did you mean when we a hundred dollars when we first met each other?
1832440	1834440	Four years ago. Yeah
1835920	1836960	Child
1836960	1843520	Four years ago. Let's dive in here. Yeah, you're kind of leaning up against the piano
1844040	1849880	in the saloon and the piano player is not playing right now cuz no one's paid him is that he's a jukebox and
1850520	1854880	He needs to get money in order to play song. So it's dead silent right now
1854880	1861280	So he's just talking to one of the gamblers who's around here and he's like, oh, yeah, no, I swear to God bad
1861280	1866960	It's a girl teenage girl walking around the new mine over there at night
1867040	1873080	Not a chance married be happy about that and the other guy's like no shit
1873480	1877000	You saw a teenage girl over there at that new mine
1877000	1882120	I don't think Silas had to have the balls do something like that and the other piano players like
1884600	1889920	He owns this town and do whatever he wants if he wants to have a new girl ever done the walk
1889920	1892120	That's right. What's random and
1892800	1900040	The guy's like I just don't see it happening that Mary Cole is a stand-up woman a good
1900200	1905160	Smart head on top of them their shoulders that she's got nice broad strong
1905160	1911200	like could easily take a man like Silas cause she truly wanted to and there's no reason she
1911680	1915320	would want to deal with that kind of nonsense in his
1916320	1918480	Blessed life praise be Lord
1925200	1927200	Does Jack join in the conversation at all
1927720	1935080	Jack's not a big fan of gossip of any kind gosh just slinging on and there's here but he does he does like listening
1935080	1936320	He just doesn't like
1936320	1940640	Participating so he's kind of he's keeping an ear on because he wants to know what's going on in the town
1940640	1947560	But he also so cutting back to this night. You've got your option here. Are you out at the bar again?
1948080	1955360	This is about a week later, or are you hanging out on the porch with your dogs lantern and bottle of whiskey a week later
1955400	1960840	What's the what's the weather like this? Oh, it's a buggy muggy motherfucker. I
1963360	1970420	Think he just goes to the bar if if the weather's not like nicer sitting outside then he'll head to the bar
1970680	1975000	There's a nice cool breeze. He'll take it outside and kind of chill but you know, you know how
1975840	1977840	Ranchers in the Old West love to chill
1978320	1981040	Take it mad easy. Keep it mad posse
1982480	1984480	It's the Old West bro
1985800	1990720	Yeah, I heard that they they they had a net that they would have to keep the bugs out
1990720	1994320	There was on a stick and they were just you know
1995340	1997340	Net stick and chill
1997720	1999720	Oh my god
2001240	2003240	That was a bad one
2004240	2009460	But I appreciate it cuz you put a lot of thought into it I put a little thought into it
2009460	2011920	So as you're coming home from the bar
2011920	2017000	What do you ride I think just like a good old strong
2017000	2021960	I can't remember the differences between the horses. I used to actually kind of know from old red dead
2021960	2027160	But it's like it's like one of those like it's a larger than average like strong
2027600	2033520	Horse a good like worker horse. That's like my I don't care about that. What's its name? Oh, what's its name?
2034840	2041320	No, I do care. But also what's its name Jeremiah? Oh, yeah, so you're riding Jeremiah back and you hear a
2042920	2044920	Oh
2047520	2051440	Coming from the field that you own and you know
2052240	2056840	It's the right here attempted a horse. It's the crying of a horse
2062880	2064880	I don't know what they sound like
2065960	2069320	Was that a sound of a horse or is that yeah, you're you're okay
2069320	2071840	You know, I didn't know there's an old man dying
2080360	2083320	All right, so you hear this as you're approaching your home
2083320	2089480	What do you do I kick up the speed swords the source of the noise roll alertness for me?
2089480	2096560	Oh, is there alertness in this game? Fuck we're playing down darker trails, which is the Old West
2097200	2102560	Setting for Call of Cthulhu and spot hidden baby old spot hidden, okay
2106640	2108640	Well, I rolled a 10
2109020	2113240	That'll probably be 16. Yeah. I was like I rolled a dick. Why was I doing?
2114360	2116360	amateur hour over here
2116400	2119040	Welcome to the show Justin get your shit together
2119680	2123520	You roll a 16 on spot hidden and as you're approaching
2123840	2128960	You're riding toward the noise and looking off into the distance. You see a thin
2129680	2130920	silhouette
2130920	2132400	dipping off
2132400	2134400	fast into the distance
2135120	2141360	40 50 yards away from this horse that is still 20 to 30 yards away from you
2141360	2143360	So almost a football field away
2143480	2149240	You see this this very slight figure that is just
2150080	2156400	Running and with that roll. You can see it's a humanoid but it's running like
2157240	2163900	Like a wild animal and you said it's like a football field away almost. Yeah. Hey, what'd you do to my horse?
2165440	2168720	Stop it will not stop it only continues
2168720	2172040	Is it cooking at a speed that I could catch up with it on horseback
2172440	2178240	Or is it so far away that it's like scurrying into the the wild it's heading into the wild at this point
2178240	2181560	But you could chase it through the wild if you could track it
2181920	2188040	Yeah, I don't feel comfortable doing that. I'm gonna go to where the horses are. I can kill you tonight if that's what yeah
2188040	2192640	I'm good. I don't have tracking and it's the night and there's a ghoulish
2193240	2195240	ghoul of some kind
2195400	2202640	No, but I'll go to the horse to go ahead and roll sanity for how fast this it's like it's inhumanely
2203040	2205040	exactly unhumanly fast
2205520	2207960	Well, I need to roll two dice, please
2211240	2215360	That's that's a 98 baby that's not gonna pass there does it though
2216480	2218480	No, I got no
2218500	2222080	Lose one sanity as you realize
2223040	2228440	There's something in contention that is not human and you look up at the stars
2228800	2232280	and it's a clear night sky and as you're kind of like
2234840	2236840	Toward this
2237640	2239640	Old man or sound
2241120	2242800	You know
2242800	2247120	The world isn't what you thought it might have been if something like that
2248040	2254720	Exists here and when you make it up to your horse, I need you to roll another sanity check because I'm surprised at how
2255320	2257320	injured it is
2258840	2260840	40 I pass whatever this thing was
2261480	2265160	It clearly was here for meat
2265840	2269600	It knew exactly where to shred the skin of
2270160	2275640	This horse to pull out the most muscle the quickest and there are
2276040	2283120	Just holes on the haunches and in the shoulders of this horse that is on the ground
2283120	2286720	You can kind of see through where its chest is
2287660	2294880	The muscle is completely missing and you can just see it's that the top rib on its left side
2294960	2296960	Where it's laying on its right?
2299600	2301600	I
2305000	2311040	Gently hop off my horse my damn dandelion. No, I
2314480	2317240	Walk up to it with my revolver and
2317920	2320140	I cock it and I look at it
2320680	2327280	I'm sorry, I couldn't be here for you when you needed me and with that I put dandelion out of its misery
2329800	2331800	Jack looks away
2332300	2335640	Sheathing or whatever he caught putting his gun back in his holster
2336160	2342480	wipes a couple tears away from his face and gets back on his horse to make the rounds to make sure
2342840	2344840	Everybody else is safe
2344840	2346840	I
2356960	2362880	Tell us Cox, what are your thoughts about the situation now? I can hear I said Thomas Cox
2363520	2366840	What are your thoughts about the situation at hand?
2367640	2371960	I don't know a whole lot about it Zack. It's the Old West
2372560	2378760	That I like that tell me about your character people are missing and that that won't stand
2381920	2385840	That's the thing we're gonna try to get to the bottom of here I bet it'll work out for us
2385840	2392160	I bet it will too. I've set this whole thing up to where you guys can look at Justin. I see meditating
2392160	2397200	That's what I thought too, but we're gonna look like assholes when we're talking about this on the podcast and he's just dead
2397860	2399860	There he goes
2400220	2402220	He moved
2403060	2405060	Thank God
2406300	2408500	Yeah, so hey I'm playing
2411740	2414860	Hold on I realized I never googled my character's name I
2415580	2418100	Did anybody terrible? Nope?
2418100	2423660	Okay, the guy who came up with the the he's the doctor who came up with the like air pathway
2424300	2429260	Thing where you shove a pin in somebody's throat and EpiPen or a trachea
2429980	2436780	Trachea and it's not spelled the same way. I immediately thought Horace Grant Oh Horace
2437580	2445820	Green oh shit is the school from rock. Okay. Well, I am I'm playing a professor Horace Green and he is a
2447620	2449620	Naturalist a paleontologist
2450500	2457420	He searches for ancient creatures from the past and they're fossils and and and they're remnants
2457940	2461540	Sick, does he just put bones together and call it what he thinks it is
2462580	2464580	some some
2465020	2469380	Huxters in his like profession do that, but he is a trained naturalist
2469380	2477300	he he's at the cutting edge of modern of modern theory when it comes to paleo biology and he
2477300	2483140	I don't know if that's a word back then but that's that's what he does man. That's what he lives and breathes
2483140	2489780	It's a word now. Mm-hmm. I'm not in character yet, so I can say it's not exactly I'm just trying to I'm just trying to
2489780	2495380	Clean it exactly who can say that before he was terribly killed by whatever
2495680	2500860	Delta green monsters Zach has in store for us that professor Horace Horace Green
2501580	2507300	Does not did not coin the term paleo biology and I asked you to write me a
2507980	2510140	Like a day not just for me
2510180	2514860	but also for you to get to learn about your character even more through the
2515340	2522500	Practice of writing this was actually helpful and also for the listeners to get to know your character even more
2522500	2527460	I was telling Joe earlier. This is the best decision we've ever made for
2528460	2532980	For writing new character direction, yeah instead of just doing it
2534700	2541180	Exactly, I really dig it. So yeah any give me what you got any DMS or GMs listening. This is a really good
2541660	2547340	This is a cool mechanic before you run a game that being said I didn't know it would be read publicly
2547340	2553180	So I will have to self-edit and clean this up as I go along because I sent Zach just a filthy
2553780	2556620	Version so it was mostly pictures crude
2557580	2563620	Crude scribblings really I was like wow. I know exactly who this character is
2564100	2566780	Professor Horace Green leaves his bed at 530
2566900	2570060	Although he has generally been awake for an hour or more at this point
2570500	2574920	Staring at the ceiling or the curtains or a sleeping cat easy it
2575460	2580560	Observing but not quite seeing these things as he lets his jumbled rush of thoughts flow freely
2580920	2583720	Until they have sorted themselves into something like order
2584160	2589120	He picks his way through the stacks of books that litter his floor and heads downstairs to the parlor
2589320	2591680	Where the widow Anderson is already waiting with coffee
2592200	2594880	He stayed at the hotel the first few months he was in town
2594880	2600520	But he found himself in frequent disagreement with that establishment over payments and acceptable level of cat excretions
2601260	2606020	Returning from his shell one day. He found the hotel and employed the washer woman's daughter to clean his room
2606540	2612100	He opened the door to see her rearranging his table of vertebrae and promptly fled to the washroom to weep
2612700	2615340	Since then he has stayed at the widow Anderson's boarding house
2615580	2619760	She rises as early as he does and enjoys stiff coffee and silence in the mornings
2620020	2621780	The other boarders are young men
2621780	2626740	They leave quickly in the morning to make their shifts at the mine and stay out of the saloons until late at night
2627300	2632040	The widow is content to leave Horace to his vertebrae and his cat enjoys her company when he is away
2632440	2635660	After drinking his coffee and reading the papers Horace heads to his shale
2636400	2638440	Following the creek a short distance out of town
2638440	2642600	He comes to the rocky outcropping that he hopes holds the answers to his most burning questions
2642960	2644960	And so Horace begins his work
2645040	2649360	He chips and digs at his shale looking for signs of the monsters who once roamed this land
2649720	2653480	It has been months and he has found nothing like the vertebrae that first brought him here
2653640	2658920	They plainly belonged to a mosasaurus, but he had never seen or read of any specimens so large
2659720	2665400	Local children will sometimes come down after their morning chores to help the crazy old professor sift through his rocks and mud
2665520	2668600	But on this day is alone by the early evening
2668600	2671540	He has found no signs of his mosasaurus and returns to town
2671840	2676440	Making a point to stop by the hotel restaurant to enjoy his supper before changing out of his muddy clothes
2677200	2682520	He cleans himself at the boarding house and reads the evening papers with the widow while he's he had sleeps in his lap
2682840	2687080	He retires to his room where he will read or respond to one of his many professional
2687640	2694120	Correspondents or diagram as vertebrae hearing the young boarders returning from the saloon. He knows it is time to retire
2694680	2696360	He tells easy at good night
2696360	2702880	Scratches his head and turns out his lamp and as soon as it's dark you hear one of your young minor
2703200	2707800	neighbors drunkenly going on about one of his ex-colleagues a
2708320	2713400	Regular gambler at the saloon who is counted among those recently missing in
2714120	2716120	contention I
2716560	2718560	Swear God is my witness
2719480	2725400	Thomas told me in confidence. He said he he said found oil down there
2725840	2728500	But like it was alive
2729280	2732240	Like moving and breathing in the light
2732880	2739760	Last week last we all saw of him. He was arguing loudly up in mr. Cole's office
2739760	2744300	And then it was it was just silent. No, I'm not saying shit to
2745020	2748940	Anyone about that cuz I don't want to be the next one missing
2749260	2754540	So that's why I'm not gonna die. I'm not going to that meeting. No, I'm not gonna go
2754540	2761860	I'm not but that I'm not telling anyone. No, no, no, no one I wouldn't tell I I mean, yeah
2761860	2766780	I might know more but I'm not telling anyone am I know I'm not
2767100	2772740	Just cuz Thomas is all missing and shit cuz he's arguing with mr. Cole
2772940	2779060	Hmm seems a fellow named Thomas is missing from from his normal gambling
2780180	2786180	Habits and and mine working after finding a living oil and arguing with mr. Cole
2787020	2788900	I'll file that away
2788900	2790820	living living oil
2790820	2797020	That could be something that's what dinosaurs are now dinosaurs are birds Zach. Fuck wait
2797100	2799720	So does that mean dinosaurs aren't real? Yeah
2799720	2804040	If birds came from dinosaurs, then why are they still dinosaurs?
2814680	2816680	Luke
2817480	2821160	What up, what are you learning learning like larva Joe said
2823880	2827800	It's fucking nasty Joe said they're wiggling around your
2828480	2831920	Character description day in the life writing assignment
2832280	2838400	Was so good that it like made him feel like he had to take it up a notch when he wrote his good
2838400	2843840	I'm glad yours is still the best one though. Do you want to describe your character? Yeah, my
2845120	2847840	My character is Ephraim Cortland
2848480	2853320	Judge Ephraim Cortland. He is a very tall large man
2854280	2856480	43 years old but looks
2857360	2861200	Looking at him. You don't you couldn't really tell how old he is. He's just
2861920	2867740	Just a disgusting. He's a slop of a human. He's a slop. He barely takes care of himself
2868440	2873720	Just soars all over him from like barely washing and not washing his clothes
2875040	2881400	Always has like grease and food in his mustache and on his face. He's always sweaty
2882400	2885680	Greasy hair dirty fingernails and
2886600	2894820	Hands just fucking gross is his guys deal. Why is he so nasty? Well, he was a well-respected judge
2895600	2901960	Fair and well respected but about six years ago his wife and his daughter died from cholera
2902080	2906380	And that pretty much is a redone. Yeah, he always
2907160	2911000	Boils his water before he drinks it now. Does he have taste buds?
2911040	2917560	He probably not because he smokes he smoked cigars. He smokes hand-rolled cigarettes
2917560	2922960	He chews tobacco. He's known to make he's known to make tea with tobacco. Oh
2924080	2927400	He uses that as a chaser for his whiskey
2927400	2931640	He always keeps iced fully stocked bar with really nice whiskey
2931640	2935720	But he he buys nice stuff so that people don't think he's a drunk
2936120	2944000	Yeah, so people think he's classy but he is a drunk drinks heavily throughout the day always has a he's got a
2944000	2945520	flask on him
2945520	2951240	It's a metal flask like bound with leather and on on the flask. It says
2951680	2953360	to EC
2953360	2955360	from our EC with love
2955880	2958560	Ruth Ruth Courtland was his wife
2959720	2963380	So he keeps that it's very special to him always filled with whiskey
2963700	2969540	How big is it how big is the flask yeah think of like a regular flask
2971220	2975820	Four times that big so it's like it can fit a hell of a lot of whiskey in it
2975820	2981380	So I needed to buy a flask when I was 16 years old. Yeah, not for drinking purposes
2981380	2984060	But because I was playing
2984580	2988700	Taney Zuko in Grease at my high school's production, of course
2988700	2994180	and I needed a flask got that lead as a sophomore baby, and so I
2995020	3000740	And so I went to an antique store and I bought a flask and I thought to myself this is kind of a big flask
3000740	3005460	But I didn't I didn't drink that much so you didn't really know when I was 16. It was like
3006020	3012900	Stealing nips from people's parents basements and such right, but I learned later when I used that flask
3012900	3017020	It held half a fifth of shit. Yeah, that's
3017980	3023780	375 milliliters, I'd say that's about yeah half a fifth is what this can can hold
3024020	3027780	He always has it on him his clothes that he wears since he is a judge
3028260	3032500	Usually like three-piece suits and stuff, but they have not been washed or taken care of
3032860	3037460	He has no intention of buying any new clothes. So they're ratty and holes and stuff in them
3037460	3043400	He always make sure there's an inner pocket for his flask though. Of course. All right, read me this read me this thing, baby
3044400	3048740	Judge Ephraim Courtland wakes up in his comfy puffy leather chair
3049000	3053640	The greasy plate is broken on the ground beside him missing the half pound of bacon
3053640	3060520	It held the night before which was eaten far too quickly by the judge and washed down with a half a bottle of expensive whiskey
3061640	3068280	Ephraim wipes his face with the back of his sleeve smearing grease and bits of bacon into his salt and pepper horseshoe mustache
3068720	3075060	His stomach churns out a low gurgle like the sound of that sweet black gold when it bubbles up from the earth
3075640	3082120	Ephraim struggles to stand up from his chair the effects of the whiskey from the night before have not yet worn off and his weight does
3082120	3085040	Not help the cause as he rises up from the chair
3085040	3087600	His top hat scrapes the roof of his modest home
3087600	3095660	His 43 year old bones hold him up at 6 foot 10 and carries a little over 300 pounds of booze and pork filled fat
3096340	3103980	The man looks like he's falling apart as if his skin was one paper cut away from expelling the rotten insides and decaying flesh
3104700	3110560	he takes his top hat off and bends over holding the makeshift barf bag expectantly in front of him a
3110960	3117700	Minute passes but the only bodily fluid in the hat is sweat that is profusely dripping off the man's balding head
3118180	3121420	He tosses the hat to the ground and strips down naked
3121660	3126900	He boils water for a bath buying some half-cooked bacon left on the dining table from the night before
3127940	3134660	Against his better judgment. He finishes the undercooked fatty pork before the flies can after breakfast
3134660	3137640	He decides against a hot bath. It's much too hot already
3137980	3143520	He half-heartedly washes himself in a cool bath just enough to be almost presentable for court
3143520	3148620	He comes as long graying patchy hair across his head and oils up his mustache
3149100	3153580	He picks up an earthy tweed three-piece suit off the floor and dresses himself
3154380	3156380	Bending over to put on his socks and shoes
3156540	3163760	He feels dizzy his top hat finally fulfills its purpose as he empties his guts into his felt and silk wastebasket
3164180	3168540	He straightens himself up feeling much better and removes a flask from his jacket
3168700	3173020	He drains the flask in one goal that fills it with a half empty bottle from the night before
3173420	3176980	He takes one last swig from the bottle switches it around his mouth
3177380	3183220	Gargles and spits it into the top hat he tucks his flask back into his suit jacket and heads toward the door
3183580	3186540	As he walks outside, he figures it to be around noon
3186640	3192260	He was due at the courthouse at 9, but he knows he will be fine as he is the only judge for miles
3192900	3198920	Plus the townsfolk won't get too upset if they can't pay their fine for not hitching their horse or getting unruly at the bar
3199800	3203400	Did he put his hat back on no, thank God
3205160	3211360	It's like what the fuck no, does he wash out his hat? No, I just leave it just leaves it on the floor
3211360	3216640	Okay, so we're gonna cut back to about a week ago. This is a few days before
3217240	3219240	one of the gamblers
3219280	3220760	disappeared and
3220760	3224400	A couple of them got into a got a pretty unruly
3225080	3230080	Unruly enough to where one of them was locked up at the courthouse and
3231080	3233920	Courtland is walking through and this guy
3235120	3236360	completely
3236360	3239040	He's got mine face not mine
3239040	3244120	Yeah, but he's kind of my main because his hands are up against the bars in front of him
3244120	3247640	But there's actual bars there. So he's really good at miming, right?
3249600	3252740	And he sticks his head in between two of the bars
3253620	3256940	His eyes get really big and he's like, you know
3259540	3262260	Mrs. Cole she ain't human
3272100	3274100	Ephraim just looks at the guy and
3274740	3281360	like the guys holding on to the bars of the prison cell and he just punches his fingers into the
3281760	3283320	bar of the
3283320	3288280	Cell and you just hear the laughter continue as this man
3289520	3292520	backs away into the darkness of his cell
3295560	3300840	He kind of eyes the guy and just stops for a second and then continues walking
3301920	3303920	back to the day in question
3304440	3310080	Ephraim still gazing up at the blaring Sun whistles a long loud note and clicks his tongue a
3311040	3317200	Colossal shiny brown and white Clydesdale saunters over and looks at the judge. We're late. Hey, mister
3317200	3325600	Let's go the juxtaposition of this elegant well-groomed horse and the off-putting nauseating giant of a man confuses the locals
3326040	3328880	How could a man like that own that horse?
3329800	3334980	Ephraim Courtland mounts the horse effortlessly his grace opposite of everything else in his life
3335300	3341300	He takes off at breakneck speed on his steed kicking up an enormous dust cloud as he races towards the courthouse
3341740	3347980	As he rides, there are only two things on his mind his horse and how many men he wants to hang today
3353060	3355060	And when Ephraim gets to the courthouse
3355580	3361820	When he walks in he goes to flip on the lights the new electrical system has made
3362500	3370000	Electrical lighting possible here in the courthouse. Thanks to all Silas Cole the genius and contention and as you flip them on there's nothing
3378420	3382820	What's wrong what oh oh gosh, oh no, I'm sorry mister
3382820	3389540	Um, it's just that it seems to be that the the copper wiring has been stolen paralegal comes running up
3390060	3395100	Yes, no, um, it seems to be that all the copper wiring has been stolen out from the courthouse
3395980	3400820	Nighttime why I don't know but it might be worth it to bring it up at the meeting today
3400820	3404900	How do you know who told you what is this and I grab it out of her hands?
3405940	3407940	And you see that there's a letter
3408460	3412900	Requesting your presence at the town hall meeting at the church to discuss
3413500	3418420	Disappearances what time is the meeting? You're already late. Well, I'm
3419340	3421980	As I'll be going over there and
3422980	3430380	Fix the fucking lights and I walk out and get back on my horse and right over to the town hall meeting
3431060	3433060	quickly fast
3448420	3450420	Oh
3478420	3480420	Oh
3508420	3510420	You know
3538420	3540420	Oh
3540420	3542420	Oh
3561700	3569340	Can't you have wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around my poor little darling
3569340	3571860	I'm afraid they'll get my darling
3571860	3579300	Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around my poor little darling
3579300	3581860	I'm afraid they'll get my darling
3599340	3601340	You
