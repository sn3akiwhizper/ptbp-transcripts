00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
Greetings.

00:01.840 --> 00:03.600
Introduction.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.760
Transition.

00:05.760 --> 00:09.320
694.2 PTBP.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.920
The good numbers.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.160
The radio station is... somewhere.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.840
Wolf the dog is... here.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.320
There is nothing to fear.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.440
Maybe.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.920
We have fans.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.760
They shouted us from the void.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.520
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Bundad Elliot,

00:28.560 --> 00:32.400
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.280
Which you should also do.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.760
Bundad Elliot writes,

00:36.760 --> 00:39.000
Wolf, I need your help.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.720
You travel through myriad realms and unknown plains

00:42.720 --> 00:45.920
and maybe you know how I might escape.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.880
The bunnies that were once my pets

00:48.880 --> 00:52.120
now hold me within a liminal space.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.960
Doors folding in upon themselves.

00:55.960 --> 00:59.080
The eldritch forms of these furry fiends

00:59.080 --> 01:01.200
have been revealed to me.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.640
They keep me fed and clothed,

01:03.640 --> 01:06.520
but I am captive nonetheless.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.200
All because I wouldn't give them banana chips.

01:10.200 --> 01:14.240
I have slipped this message through a crack in the wall.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.120
I hope you find it.

01:16.120 --> 01:19.480
P.S. Please send banana chips.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.520
Oh damn, you met those guys?

01:23.520 --> 01:27.480
Tell those fun buns ol' Wolfie says hello.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.560
Enjoy your stay.

01:29.560 --> 01:33.520
I'm sure they won't be keeping you there for too long.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.720
Humans live what, a couple hundred years or so?

01:37.720 --> 01:40.400
Ah, you'll be fine.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.400
I will not be sending you banana chips

01:43.400 --> 01:46.320
because I do not believe in them.

01:46.320 --> 01:51.080
I will not conform and I shall not obey.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.360
If you wanna write up something for your wolf

01:54.120 --> 01:57.880
tag at pretending pod on Instagram fuck Mark Zuckerberg

01:57.880 --> 02:01.240
at pretending pod on Twitter fuck Jack Dorsey

02:01.240 --> 02:05.240
fuck Elon Musk or pretending to be people on Facebook.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.800
Another fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.320
And if you wanna be the very best,

02:10.320 --> 02:13.120
like no one ever was,

02:13.120 --> 02:15.680
go ahead and write up a five star review

02:15.680 --> 02:18.240
on the podcast app of your choice

02:18.240 --> 02:20.080
and let us know.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.400
We love that shit.

02:22.400 --> 02:27.120
But if you're keeping your love of 694.2 PTBP

02:27.120 --> 02:31.640
a dirty little secret from your online friends and family,

02:31.640 --> 02:35.200
you don't wanna post about how much you love this show.

02:35.200 --> 02:40.200
You don't wanna wear our six shirts, hats, and fanny packs.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.000
You don't wanna dry off with a towel from Splashylvania.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.880
Well, that's all fine.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.240
You can confidentially support us

02:50.240 --> 02:54.480
at patreon.com slash pretending pod

02:54.480 --> 02:57.880
and for even $5 per month,

02:57.880 --> 03:02.240
you'll get access to 33 bonus episodes.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.080
And what's that?

03:03.080 --> 03:06.560
I'm hearing there is more on the way.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.760
What more can I say?

03:08.760 --> 03:12.840
The links are in the show notes.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.840
All right, I got through what I needed to.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.320
And now it's time for me to read the news.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.320
Last time Beck Wilder was impaled by a DIY Jackalope

03:26.000 --> 03:29.920
with a yellow ribbon tying the mundane antlers

03:29.920 --> 03:34.920
to the standard rabbit to create the mythological beast.

03:35.480 --> 03:39.080
While watching Stevie witness Fox God'll twitch

03:39.080 --> 03:42.440
and convulse at the side of headphones,

03:42.480 --> 03:47.280
Cal realized that she was very likely Faith Godell,

03:47.280 --> 03:49.880
the oldest child of Fred Godell

03:49.880 --> 03:52.960
disguised as the production assistant.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.600
The medical staff at Grover's Gorge

03:55.600 --> 03:58.040
showed up in a bullpen car

03:58.040 --> 04:01.000
to pick up the Gord camera operator.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
And on the way to the lab,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.280
the group saw another makeshift Jackalope.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.920
This one with a purple ribbon, Fox Godell,

04:09.960 --> 04:13.640
who Stevie says went by Greg before,

04:13.640 --> 04:17.520
quickly grabbed the ribbon, popped it in his pocket

04:17.520 --> 04:22.240
and promptly fucked off back to his Godell innovation zone

04:22.240 --> 04:26.640
or jizz, if you'd like, and I do.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.720
In the lab, the medical staff says

04:29.720 --> 04:32.520
they can treat Beck's wound here in the same room

04:32.520 --> 04:34.640
as the interview with the mayor.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.240
The mayor, an old beat up damp box turtle

04:39.280 --> 04:41.200
called Sandro.

04:41.200 --> 04:46.200
Taking us now to this quirky and riveting news story.

04:46.600 --> 04:51.600
It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.600
My life is great and it's all my fault

04:56.960 --> 05:01.960
Cause my life is great and it's all mine

05:11.400 --> 05:16.400
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault

05:21.600 --> 05:26.600
On the tree subreddit right now it was like,

05:30.400 --> 05:32.560
I joined thinking this was actually about trees.

05:32.560 --> 05:33.880
Where's the real tree sub?

05:33.880 --> 05:35.480
And I knew that the one about trees

05:35.480 --> 05:38.040
is called marijuana enthusiasts,

05:38.040 --> 05:40.920
but I didn't, there's some other ones that I didn't know.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.400
World politics is anime titties

05:44.400 --> 05:47.240
and anime titties is world politics.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.080
And John Cena is about potato salad

05:51.080 --> 05:52.840
and potato salad is about John Cena.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.040
Oh my God, nice.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.640
Oh, also I knew this one, but Super Bowl

05:58.640 --> 06:00.440
is actually about superb owls.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.320
So I didn't know this one.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.040
There's an Amish subreddit.

06:07.040 --> 06:11.560
It has 175,000 members and no posts.

06:11.560 --> 06:16.560
I fell on a jackalope.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.760
Oh, good call dude.

06:22.040 --> 06:22.880
Holy shit.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.240
Whoa, look out.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.880
Fell on a jackalope.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.600
Damn, I remember watching those videos for the first time

06:32.600 --> 06:34.760
when I was like probably in the sixth grade.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.360
I have no idea what you're referencing.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.640
Guy on a buffalo.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.480
Whoa, look out.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.320
I still have no idea what you're referencing.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.960
I haven't seen Guy on a Buffalo.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.160
I guess I haven't seen Guy on a Buffalo.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.960
Is it one of those like two girls, one cups kind of videos?

06:46.960 --> 06:48.160
Cause I haven't seen any of those.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.320
The guy fucks a buffalo.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.160
Yeah.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.720
Like donkey man.

06:51.720 --> 06:52.640
Donkey man.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.720
We've already done this.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.000
Mr. Hands.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.840
Donkey man.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.560
Let's not do this.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.400
Okay.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.240
Thanks.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.560
We'll do it afterwards though, for sure.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.400
No, we'll forget.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.440
So yeah, we're talking to a turtle.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.720
We were, yeah.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.760
So what are we doing?

07:12.760 --> 07:13.600
So we're talking to a turtle?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.440
So we're talking to the turtle.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.720
Can news get a big old scoop with the mayor of this town?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.080
Turns out, turtle.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.000
Sandro.

07:21.000 --> 07:21.840
Sandro.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.960
Sandro the turtle.

07:23.960 --> 07:24.880
Sandro.

07:24.880 --> 07:25.800
Sandro.

07:25.800 --> 07:30.800
I put a microphone on the turtle's shell and...

07:33.000 --> 07:34.360
Cal, pat your back and he's like,

07:34.360 --> 07:36.280
way to step up for a back buddy.

07:36.280 --> 07:40.760
Mr. Mayor, could you spell your first and last name?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.920
The makeup artist is kind of like laughing

07:42.920 --> 07:46.760
and she looks up and is like, you got him?

07:46.760 --> 07:49.080
And then she kind of walks away and heads out the door.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.440
Says you got him to us?

07:50.440 --> 07:52.880
To Julius, who's standing there.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.560
Cal leans into Stevie again.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.000
So does turtle, can it talk?

08:00.720 --> 08:04.120
Exhales real big, looks you dead in the eyes.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.640
Kinda.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.320
What do you mean kinda?

08:07.320 --> 08:10.040
Beck did not expect the word kinda.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.400
It's a whole thing, okay.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.640
Like two taps for yes, one for no.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.880
And one of the medical people kinda,

08:16.880 --> 08:18.920
we're gonna be right back with the equipment that we need

08:18.920 --> 08:20.040
to take care of this.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.280
Should only take a couple minutes.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.920
And they head out to the front door.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.640
Word, no hurry.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.200
And as they head out the door,

08:26.200 --> 08:29.280
you see a 58 year old man standing there.

08:29.280 --> 08:33.760
He's got bright blue eyes and a face lined by the sun,

08:33.760 --> 08:38.160
which is topped by a flat top of salt and pepper hair.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.200
He's Uncle Strong.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.520
Like he could bench 250 pounds,

08:42.520 --> 08:43.360
but he gets winded.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.200
Oh, that's not his name.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.040
I thought.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.280
He's Uncle Strong.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.120
I was like, okay, is he a turtle's uncle?

08:50.120 --> 08:52.680
He just looks like he could bench 250 pounds,

08:52.680 --> 08:54.600
but he also looks like he gets winded

08:54.600 --> 08:57.400
going up a flight of stairs.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.920
This is Chuck Bidwell.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.520
He says, as he introduces himself.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.960
Hey, how's it going there?

09:01.960 --> 09:03.080
It's Chuck Bidwell.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.320
It's nice to meet each and every one of you.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.160
I'm the mayor.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.000
Well, I'm not the mayor.

09:07.000 --> 09:07.840
I'm kind of the mayor.

09:07.840 --> 09:12.840
Shout out to Anthony from Bristol, UK for Chuck Bidwell.

09:12.840 --> 09:16.680
Anthony is one of our $10 or up subscribers on Patreon.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.520
Thanks, Anthony.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.360
Or up.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.200
Or up.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.840
Yeah, Chuck Bidwell.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.040
It's a pleasure to meet each and every one of you.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.240
Oh, it looks like you've had a bit of a rough and tumble

09:28.240 --> 09:30.360
goal of it so far, Mr. Camerman, sir.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.640
Fell on a jackalope.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.360
As he looks at you, guess what happens?

09:34.360 --> 09:36.440
Oh, wait, wait, wait, Zach, Zach.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.440
I think I can guess.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.360
He's wearing a green dry fit polo

09:43.360 --> 09:46.640
tucked in kind of over his belly.

09:47.760 --> 09:48.600
Hog?

09:49.600 --> 09:50.720
Yes.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.960
And he kind of zones out for a moment

09:54.960 --> 09:59.960
and you see into Chuck Bidwell's deepest, saddest soul

10:00.960 --> 10:05.640
of a face and then with just a half a second,

10:05.640 --> 10:06.920
he's right back to normal.

10:06.920 --> 10:07.760
Hey, how's it going?

10:07.760 --> 10:09.040
Chuck Bidwell, yeah.

10:09.040 --> 10:09.880
What's your name?

10:09.880 --> 10:10.720
What's your name?

10:10.720 --> 10:12.120
Julius Summers.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.480
Julius, Mr. Summers.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.320
Nice to meet you.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.160
And you, sir?

10:15.160 --> 10:17.200
Hey, Beck, it's Beck Wilder.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.120
Beck Wilder, what happened to you, son?

10:19.120 --> 10:22.560
I fell on a jackalope.

10:22.560 --> 10:26.920
I fell on a jackalope and I don't think I survived.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.240
Oh, oh, he pats you on the shoulder

10:29.480 --> 10:31.680
and he's like, he looks at the other two.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.840
Did he kill it?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.960
No, no, I'm sure it's fine.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.240
And what is your name, sir?

10:36.240 --> 10:37.240
Chuck Bidwell here.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.560
Cal Colorado, City Action News.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.080
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Bidwell.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.160
Oh, right, you're the Cal Colorado

10:43.160 --> 10:45.640
who has come to do all the wonderful interviews

10:45.640 --> 10:48.200
and show off Grover's Gorge for the beautiful town

10:48.200 --> 10:49.520
that it is, that's right, okay.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.480
Well, we've got you set up over here, of course.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.680
You know, with the mayor, Sandro, if you met Sandro,

10:55.680 --> 10:59.160
I'm not the mayor, I happened to lose.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.320
I lost the election there.

11:01.320 --> 11:06.320
Oh, so Sandro was able to participate in an election?

11:06.800 --> 11:11.160
Well, yeah, but he does get elected every time.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.960
How long has he been the mayor?

11:12.960 --> 11:16.000
He's been the mayor since almost the beginning, yeah,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.360
since the founding of Grover's Gorge.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.920
And he'll always be the mayor?

11:19.920 --> 11:22.600
Well, seemingly, seemingly for sure.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.240
I mean, I lost by 836 votes.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.600
What is the voting age here?

11:26.600 --> 11:28.400
Voting age is 18, like everyone else.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.600
We're in America, aren't we?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.840
Well, that's an interesting question.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.360
You were the mayor, perhaps?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.880
Well, I'm not the mayor, I wish I was the mayor.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.520
I mean, the only two votes I even got

11:37.520 --> 11:40.000
were from me and my wife, Barbara,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.280
kind of honestly, if I'm being completely honest,

11:42.280 --> 11:44.200
she pushed me into running.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.960
I'm being totally straight with you.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.520
Yes, you're not the mayor in title,

11:48.520 --> 11:51.200
and yet you have all the responsibilities of the mayor.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.040
Is that correct?

11:52.040 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, speaking of those responsibilities,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.600
them responsibilities is why I was so late.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.280
I'm so sorry that I didn't greet you at the gate.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.360
That is my deepest and searest apologies.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.440
I'm so sorry.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.280
Isn't it funny that a turtle is running for mayor?

12:09.360 --> 12:11.680
Oh, I like this kid, you don't have him on camera yet.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.720
Oh, you writing the jokes for this old man over here?

12:14.720 --> 12:17.400
That is very funny, I'm going to say that.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.000
It's all yours, Cal.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.800
The turtle is a turtle.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.640
Right.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.400
At this point, you've walked away from the turtle.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.240
No, I think we're standing right by it.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.640
I've got my eye on it, it's not really going anywhere.

12:31.640 --> 12:32.960
Okay, we're all kind of bunched up

12:32.960 --> 12:35.120
in the same area then right up the front.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.560
The medical staff comes in and starts treating Beck

12:37.560 --> 12:39.800
while you guys are having this conversation.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.200
Hey there, whoa, precious cargo now.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.080
They have some sort of machinery

12:44.080 --> 12:46.640
that you haven't seen in a hospital before,

12:46.640 --> 12:51.040
and they begin attaching it to Beck's backside

12:51.040 --> 12:51.960
and upper thigh.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.560
I instinctively say, Beck, get a shot of that.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.600
But then I realized.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.920
But Beck is trying to,

12:58.920 --> 13:00.400
whatever weird positions they put him in,

13:00.400 --> 13:01.480
he's holding the camera,

13:01.480 --> 13:03.200
trying to get footage of this new machine.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.320
You still have the camera?

13:04.320 --> 13:05.160
Yeah.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.560
When he does that, Julius, yeah, grabs the camera,

13:10.560 --> 13:12.240
trying to still keep the shot.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.340
You feel some resistance.

13:13.340 --> 13:15.840
Everybody roll alertness for me real quick.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.200
I'm going to burn my dice, if that's cool with you.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.840
I got a 27, I pass.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.280
And you're at a negative 20, Cal.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.600
Yeah, doesn't matter, 73 fail.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.200
Got an 87 fail.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.920
Julius, as you've walked away,

13:31.920 --> 13:34.760
you actually notice that similarly to the way

13:34.760 --> 13:38.400
that the glass kind of rose from the grass below

13:38.400 --> 13:40.640
on the first floor, letting you through the entrance

13:40.640 --> 13:45.000
into this building, the glass on this room, the window,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
opens in a similar fashion.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.440
Chuck sees that you notice and you look down

13:49.440 --> 13:52.120
and see that he's got a little clicker in his hand.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.480
Oh, I thought it'd be nice that way

13:53.480 --> 13:54.920
there's no glass behind the shot.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.560
We get a beautiful, perfect view

13:57.560 --> 13:59.140
of the city park right behind.

13:59.140 --> 14:00.360
Oh, like a remote.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.680
I thought you meant like he's clicking

14:01.680 --> 14:04.320
to see how many times I noticed things.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.160
I'm like, what the fuck, man?

14:08.160 --> 14:10.440
I was like, I'm taking that away from him.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.280
You're like, what's the count?

14:11.280 --> 14:12.780
I see.

14:12.780 --> 14:15.440
Chuck, that's, thank you, incredible.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.920
I wouldn't have even thought to ask.

14:17.920 --> 14:18.760
Yeah.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.280
Can you do it to, I mean, you don't need to,

14:20.320 --> 14:22.840
but can you do that to all the windows in this building?

14:22.840 --> 14:24.360
Yeah, isn't that amazing?

14:24.360 --> 14:27.840
It's an absolutely incredible laboratory that we have here.

14:27.840 --> 14:28.680
It's beautiful.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.640
And that controls all the doors as well.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.480
Yeah, I mean, the door is the window,

14:32.480 --> 14:34.280
the window is the door, am I right?

14:35.160 --> 14:36.680
You'll see here, and he points behind him

14:36.680 --> 14:38.680
that there aren't really any doors inside here.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.960
There's just kind of open doorways.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.440
Julius is going to bookmark that information

14:43.440 --> 14:46.520
and definitely gonna try to steal that at some point.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.480
How's the machine, what's it doing to me now?

14:48.480 --> 14:51.620
They've got a machine that kind of wraps around.

14:51.620 --> 14:54.980
It's almost like a heating pad, but on the inside of it,

14:54.980 --> 14:57.340
there is some sort of technology

14:57.340 --> 14:58.740
that you haven't seen before.

14:58.740 --> 15:01.320
It kind of looks like a light almost,

15:01.320 --> 15:05.080
but they can fold this piece of machinery around you.

15:05.080 --> 15:08.640
It's easily foldable around the back of your leg.

15:08.640 --> 15:13.320
And when it's on, you just kind of feel this sort of heat,

15:13.320 --> 15:16.480
a nice vibration, you get hard.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.960
You guys gotta try this.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.800
Beckworth, you're at work.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.400
Do you remember those old school machine things

15:26.400 --> 15:28.520
that would do this for weight loss?

15:28.520 --> 15:31.560
Oh yeah, just kind of like pulsate your muscles.

15:31.560 --> 15:32.400
It was a band around.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.380
No, it was like a band that just went like,

15:34.380 --> 15:35.220
okay, it's wrapped around you.

15:35.220 --> 15:36.800
Like just putting his hand at the side

15:36.800 --> 15:38.480
and then waving them wildly.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.880
I know, in my mind, this makes sense.

15:42.880 --> 15:43.720
Anyway.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.040
I'm kind of talking to a medic person near me.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.280
I've never seen this before.

15:49.040 --> 15:54.040
Is this like some like new medical issue thing?

15:55.040 --> 15:59.600
You tell me and they pull it off and you look behind you

15:59.600 --> 16:04.040
and you basically don't have wounds anymore.

16:05.560 --> 16:06.760
Beck is making wide,

16:06.760 --> 16:08.800
like he's looking at where the wounds were

16:08.800 --> 16:11.320
and then looking at Cal and then looking at Julius

16:11.320 --> 16:13.640
and then looking down at the leg that is now healed.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.420
Yeah, and you feel like there's some slight cuts, right?

16:17.860 --> 16:21.300
Where the holes were not even sutured back together,

16:21.300 --> 16:22.580
but where they came back together,

16:22.580 --> 16:24.220
they're not completely healed.

16:24.220 --> 16:26.500
One of them goes, oh, it didn't actually,

16:26.500 --> 16:28.380
didn't work all the way, but that's okay.

16:28.380 --> 16:29.920
It should heal up naturally from here

16:29.920 --> 16:30.960
and you should be able to walk

16:30.960 --> 16:33.680
and they kind of hold your hand and lift you up out

16:33.680 --> 16:35.620
and you do, you feel much better

16:35.620 --> 16:37.180
as you gain back two hit points.

16:37.180 --> 16:39.320
You're only one away from full health

16:39.320 --> 16:41.700
and you can walk on this leg pretty easily now.

16:41.700 --> 16:46.060
Doctors, is that gaudal technology?

16:46.060 --> 16:48.540
So with everyone paying attention

16:48.540 --> 16:51.380
to the gaudal technology here.

16:51.380 --> 16:52.980
Yeah, the turtle's dead or something, right?

16:52.980 --> 16:53.860
Yeah, for sure.

16:53.860 --> 16:56.680
They help Beck up out of the bed.

16:56.680 --> 16:57.520
Oh no.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.780
Well, it's okay, they can just put him in the thing.

17:05.780 --> 17:09.860
Go ahead and roll alertness at a negative 40.

17:09.860 --> 17:11.860
The turtle's gonna fall out the window.

17:12.700 --> 17:16.580
Yeah, I've failed miserably.

17:16.580 --> 17:18.420
I mean, I have 40 alertness, so I'd-

17:18.420 --> 17:19.780
Oh yeah, ouchy, ouchy.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.700
Cal is still looking at his in astonishment

17:21.700 --> 17:22.540
at the healed wounds.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.340
The camera looks behind this group

17:25.340 --> 17:28.300
staring at this incredible technology

17:28.300 --> 17:33.300
as this turtle is swaying back and forth on its stool.

17:33.980 --> 17:35.260
I just wanna say right now,

17:35.260 --> 17:37.940
we did not put that turtle on that fucking stool.

17:37.940 --> 17:41.380
This is a gaudal company mistake.

17:43.140 --> 17:48.140
Teeter, totter, teeter, whoop, teeter totter turtle die.

17:54.820 --> 17:59.320
Chuck Bidwell looks up and goes, oh my God.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.300
And you see the turtle going over the side

18:02.300 --> 18:06.420
along with the stool, boom, off the side of this building.

18:06.540 --> 18:08.380
The open window door thing.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.580
Oh, fuck.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.640
None of this is on us.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.200
From the quick glimpse we got,

18:13.200 --> 18:16.220
did it look like the turtle was doing that on purpose?

18:16.220 --> 18:19.020
Because you weren't able to get a quick glimpse,

18:19.020 --> 18:22.100
you're completely unable to roll.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.340
Human, animal, turtle-ant?

18:25.340 --> 18:26.180
Turd-ant.

18:26.180 --> 18:27.800
Turd-ant.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.900
Yeah, we just hear the cries of the onlookers.

18:30.900 --> 18:34.860
Literally, suddenly you hear a squoosh.

18:36.540 --> 18:39.620
From your second tier in the lab.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.380
And then you just hear this, oh my God.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.800
Oh no, holy shit, oh my God.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.300
Sandro, no, Sandro.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.220
Sandro, where's Sandro?

18:54.460 --> 18:56.380
Our town is leaderless.

19:00.260 --> 19:02.900
Why do animals keep dying around me?

19:02.900 --> 19:03.980
Everyone roll.

19:04.300 --> 19:07.100
Beck, you were much farther away from this turtle.

19:10.460 --> 19:12.980
I'm not even joking, I'm not using these dice anymore.

19:12.980 --> 19:13.800
That's an 88.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.640
Again.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.300
Oh my God, dude.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.660
Have you rolled an 88 or did?

19:18.660 --> 19:20.740
Yeah, I rolled an 88 earlier.

19:20.740 --> 19:22.900
I don't think I've rolled under a 70 something all night.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.300
Wow, that would be great

19:24.300 --> 19:26.820
if we were playing some different game.

19:26.820 --> 19:27.860
I got a 21.

19:30.060 --> 19:32.840
Beck, you know what, it's a critical fail,

19:32.880 --> 19:36.280
so you're gonna lose four grip, the full D4.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.120
Oof-da.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.440
What are you at and what's your breaking point?

19:39.440 --> 19:42.840
I'm at 68 with a breaking point of 60.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.400
Luckily, grip was what Beck was good at, so.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.240
Nice.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.360
He's taking a lot of hits though.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.200
Yeah.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.660
This is not a normal day for him.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.640
You've said that a couple times now, I think.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.480
This is not a normal day.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.240
I don't know if it's a human roller

20:00.240 --> 20:01.400
just looking at their faces,

20:01.400 --> 20:04.640
but Howard's like, I assume Chuck has his own reasons

20:04.640 --> 20:06.160
for whatever his reaction is,

20:06.160 --> 20:08.340
but just a normal medical staff,

20:08.340 --> 20:12.680
seeing the mayor throw themselves off the thing.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.480
Why are you entertaining this?

20:14.480 --> 20:19.480
They placed a turtle on a stool

20:20.020 --> 20:21.920
in front of an open fucking window.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.160
But I mean, are they like in tears

20:25.160 --> 20:26.840
like their great leader has died

20:26.840 --> 20:28.760
or are they just like, oh shit.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.640
No, they're mostly super, super confused

20:31.640 --> 20:36.320
and they are at a loss for what to do now.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.540
I need you all to roll grip.

20:39.540 --> 20:40.380
Failed.

20:40.380 --> 20:41.200
Pass.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.200
This might be why you said to do this,

20:43.200 --> 20:46.920
but Julius for sure was still had that clicker in mind

20:46.920 --> 20:48.960
and was like, oh fuck, he did this.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.880
Interesting.

20:51.880 --> 20:52.720
Joe.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.040
97 baby with brand new dice, sir.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.760
Joe's rolling bad tonight.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.840
Thomas, go ahead and remove your headphones real quick.

21:05.360 --> 21:10.360
I need you both to roll a D8 and add one.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.440
An eight plus one is nine.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.640
Holy shit, dude.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.160
That's a four, so a five.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.400
So you're gonna lose five.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.620
Holy shit.

21:23.620 --> 21:24.520
Beck wild there.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.740
Julius Summers, you lose nine grip.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.740
And that puts me past my breaking point.

21:29.740 --> 21:34.740
As you both see a wet energy erupt from the spot

21:35.260 --> 21:39.040
where the turtle just teeter tottered to its doom

21:39.040 --> 21:43.160
and this wet energy flings itself

21:43.160 --> 21:45.780
into the body of Chuck Bidwell,

21:45.780 --> 21:49.520
throwing him back through the wall

21:49.520 --> 21:51.720
on the far side of this room.

21:51.720 --> 21:55.300
And it is a glass wall and it shatters.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.880
Holy shit.

21:57.820 --> 21:59.180
Holy shit, Zach.

22:01.660 --> 22:02.520
Now, if you don't mind,

22:02.520 --> 22:06.500
if I could talk to you each one at a time, Luke first.

22:06.500 --> 22:11.500
This wet energy that you see just for a glimpse,

22:11.500 --> 22:15.660
you just catch enough of it to get some semblance

22:15.660 --> 22:19.760
of like what it looks like, what it moves like,

22:19.760 --> 22:21.320
how it reacts to things around it.

22:21.320 --> 22:25.520
Like very short split second as this thing flies past you.

22:25.560 --> 22:30.560
So I'm gonna let you ask three yes or no questions

22:31.040 --> 22:34.740
to kind of try to decipher what this thing is like.

22:34.740 --> 22:36.720
Okay, everything has a shape,

22:36.720 --> 22:41.440
but did it have like a, not like human shape,

22:41.440 --> 22:44.680
but like what, there's a word I'm looking for here.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.520
Humanoid?

22:45.520 --> 22:46.840
Humanoid, sure.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.520
Yes, it has a humanoid shape.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.280
Did it make a sound?

22:52.280 --> 22:53.920
Yes.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.680
Question two, part A.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.280
Like a buzzing sound or like what?

22:58.280 --> 22:59.340
It was weird.

22:59.340 --> 23:04.340
It's like you could hear a man's voice,

23:05.600 --> 23:06.440
but it was not.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.440
But like not actual words or anything?

23:08.440 --> 23:13.440
Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.

23:15.440 --> 23:20.440
Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.

23:20.440 --> 23:25.440
Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.

23:29.220 --> 23:32.320
But it's just like whispering through,

23:32.320 --> 23:34.720
almost like it's this enormous noise

23:34.720 --> 23:36.960
that's billowing from out of this thing,

23:36.960 --> 23:39.640
but almost distant with inside of it.

23:39.640 --> 23:40.480
Gotcha.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.280
Whoa.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.560
Okay, third question.

23:45.560 --> 23:46.720
Maybe you only get two.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.880
What did it taste like?

23:50.200 --> 23:51.400
We got away from yes, no questions,

23:51.400 --> 23:53.000
and that's fine, because this is more fun.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.440
And as it kind of went by you,

23:54.440 --> 23:59.200
you get this like just saltiness in your nose

23:59.200 --> 24:01.640
and on your tongue, like as it whips by you.

24:02.840 --> 24:03.800
Okay.

24:03.800 --> 24:04.840
Very scary.

24:04.840 --> 24:06.340
Hey, thanks.

24:06.340 --> 24:07.380
I rubbed my ear so much,

24:07.380 --> 24:09.160
I think I gave myself dizziness.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.660
I was kind of sick.

24:10.660 --> 24:11.680
I'm sorry.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.560
Let's make you sicker.

24:13.560 --> 24:17.080
This wet energy, you kind of get a glimpse of it

24:17.080 --> 24:19.680
as it just flies past you.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.000
To the body of Chuck Bidwell, throwing him back.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.400
So I'm going to let you ask three questions.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.980
And I think the first two have to be yes or no questions.

24:28.980 --> 24:31.620
And then the last one doesn't have to be a yes or no question

24:31.620 --> 24:33.960
based on what I did with Luke,

24:33.960 --> 24:37.360
in order to get an idea of like what it looks like,

24:37.360 --> 24:39.800
what it seems like, what it's doing, like how it moves,

24:39.800 --> 24:41.040
like anything you want to ask

24:41.040 --> 24:43.760
about what you might be able to perceive.

24:43.760 --> 24:44.680
Okay.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.880
My first question is, you said wet.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.880
Did it splash against Chuck Bidwell

24:50.880 --> 24:52.920
or did it get absorbed by Chuck Bidwell?

24:54.200 --> 24:56.000
Yes to the second one.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.360
Okay. That's what I hoped.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.800
Is there a reason that I saw it?

25:01.800 --> 25:02.640
No, wait.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.640
Yes or no questions. Sorry.

25:03.640 --> 25:04.640
Is there a reason?

25:04.640 --> 25:06.120
Is a yes or no?

25:09.080 --> 25:10.540
Doesn't help me though.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.540
I did elaborate when Luke asked his second

25:12.540 --> 25:14.400
yes or no question, so we can do this.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.920
Well, I just wanted to clarify,

25:16.960 --> 25:18.600
was it just because I happened to be looking

25:18.600 --> 25:20.000
in the right direction?

25:20.000 --> 25:24.600
Or did it seem, I don't know how to ask this.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.200
Yeah, no, it's a good question.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.100
You think that like,

25:27.100 --> 25:29.360
no matter what was going through your head,

25:29.360 --> 25:31.720
because you were looking in the right direction,

25:31.720 --> 25:33.040
you fucking saw this thing.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.400
Because I was looking in the right direction,

25:34.400 --> 25:35.980
I saw this thing. Okay.

25:35.980 --> 25:39.960
For my third question then, you've said wet energy.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.400
How fast was it?

25:41.400 --> 25:43.520
Fucking wildly fast.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.780
Like lightning strike fast

25:44.780 --> 25:48.380
or like somebody's shooting a super soaker out of the air.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.020
Super soaker. Okay.

25:50.020 --> 25:50.860
Good question.

25:54.860 --> 25:56.780
Tommy, Tommy come play.

25:57.940 --> 25:59.500
We're bringing Thomas back with the bird here.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.740
Oh wow, what the fuck?

26:01.740 --> 26:05.860
Thomas, that reaction comes from seeing all of a sudden,

26:05.860 --> 26:10.420
Chuck Bidwell has exploded through the far side wall

26:10.420 --> 26:13.780
on the opposite side from the open wall.

26:13.780 --> 26:17.580
He slams backward through glass, exploding everywhere,

26:17.580 --> 26:20.380
10 meters from where he just stood a second ago

26:20.380 --> 26:21.720
when you saw him.

26:21.720 --> 26:25.060
You lose one grip as you have no idea how the fuck

26:25.060 --> 26:25.900
that just happened.

26:25.900 --> 26:29.140
No, it's pretty obviously that the ghost of the turtle

26:29.140 --> 26:31.340
that Charles Bidwell tried to assassinate

26:32.260 --> 26:34.180
or successfully assassinated,

26:34.180 --> 26:37.340
came back and like super scienced his ass through the window

26:37.340 --> 26:39.680
into like a last act of spiritual vengeance.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.340
You said explodes through the glass,

26:41.340 --> 26:43.500
but his body didn't explode, did it?

26:44.060 --> 26:44.900
No, his body did not explode.

26:44.900 --> 26:45.740
It's the glass around him that exploded.

26:45.740 --> 26:47.060
The glass around him explodes, yeah.

26:47.060 --> 26:52.060
And you hear him just like, oh, fucking shit.

26:52.220 --> 26:54.200
Oh my God.

26:56.640 --> 27:01.640
You hear the blabered breathing of Chuck Bidwell.

27:02.260 --> 27:04.300
Oh, oh my God.

27:06.260 --> 27:10.660
And then you hear nothing coming from the room

27:10.660 --> 27:12.820
that is now part of your room.

27:13.740 --> 27:17.460
Partition gone, glass wall down,

27:17.460 --> 27:20.420
shattered into a million little pieces.

27:21.620 --> 27:25.700
The footage from Beck's camera maybe had seen the,

27:25.700 --> 27:28.180
it's shown like an empty stool tipped over

27:28.180 --> 27:31.540
and nothingness just, you know, there, there.

27:31.540 --> 27:34.580
And then you heard a big crash off camera

27:34.580 --> 27:37.940
and Beck was so shocked that he is now pointed

27:37.940 --> 27:39.700
to the ground with the camera.

27:39.700 --> 27:40.540
Yeah, that's perfect.

27:40.540 --> 27:43.340
And then after the thing had settled,

27:44.060 --> 27:47.580
yeah, so it goes from like your wound healed

27:47.580 --> 27:50.420
to an empty stool across the room

27:50.420 --> 27:53.980
to just like chaos having already erupted.

27:53.980 --> 27:54.820
Yeah, exactly.

27:54.820 --> 27:55.940
Okay, very cool.

27:55.940 --> 27:56.760
Luke.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.600
Yeah.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.440
Let's talk.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.980
How, what are we doing with breaking points this season?

28:00.980 --> 28:02.060
What do you guys want to do?

28:02.060 --> 28:05.700
Do we want to come up with like a phobia or mania together?

28:05.700 --> 28:07.360
Do we want to do it just one-on-one

28:07.360 --> 28:09.860
or do we want to roll on the table like we did last time?

28:09.860 --> 28:11.260
I would do any of the above.

28:11.260 --> 28:12.700
I don't think we should do it together

28:12.700 --> 28:16.860
just cause it's fun to have that as a secret or not,

28:16.860 --> 28:18.340
you know, rolling is fun,

28:18.340 --> 28:21.580
but I think it makes more sense to have something related

28:21.580 --> 28:23.580
to what happened to make you break.

28:23.580 --> 28:25.360
Here's a pitch that's half your idea

28:25.360 --> 28:27.140
and half the opposite of your idea.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.420
Joe and I come up with your mania related to,

28:31.460 --> 28:32.860
related to your current situation.

28:32.860 --> 28:33.700
That's interesting.

28:33.700 --> 28:34.540
I don't hate it.

28:34.540 --> 28:35.360
That's kind of fun.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.200
And you know, vice versa all the way around.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.040
Yeah, I like that.

28:37.040 --> 28:37.880
Okay.

28:37.880 --> 28:38.700
All right, cool.

28:38.700 --> 28:39.540
I'm in.

28:39.540 --> 28:40.820
Okay, so let's talk about it.

28:41.700 --> 28:42.820
Well, he's never going to see a turtle

28:42.820 --> 28:43.740
without shit in his pants.

28:43.740 --> 28:44.580
I'll tell you that.

28:44.580 --> 28:47.460
I was going to say, I'll listen, but I'll just not talk.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.460
Hang on though, the bad thing about this is that

28:49.460 --> 28:52.260
Thomas and his character don't know

28:52.260 --> 28:55.380
what it actually was that made him lose his career.

28:55.380 --> 28:56.420
It doesn't really work.

28:56.420 --> 28:57.260
Yeah, okay.

28:57.260 --> 28:58.080
That's fair.

28:58.080 --> 28:58.920
I have no fucking clue.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.260
Okay, Joe and Thomas,

29:00.260 --> 29:02.100
take off your headphones real quick, please.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.620
Do you have any ideas right off the top of your head?

29:03.620 --> 29:06.200
So initially I was like, well, it's boring,

29:06.200 --> 29:07.580
but like afraid of heights.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.340
But the thing that fucked me up

29:09.340 --> 29:11.380
wasn't the turtle falling out the window.

29:11.380 --> 29:15.180
It was the fucking wet ghost energy thing.

29:15.180 --> 29:16.480
Yeah, it was the wet energy.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.980
So...

29:17.980 --> 29:19.900
I would say let's go water.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.140
Just hydrophobia?

29:21.140 --> 29:21.980
Yeah, let's go.

29:21.980 --> 29:22.820
Oh fuck, okay.

29:22.820 --> 29:24.900
But let's say it's a specific kind where you can...

29:24.900 --> 29:29.380
Like running water or like a stream or a faucet or a shower.

29:29.380 --> 29:32.060
But still water is fine.

29:32.060 --> 29:33.100
I'm not going to die.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.160
And obviously we're not going to tell them

29:35.160 --> 29:36.060
until it comes up.

29:36.060 --> 29:36.880
Exactly.

29:36.880 --> 29:37.720
Rock and roll.

29:37.720 --> 29:38.940
Rock and roll.

29:39.420 --> 29:40.620
Hell yeah, dude.

29:40.620 --> 29:41.760
Welcome back, boys.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.600
Hey.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.220
I'm afraid of having a huge penis.

29:44.220 --> 29:45.780
And so I start screaming.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.060
Yeah, man.

29:50.220 --> 29:54.120
And I look back and I remember that he has a huge penis

29:54.120 --> 29:55.720
and it scares the shit out of me.

29:56.700 --> 29:59.220
And I haven't seen cows yet, but I imagine it's big too.

29:59.220 --> 30:01.300
We cannot get you around those statues.

30:03.540 --> 30:06.660
Yeah, so Julius kind of, he comes to and...

30:06.660 --> 30:08.860
I mean, you're in Fight, Flight or Freezer at this point.

30:09.820 --> 30:10.900
Freeze.

30:10.900 --> 30:14.260
Well, I'm going to go freeze.

30:14.260 --> 30:15.740
Freeze will be four, five, six.

30:15.740 --> 30:17.380
Fight, flight.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.060
Okay, flight is one, fight is two or three.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.460
Go ahead and roll a D six.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.020
That's a three.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.820
So you're going to fight.

30:28.100 --> 30:28.940
Fight, yeah.

30:28.940 --> 30:29.840
Fight.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.980
Well, no, yeah, fight.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.100
Fight is going to be your response here.

30:34.100 --> 30:38.060
So I'm going to just...

30:38.860 --> 30:41.180
Fucking attack a doctor.

30:41.180 --> 30:42.020
Yep.

30:42.020 --> 30:43.340
Go ahead and roll.

30:43.340 --> 30:46.260
Are you using your hands or are you going to grab something

30:46.260 --> 30:48.840
and utilize a weapon of some sort?

30:48.840 --> 30:51.060
There's broken glass everywhere.

30:51.060 --> 30:53.560
It's too far away from you to grab.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.900
Yeah, it's 10 meters across the room.

30:55.900 --> 30:56.900
What's close to me?

30:56.900 --> 30:58.780
There's a whole like medical bay.

30:58.780 --> 31:00.140
It just doesn't slide across grass floors

31:00.140 --> 31:01.100
like it might on something.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.380
Oh yeah.

31:02.380 --> 31:03.420
Exactly.

31:03.420 --> 31:06.220
There's a whole medical cart like right in front of you.

31:06.220 --> 31:09.580
Yeah, I'm going to grab the blood pressure monitor.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.640
Just start swinging.

31:11.640 --> 31:12.840
Okay, awesome.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.020
Go ahead and roll a melee weapons.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.540
He's got a 90 in that.

31:18.540 --> 31:19.460
I don't mind.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.660
I got a 59 on a 50.

31:21.660 --> 31:24.220
Oh shit, it's a higher skill than I would have guessed.

31:24.220 --> 31:25.060
I'm athletic.

31:25.060 --> 31:29.460
You fling your arms wildly at this medical professional

31:29.460 --> 31:32.300
who just helped your friend and they're backing up

31:32.300 --> 31:35.660
and they are really, really confused.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.140
And they see the crazed look in your eye.

31:38.140 --> 31:39.140
Okay, we're leaving.

31:39.140 --> 31:41.500
And they grabbed the medical cart

31:41.500 --> 31:43.860
and kind of wheel it backwards away from you.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.020
Julius is screaming,

31:45.020 --> 31:48.420
you fucking magicked my friend back and then the turtle,

31:48.420 --> 31:50.860
you got the turtle energy.

31:53.020 --> 31:56.980
The two look at each other and they look back at you

31:56.980 --> 32:01.040
and then they look at each other and then they dip.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.420
Probably the best solution.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.700
Beck is looking at Julius and hearing him saying that

32:04.740 --> 32:09.380
and he's nodding vigorously to whoever is in the room still.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.500
It is literally just the three of you

32:11.500 --> 32:14.340
and the body of Chuck in the other room at this point.

32:14.340 --> 32:17.860
So Cal this whole time has been like watching everything.

32:17.860 --> 32:20.140
He was furiously taking notes while

32:22.340 --> 32:25.460
Julius was fighting with the doctors.

32:25.460 --> 32:28.500
And as soon as he senses that like the audio is right,

32:28.500 --> 32:31.220
he motions to Beck to roll and he says,

32:31.220 --> 32:33.120
tonight, you're a little yeeted.

32:34.700 --> 32:39.060
Turtle mayor of Godel Gulag assassinated

32:39.060 --> 32:40.180
and the chief suspect,

32:40.180 --> 32:42.980
his political rival is an unknown condition.

32:42.980 --> 32:45.120
Tune in to Can Action News for more.

32:46.120 --> 32:49.020
Stevie is standing there with eyes,

32:49.020 --> 32:53.440
absolutely as wide as eyes can be.

32:58.120 --> 33:03.120
Yeah, I didn't think this would happen.

33:05.180 --> 33:06.260
Did you get that?

33:06.260 --> 33:08.780
And then Beck is pulling down the camera

33:08.780 --> 33:10.820
and is looking at the viewfinder

33:10.820 --> 33:13.940
and realizes he didn't really get much

33:13.940 --> 33:16.580
and his face kind of slacks.

33:16.580 --> 33:18.140
Fuck.

33:18.140 --> 33:19.660
There's no proof.

33:19.660 --> 33:21.300
Oh shit.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.300
How's Julius feeling at this point?

33:23.300 --> 33:25.300
I would say absolutely enraged

33:25.300 --> 33:27.540
and about to like punch Beck.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.380
You like wanna break glass.

33:29.380 --> 33:33.260
Julius stomps over to Chuck's body and is yelling,

33:33.300 --> 33:35.780
Sandro, Sandro.

33:35.780 --> 33:39.100
Cal kind of like cautiously walks up behind you

33:39.100 --> 33:41.680
and he puts out an arm on your shoulder

33:41.680 --> 33:44.260
and he just says, Julius.

33:44.260 --> 33:47.180
Julius whips around and his like teeth gritted

33:47.180 --> 33:49.820
and like fucking spit coming out of his mouth

33:49.820 --> 33:52.040
and fucking hit.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.860
Cal puts both hands on your shoulders

33:55.860 --> 33:59.740
and he says, you're Julius Summers, City Action News

33:59.740 --> 34:01.860
and we're here to do a job.

34:01.900 --> 34:04.420
Beck has the camera up and is catching this.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.140
The turtle's in him.

34:11.140 --> 34:11.980
The turtle?

34:11.980 --> 34:12.940
I don't know.

34:12.940 --> 34:13.860
Sent who?

34:13.860 --> 34:15.060
The turtle's in him.

34:15.060 --> 34:17.020
Oh, is in who?

34:17.020 --> 34:19.940
You look down and you see the body of Chuck Bidwell

34:19.940 --> 34:24.700
just absolutely covered in like cuts and blood

34:24.700 --> 34:29.420
and is covered in sweat, just like drenched clothes

34:29.460 --> 34:32.060
and not lifeless, he's breathing.

34:32.060 --> 34:36.380
You can tell like his dry fit green polo

34:36.380 --> 34:39.420
is kind of bobbing slowly up and down.

34:39.420 --> 34:42.260
Is that medical wrap still lying on the ground?

34:42.260 --> 34:44.620
Like, no, but sure.

34:46.060 --> 34:47.260
We're gonna take this everywhere

34:47.260 --> 34:49.100
and heal all our wounds all the time.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.900
Yeah, no, the medical staff took that with them.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.320
The only thing that you guys still have

34:55.320 --> 34:56.860
is the blood pressure monitor.

34:56.940 --> 34:59.220
Which I slap on him to see if he's got any.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.340
No.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.700
Yeah, you can tell that he's breathing.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.020
Is he like bleeding really, really bad

35:07.020 --> 35:09.740
or just like kind of minor cuts and stuff?

35:09.740 --> 35:10.980
It's not good.

35:10.980 --> 35:14.420
There's a pool of blood beneath him and you see-

35:14.420 --> 35:16.020
Nobody's ever almost died

35:16.020 --> 35:18.940
from falling through a glass window, have they?

35:21.020 --> 35:23.340
You can't, yeah, you can't like lose blood, right?

35:23.340 --> 35:24.820
Yeah, no, probably not.

35:24.820 --> 35:28.340
You definitely can't have an 18 inch long piece of glass

35:28.340 --> 35:31.100
stuck in your upper thigh, butt area

35:31.100 --> 35:33.260
and then lose a third of your blood

35:33.260 --> 35:37.580
and have two blood transfusions on the operating table and-

35:37.580 --> 35:39.400
Yeah, not never have your penis work right again.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.460
You know, just like-

35:40.460 --> 35:44.460
It works, it just doesn't work right.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.860
I was describing my shotgun blast to you the other day,

35:48.860 --> 35:50.500
right?

35:50.500 --> 35:51.340
Yeah.

35:51.340 --> 35:52.160
Oh, wait, yeah.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.000
Yeah, you said-

35:53.000 --> 35:53.840
Is that from that?

35:54.120 --> 35:54.960
No.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.920
No cilia in your pee hole.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.960
That's right, there's no cilia in my pee hole.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.560
No cilia in your pee hole,

36:00.560 --> 36:02.960
which we all are helpful helpers.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.960
I burnt it all out, vaping through my dick.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.020
Oh, that sounds rad.

36:12.680 --> 36:15.280
How is that the response?

36:15.280 --> 36:16.520
I don't know.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.680
Well, how did we get to this?

36:17.680 --> 36:22.360
Oh yeah, he's cut up and you almost died.

36:24.840 --> 36:25.680
Ding.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.440
And you all actually see coming up

36:28.440 --> 36:31.640
the synthetic bouncy walkway up to the second floor,

36:31.640 --> 36:33.200
you see through the glass wall

36:33.200 --> 36:36.400
on the east side of the room you're currently in,

36:36.400 --> 36:39.960
this pencil-like woman with the spiky hair

36:39.960 --> 36:44.560
you know as Barbara Bidwell, the wife of Chuck Bidwell,

36:44.560 --> 36:47.480
is absolutely losing her mind

36:47.480 --> 36:51.160
as she's running into this room going,

36:51.280 --> 36:55.920
oh my God, oh my God, no, no, Chuck, Chuck,

36:55.920 --> 36:57.480
what's this, what happened?

36:57.480 --> 36:59.600
What happened here, what did you do?

36:59.600 --> 37:01.000
Barbara, try to stay sharp.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.120
No, I will not, I refuse to stay sharp.

37:06.120 --> 37:06.960
Well done.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.440
Your husband killed the turtle.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.640
Wait, what?

37:12.640 --> 37:13.460
Well-

37:13.460 --> 37:14.600
The mayor's dead.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.420
Yes.

37:15.420 --> 37:16.260
And your husband might be too soon.

37:16.260 --> 37:17.080
And for a brief moment,

37:17.080 --> 37:19.980
I think your husband was the mayor, officially.

37:19.980 --> 37:21.820
She's down on the ground now.

37:21.820 --> 37:24.940
That's nice, that's if that's any consolation.

37:24.940 --> 37:27.520
Hands and knees in glass shards.

37:27.520 --> 37:30.420
Now her hands are bleeding, her knees are bleeding

37:30.420 --> 37:34.540
and she's, you know, just, it's okay.

37:34.540 --> 37:36.540
It's okay, Chucky, it'll be okay.

37:36.540 --> 37:38.180
And she's kind of like slapping his face

37:38.180 --> 37:41.300
and it's like, wake up, wake up, wake up.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.460
Medical, medical!

37:43.460 --> 37:44.340
Barbara, Barbara,

37:44.340 --> 37:47.100
do you have one of those communicator devices?

37:47.100 --> 37:48.420
They're on their way.

37:48.460 --> 37:52.260
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.900
I don't know that they are on their way

37:53.900 --> 37:57.540
because they were like on their not way a minute ago.

37:57.540 --> 38:00.100
Yes, many of them were already here

38:00.100 --> 38:02.260
and then they fled in terror.

38:02.260 --> 38:04.260
You might want to try to call them again.

38:04.260 --> 38:06.260
It's like they didn't want to help.

38:06.260 --> 38:07.460
They didn't want to help?

38:07.460 --> 38:09.060
No, that doesn't make any sense.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.100
Okay, and she pulls out one of the same-

38:12.100 --> 38:14.260
Full disclosure, Julius beat some of them away

38:14.260 --> 38:15.400
with a monitor.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.620
As she's pulling out her radio device,

38:17.660 --> 38:19.380
she looks at you and she's like,

38:19.380 --> 38:22.620
well, that's probably why they left.

38:22.620 --> 38:24.620
Medical, medical, yeah.

38:24.620 --> 38:26.740
We need a medical up to the second floor of the lab.

38:26.740 --> 38:28.640
Yeah, right by the entrance.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.140
Yes, boys, come immediately.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.500
I mean, I know this is a crisis moment for her,

38:32.500 --> 38:34.140
but she's got a very sultry voice.

38:35.420 --> 38:37.220
As soon as Cal says my name

38:37.220 --> 38:39.440
and describes what I did to the doctors,

38:39.440 --> 38:41.460
I kind of like come do more.

38:41.460 --> 38:43.460
And I'm like, that's fucking, that's ridiculous.

38:43.460 --> 38:47.540
So he kind of like sets the blood pressure thing down

38:48.420 --> 38:51.820
and he looks at Beck and does the rolling signal

38:51.820 --> 38:54.780
and then like tries without asking permission

38:54.780 --> 38:56.740
to mic up Barbara.

38:57.740 --> 38:58.860
We constantly do this.

38:58.860 --> 39:01.360
We're constantly looking back to see if Beck is rolling,

39:01.360 --> 39:02.860
even though it's completely unnecessary.

39:02.860 --> 39:04.200
It's always, he is always.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.460
It's just Joe nodding.

39:08.740 --> 39:10.100
He is, he is.

39:12.540 --> 39:14.460
What are you doing?

39:14.460 --> 39:16.500
No, I'm not being interviewed right now.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.540
Medical, medical.

39:18.540 --> 39:19.860
She swats your hand away

39:19.860 --> 39:22.420
and the medical staff tentatively, oh.

39:24.420 --> 39:26.420
Like kind of dip toe in.

39:26.420 --> 39:27.720
Inches towards you

39:27.720 --> 39:30.500
and they're keeping their distance away from Julius.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.500
Julius backs away and puts his hands up.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.800
And they are just confusedly looking across at him

39:35.800 --> 39:38.220
while moving to do their job,

39:38.220 --> 39:43.220
which is to get Chuck Bidwell up onto this bulletin carriage.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.100
Wow.

39:46.640 --> 39:47.480
Bulletin carriage?

39:47.480 --> 39:48.560
He means bull pin cart.

39:55.220 --> 39:56.340
That was incredible.

39:56.340 --> 39:57.180
Oh my God.

39:58.140 --> 40:00.220
Okay, do you not know what bullpen means

40:00.220 --> 40:01.420
or what bulletin means?

40:03.060 --> 40:04.920
Because only one is Squamous.

40:13.220 --> 40:14.940
Let's get him up on this bulletin carriage.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.740
Let's get him on the bulletin carriage.

40:19.140 --> 40:21.280
Holy shit, I didn't know that's what it looked like.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.500
It's a big hat.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.580
It's a big helmet.

40:25.020 --> 40:26.680
It's a baseball wearing a hat.

40:26.680 --> 40:27.520
Yeah.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.380
They all look a little different, but the best ones.

40:31.380 --> 40:32.700
Wow, that rips.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.380
They were really popular in like the late 70s and 80s.

40:35.380 --> 40:37.580
And now I'm gonna Google bulletin carriage.

40:37.580 --> 40:39.020
Yeah, that's what I thought you were looking up.

40:39.020 --> 40:42.380
No, that'll be the dolly image we posted.

40:43.340 --> 40:44.700
I'll do it right now.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.860
You guys still like that meme, right?

40:47.860 --> 40:48.700
Yeah.

40:48.700 --> 40:49.520
Of course you do.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.360
Of course you do.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.300
We're gonna do it enough that it's our meme.

40:54.580 --> 40:58.040
Beck is kind of now saying like pass the camera

40:58.040 --> 41:02.340
toward the belabored breathing body of Chuck.

41:02.340 --> 41:04.060
Dude, you're gonna be fine.

41:04.060 --> 41:07.300
Like I had holes in my legs and now I don't, dude.

41:07.300 --> 41:08.260
You're gonna be okay.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.860
You see a little lung come out.

41:10.380 --> 41:14.340
Chuck, you're gonna be fine.

41:14.340 --> 41:17.820
Or is it Sandro?

41:17.820 --> 41:18.660
What are you doing?

41:18.660 --> 41:19.940
He's not awake.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.020
What are you?

41:21.020 --> 41:22.820
And they're moving him into this cart

41:22.820 --> 41:26.020
and they begin to kind of cart him out of this room.

41:26.020 --> 41:31.020
The medical staff don't want to be around you three at all.

41:31.740 --> 41:32.820
Specifically Julius.

41:32.820 --> 41:33.860
Makes sense.

41:33.860 --> 41:34.900
So they're trying to get him out.

41:34.900 --> 41:37.660
And of course Barbara is just at the side

41:37.660 --> 41:39.140
of her husband, Chuck.

41:39.380 --> 41:40.860
As the group walks out.

41:40.860 --> 41:43.460
So are we now being left in this room by ourselves?

41:43.460 --> 41:44.300
Yep.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.340
Interesting.

41:45.340 --> 41:48.060
I want to look around for interesting things.

41:48.060 --> 41:50.980
I would like to perhaps roll the search.

41:50.980 --> 41:52.380
Yeah, so this is kind of the first time

41:52.380 --> 41:53.500
you guys have looked around here.

41:53.500 --> 41:54.900
Go ahead and roll that search.

41:54.900 --> 41:58.980
You were previously in a conference room

41:58.980 --> 42:00.780
that overlooked this area.

42:00.780 --> 42:02.820
So there's a big table off to the side

42:02.820 --> 42:04.980
where you guys kind of weren't.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.700
Hey, I finally passed a roll.

42:06.700 --> 42:07.540
Oh nice.

42:07.540 --> 42:09.020
It's a 38 on a 40.

42:09.900 --> 42:10.740
I got a 34 and a 60.

42:10.740 --> 42:13.420
I got a 42 on a 70.

42:13.420 --> 42:15.620
Okay, so success is all around.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.060
Success is all around.

42:17.060 --> 42:18.700
Wait, did you say 32?

42:18.700 --> 42:19.540
42.

42:19.540 --> 42:20.900
Oh, I thought you said 32

42:20.900 --> 42:22.420
and then we all would have had 30s

42:22.420 --> 42:25.180
and that would have been full out.

42:25.180 --> 42:26.540
That's crazy.

42:26.540 --> 42:30.420
So the room that Chuck busted into was an office.

42:30.420 --> 42:31.780
It was an empty office.

42:31.780 --> 42:33.260
No one was working in there today,

42:33.260 --> 42:36.500
but it just has kind of a spartan desk

42:36.500 --> 42:38.740
and anything cool on that desk.

42:39.340 --> 42:42.420
Like a key card or secret villain plan.

42:42.420 --> 42:45.900
Oh yeah, there's a secret villain plan for sure.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.060
As you've seen so far,

42:47.060 --> 42:49.860
that you might not need a key card in this whole place

42:49.860 --> 42:52.820
as doors don't seem to be too much of an issue.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.700
Walls might need a clicker.

42:54.700 --> 42:57.740
Yeah, which I see and grab.

42:57.740 --> 42:58.560
Yeah, sure.

42:58.560 --> 42:59.400
How about that?

42:59.400 --> 43:00.240
You grab a clicker,

43:00.240 --> 43:03.140
which will be able to open up any doors or walls

43:03.140 --> 43:06.220
that you come across while you were here in Grover's Gorge.

43:07.180 --> 43:09.020
Fuck yeah, dude.

43:09.020 --> 43:09.860
Excellent.

43:09.860 --> 43:11.680
Congratulations.

43:11.680 --> 43:12.820
Along with that.

43:12.820 --> 43:13.660
I'm the mayor now.

43:13.660 --> 43:15.500
You all hear murmuring

43:16.540 --> 43:19.500
and it's coming from out front of the lab

43:19.500 --> 43:21.460
kind of by the statues

43:21.460 --> 43:25.260
and it's almost like you can hear a crowd gathering.

43:25.260 --> 43:27.340
Is it like where the turtle is?

43:27.340 --> 43:30.900
It would be exactly where the turtle was.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.120
Maybe we should get out there amongst the mob

43:33.160 --> 43:36.720
instead of being directly opposite the mob.

43:36.720 --> 43:40.000
If we're inside it filming, getting interviews and stuff,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.540
they're less likely to turn on us for killing their mayor.

43:42.540 --> 43:43.380
Very true.

43:43.380 --> 43:46.040
Also, we don't tell them.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.640
Dude, but like, they're gonna pin it on me.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.720
I'm already an animal killer here.

43:50.720 --> 43:52.640
No, no, no, Beck, Beck.

43:52.640 --> 43:54.800
There's no proof of it anymore.

43:54.800 --> 43:55.920
He looks at his leg.

43:55.920 --> 43:58.840
Yeah, I mean, people saw it.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.860
If you guys don't think they're gonna turn on me,

44:00.860 --> 44:02.280
I'll go with you, of course.

44:02.280 --> 44:06.840
Now, Beck, I know this might seem harsh and even unpleasant,

44:06.840 --> 44:09.000
but if they start to turn on you,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.840
all you have to do is show them your headphones.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.780
Good, good point, dude.

44:13.780 --> 44:16.280
They all seem really freaked out by my headphones.

44:16.280 --> 44:17.920
That should buy us some time.

44:17.920 --> 44:22.920
The trauma of getting godled seems to pause the psyche.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.680
Yeah, yeah, man, I like it.

44:25.680 --> 44:26.520
I mean, I don't like it.

44:26.520 --> 44:27.780
It's awful and it sounds like these people

44:27.780 --> 44:30.780
are maybe being subjected to inhumane things,

44:30.780 --> 44:33.780
but I like it for our purposes now.

44:33.780 --> 44:35.900
Beck looks at Stevie at this point.

44:35.900 --> 44:36.860
Yeah.

44:36.860 --> 44:39.160
I mean, it seems like we could have been more prepared

44:39.160 --> 44:41.060
to enter this scenario.

44:41.060 --> 44:44.460
Well, I didn't want you guys to blow my cover,

44:44.460 --> 44:47.400
so I didn't want to really give too much away,

44:48.420 --> 44:49.260
if that makes sense.

44:49.260 --> 44:52.180
I guess now that that's done, it doesn't matter anymore,

44:52.180 --> 44:54.900
but I would say we're kind of all in the same

44:54.900 --> 44:57.460
fucked situation at this point.

44:57.460 --> 44:59.580
Stevie, I understand your reasoning,

44:59.580 --> 45:01.460
though if you had told us your identity,

45:01.460 --> 45:03.480
it would have allowed us to prepare

45:03.480 --> 45:06.220
a more comprehensive infiltration.

45:06.220 --> 45:07.520
You make a really good point,

45:07.520 --> 45:09.960
and then next time that I do this, I'll let you know.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.260
That's all I ask.

45:11.260 --> 45:12.100
Okay.

45:12.100 --> 45:14.900
When we infiltrate the secret company town

45:14.900 --> 45:16.660
on your mom's side of the family.

45:18.660 --> 45:21.260
Perhaps give us a couple of weeks to prepare.

45:21.260 --> 45:24.820
She laughs and then you see genuine laughter and joy

45:24.820 --> 45:26.940
come across her face for the first time.

45:26.940 --> 45:29.100
She's been really nervous this whole time.

45:29.460 --> 45:32.100
What do you think the chances of us going out there

45:32.100 --> 45:35.940
and being apprehended and sent to, I saw the judge,

45:35.940 --> 45:39.160
I assumed, god-old jail for killing an animal

45:39.160 --> 45:40.700
and maybe the mayor?

45:40.700 --> 45:43.380
Hang on, real fast, just so we're all on the same page.

45:43.380 --> 45:45.180
We had nothing to do with the turtle,

45:45.180 --> 45:47.020
and we're not even lying.

45:47.020 --> 45:48.020
Yes, true.

45:48.020 --> 45:53.020
I mean, it was quite old, and it needed a lot of makeup.

45:54.260 --> 45:56.720
None of us were anywhere near it, right?

45:56.720 --> 45:57.560
No.

45:57.560 --> 45:58.880
No. No.

45:59.520 --> 46:00.360
Can I human that?

46:00.360 --> 46:01.320
Yeah, sure.

46:01.320 --> 46:02.160
84.

46:02.160 --> 46:03.760
Yeah, seems.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.720
Let's get a shot of the crowd from above

46:09.720 --> 46:11.600
before we join, at least.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.620
Yeah, that kind of creeps to the edge.

46:13.620 --> 46:15.960
He doesn't want to pull focus up to himself up there,

46:15.960 --> 46:17.760
so he's maybe holding the camera out a little bit,

46:17.760 --> 46:19.400
using the viewfinder at an angle.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.720
Oh yeah, this has to be incognito and stealthy.

46:22.720 --> 46:25.480
Otherwise, it's just the three of us standing over

46:25.480 --> 46:28.280
at the fucking balcony where they're pointing down.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.120
Yeah.

46:30.560 --> 46:32.840
Can you guys do that for the shot, though?

46:32.840 --> 46:34.320
That one is sobbing.

46:34.320 --> 46:35.160
Film her.

46:38.280 --> 46:40.780
Yeah, I'm gonna need the videographer roll here.

46:44.280 --> 46:45.800
74 on an 80.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.360
Ooh.

46:47.360 --> 46:48.200
Very nice.

46:48.200 --> 46:51.160
You were able to slyly put this in a position

46:51.160 --> 46:55.080
where you know that in the ceiling above,

46:56.080 --> 46:58.320
there's a pattern to where if most people

46:58.320 --> 47:01.260
are looking up toward you, the camera kind of blends in

47:01.260 --> 47:02.720
with what would be behind it.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.320
Smart man.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.160
Nice.

47:06.160 --> 47:08.600
The ceiling is just a tesseract of a camera.

47:11.040 --> 47:13.480
Yeah, it sounds like a pretty cool ceiling.

47:13.480 --> 47:15.920
No, literally, there's just thousands of cameras

47:15.920 --> 47:18.580
filming your every move while you're in Donald Gorge.

47:18.580 --> 47:20.640
Hey, let me tell you something right now.

47:20.640 --> 47:21.840
There's definitely not.

47:22.960 --> 47:24.840
Also, to prove our innocence.

47:25.440 --> 47:26.840
If you can fucking kill a balrog

47:26.840 --> 47:30.120
and make a ravine in a magic town,

47:30.120 --> 47:32.400
you probably aren't scared of shit.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.240
Yeah, that's a good point.

47:34.240 --> 47:36.280
Why would I have a security camera?

47:36.280 --> 47:37.520
I killed a balrog.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.360
I can't remember, were you saying the stuff

47:41.360 --> 47:43.360
about blending into the crowd and character?

47:43.360 --> 47:44.600
An excellent idea.

47:44.600 --> 47:47.720
Yeah, I'll film interviews and we'll just look like

47:47.720 --> 47:49.280
we were doing what we were doing,

47:49.280 --> 47:53.520
which is just doing interviews for City Action News.

47:53.520 --> 47:54.360
That's what we do.

47:54.760 --> 47:55.840
Tell them the truth.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.920
That's what we do and that's what we did

47:56.920 --> 47:58.120
and that's all that we were doing.

47:58.120 --> 47:58.960
Yeah.

47:58.960 --> 47:59.800
All right.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.960
That's all we saw and that's all we saw.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.600
Can crew on three.

48:02.600 --> 48:03.720
And he puts his hand up.

48:03.720 --> 48:07.620
One, two, three, can crew.

48:07.620 --> 48:10.800
And then we reservoir dogs like out of the building

48:10.800 --> 48:13.640
all on a line, all very confidently like,

48:13.640 --> 48:15.560
I got a tripod over her shoulder.

48:15.560 --> 48:18.560
Cal just walks up right to the first crying person.

48:18.560 --> 48:21.200
Cal Colorado here on a sad day.

48:21.200 --> 48:24.320
Sir, where were you when you heard the mayor had died?

48:25.160 --> 48:30.160
The crowd is all staring at you as you come out.

48:30.400 --> 48:35.400
You walk past the dried up corpse of Sandra the turtle,

48:37.160 --> 48:39.920
put a microphone in the first person's face

48:41.440 --> 48:46.320
and the crowd immediately parts and standing there,

48:46.320 --> 48:50.160
you see a rail thin man with a balding,

48:50.160 --> 48:51.840
mostly already balded head.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.960
Is this another pencil person?

48:54.480 --> 48:57.520
He's wearing a tattered three piece double breasted suit.

48:57.520 --> 48:58.560
Turtle, turtle.

48:58.560 --> 49:03.360
But his skin that you can see is bruised and scratched

49:03.360 --> 49:05.260
and seems to cover his entire body.

49:05.260 --> 49:07.300
But the suit covers most of that.

49:08.200 --> 49:13.200
And he is rabid, almost foaming at the mouth.

49:14.320 --> 49:19.320
And he drags a long thin cane against the ground

49:20.200 --> 49:21.700
as he approaches you.

49:22.720 --> 49:23.560
Holy shit.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.880
Well now then boys,

49:28.200 --> 49:33.200
I do believe that you are under arrest

49:34.440 --> 49:38.560
for the murder of our mayor,

49:39.800 --> 49:41.960
Sandra the turtle.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.840
I believe in fact, no such thing will happen.

49:46.840 --> 49:49.040
We had no part in your mayor's death.

49:49.040 --> 49:50.120
He was placed carelessly.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.580
Roll dodge or fight back.

49:52.140 --> 49:55.740
Just Cal who's talking right to him

49:55.740 --> 49:59.260
cause he's walking right up to Cal as he drags that cane.

49:59.260 --> 50:01.620
Well, Cal rolls a 92

50:01.620 --> 50:03.780
and probably gets smacked in the face with it.

50:03.780 --> 50:07.200
In the middle of you talking, you're just slapped.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.660
Not even for damage.

50:09.660 --> 50:12.580
It literally does no hit points of damage to you.

50:12.580 --> 50:15.720
It is to shut you up and put you in your place.

50:15.720 --> 50:17.660
And he says, now then.

50:17.660 --> 50:20.020
Cal doesn't like that because he was telling the truth.

50:20.060 --> 50:22.600
Beck just saw Cal get hit with a cane

50:22.600 --> 50:25.540
and his reaction is not to stand out.

50:25.540 --> 50:26.380
His friend just got hit.

50:26.380 --> 50:28.180
Whoa, hey, bro.

50:28.180 --> 50:30.420
You can't just go around hitting people with canes.

50:30.420 --> 50:32.780
Immediately the tip of his cane is in your face.

50:32.780 --> 50:33.620
A guy comes running up.

50:33.620 --> 50:35.820
He can, he can, he can.

50:35.820 --> 50:40.820
He did, didn't you see it?

50:46.180 --> 50:49.720
When he sits back, it's like when Beck saw Cal get hit.

50:50.660 --> 50:54.460
Excuse me, but this man is an employee of City Action News.

50:54.460 --> 50:56.940
We were invited here to cover your community.

50:56.940 --> 50:58.580
He's going to punch you in the nose.

50:58.580 --> 51:00.400
If you want to try to dodge.

51:00.400 --> 51:03.300
I mean, I'm going to try to like, yeah, I want to actually,

51:03.300 --> 51:06.000
I guess if he's throwing punches, we're going to fight.

51:07.960 --> 51:09.060
I pass with a 14.

51:09.060 --> 51:10.820
Well, then I beat you with a 32.

51:10.820 --> 51:11.940
Oh, absolutely you do.

51:11.940 --> 51:13.740
So he goes to throw a punch and?

51:13.740 --> 51:16.740
Cal catches it and then knocks it aside.

51:16.780 --> 51:20.060
Sir, are you not interested in hearing the truth?

51:20.060 --> 51:20.940
While he's talking,

51:20.940 --> 51:24.620
Julius is going to try to pin a microphone on his.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.700
He's distracted.

51:28.700 --> 51:30.100
He was trying to fight Cal.

51:32.420 --> 51:34.780
You know, this is one of those let it happen moments.

51:34.780 --> 51:36.020
Cool.

51:36.020 --> 51:39.220
You're just going up and he's literally, he loves it.

51:39.220 --> 51:41.380
He looks down and he's like,

51:41.380 --> 51:45.520
yes, these words need to be heard, of course.

51:46.440 --> 51:49.040
You will know your place, good sir.

51:49.040 --> 51:53.440
Now I'm of course, Cal, Colorado city action news.

51:53.440 --> 51:55.600
First things first for the viewers

51:55.600 --> 51:58.360
who we are streaming live to at this moment.

51:58.360 --> 52:01.240
And he wants to like persuade or fluff that guy.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.440
Could you please state your name clearly?

52:04.440 --> 52:05.520
So go ahead and roll.

52:05.520 --> 52:08.720
He's going to roll a human against your persuade.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.440
He succeeds with a critical success.

52:12.440 --> 52:13.560
Oh shit.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.000
I also succeed.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.200
I thought you were going to say

52:16.200 --> 52:18.360
with a higher critical success,

52:18.360 --> 52:22.720
I quit with a 33 and he looks at the camera

52:22.720 --> 52:25.320
and he smirks and he looks back at you.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.480
Oh yes, of course.

52:27.480 --> 52:32.480
My name is the landlord Vernon Covington.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.940
And when he says the landlord,

52:36.920 --> 52:41.840
you can feel the chill run down the spine

52:41.840 --> 52:46.280
of all in attendance of this crowd.

52:46.280 --> 52:51.000
Sucks the air right out of this beautiful sunny day.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.320
How did you say he was dressed?

52:52.320 --> 52:55.640
In a tattered three piece double-breasted suit

52:55.640 --> 52:59.160
that mostly covers the bruises and scratches

52:59.160 --> 53:00.900
that are all over his body.

53:02.400 --> 53:05.700
Beck wants to twiddle his headphones just to try,

53:05.700 --> 53:08.640
like as though trying to tempt a dog with a treat.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.840
And as you do so,

53:09.840 --> 53:13.000
you see that nothing about his suit adds up.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.520
It's not nice, which everyone's clothes here are nice.

53:16.520 --> 53:19.680
And it's also all over the place color wise.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.640
I mean, it probably looks like it's out of the forties,

53:21.640 --> 53:22.480
right?

53:22.480 --> 53:23.320
Or fifties.

53:23.320 --> 53:25.080
Eh, it's just like old shit.

53:25.080 --> 53:25.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.120
It's not like...

53:27.120 --> 53:28.360
I mean, style wise.

53:28.360 --> 53:29.600
Oh, style wise, yeah.

53:29.600 --> 53:31.840
It's just kind of like a big boxy cut.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.040
It might even be like eighties or some shit.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.880
I love an eighties cut.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.040
David Byrne.

53:39.080 --> 53:41.280
Do I see the body of the turtle laying anywhere?

53:41.280 --> 53:42.520
Oh yeah, they left it out.

53:42.520 --> 53:43.780
I think Luke was on the same page as me.

53:43.780 --> 53:46.120
I thought this was the personification of the turtle.

53:46.120 --> 53:46.960
Yeah, for sure.

53:46.960 --> 53:50.240
So at least it's not the body thereof

53:50.240 --> 53:51.560
and his name isn't Sandro.

53:51.560 --> 53:53.800
So I don't know if this is the case or not.

53:53.800 --> 53:56.980
I just thought Luke was expressing his mania

53:56.980 --> 54:00.740
about seeing turtle bodies fly into other people.

54:00.740 --> 54:02.400
Is that the shit you fucking saw?

54:03.280 --> 54:04.360
You gonna talk about it in character

54:04.360 --> 54:05.960
or you gonna talk about it out of character?

54:05.960 --> 54:07.160
I'm asking my friend, Luke.

54:07.600 --> 54:10.560
Will you please let us have a conversation, Zach?

54:10.560 --> 54:13.000
No, Vernon Covington is making it very difficult

54:13.000 --> 54:14.360
for you all to have a conversation

54:14.360 --> 54:17.880
as he is doing his best to keep you quiet and in your place.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.560
Yeah, this guy sucks.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.680
Yeah.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.600
Cal pulls out a gun and shoots him.

54:22.600 --> 54:23.440
Yeah.

54:28.120 --> 54:30.800
By God, if I'm going to be found guilty of murder,

54:30.800 --> 54:32.780
I better damn well be guilty.

54:32.780 --> 54:37.780
What authority do you have to place us under arrest?

54:39.100 --> 54:42.340
He looks back and in the back of the crowd,

54:42.340 --> 54:46.060
you see the judge wearing the powdered wig

54:46.060 --> 54:47.780
and the judge's robes.

54:47.780 --> 54:49.980
And he looks back and he says,

54:49.980 --> 54:54.980
oh, I do believe that the authority is here with us now

54:56.600 --> 54:59.380
in order to make a decision.

54:59.380 --> 55:01.680
And then he's going to start prodding you

55:02.640 --> 55:05.360
like a farmer poking cattle

55:05.360 --> 55:09.960
to kind of get you guys to stand all together in one spot.

55:09.960 --> 55:12.660
Cal stands right where he is and he says,

55:12.660 --> 55:15.540
you're insinuating that the judge over there,

55:15.540 --> 55:18.360
that's your authority, but what is their authority?

55:18.360 --> 55:21.280
None of you are agents of the state

55:21.280 --> 55:22.800
or the federal government.

55:22.800 --> 55:24.600
You are vigilantes.

55:24.600 --> 55:27.400
You have no right to put us on trial

55:27.400 --> 55:29.060
for a crime we did not commit.

55:29.060 --> 55:31.980
And I feel, you know, we did not commit this.

55:31.980 --> 55:35.620
The judge walks up to the front

55:35.620 --> 55:38.580
as you've been making your plea

55:38.580 --> 55:41.060
and Vernon Covington looks down at you,

55:41.060 --> 55:44.400
smiles really big and starts laughing.

55:45.900 --> 55:46.740
Oh my.

55:52.740 --> 55:56.300
Where are your courts?

55:56.340 --> 55:59.980
Where are your police officers?

55:59.980 --> 56:02.660
Where is your law now?

56:02.660 --> 56:05.660
You perhaps misunderstand me.

56:05.660 --> 56:08.860
I do not dispute that you could do anything

56:08.860 --> 56:12.660
to us you might want, but you do not do it

56:12.660 --> 56:15.700
with the grace of the law that you spit on

56:15.700 --> 56:17.100
and they will come for you.

56:17.100 --> 56:19.380
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

56:19.380 --> 56:22.440
but the name Cal Colorado means something in this town

56:22.440 --> 56:26.720
and he will not be sacrificed for some fucking turtle.

56:26.720 --> 56:29.780
Vernon Covington has been smiling the entire time.

56:30.680 --> 56:33.180
He looks at Beck Wilder and Julius Summers

56:33.180 --> 56:37.000
and he says, any squawking from the other two?

56:37.000 --> 56:39.040
Looks over at Stevie.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.520
And you down there?

56:40.520 --> 56:41.880
Anything from you?

56:41.880 --> 56:44.320
When he looks at Julius, he pokes him with his cane

56:44.320 --> 56:45.860
and Julius wants to try to grab it

56:45.860 --> 56:48.800
and snap it over his huge fucking thighs.

56:48.800 --> 56:49.640
Awesome.

56:49.640 --> 56:50.480
Awesome.

56:51.440 --> 56:54.760
He's gotta get a bonus for the size of his thighs.

56:59.640 --> 57:01.520
I'm gonna use my luck and that's a nine.

57:01.520 --> 57:02.920
Wait, was that a contested roll?

57:02.920 --> 57:04.680
I'm gonna tell you to not use your luck.

57:04.680 --> 57:05.840
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.480
I'm gonna be nice and tell you,

57:07.480 --> 57:09.760
no, I think that just seems super fair.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.280
I rolled a 77.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.440
Oh, so, fail I hope?

57:13.440 --> 57:14.280
Nope.

57:15.120 --> 57:17.400
That is a critical cane success.

57:17.400 --> 57:18.680
Okay, I got a 90.

57:18.680 --> 57:20.580
For Vernon Covington.

57:25.680 --> 57:27.160
What is it? Is it a nine?

57:27.160 --> 57:28.560
Yeah, that's a nine.

57:28.560 --> 57:29.720
What the fuck?

57:30.800 --> 57:32.800
How many hit points do you have right now?

57:35.440 --> 57:36.280
10.

57:37.280 --> 57:38.740
What?

57:38.740 --> 57:39.580
Why does a cane-

57:39.580 --> 57:41.340
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

57:41.340 --> 57:44.440
Like six shots to the face all at the exact same time.

57:44.440 --> 57:46.460
Blood starts spurting everywhere

57:46.460 --> 57:49.620
and you hit the ground unconscious immediately.

57:49.620 --> 57:50.860
What the fuck?

57:50.860 --> 57:53.060
Roll constitution to see if you can actually

57:53.060 --> 57:55.700
stay conscious at this point in time.

57:55.700 --> 57:58.340
As Vernon Covington stands over your body.

57:58.340 --> 58:00.940
Cal screams, Julius, no!

58:00.940 --> 58:03.540
But then also looks back to see if Beck is filming.

58:05.620 --> 58:06.460
He is.

58:08.060 --> 58:11.260
Yeah, Julius, I pass my con check.

58:11.260 --> 58:14.120
So Julius is on the ground, face bloodied,

58:14.120 --> 58:15.940
and also looking blood.

58:16.420 --> 58:18.500
And also looking back to make sure he's filming.

58:21.500 --> 58:23.780
He's like on the ground, reaching out,

58:23.780 --> 58:25.780
and making the like little roll motion.

58:26.900 --> 58:27.740
Oh my god.

58:28.940 --> 58:30.420
Holy shit.

58:30.420 --> 58:31.680
Fuck, dude.

58:32.740 --> 58:34.860
What the fuck?

58:34.860 --> 58:36.460
I'm almost dead.

58:36.460 --> 58:37.540
I don't like this guy.

58:37.540 --> 58:40.780
Vernon Covington stands over the body of Julius Summers

58:40.780 --> 58:43.020
and looks out to the crowd and says,

58:44.020 --> 58:46.540
are there any witnesses?

58:48.420 --> 58:50.260
The two medical workers in the crowd

58:50.260 --> 58:53.380
kind of raise their hand and one of them speaks up

58:53.380 --> 58:56.580
and says, uh, yeah, that one?

58:56.580 --> 58:58.500
And points at Julius.

58:58.500 --> 59:02.100
That one chased us and tried to hurt us.

59:02.100 --> 59:05.260
Vernon Covington puts his hands in the air.

59:05.260 --> 59:10.260
Do you not see what kind of men these men are, judge?

59:10.260 --> 59:12.620
Men are, judge.

59:12.620 --> 59:15.340
So Cal is looking over at Stevie.

59:15.340 --> 59:18.620
Do you really think she'll protect you?

59:18.620 --> 59:23.620
And there's a glimmer of hope in Stevie's eyes.

59:23.820 --> 59:27.360
But as you're staring into those hope-filled eyes,

59:28.300 --> 59:29.600
you hear from behind.

59:30.540 --> 59:35.540
These men deserve the proper punishment.

59:35.580 --> 59:36.420
Yes.

59:38.780 --> 59:41.940
They should be stoned to death.

59:41.940 --> 59:42.780
Fuck.

59:42.780 --> 59:43.600
Fuck.

59:45.020 --> 59:46.260
I'll say that one more time.

59:46.260 --> 59:49.120
They should be stoned to death.

59:49.120 --> 59:50.160
Hell yeah.

59:50.160 --> 59:51.000
Hell yeah.

59:51.000 --> 59:51.820
Hell yeah.

59:51.820 --> 59:52.660
Hell yeah.

59:52.660 --> 59:53.500
Hell yeah.

59:53.500 --> 59:54.340
Hell yeah.

59:54.340 --> 59:55.160
Hell yeah.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.460
As soon as I said fuck, I was like, wait, no.

59:57.460 --> 59:58.300
Wrong.

59:58.300 --> 59:59.140
Yeah.

59:59.140 --> 59:59.980
I'll try again.

59:59.980 --> 01:00:00.820
Hell yeah.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:01.640
Hell yeah.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.480
Hell yeah.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.320
Hell yeah.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.140
Hell yeah.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:04.980
Hell yeah.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.960
Cause my life is great.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.960
And it's all mine.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:24.440
Cause my life is great.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.440
And it's all mine.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:26.940
Fuck.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:46.500
The sun's reflection off the ocean water amplifies the heat and steam rises, crawling up the

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.140
wooden boards of a small ship.

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:57.680
And as the flag unfurls from the top of the highest mast, the fog dissipates and reveals

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:08.440
text that reads North Atlantic ocean, Northeast of the greater Antilles 20th of August, 1694.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.480
And then the credits start to come up on the screen for like, you know, before the movie

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:21.200
actually starts, but the names of everyone are coming up and it says, Luke, Joe Terry,

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:28.080
Thomas Cox, Zach Reeves, and Beth May.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:02:06.800
Teeter totter turtle die.
