0.00 24.16 speaker0  Hello small beans one and all, it's your big bean zaddy, Wolf the Daddy.
17.26 39.52 speaker1  from a serene scheme that beams live from 694.2 PTBP.
38.28 251.42 speaker0  here show? What we could improve upon and that sort of such ain't happenin's? Check out the show notes for a link to our listeners survey, a place for you delicious folk to make your voices heard. If you hate looking at the show notes for some dumb fuckin reason, all the better. You can find a leak on our tweeter, PretendinPod, our Facebook, or on the subreddit r slash PretendinToBePeople. in this Cthulhu forsaken world, join us on the Discord, there's a link, you guessed it, in the show notes. the motherfuckin' truth, y'all. I click every link I see no matter where it's from or who sent it to me, and that's wild because I don't even know how to get on the fuckin' internet, Bill Gates. If you're sick of basic ass juice, there's no excuse for not mixing in equal parts gin, cherry liqueur, and chartreuse. It's time for the news. Last time, Keith and Pastor Adam Kane went through the impassable metal plate, the door at the bottom of Bean's pond, and Daddy passed the fuck out due to impact. Keith shot him in both feets before headin' out down an old mine elevator to a cavernous laboratory. Above ground, Clark didn't throw away his shot, which he missed, but it led Casey Kristoff to have his hand blown off by a shot from the clandestine carbine of Anne Love, codename Karen. And then, there was a very good conversation happenin' between Clark Bishop and Anne Love. They got into a whole thing about the asylum? Woof, I bet there's more of that comin' soon. Down in the underground lab, Keith found the drafts for an old camera, radio, gun, and helmet. He also found the blueprints for a ball, the 25th of which worked. M-A-R-Y, you ain't got no alibi, you ugly. Except for you, dear listener, you are beautiful beyond imagination, and you obviously remember that Keith then attempted to cast a spell of eternal life on himself that caused his nails to pop off like a movie theater concession stand. Mmm, butter. Now, dear listener, what is your favorite thing to put on top of a heated dry corn? Some say butter, some say premarison cheese.
250.42 254.14 speaker2  Where's Leon?
251.42 258.34 speaker1  He's, uh, he's helpin' with somethin' else.
254.14 267.46 speaker2  Yeah, but he was sent for... did you send him somewhere else? Yes.
266.46 281.98 speaker1  I pass. Uh, 35 on a 40. Okay.
277.06 283.98 speaker2  I mean, I know the takeover has been pretty brutal.
282.98 285.86 speaker1  That's kinda what I'm wondering about.
283.98 315.90 speaker2  Well yeah, because Jim had to die, right? Because of the revelations of the Overseer, which he wasn't stoked about, but Maggie was seemingly completely on board with. And when that actually came to fruition, she saw her place and came to claim it. This is all... we gotta get to your, uh... you still live at your parents' house, right? We can't...
314.22 324.54 speaker1  We can't leave Keith down there.
322.02 423.20 speaker2  I don't know, seems like an impassable metal plate. I'd like to try to do that. Okay, three, two... remember? Legs, not back. Three, two... Hey, Councilwoman? You gonna help? Three, two, one. And you guys, you can't get your fingers more than half an inch underneath it. And there's just mud. There's nothing under... what was I saying? I doubt it. I don't know. Maggie? Sure. Hahahaha. So, like, when you couldn't get your parent's book, cause I failed, Kevin here failed, we failed. But when it happened, the only thing that came out of it was that fucking picture, that creepy, creepy picture of the guy, the hood, the light says, you know, he should not... And there was a letter in it, right? Cause letters pop out of that one, it's like, you can't do shit with that book, but sometimes letters pop out? I don't know. But it was called the Revelations of the Overseer, and it was this thing that was just like on of knowledge. Yeah, he was my handler.
422.20 444.64 speaker1  He was our handler. Uh... Cool! Would you happen to know what the meaning behind a tarot card with a devil on it might be? Does that ring a bell for you?
440.12 509.22 speaker2  Seems like we never really made that a focus and therefore just kind of fell off the plot Basically we're not here to try to take down Myriad. That would be, that would take a bit of, you know, intelligence and time. have some sway in political matters. You met Marvin, right?
507.36 511.76 speaker1  And then why did you kill my parents?
510.76 520.40 speaker2  Sorry about that. If we found it I would have felt better about killing your parents, but I bet it's still at your house, so if we could go get that actually, that would be dope.
518.50 532.44 speaker1  You killed them because you couldn't find it?
527.80 548.36 speaker2  me it all means necessary. I mean even though they were his friends, technically, I guess if you want to call that friendship. He had them under the San Ferra Blum situation, so I guess it's not really friendship, but even that couldn't get the information out of them.
547.12 552.20 speaker1  What is that?
549.36 611.32 speaker2  At Calm Comfy Campground! It's the whole thing, with the flowers, and the city, you know, we've been using it in the city for a while, and then Myriad wanted us to go country-wide with it, but then James Maggie's going through with it. in the city basically works for Bar Corp at this point, which is one of our subsidiaries Order, but basically it's just making sure that chaos doesn't happen. as soon as this is over? Hahahaha! Cause if so, then hell yeah.
610.20 613.32 speaker1  Going to sell.
612.32 671.36 speaker2  That seemed like a thing. No it didn't. at patreon.com slash pretending pod, that was all, and love talking. of Knowledge, and with that comes, you know, whatever you want, but more than money it's
666.40 679.24 speaker3  Well, but, I mean, with the San Ferablam and Marriott stuff, aren't you kinda just destroying the world in the name of saving it?
677.16 682.24 speaker1  signing up to stop a monster.
681.24 735.68 speaker2  By creating one? The Gigantombropypicus? Seriously, Kevin, you are absolutely gonna join the Circle of Knowledge after this, which, But I guess we could get the book first, get the book and then go to CCC, cause the book, I mean your town here, no offense, completely fucked probably unless we figure out a way which the book is probably the way that we can solve all this ooze and goo or whatever
734.04 738.68 speaker3  Adam is the man, uh... He's down in that hole. In the hole.
737.68 744.08 speaker2  Oh, the helmet guy?
743.08 767.84 speaker1  Have you seen this door before? Did you say how you found us?
765.78 772.36 speaker3  be a place that I wanna go.
770.38 796.20 speaker2  And she kinda like goes up and elbows you? Seemed like the most exciting thing. Oh, by the way, my name's Anne Love. I don't know if you knew that.
793.96 800.84 speaker3  Same as my daddy and my daddy before. Oh, for real?
799.84 810.04 speaker2  Yeah. Oh damn, that's me. Okay, cool. John. Nice to meet you, John. Thanks, man. Alright, you guys wanna go continue to save the world?
808.04 814.04 speaker3  We gotta kill this cat, though. Provisionally. Oh, we should kill this cat.
813.04 831.64 speaker2  We gotta kill this cat. hopeful that John Lee Pettymore would help him ooze his way into this radio to like,
827.08 853.26 speaker3  I thought he turned on us after my offer of, he threw gun, he threw dirt in my gun. Yeah, he thought you were gonna kill him.
848.16 871.12 speaker2  him on you, more of a, he's still afraid that you're gonna try to kill him kind of thing. But with the conversation that's been happening since then, especially the one where he got worried.
868.12 877.52 speaker3  I think he's more of a use to us alive than dead. Okay, well, you know. I wink at the cat.
875.48 908.88 speaker2  Cool. Hey, Drew. Hey, yeah, no, sorry, um, this is all going way over my head, and I would rather not have this knowledge if it means that, if it's gonna make me feel worse in my head space, then I would rather not have this knowledge. So I would like to go home, I guess.
907.68 913.72 speaker3  I totally understand.
912.72 917.00 speaker1  you home.
914.76 925.32 speaker3  With some of the knowledge that's in your head space?
923.12 933.32 speaker2  long as Miss Karen... Karen, we'll... Yeah, we'll be right with you, Karen.
932.32 956.80 speaker1  Councilwoman? Yes, of course. Big winks. At the side of Adam there? What happened? Were you at the church?
953.56 966.84 speaker2  in a side room until I was brought here. Oh, good.
965.16 983.84 speaker1  Were you, were you attacked, kidnapped? Did you seek them out?
977.00 1006.12 speaker2  a phone conversation, and then I believe it was that old, um, oh, what's his name? That ne'er-do-well. Terrence. Yeah, Terrence Liquor and, uh, the other one, the Rocky Balboa little fella. Fade.
1002.12 1017.76 speaker1  And did they ever mention a plan or a goal with you?
1010.76 1026.88 speaker2  in time to save the world, I guess was their plan, but it never made much sense to me because Thanks, Drew.
1023.20 1039.16 speaker3  Yeah, how much, how, how much progress did they make on that sacrifice and everybody's
1035.56 1065.40 speaker2  were useful, but he, he was mostly keeping everyone alive. I would assume that they're all still at the first church of contention, but then looking around, I guess the first church of contention is unguarded currently. That's what they were calling the pools where they could hide from this, they kept calling it residue.
1064.40 1067.40 speaker3  Oh, from the goo.
1066.40 1095.28 speaker2  Well, you were there.
1088.12 1099.48 speaker1  He did like Porky Pig and, uh, he could do his other characters doing his other characters.
1095.28 1102.48 speaker3  So he could do like Elmer Fudd doing Porky Pig or whatever. Yeah.
1100.48 1137.12 speaker1  What would that sound like? I can't do either. Normally. I turned to John. My one idea now is we could send Drew back to his body with the radio and the four wheeler and we give him something to do, maybe put him back in his own body and we could go with Anne here.
1132.52 1151.40 speaker2  If you could direct me in the right direction, then I could get back into my own body and not be, and Drew kind of looks down and it's like in Gary Page's body.
1150.04 1166.46 speaker1  Who's all down there? Mildred Mitchell's down there. And then your body is down there.
1165.00 1173.38 speaker2  If you'll excuse me, Kitty.
1172.38 1187.72 speaker1  does revolver. You got protection.
1181.86 1206.32 speaker2  And Kerry gets really emotional, looks at John Lee Pettymore the third and says, your that he's done for me.
1204.80 1225.48 speaker3  bubble gum tree. More or less, yeah.
1223.98 1243.48 speaker2  So we're all really indifferent. I mean, Clark, you're still Clark. Yeah.
1238.92 1258.04 speaker3  Some folks have trouble keeping up with it, yeah, but not us.
1251.80 1301.58 speaker2  Then he turns, she turns, he turns to and love. Oh, yep. Okay, sure. Uh, I'll just take this four wheeler then. If you guys want to direct me in the appropriate direction to hit the sewers and kitty, are you going with them or are you coming with me?
1298.62 1307.98 speaker1  If you, if you can get to clinkers, you can, you can find them down there.
1301.58 1323.62 speaker2  You look to where clinkers would be because it's just like a block past this water wall. What do you guys want to do?
1321.90 1329.44 speaker1  Keith is still just down there. I assume he's going to come back up at some point.
1328.44 1332.96 speaker2  Go get rained away.
1330.44 1335.28 speaker3  Hey, I'll probably figure it out, but if you want to leave something in the mud, that's
1333.96 1350.96 speaker1  I'm going to pat down my uniform. Do I maybe have a notepad on me?
1346.82 1358.16 speaker3  We need to get in this fucking hole and gives you a salute.
1357.16 1408.40 speaker2  We should have gone with him. Okay. When we started this entire campaign, my total, my absolute hope was that Drew Andrews and the body of Kerry pages would be driving the four wheeler that was brought here 25 years ago out of a dry beans pond with agent Trent, Chad, a city asylum employee in the body of
1407.40 1426.44 speaker3  It was obvious. You wanted us to get to hear it, man.
1425.44 1457.08 speaker2  This has been fun. All right. It's not over yet. Not even by a little bit. So let's keep going. The four wheeler drives up and out and, and love looks at you and is like, why wouldn't you want to go with me? We need to go to Bishop's. We need to get the book.
1454.80 1507.32 speaker1  give me, give me one, one second. And I want to pull John away a little bit. John, um, do you remember that whole business at the, at the college in our, in our last lives? and at the last minute had a change of heart and decided that we should investigate the college stuff, which I think we found out after the fact, it seemed kind of like a personal thing for him, but his actual mission was to get me to the common comfy campground. So it seems like the circle wants us there at least. Yeah. I don't, I didn't like all that new new world order business, but the, the creature is real. The creature I saw and it could, it could end at all.
1506.32 1528.72 speaker3  Yeah. I just want to focus on one thing.
1525.88 1538.80 speaker1  call myself on her side. But at this point she's saying some of the right things that she doesn't necessarily care about Maggie, which we've had her doubts about Maggie. She knows a lot about what's going on.
1537.80 1568.00 speaker3  Clearly. She's not like got good intentions. How about, how about this?
1565.88 1577.46 speaker1  our backs, me especially. So let's just have that in our back pocket. The first time things get hanky, we can pop her. No questions asked.
1574.08 1585.28 speaker3  I think you're taking, I think you're trying to take us to comp company campground right now is the definition of hanky. Seems hanky to me.
1583.52 1601.96 speaker1  I mean, yeah.
1600.96 1608.40 speaker3  I don't trust her. I don't think we should go. I don't like it. I think we got to help Keith.
1607.40 1625.12 speaker1  Fuck. They opened the door somehow. That's what I thought. I'm kind of wondering now if it opened because Keith was near it, it has his name on it.
1624.12 1628.40 speaker3  That's not a bad thought. Oh, you know what it was?
1627.12 1631.04 speaker1  He had the watch on.
1628.40 1665.04 speaker3  That savior and son of a bitch. Well.
1655.52 1681.96 speaker2  ground on mass, erupting both away from and into Bean's pond where the three of you are currently chit chatting. Ann Love rolled a four.
1680.96 1699.00 speaker1  I pass. So I have the baseline 20 and I rolled a 10. I have the baseline 20 and I rolled a 54.
1691.72 1728.28 speaker2  And from all sides simultaneously, this mushroom shaped lack of pond is filling back up and becoming a pond. And as you're trying to run, we got muddy feet and it's filling all the way to the top as you swim. You uh, you can stay afloat the entire time where you're only, you don't take in much water as you're making your way up out of there. John, you actually have some issues as John Lee Pettymore the third is trying to swim out. You feel. You're kind of roboty. That's perfect.
1727.28 1737.56 speaker1  Yeah.
1732.56 1814.52 speaker2  further down into the murky fish frenzy that is beans pond. Oh, and you feel the intense buzzing inside your skull that you felt when you dunked your head into the truck bed puddle and the static is growing and growing, but suddenly you're moving upward toward the surface at a rapid clip. feet. And she is standing on the pond and you are standing on the pond. She puts her hand on your shoulder and as you catch your breath, she walks you off of this teeming overflowing pond and onto the bank next to Clark Bishop, still ankle deep
1813.04 1820.08 speaker1  What up dude?
1819.08 1823.08 speaker3  What are we? I just typed in borf.
1822.08 1859.52 speaker2  Okay. You didn't know what you were doing when you typed in borf. Oh, that is a, um, there's a furry. I like this one better. Oh boy.
1858.36 1862.00 speaker3  He's a little alien.
1859.52 1865.72 speaker2  It looks like a flubber became a person.
1864.72 1866.72 speaker3  Ew.
1865.72 1871.04 speaker2  Yeah. Oh, can you imagine if Robin Williams had been in Ghostbusters?
1870.04 1874.32 speaker3  I can't imagine.
1871.04 1877.28 speaker2  It would go a little something like this.
1876.28 1882.28 speaker3  Gotta get the ghost.
1881.28 1894.40 speaker2  We gotta call. We gotta call.
1893.40 1897.52 speaker3  Okay.
1894.40 1900.54 speaker2  Look, do you remember where we were last time?
1897.52 1905.54 speaker3  That is a baby with a handlebar mustache. It's a very good look.
1904.08 1914.08 speaker2  Who can share? Only host. There it is.
1912.40 1930.76 speaker3  What a shame.
1921.18 2074.46 speaker2  Last time you went down an elevator shaft, an old mining elevator down and then opened up a sealed blast door like from a bunker, entered a large cavernous room. Your ears popped. You did the yawn. So you went down here, you found papers that were blueprints for the four items that we've come to know as the items that were in the trunk that Jon Peters brought to his home from the green box over at, I want to say, A Plus Storage was the name, and those four items were the gun, the helmet, the radio, and the camera. And you found scientific math that did not quite add up to come up with the engineering to make those items possible. You also found some notes about different spells this person was trying out in an attempt at eternal life, and then you finally found twenty-five attempts at making a manipulating activator colon robot, A through Y, with the final one being codename Mary saw the picture of a small metal sphere that was one inch in diameter, and at the bottom it said host found. You tried out one of these spells for the eternal life situation, you gave it a go, and when you said the words enough times, or maybe the right way, or maybe with the correct pronunciation, your bones began to vibrate, and then you felt all of your toenails and fingernails popping like popcorn off of your body, and at that exact moment, you heard the blast door that was on the far side of this room, something rammed itself. Probably something spooky. Might be a dragon.
2072.86 2117.90 speaker3  Because it doesn't have nails. No nails required. Yes. If I touch them on the ground, are they still like nails? They're brittle. I put all of them in my pocket.
2116.58 2127.06 speaker2  Yeah, they have layers. So as they kind of splinter apart as you're touching them, they're like extremely weak nails.
2126.06 2138.26 speaker3  Okay. I've got ten of those in my pocket.
2137.26 2150.46 speaker2  What was your foot situation? So no socks. And they stink. They stink.
2147.26 2165.90 speaker3  Also, remember, I fell into- no, no, no! I took my shoes off.
2164.90 2174.70 speaker2  but you see these shards. I'm going to put my toenails in my pockets too. In that left pocket. In only the left pocket.
2173.34 2181.42 speaker3  Left cargo pocket. Like in the button up one.
2180.42 2194.18 speaker2  hand into a bowl? Like spaghetti and grapes. Yeah, imagine what it would be like to put your hand into just 200 shards of brittle nail. No, thank you.
2192.46 2211.58 speaker3  I almost just threw up saying that. Okay, so now that I've got that done, I'm going to clean up.
2208.46 2222.10 speaker2  God, it's an emptiness? It's for sure emptiness, but it feels infinite in its helpfulness.
2221.10 2229.62 speaker3  Yes, very much so.
2227.76 2340.46 speaker2  As you're peering through this circular... Circle window. Like a porthole? And a sub-mer... Yes, thank you. So you're looking through this essentially porthole on this blast door. The lights in this cavernous room shine down at just the perfect angle to illuminate a small circle of the floor of whatever room is behind this blast door, which is otherwise drenched in perfect darkness. the glass. Staring at you with wild eyes is the skeletal, pallid face of a teenage girl. Her skin is thin and decaying. Small tears have opened up sores on her cheekbones, nose, and chin, where bone is peeking out under infected lesions. Her scalp looks the same, where it isn't covered by patches of this thin, brittle hair. But still, enough of her is there to recognize Tildi B. Mitchell.
2338.46 2359.98 speaker3  Roll Sanity. 7.
2355.74 2395.30 speaker2  next to you begins to kind of pshhh. And this square in the concrete kind of opens up. It's weird, you get the innate feeling that your watch was close enough to the ground in this exact spot. And as this panel lifts up out of the ground, it seems like you can remove a square of the concrete in the ground a foot down. There is a revolver, an old timey revolver, with weird, odd metal all over it, and these glass tubes, and it's got a green light that's lit.
2394.18 2396.30 speaker3  Is there anything else in that hole?
2395.30 2403.94 speaker2  No there is not.
2396.30 2418.90 speaker3  Okay, I'm gonna put it down on the ground very carefully, as to not break any tubes. And I want to, in this whole room, I'm gonna just walk around with my watch, like an inch
2415.90 2431.58 speaker2  Go ahead and roll. Roll on natural. What do I have in there? 50. Now he's showing me, he's showing me what he rolled on the camera. He rolled a 50 on a 50. Hell yeah. You motherfucker.
2430.58 2438.46 speaker3  Okay, absolutely.
2433.50 2456.26 speaker2  When you go, and you're like, basically, you're that dude on the beach. Gotta find some quarters. You know? Yeah. 2019. Yep.
2454.14 2478.06 speaker3  2020 would be a real find. I don't think they exist. Well, that's why it would be so rare.
2470.26 2498.98 speaker2  looking down into this spot, you see a single metal sphere, about one inch in diameter. Cole.
2495.62 2508.06 speaker3  What were the words on that piece of paper that was her face wrapped? Roll intelligence. I think one, a couple episodes ago, I remembered it, but I'll roll again.
2505.22 2520.14 speaker2  Yeah, if you don't remember, then you have to roll.
2519.14 2531.78 speaker3  Yeah, it's fun. It is fun. Show me what you got. I look at the photo and I'm like, hmm, oh yeah, those words, I remember exactly what they are there.
2529.10 2549.46 speaker2  Because you wrote them, you pulled out a Sharpie and you wrote them on the back of the picture.
2548.46 2583.74 speaker3  Any different? Nope. Keith thinks up for a second, he's like, well, we've already chanted something weird today,
2579.16 2613.10 speaker2  This spell had basically a mechanic where I didn't know that you were going to go bat And I made this spell where all four of us had a twenty-five percent chance of being the one who got to come up with what the spell does. But since it's only me and you here, I just have you roll basically a fifty-fifty shot to decide who gets to choose what the spell does. And I get to choose. It can only be three words.
2610.82 2644.30 speaker3  What the spell does can only be three words. Yeah. Don't say penis falls off, oops. I prayed for that one before I lost my fingernails. There's lots of combinations of three words you could make. Okay. I'm nervous.
2636.54 2797.50 speaker2  As you begin to chant, you feel your bones once again begin to vibrate, but Keith Beans is more than bone. You can feel it inside you throbbing with pain right before your skin begins splitting open. It starts at your index finger and your body slowly begins to unzip the rip peeling apart and the seam shooting up your forearm past your elbow, continuing toward your shoulder as the metal inside this arm begins falling out and clanking on the concrete floor below. The opening of your body does not cease, however, and your skin continues to burst open, unzipping itself up your neck, and it finally halts its progress at the tear duct of the eye. The glass scientists had to surgically set back into its socket. The pain is searing and unbearable. Your metal septum shifts to one side and slides out of your nostril.
