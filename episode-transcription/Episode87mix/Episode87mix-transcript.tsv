9860	17260	And I am here to meme and scream till I deem this a proper scene that seems to lean mean
17260	24160	from a serene scheme that beams live from 694.2 PTBP.

97640	102760	because I don't even know how to get on the fuckin' internet, Bill Gates.
102760	109460	If you're sick of basic ass juice, there's no excuse for not mixing in equal parts gin,
109460	112500	cherry liqueur, and chartreuse.
112500	115060	It's time for the news.
115060	120420	Last time, Keith and Pastor Adam Kane went through the impassable metal plate, the door
120420	125700	at the bottom of Bean's pond, and Daddy passed the fuck out due to impact.
125700	132700	Keith shot him in both feets before headin' out down an old mine elevator to a cavernous
132700	133700	laboratory.
133700	139700	Above ground, Clark didn't throw away his shot, which he missed, but it led Casey Kristoff
139700	146160	to have his hand blown off by a shot from the clandestine carbine of Anne Love, codename
146160	147160	Karen.
147160	153040	And then, there was a very good conversation happenin' between Clark Bishop and Anne Love.
153040	155480	They got into a whole thing about the asylum?
155480	159440	Woof, I bet there's more of that comin' soon.
159440	166160	Down in the underground lab, Keith found the drafts for an old camera, radio, gun, and
166160	167160	helmet.
167160	172360	He also found the blueprints for a ball, the 25th of which worked.
172360	178540	M-A-R-Y, you ain't got no alibi, you ugly.
178540	184820	Except for you, dear listener, you are beautiful beyond imagination, and you obviously remember
184820	190800	that Keith then attempted to cast a spell of eternal life on himself that caused his
190800	195140	nails to pop off like a movie theater concession stand.
195140	196700	Mmm, butter.
196700	203900	Now, dear listener, what is your favorite thing to put on top of a heated dry corn?
203900	208220	Some say butter, some say premarison cheese.
208220	212020	I say it's kudzu with no backbone.
238220	244740	Anne Love, code name Karen, looks right at Clark Bishop and says,
244740	250420	W-wait a second, so...
250420	251420	Where's Leon?
251420	254140	He's, uh, he's helpin' with somethin' else.
254140	258340	Yeah, but he was sent for... did you send him somewhere else?
258340	259700	Yes.
259700	266460	Roll Persuade.
266460	267460	I pass.
267460	269340	Uh, 35 on a 40.
269340	270340	Okay.
270340	271900	Well, we better get going.
271900	277060	Wait, Anne, I gotta... what do you know about Maggie?
277060	281980	I mean, I know the takeover has been pretty brutal.
281980	282980	The takeover?
282980	283980	That's kinda what I'm wondering about.
283980	285860	Well yeah, because Jim had to die, right?
285860	292260	Because of the revelations of the Overseer, which he wasn't stoked about, but Maggie was
292260	295020	seemingly completely on board with.
295020	299820	And when that actually came to fruition, she saw her place and came to claim it.
299820	301200	Why did Jim have to die?
301200	303220	Because of the revelation of the Overseer?
303220	306100	I read a bit of that, and I don't remember seeing...
306100	307620	Okay, walk and talk, walk and talk.
307620	312220	This is all... we gotta get to your, uh... you still live at your parents' house, right?
312220	313220	We can't...
313220	314220	Keith's down in the hole.
314220	315900	We can't leave Keith down there.
315900	317120	Oh, right.
317120	319100	Can you help us get our buddy out of this hole?
319100	321820	She looks down at it, and she kinda, like, steps on it.
322020	324540	I don't know, seems like an impassable metal plate.
324540	325540	Hahahaha.
325540	329180	I don't... we haven't even, like, tried to pick it up or anything.
329180	330660	I'd like to try to do that.
330660	332540	Okay, three, two... remember?
332540	333660	Legs, not back.
333660	334660	Three, two...
334660	335660	Hey, Councilwoman?
335660	336660	You gonna help?
336660	337660	Three, two, one.
337660	342460	And you guys, you can't get your fingers more than half an inch underneath it.
342460	343960	And there's just mud.
343960	346460	It's seemingly just this metal plate.
346460	349460	There's nothing under... what was I saying?
349460	350460	I doubt it.
350460	351460	I don't know.
352100	353100	Maggie?
353100	354100	Sure.
354100	355100	Hahahaha.
355100	359580	Oh, right, the Revelation of the Overseer.
359580	365380	So, like, when you couldn't get your parent's book, cause I failed, Kevin here failed, we
365380	366380	failed.
366380	369660	Also, you know, sorry about all that.
369660	372960	But we couldn't get the book, so he tried to create his own, right?
372960	377580	But when it happened, the only thing that came out of it was that fucking picture, that
377580	383980	creepy, creepy picture of the guy, the hood, the light says, you know, he should not...
383980	386220	It's only through death that he shall rise again.
386220	390540	Oh, such an excellent member of the circle of knowledge you've already become.
390540	392900	And there was a letter in it, right?
392900	396360	Cause letters pop out of that one, it's like, you can't do shit with that book, but sometimes
396360	397360	letters pop out?
397360	398360	I don't know.
398360	402480	But it was called the Revelations of the Overseer, and it was this thing that was just like on
402480	407820	and on about how Jim had to die in order for the world to be safe and blah, blah, blah.
407820	410360	So anyway, Jim obviously didn't like that a whole lot, but...
410360	413160	You were friends with Jim, right?
413160	415680	Friends is an interesting term.
415680	420200	Well, you said he kind of recruited you, like, you guys had a relationship before the circle
420200	421200	of knowledge.
421200	422200	Yeah, he was my handler.
422200	423200	He was our handler.
423200	424200	Uh...
424200	425200	Cool!
425200	433040	Would you happen to know what the meaning behind a tarot card with a devil on it might
433040	434040	be?
434040	435040	Does that ring a bell for you?
435040	440120	I mean, Satan, but that seems more big picture and not really what we're doing here.
440120	444640	Seems like we never really made that a focus and therefore just kind of fell off the plot
444640	447720	line structure of this whole thing.
447720	448720	Satan?
448720	449720	Yeah.
449720	454800	Jack was Satan, you're a big bad.
454800	457160	Well I think it was more of like a code name.
457160	460720	Basically we're not here to try to take down Myriad.
460720	466760	That would be, that would take a bit of, you know, intelligence and time.
466760	470360	So you know about Myriad, you know those creatures.
470360	475080	Jim told us what he wanted to about Myriad, yeah.
475080	476160	What was that?
476160	479720	We really need to get going if we're going to make it to CCC.
479720	484040	Circle of knowledge to a circle of knowledge member, what is Myriad to us?
484040	491880	To you I don't know, but Myriad is the group that runs the government, is that a good
491880	492880	way of saying it?
492880	493880	Yeah, it checks out.
493880	498400	Basically we made a deal with them to use their technology if they could, you know,
498400	501160	have some sway in political matters.
501160	502160	You met Marvin, right?
502160	507360	He was a rebel, I guess with a cause, if that cause is just attaining power.
507360	509220	And then why did you kill my parents?
509220	510760	To get the book that we never found.
510760	511760	Sorry about that.
511760	515000	If we found it I would have felt better about killing your parents, but I bet it's still
515000	518500	at your house, so if we could go get that actually, that would be dope.
518500	520400	You killed them because you couldn't find it?
520400	527800	I was sent there to kill, yes, Jim essentially hired us to go get the book, but he, he told
527800	532440	me it all means necessary.
532440	536680	I mean even though they were his friends, technically, I guess if you want to call that
536680	537680	friendship.
537680	542000	He had them under the San Ferra Blum situation, so I guess it's not really friendship, but
542000	544680	even that couldn't get the information out of them.
544680	547120	San Ferra Blum, we've heard that mentioned.
547120	548360	What is that?
548360	549360	It's the project!
549360	552200	At Calm Comfy Campground!
552200	558640	It's the whole thing, with the flowers, and the city, you know, we've been using it in
558640	564520	the city for a while, and then Myriad wanted us to go country-wide with it, but then James
564520	571760	for some reason freaked out about that plan and fucked everything up for, not for long,
571760	573280	Maggie's going through with it.
573280	575320	But what does San Ferra Blum do?
575320	580240	Pacifies the mind, essentially, so it makes people more malleable, right, so like everyone
580240	584600	in the city basically works for Bar Corp at this point, which is one of our subsidiaries
584600	591400	that we own, so basically the idea is that it's like, people are calling it New World
591400	594680	Order, but basically it's just making sure that chaos doesn't happen.
594680	598840	Could this New World Order protect a man of means such as myself?
598840	603040	Kevin, are you talking about the money from all the cocaine we're probably gonna sell
603040	605000	as soon as this is over?
605000	606000	Hahahaha!
606000	609200	Cause if so, then hell yeah.
609200	610200	Yes.
610200	611320	Going to sell.
611320	612320	What did that mean?
612320	613320	That seemed like a thing.
613320	614320	No it didn't.
614320	622040	Hahahaha!
622040	631140	You know, this is an audio medium and I can't convey my inner intentions with a glance or...
631140	637480	You can join the Den of Sin for $15 to get those glances on our Patreon content over
637480	641320	at patreon.com slash pretending pod, that was all, and love talking.
642320	649640	Uh, yeah, no we're definitely gonna be of means, but Kevin, you are primed to join Circle
649640	654840	of Knowledge, and with that comes, you know, whatever you want, but more than money it's
654840	662080	a sense of pride of saving the world from total destruction, but also on top of that
662080	666360	you get literally anything you want cause money doesn't really matter anymore for us.
666400	671360	Well, but, I mean, with the San Ferablam and Marriott stuff, aren't you kinda just destroying
671360	673240	the world in the name of saving it?
673240	677160	I had some qualms with that too, Maggie didn't mention this New World Order stuff, I was
677160	679240	signing up to stop a monster.
679240	681240	Yeah, well that's how we're doing it.
681240	682240	By creating one?
682240	686120	Well, I don't, I wouldn't say that we're creating a monster necessarily as...
686120	689360	You know, Maggie showed me that creature, have you seen it?
689360	692040	The Gigantombropypicus?
692040	693880	I didn't, she didn't tell me its name.
693880	695920	Oh yeah, that shit is mad fucked.
695920	696920	I'm sorry, what?
696920	697920	Gigantombropypicus?
697920	701080	Yeah, sorry, I'm not in your club, what's...
701080	705920	Seriously, Kevin, you are absolutely gonna join the Circle of Knowledge after this, which,
705920	714040	if we could get to the CCC, that was the original, the original game plan.
714040	718720	But I guess we could get the book first, get the book and then go to CCC, cause the book,
718720	723000	I mean your town here, no offense, completely fucked probably unless we figure out a way
723000	726960	which the book is probably the way that we can solve all this ooze and goo or whatever
726960	727960	you're talking about.
727960	733040	Did you know that Adam thought that he could somehow change all this?
733040	734040	Who's Adam?
734040	735680	Adam is the man, uh...
735680	736680	He's down in that hole.
736680	737680	In the hole.
737680	738680	Oh, the helmet guy?
738680	739680	Yeah.
739680	740680	No, I don't know who that is.
740680	743080	Do you know what he thought was down there?
743080	744080	Have you seen this door before?
744080	747320	Do you know anything about what's going on here at Bean's Pond?
747320	748320	No.
748320	749320	Did you say how you found us?
749320	756000	Well yeah, I came to town to break into your house, and then I saw this big floating wall
756000	765780	of water that was filled with fish, and I thought to myself, you know what, that might
765780	767840	be a place that I wanna go.
767840	770380	And then it turns out my old partner's fucking here.
770380	772360	And she kinda like goes up and elbows you?
772360	776120	When we got to town, we were saving the fish wall thingy for last.
777120	779640	Oh, well we did opposites, I suppose.
779640	781520	Seemed like the most exciting thing.
781520	787000	Maybe we should just go for the big fish wall next time.
787000	788160	That's what Anne Love would do.
788160	790040	Oh, by the way, my name's Anne Love.
790040	791720	I don't know if you knew that.
791720	793960	Hi, my name's John Lee Pettymore.
793960	796200	Same as my daddy and my daddy before.
796200	797840	Oh, for real?
797840	799840	That's like, that's your actual name?
799840	800840	Yeah.
800840	802160	Oh damn, that's me.
802160	803160	Okay, cool.
803160	804160	John.
804160	805160	Nice to meet you, John.
805200	806200	Thanks, man.
806200	808040	Alright, you guys wanna go continue to save the world?
808040	810040	We gotta kill this cat, though.
810040	811040	Provisionally.
811040	812040	Oh, we should kill this cat.
812040	813040	I don't care.
813040	814040	We gotta kill this cat.
814040	819920	At that point, Agent Shrink Cat, who's on top of the radio, has turned from being extremely
819920	826080	hopeful that John Lee Pettymore would help him ooze his way into this radio to like,
826080	827080	wait, what?
827080	831640	I thought he turned on us after my offer of, he threw gun, he threw dirt in my gun.
831640	833840	Yeah, he thought you were gonna kill him.
833840	838520	He recently, though, has been pointing at, he was pointing at the on-off switch on the
838520	839520	thing?
839520	843160	Yeah, he was pointing at the broken tube of the radio, and then he was pointing at John.
843160	848160	He was mostly just afraid when you failed the role, it was less of a, like, turning
848160	853260	him on you, more of a, he's still afraid that you're gonna try to kill him kind of thing.
853260	857160	But with the conversation that's been happening since then, especially the one where he got
857160	866120	outed as, uh, a member of a, uh, posing force, if you will, of the unnatural, he's gotten
866120	867120	worried.
867120	868120	Hold on, Ann.
868120	871120	I think he's more of a use to us alive than dead.
871120	872360	Okay, well, you know.
872360	873360	I wink at the cat.
873360	875480	The cat winks back.
875480	877520	Cool.
877520	885160	And Carrie Pages is, like, sitting in the mud, just kind of, like, drawing in it.
885160	886160	Hey, Drew.
886160	893440	Hey, yeah, no, sorry, um, this is all going way over my head, and I would rather not have
893440	899460	this knowledge if it means that, if it's gonna make me feel worse in my head space, then
899460	902000	I would rather not have this knowledge.
902000	906160	So I would like to go home, I guess.
906160	907680	Drew, I understand.
907680	908880	I totally understand.
908880	912720	Drew, I was, I was hoping I could ask you a couple questions before you, before we got
912720	913720	you home.
913720	914720	Is that okay?
914760	917000	With some of the knowledge that's in your head space?
917000	923120	Yes, no, of course, um, I am willing to answer any questions from you guys, obviously, as
923120	925320	long as Miss Karen...
925320	926320	Karen, we'll...
926320	927500	Yeah, we'll be right with you, Karen.
927500	932320	We'll head your way after we finish talking to Miss Pages here.
932320	933320	Councilwoman?
933320	934320	Yes, of course.
934320	937480	Can you tell me what you learned from your time at, uh...
937480	938480	Big winks.
938480	939480	Yeah.
939480	942600	At the side of Adam there?
942600	943600	What happened?
943600	944600	Were you at the church?
944600	947160	Well, he points to the radio.
947160	953560	They used that to switch our bodies, of course, and then I was blindfolded and held in a,
953560	956800	in a side room until I was brought here.
956800	958520	Oh, good.
958520	965160	How did the, how'd they get ahold of you in the, in the first place?
965160	966840	Were you, were you attacked, kidnapped?
966840	968080	Did you seek them out?
968080	969080	What happened here?
969080	970080	Oh yeah, no, right.
970080	977000	So, I was out and about, and I was getting a cat carrier for you all, and then we had
977000	983840	a phone conversation, and then I believe it was that old, um, oh, what's his name?
983840	984840	That ne'er-do-well.
984840	985840	Terrence.
985840	991880	Yeah, Terrence Liquor and, uh, the other one, the Rocky Balboa little fella.
991880	992880	Fade.
992880	993880	Oh yeah, Fade.
993880	998880	Uh, Fade, can't pronounce his last name, was, uh, they, they came and they, they grabbed
998880	1002120	me and they, they brought me to the church.
1002120	1006120	And did they ever mention a plan or a goal with you?
1006120	1010760	Well, yeah, they were going to sacrifice everyone's bodies in order to get the pastor to go back
1010760	1017760	in time to save the world, I guess was their plan, but it never made much sense to me because
1017760	1020200	I had all the faith in the world and the three of you.
1020200	1021200	Aw.
1021200	1022200	Thanks, Drew.
1022200	1023200	We're still working.
1023200	1026880	Yeah, how much, how, how much progress did they make on that sacrifice and everybody's
1026880	1027880	body's part?
1027880	1035560	Well, no, it was supposed to be an all-at-once deal, so, I mean, yeah, I mean, bodies were,
1035560	1039160	were useful, but he, he was mostly keeping everyone alive.
1039160	1045960	I would assume that they're all still at the first church of contention, but then looking
1045960	1052220	around, I guess the first church of contention is unguarded currently.
1052220	1055160	It does seem like the water's here and not there.
1055160	1058080	I mean, there might be enough puddles there for everyone.
1058080	1062260	That's what they were calling the pools where they could hide from this, they kept calling
1062260	1063400	it residue.
1063400	1064400	We call it goo.
1064400	1065400	Oh, from the goo.
1065400	1066400	I like that much better.
1066400	1067400	Well, you were there.
1067400	1068400	You're Drew.
1068400	1074920	Yes, I am and I've always liked that much better.
1074920	1079040	It's hard to do one voice when you're trying to be in the mind of another.
1079040	1083440	I can only imagine.
1083440	1088120	Del Blanc, they always talk about a sign that he was such a great voice actor.
1088120	1095280	He did like Porky Pig and, uh, he could do his other characters doing his other characters.
1095280	1099480	So he could do like Elmer Fudd doing Porky Pig or whatever.
1099480	1100480	Yeah.
1100480	1102480	What would that sound like?
1102480	1103480	I can't do either.
1103480	1104480	Normally.
1104480	1110600	Why, get that wasque, wasque, wasque, wasque rabbit.
1110600	1111600	Nailed it.
1111600	1112600	Yeah.
1112600	1114200	I turned to John.
1114200	1120480	My one idea now is we could send Drew back to his body with the radio and the four wheeler
1120480	1126680	and we give him something to do, maybe put him back in his own body and we could go with
1126680	1127680	Anne here.
1127680	1132520	I was only eavesdropping a little bit, but that sounds fantastic to me.
1132520	1137120	If you could direct me in the right direction, then I could get back into my own body and
1137120	1145480	not be, and Drew kind of looks down and it's like in Gary Page's body.
1145480	1147720	Do we trust the sewer people with the radio?
1147720	1150040	I trust Gary and Harry for sure.
1150040	1151400	Who's all down there?
1151400	1153520	Mildred Mitchell's down there.
1153520	1155720	And then your body is down there.
1155720	1157320	Last we left it, it was unconscious.
1157320	1158320	Is it hurt?
1158320	1161040	It took a couple of spills, but nothing you can't handle, Drew.
1161040	1162040	Yeah.
1162040	1163440	Okay, well let's get going.
1163440	1165000	That sounds like a great idea to me.
1165000	1166460	If you'll excuse me, Kitty.
1166460	1172380	Back at Ang's house during that firefight out on the lawn, I picked up another snub
1172380	1173380	does revolver.
1173380	1179540	I'm going to hand that to Kerry, just in case it comes in handy.
1179540	1180860	You got protection.
1180860	1181860	Okay.
1181860	1187720	And Kerry gets really emotional, looks at John Lee Pettymore the third and says, your
1187720	1197240	son taught me how to shoot one of these and I will never forget him for that and everything
1197240	1198800	that he's done for me.
1198800	1204800	Big grin comes across my face and I put both hands on his shoulders and I said, no, Drew,
1204800	1206320	bubble gum tree.
1206320	1213320	And Kerry Page's eyes light up and Drew just like throws his arms around you.
1213320	1215760	Hey little buddy.
1215760	1218760	John, is this really you?
1218760	1219760	More or less, yeah.
1219760	1220760	Oh my God.
1220760	1223980	This whole time I thought that it was, Oh my God.
1223980	1225480	So we're all really indifferent.
1225480	1227360	I mean, Clark, you're still Clark.
1227360	1228360	Yeah.
1228360	1232820	I mean, except for Clark and well, Keith is kind of MIA down the bottom of the pond,
1232820	1235120	but otherwise it's just all a big switcheroo.
1235120	1236460	Oh boy.
1236460	1238920	This must be really confusing for everyone.
1238920	1243480	Some folks have trouble keeping up with it, yeah, but not us.
1243480	1251800	Well, John, I don't know how to repay you for, thank you.
1251800	1258040	Then he turns, she turns, he turns to and love.
1258040	1263480	And thank you, you, I think saved my life and puts out a hand.
1263480	1266920	Maybe, maybe don't, maybe don't, maybe don't put out a hand.
1266920	1267920	Oh, yep.
1267920	1268920	Okay, sure.
1268920	1271220	Uh, I'll just take this four wheeler then.
1271220	1277380	If you guys want to direct me in the appropriate direction to hit the sewers and kitty, are
1277380	1279620	you going with them or are you coming with me?
1279620	1282660	And the cat is like pointing at the radio.
1282660	1290140	I still think, I still think that we should kill it.
1290140	1294060	Noted.
1294060	1298620	This page is Harry put up a sign at clinkers showing you where to go.
1298620	1301580	If you, if you can get to clinkers, you can, you can find them down there.
1301580	1307980	You look to where clinkers would be because it's just like a block past this water wall.
1307980	1315380	Anyway, here's water wall.
1315380	1316380	Throwing it back to you.
1316380	1318380	What do you guys want to do?
1318380	1321900	John, do you think we should, uh, like leave a note or something?
1321900	1323620	Keith is still just down there.
1323620	1325840	I assume he's going to come back up at some point.
1325840	1328440	You could probably write it in the mud.
1328440	1329440	Go get rained away.
1329440	1330440	I don't know.
1330440	1332960	Hey, I'll probably figure it out, but if you want to leave something in the mud, that's
1332960	1333960	fine with me.
1333960	1335280	I'm going to pat down my uniform.
1335280	1337520	Do I maybe have a notepad on me?
1337520	1341600	As you guys are doing this, Drew is getting on the four wheeler.
1341600	1346820	Wait, are we really going to go with and love the calm, comfy campground?
1346820	1350960	We need to get in this fucking hole and gives you a salute.
1350960	1357160	And then with the cat on the back, I feel like they drive up out of beans pond.
1357160	1358160	We should have gone with him.
1358160	1359160	Okay.
1359160	1368040	When we started this entire campaign, my total, my absolute hope was that Drew Andrews and
1368040	1374520	the body of Kerry pages would be driving the four wheeler that was brought here 25 years
1374520	1382840	ago out of a dry beans pond with agent Trent, Chad, a city asylum employee in the body of
1382840	1392480	Dr. Marie Andrews is cat Salem out and then toward clinkers to find a hidden message in
1392480	1400120	the signs to find out where they are in the sewers and love is like, Hey, is that my four
1400120	1401120	wheeler?
1401120	1403600	I felt like this has been pretty railroaded the whole time.
1403600	1407400	You're right.
1407400	1408400	It was obvious.
1408400	1410360	You wanted us to get to hear it, man.
1410360	1418320	We've been, I remember when you guys went to the city, I was like, Oh fuck.
1418320	1424440	They don't understand my vision at all.
1424440	1425440	God damn it.
1425440	1426440	This has been fun.
1426440	1427440	All right.
1427440	1428440	It's not over yet.
1428440	1429440	Not even by a little bit.
1429440	1430880	So let's keep going.
1430880	1435560	The four wheeler drives up and out and, and love looks at you and is like, why wouldn't
1435560	1436840	you want to go with me?
1436840	1437840	We need to go to Bishop's.
1437840	1439240	We need to get the book.
1439240	1444540	If you finally tell us where it is, then we could have it in the circle of knowledge.
1444540	1447320	We can do whatever we want.
1447320	1450200	Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Maggie.
1450200	1454800	If you guys want to take over the three of us could take over and, and could you just
1454800	1457080	give me, give me one, one second.
1457080	1458960	And I want to pull John away a little bit.
1459040	1464360	John, um, do you remember that whole business at the, at the college in our, in our last
1464360	1465360	lives?
1465360	1466360	Yeah.
1466360	1471600	Right before all that happened, Leon wanted to take me to the common comfy campground
1471600	1476320	and at the last minute had a change of heart and decided that we should investigate the
1476320	1480660	college stuff, which I think we found out after the fact, it seemed kind of like a personal
1480660	1486720	thing for him, but his actual mission was to get me to the common comfy campground.
1486720	1489760	So it seems like the circle wants us there at least.
1489760	1490760	Yeah.
1490760	1496800	But we learned a lot about the circle just now that kind of makes it seem a little unsavory.
1496800	1501560	I don't, I didn't like all that new new world order business, but the, the creature is real.
1501560	1506320	The creature I saw and it could, it could end at all.
1506320	1507320	Yeah.
1507320	1513800	What if we kill Ann though and just focus on trying to get Keith out of that hole.
1513880	1517480	I feel like someone or something is throwing a lot of distractions at us.
1517480	1521040	I just want to focus on one thing.
1521040	1525880	As much as I hate her, there's nothing that she could say or do that would ever make me
1525880	1528720	call myself on her side.
1528720	1532300	But at this point she's saying some of the right things that she doesn't necessarily
1532300	1535840	care about Maggie, which we've had her doubts about Maggie.
1535840	1537800	She knows a lot about what's going on.
1537800	1538800	Clearly.
1538800	1540800	She's not like got good intentions.
1540800	1544800	I mean us in power means the new world order thing wouldn't happen.
1544800	1547800	I think that happens no matter what we just be running it.
1547800	1553760	I don't know if that'd be so bad if we could, if we could change it from the inside.
1553760	1560680	I just want to watch my Smokies and sit around with my money and my family.
1560680	1561680	How about, how about this?
1561680	1565880	How about we just, you and I both know that killing her wouldn't be too much sweat off
1565880	1568000	our backs, me especially.
1568000	1569480	So let's just have that in our back pocket.
1569480	1573080	The first time things get hanky, we can pop her.
1573080	1574080	No questions asked.
1574080	1577460	I think you're taking, I think you're trying to take us to comp company campground right
1577460	1579840	now is the definition of hanky.
1579840	1580840	Seems hanky to me.
1580840	1583520	That's what I'm saying though is what about Keith man?
1583520	1585280	I mean, yeah.
1585280	1588280	What about Keith?
1588280	1600960	Well, when you put it that way, I don't know, dude.
1600960	1601960	I don't trust her.
1601960	1602960	I don't think we should go.
1602960	1603960	I don't like it.
1603960	1604960	I think we got to help Keith.
1604960	1607400	Well, how, how would we, how would we do that?
1607400	1608400	Fuck.
1608400	1609400	They opened the door somehow.
1609400	1613520	I kind of wondered maybe and knows more about it than she's letting on.
1613520	1615200	I was asking her about it.
1615200	1616200	That's what I thought.
1616200	1617760	I was hoping she would know that.
1618240	1623120	I'm kind of wondering now if it opened because Keith was near it, it has his name on it.
1623120	1624120	Yeah.
1624120	1625120	That's not a bad thought.
1625120	1626120	Oh, you know what it was?
1626120	1627120	I bet it was the watch.
1627120	1628400	He had the watch on.
1628400	1631040	That savior and son of a bitch.
1631040	1632240	Well.
1632240	1641240	And at that exact moment, you hear a rushing of a waterfall as whatever unnatural force
1641240	1648800	was holding up either side of this water wall relinquishes control and like a sheet of ice
1648800	1655520	or a long cloth or a string of beads, this floating moat comes crashing down into the
1655520	1665040	ground on mass, erupting both away from and into Bean's pond where the three of you are
1665040	1667280	currently chit chatting.
1667280	1672360	I need both of you to roll swim checks.
1672360	1677440	That's something I sure as shit didn't put any points into.
1677440	1678960	Ann Love rolled a four.
1678960	1679960	Good for her.
1679960	1680960	Oh my God.
1680960	1681960	I pass.
1681960	1683560	So I have the baseline 20 and I rolled a 10.
1683560	1686520	I have the baseline 20 and I rolled a 54.
1686520	1689440	Clark, you see this thing.
1689440	1691720	It's just.
1691720	1699000	And from all sides simultaneously, this mushroom shaped lack of pond is filling back up and
1699000	1700400	becoming a pond.
1700400	1707200	And as you're trying to run, we got muddy feet and it's filling all the way to the top
1707200	1708480	as you swim.
1708480	1712640	You uh, you can stay afloat the entire time where you're only, you don't take in much
1712640	1715440	water as you're making your way up out of there.
1715440	1720960	John, you actually have some issues as John Lee Pettymore the third is trying to swim
1720960	1721960	out.
1721960	1722960	You feel.
1722960	1723960	You're kind of roboty.
1723960	1725280	Is it sinking him?
1725280	1726280	Holy shit.
1726280	1727280	That's perfect.
1727280	1728280	Yeah.
1728280	1732560	John, you feel the weight of the metal in your endoskeleton pulling you further and
1732560	1737560	further down into the murky fish frenzy that is beans pond.
1737560	1742760	Oh, and you feel the intense buzzing inside your skull that you felt when you dunked your
1742760	1749320	head into the truck bed puddle and the static is growing and growing, but suddenly you're
1749320	1754560	moving upward toward the surface at a rapid clip.
1754560	1763440	And as you break through the top of the water, you hear fossilism, fossilism, fossilism,
1763440	1770200	and you see and love holding out one hand toward you and her other hand down at her
1770200	1771200	feet.
1771200	1779400	And she is standing on the pond and you are standing on the pond.
1779400	1784360	She puts her hand on your shoulder and as you catch your breath, she walks you off of
1784360	1792120	this teeming overflowing pond and onto the bank next to Clark Bishop, still ankle deep
1792120	1799040	due to the excess water in the wall.
1799040	1801040	Holy shit Kev lucky for you.
1801040	1813040	I was here and we were going to kill you.
1813040	1814520	What up dude?
1814520	1815520	How you would have been.
1815520	1818080	Oh, we got a screen share right off the bat.
1818080	1819080	Oh boy.
1819080	1820080	What are we?
1820080	1822080	I just typed in borf.
1822080	1823080	Okay.
1823080	1825480	You didn't know what you were doing when you typed in borf.
1825480	1828960	Oh, that is a, um, there's a furry.
1828960	1830760	I like this one better.
1830760	1831760	Oh boy.
1831760	1836760	Ooh, this is a borf gets you a lot of good stuff.
1836760	1841160	On our call of Cthulhu game, uh, Luke learned what yiffing was.
1841160	1842160	Oh yeah.
1842160	1843160	Furry sex.
1843160	1847640	That was, I don't know if that came from the chat or if that just came up.
1847640	1853480	I don't remember why it came up, but when you look up borf, there's a fair amount of
1853480	1855840	animal fucking going on in here.
1855840	1858360	Oh, this guy's name's borf too.
1858360	1859520	He's a little alien.
1859520	1862000	It looks like a flubber became a person.
1862000	1864720	It's like a flubber and Ghostbusters mix.
1864720	1865720	Ew.
1865720	1866720	Yeah.
1866720	1870040	Oh, can you imagine if Robin Williams had been in Ghostbusters?
1870040	1871040	I can't imagine.
1871040	1874320	It would go a little something like this.
1874320	1876280	Hey everybody, gotta get the ghost.
1876280	1877280	Gotta get the ghost.
1877280	1878280	Oh.
1878280	1879280	Is that good?
1879280	1880280	It was good enough.
1880280	1881280	Trying these letters.
1881280	1882280	We gotta call.
1882280	1883280	We gotta call.
1883280	1891400	It's a something.
1891400	1893400	Funny always gets good stuff.
1893400	1894400	Okay.
1894400	1897520	Look, do you remember where we were last time?
1897520	1900540	That is a baby with a handlebar mustache.
1900540	1902320	It's a very good look.
1902320	1904080	Advanced sharing options.
1904080	1905540	Who can share?
1905540	1906540	Only host.
1906540	1907540	Aww.
1907540	1908540	There it is.
1908540	1912400	I guess I'll get out of this then.
1912400	1914080	What a shame.
1914080	1916320	It's fun being on Zoom calls with you, Luke.
1916320	1918220	Let's play games.
1918220	1921180	Let's play games.
1921180	1930760	Last time you went down an elevator shaft, an old mining elevator down and then opened
1930760	1938620	up a sealed blast door like from a bunker, entered a large cavernous room.
1938620	1939660	Your ears popped.
1939660	1940660	You did the yawn.
1940660	1941660	I did.
1941660	1945280	Sorry, what was that?
1945280	1949460	It's a shame that this is only an audio medium because...
1949460	1959320	Unless you subscribe to the Patreon, then once a month you get to watch me do this.
1959320	1964780	So you went down here, you found papers that were blueprints for the four items that we've
1964780	1970780	come to know as the items that were in the trunk that Jon Peters brought to his home
1970780	1978100	from the green box over at, I want to say, A Plus Storage was the name, and those four
1978100	1983500	items were the gun, the helmet, the radio, and the camera.
1983500	1991540	And you found scientific math that did not quite add up to come up with the engineering
1991540	1993580	to make those items possible.
1993580	2001140	You also found some notes about different spells this person was trying out in an attempt
2001140	2011460	at eternal life, and then you finally found twenty-five attempts at making a manipulating
2011460	2021700	activator colon robot, A through Y, with the final one being codename Mary saw the picture
2021700	2028340	of a small metal sphere that was one inch in diameter, and at the bottom it said host
2028340	2030500	found.
2030500	2032580	And yes, I was excited.
2032580	2040540	You tried out one of these spells for the eternal life situation, you gave it a go,
2040540	2046620	and when you said the words enough times, or maybe the right way, or maybe with the
2046620	2053460	correct pronunciation, your bones began to vibrate, and then you felt all of your toenails
2053460	2061180	and fingernails popping like popcorn off of your body, and at that exact moment, you heard
2061180	2067660	the blast door that was on the far side of this room, something rammed itself.
2067660	2069860	Probably something spooky.
2069860	2070860	Might be a dragon.
2070860	2071860	Look at my new name.
2071860	2072860	I don't get it.
2072860	2074460	Because it doesn't have nails.
2074460	2075460	No nails required.
2075980	2076980	Oh my god.
2076980	2081140	It says dovetail joint, and I'm not a craftsman.
2084180	2089060	Okay, so, when I look at my hand, like, what's that look like?
2089060	2096460	Well, it looks like a hand, but instead of nails, there is a wrinkly bed of skin.
2096460	2099980	So the nails popped like popcorn and fell off?
2099980	2100980	Yes.
2100980	2103740	If I touch them on the ground, are they still like nails?
2103740	2104740	They're brittle.
2105620	2107460	I put one in my pocket.
2107460	2108980	I put all of them in my pocket.
2108980	2113580	Okay, as you're collecting them, they are brittle like cat's nails.
2113580	2115580	They're like ogres.
2115580	2116580	They're like ogres?
2116580	2117900	Yeah, they have layers.
2117900	2125060	So as they kind of splinter apart as you're touching them, they're like extremely weak
2125060	2126060	nails.
2126060	2127060	Okay.
2127060	2128420	I've got ten of those in my pocket.
2128420	2130940	Okay, so probably a hundred shards.
2131020	2136260	Okay, I want to take my shoes off and empty the nails out of there, and then put my shoes
2136260	2137260	back on.
2137260	2138260	What was your foot situation?
2138260	2139780	Did you have on boat shoes?
2139780	2141060	Yes, I did.
2141060	2142060	So no socks.
2142060	2145260	These were all just in your smelly smelly.
2145260	2146260	And they stink.
2146260	2147260	They stink.
2147260	2150460	Also, remember, I fell into- no, no, no!
2150460	2151460	I took my shoes off.
2151460	2152460	Oh yeah, you took them off.
2152460	2159260	So looking on the ground, you can look back and see the trail of muddy footprints, and
2159260	2164900	you're not quite sure whether it's all mud on those footprints on the concrete ground,
2164900	2165900	but you see these shards.
2165900	2168200	I'm going to put my toenails in my pockets too.
2168200	2171060	So you've got roughly 200 shards of nail.
2171060	2172060	In that left pocket.
2172060	2173340	In only the left pocket.
2173340	2174700	Left cargo pocket.
2174700	2176820	Like in the button up one.
2176820	2180420	You remember those Halloween games when you were a kid where they'd have you put your
2180420	2181420	hand into a bowl?
2181420	2183420	Like spaghetti and grapes.
2184140	2190460	Yeah, imagine what it would be like to put your hand into just 200 shards of brittle
2190460	2191460	nail.
2191460	2192460	No, thank you.
2192460	2194180	I almost just threw up saying that.
2197180	2201900	Okay, so now that I've got that done, I'm going to clean up.
2201900	2204060	Another slam into this door.
2204060	2208460	Do I physically feel any different other than not having nails?
2208460	2211580	God, it's an emptiness?
2211580	2217420	It's for sure emptiness, but it feels infinite in its helpfulness.
2217420	2221100	Okay, am I still bleeding out of my bullet wounds?
2221100	2222100	Yes, very much so.
2222100	2223100	Okay.
2223100	2227760	I'm going to peer through the window on this blast door and see what's making the commotion.
2227760	2229620	As you're peering through this circular...
2229620	2232220	What are those called?
2232220	2234980	Circle window.
2234980	2235980	Like a porthole?
2235980	2236980	And a sub-mer...
2236980	2237980	Yes, thank you.
2237980	2242260	So you're looking through this essentially porthole on this blast door.
2242260	2248220	The lights in this cavernous room shine down at just the perfect angle to illuminate a
2248220	2255340	small circle of the floor of whatever room is behind this blast door, which is otherwise
2255340	2258860	drenched in perfect darkness.
2258860	2269980	And in this well-lit ring, you can see the grayish, withering, nail-free feet of a human.
2269980	2276940	Immediately this creature rushes the door once more, and it smushes its face against
2276940	2278940	the glass.
2278940	2286860	Staring at you with wild eyes is the skeletal, pallid face of a teenage girl.
2286860	2289820	Her skin is thin and decaying.
2289820	2298020	Small tears have opened up sores on her cheekbones, nose, and chin, where bone is peeking out
2298020	2300740	under infected lesions.
2300740	2307780	Her scalp looks the same, where it isn't covered by patches of this thin, brittle hair.
2307780	2316620	But still, enough of her is there to recognize Tildi B. Mitchell.
2317500	2320140	No fucking way.
2320140	2324940	And when she makes eye contact with you, she shrieks.
2324940	2331420	I gotta get her out of there.
2331420	2335900	Gonna help her.
2335900	2338460	I'm terrified.
2338460	2340460	Roll Sanity.
2340460	2345420	39 on, I'm sure I have less than that.
2345420	2346420	7.
2346420	2348420	I wouldn't roll a d4.
2348420	2349420	3.
2349420	2355740	You stumble backwards, and you fall to the ground, and a panel in the concrete right
2355740	2359980	next to you begins to kind of pshhh.
2359980	2363060	And this square in the concrete kind of opens up.
2363060	2368220	It's weird, you get the innate feeling that your watch was close enough to the ground
2368220	2369620	in this exact spot.
2369620	2374980	And as this panel lifts up out of the ground, it seems like you can remove a square of the
2374980	2379540	concrete in the ground a foot down.
2379540	2386700	There is a revolver, an old timey revolver, with weird, odd metal all over it, and these
2386700	2391780	glass tubes, and it's got a green light that's lit.
2391780	2394180	I wanna reach in and grab it.
2394180	2395300	Is there anything else in that hole?
2395300	2396300	No there is not.
2396300	2403940	Okay, I'm gonna put it down on the ground very carefully, as to not break any tubes.
2403940	2410460	And I want to, in this whole room, I'm gonna just walk around with my watch, like an inch
2410460	2413260	from the ground, to see if anything else opens up.
2413260	2414900	Ooh, okay, fun!
2414900	2415900	Yeah.
2415900	2418900	Go ahead and roll.
2418900	2419900	Roll on natural.
2419900	2421900	What do I have in there?
2421900	2422900	50.
2422900	2426660	Now he's showing me, he's showing me what he rolled on the camera.
2426660	2428580	He rolled a 50 on a 50.
2428580	2429580	Hell yeah.
2429580	2430580	You motherfucker.
2430580	2431580	Okay, absolutely.
2431580	2432580	Abso-fucking-lutely.
2433500	2438460	When you go, and you're like, basically, you're that dude on the beach.
2438460	2439460	Gotta find some quarters.
2439460	2442820	Just trying to find some quarters, baby, and hopefully they're from the right year.
2442820	2443820	You know?
2443820	2444820	Yeah.
2444820	2445820	2019.
2445820	2449340	Oh, those 2019 quarters are super rare.
2449340	2450340	Yep.
2450340	2454140	The newest, the newer the coin, the better they are.
2454140	2456260	2020 would be a real find.
2456260	2457740	I don't think they exist.
2457740	2460820	Well, that's why it would be so rare.
2461820	2470260	And another concrete square, about a foot by a foot, opens up out of the ground and
2470260	2478060	looking down into this spot, you see a single metal sphere, about one inch in diameter.
2478060	2482420	Ooh, I don't know if I want to touch it or not.
2482420	2484420	Um, hmm.
2484420	2487180	I want to check and make sure I still have my photo on me.
2487220	2493620	When you look at the photograph that you have in your pocket, it is still your face as Silas
2493620	2494620	Cole.
2494620	2495620	Okay.
2495620	2498980	What were the words on that piece of paper that was her face wrapped?
2498980	2500220	Roll intelligence.
2500220	2505220	I think one, a couple episodes ago, I remembered it, but I'll roll again.
2505220	2508060	Yeah, if you don't remember, then you have to roll.
2508060	2513020	Forty-four on a fifty.
2513020	2514500	Hell yeah.
2514500	2516660	You're just a, just to make sure, you know?
2516660	2518140	I trust you.
2518140	2519140	I like doing it though.
2519140	2520140	Yeah, it's fun.
2520140	2521140	It is fun.
2521140	2522140	Show me what you got.
2522140	2527940	I look at the photo and I'm like, hmm, oh yeah, those words, I remember exactly what
2527940	2529100	they are there.
2529100	2531780	Because you wrote them, you pulled out a Sharpie and you wrote them on the back of the picture.
2531780	2533980	I wrote it on the back of the picture.
2533980	2538900	And then I also wrote, this is Keith Bean's picture, don't steal it.
2538900	2545300	It says, ianaha fersat sayiya.
2545300	2548460	When I think of those words, how do I feel?
2548460	2549460	Any different?
2549460	2550460	Nope.
2550460	2556180	Keith thinks up for a second, he's like, well, we've already chanted something weird today,
2556180	2566700	so ianaha fersat sayiya, ianaha fersat sayiya, ianaha fersat sayiya.
2566700	2569780	Roll just a check against fifty.
2569780	2574340	Ooh, sixty-four on a fifty, so I fail.
2574340	2579160	So that means I get to choose what it does.
2579160	2583740	This spell had basically a mechanic where I didn't know that you were going to go bat
2583740	2588100	shit crazy and fuck up Mildred Mitchell.
2588100	2594960	And I made this spell where all four of us had a twenty-five percent chance of being
2594960	2600020	the one who got to come up with what the spell does.
2600020	2605100	But since it's only me and you here, I just have you roll basically a fifty-fifty shot
2605100	2607980	to decide who gets to choose what the spell does.
2607980	2608980	And I get to choose.
2608980	2610820	It can only be three words.
2610820	2613100	What the spell does can only be three words.
2613100	2614100	Yeah.
2614100	2616040	Makes brain smart.
2616040	2619760	Oh boy, okay.
2619760	2624380	Don't say penis falls off, oops.
2624380	2627660	I prayed for that one before I lost my fingernails.
2627660	2629500	You did indeed.
2629500	2634540	There's lots of combinations of three words you could make.
2634540	2635540	Okay.
2635540	2636540	I'm nervous.
2636540	2644300	As you begin to chant, you feel your bones once again begin to vibrate, but Keith Beans
2644300	2646180	is more than bone.
2646180	2653820	Keith Beans is partially made of metal, and all of that metal begins to heat up.
2653820	2661900	You can feel it inside you throbbing with pain right before your skin begins splitting
2661900	2662920	open.
2662920	2673740	It starts at your index finger and your body slowly begins to unzip the rip peeling apart
2673740	2680460	and the seam shooting up your forearm past your elbow, continuing toward your shoulder
2680460	2689820	as the metal inside this arm begins falling out and clanking on the concrete floor below.
2689820	2697360	The opening of your body does not cease, however, and your skin continues to burst open, unzipping
2697360	2705060	itself up your neck, and it finally halts its progress at the tear duct of the eye.
2705060	2710540	The glass scientists had to surgically set back into its socket.
2710540	2714780	The pain is searing and unbearable.
2714780	2723140	Your metal septum shifts to one side and slides out of your nostril.
2723140	2730860	An endless stream of cocaine pours onto the ground, forming an anthill mound of white
2730860	2734100	powder on the uneven concrete.
2734140	2746260	Half of your upper body is an empty, slashed-open skin seam, and with that, the real pain begins.
2746260	2751860	Bones begin cracking and forming.
2751860	2754780	The bone and muscle starts growing.
2754780	2760780	Your nerve endings are lighting up like the finale of a fireworks show, this torrid pain
2760780	2767500	taking away your breath, your body is covered in sweat, and you feel like this horror will
2767500	2776860	never end, but finally, your skin begins zipping itself back up, and when it's finished, you
2776860	2779620	can't even find the seam.
2779620	2788420	The only evidence of what you just lived through is the pile of cocaine and metal skeletal
2788420	2794700	structures strewn about on the ground below you.
2794700	2795700	Does it still hurt?
2795700	2797500	It hurts like a motherfucker.
2797500	2802020	Well, I don't think Keith could have pulled off the one-armed Voldemort look, so I'm glad
2802020	2805300	it came back at least.
2805300	2807040	Keith is freaking the fuck out.
2807040	2809460	How long does this process take?
2809460	2812100	It takes, what, ten minutes?
2812100	2814140	So what are you doing while this is happening?
2814140	2815820	Are you just standing there letting it happen?
2815820	2817460	Are you walking around?
2817460	2818460	Are you falling over?
2818460	2824820	I'm like just staring at my arm and like, yeah, just like in shock, staring at my arm
2824820	2828700	and like feeling my nose and trying to keep it together.
2828700	2835620	And the spell has completed its intended purpose, as you are made whole again.
2835620	2837060	And I need you to roll sanity.
2837060	2840660	Yeah, I'm gonna fail that unless it's a miracle.
2840660	2844620	Okay, I have a 4% chance of this being a good roll.
2844620	2846580	Oh, I bet you can do it.
2847100	2848100	Nah.
2848100	2849100	87.
2849100	2850100	Okay.
2850100	2851100	Oh, 57.
2851100	2852100	Still a fail.
2852100	2857340	Uh, go ahead and, uh, what do you think?
2857340	2858340	Roll a d4 for me.
2858340	2861260	Okay, I hope that- Your body just fell out of itself and then
2861260	2865820	reformed with human bone- Hope that I don't roll a 4 on this bad boy.
2865820	2866820	You won't.
2866820	2867820	There's no way.
2867820	2868820	Fucking shit.
2868820	2869820	No shit.
2869820	2873820	He's showing me the- He rolled a 4?
2874820	2879060	Oh, Keith Beans.
2879060	2880740	I don't feel very good.
2880740	2886060	As you hit zero sanity, according to the rules of the game that we definitely always follow
2886060	2888020	to a T- To the T.
2888020	2890820	The handler gets to take over control.
2890820	2892300	Spill the T, baby.
2892300	2893700	Don't mind if I do.
2893700	2899380	Keith Beans, in his newly formed body, walks over to the workstation across this cavernous
2899380	2900740	laboratory.
2900740	2905700	She stuffs as many of the blueprints and notes as he possibly can into the big ol' cargo
2905700	2912260	short pockets, along with his stash of nail shards, before he sets his eyes on the gun
2912260	2917980	he so carefully placed on the ground to avoid cracking those glass tubes.
2917980	2926180	Those glass tubes which he can now see are full of this undulating pitch black ooze.
2926180	2932540	And Keith picks up this odd looking revolver, eagerly considering the lit green light on
2932540	2940580	the side, which is next to this cylinder, which he slides open, revealing a single oversized
2940580	2944660	bullet that fills the entire chamber.
2944660	2952460	This bullet looks old and dusty, and Keith smiles as he resets the cylinder and pulls
2952460	2954660	back the hammer.
2954660	2963660	With a squeeze of the trigger comes a blinding flash of light, and Keith Beans finds himself
2963660	2968660	standing on a dirty, sandy trail.
2968660	2974220	The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air, and looking down the
2974220	2980720	road, Keith sees a man just a bit ahead of him walking into town.
2980720	2986860	The camera pans down just in time as Keith Beans strips his shorts off.
2986860	2992120	We steadily move forward over the shit and mud covered shorts and the dusty footpath
2992120	2999680	and words appear at the bottom of the screen in an old western font that reads,
2999680	3003840	Contention 1880 something.
3003840	3010680	As the camera pans back up there in the distance we see a fully naked Keith Beans sprinting
3010680	3012680	toward his target.
3012680	3019840	He hollers out, Hey, Silas Cole, and the man turns around just in time for a sucker punch.
3019840	3025740	As soon as Cole hits the ground, Keith grabs his chin in the back of his neck and extinguishes
3025740	3030560	this man's life with a single twist.
3030560	3039480	Keith is standing over this man's body now, which is face down in the dry, cracked dirt.
3039480	3043120	Face down in the dirt.
3043120	3045680	And this dead body says it doesn't hurt.
3045680	3051160	One day, one job, bad bad, and enough.
3051160	3059400	Yep, guys, if you haven't checked out Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, I'm telling you, top tier,
3059400	3061800	top tier shit.
3061800	3068640	Back to the body on the ground, Keith's hands are trembling as he rolls Silas over a dead
3068640	3076360	man in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine, dressed in the fashion of the day, and a tri-folded
3076360	3081600	piece of parchment falls out of this deceased man's jacket pocket.
3081600	3087760	It's a job advertisement for the Contention Mining Company, and it reads,
3087760	3093520	We is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight.
3093520	3095160	Plenty of work.
3095160	3096880	Hesitate not.
3096880	3097880	Whew!
3097880	3101400	What the hell's gonna happen?
3101400	3103400	Fuck yeah.
3103400	3112640	I'm fucking insane, and in the past, I'm gonna fuck some shit up.
3112640	3114480	It's my town now.
3125160	3151480	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
3151480	3162280	How can you have enough drowning out all the noise?
3162280	3166280	There's nobody home.
3166280	3174280	Nobody home.
3174280	3178280	Fight, fight, streamy night.
