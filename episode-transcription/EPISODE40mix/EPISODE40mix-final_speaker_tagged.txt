0.00 278.72 speaker0  Listen here y'all, listen real close, closer, come on don't be scared, snuggle on up with your little wolfy boy, prepare to be comforted by the sounds of your favorite cuddle bug wolf the dog, broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP the radio station of your dreams baby. This week's howlin with wolf comes from atj51ropa on twitter who tagged at pretending pod in one of them their tweets, wow what a thoughtful act of support on a social media platform that wolf definitely knows how to use without help, thanks my baby, they write, hey wolf my dog, been missing your dulcet tones since I moved from contention to the city, it was a real pleasant surprise to hear your pirate station up and running, can you give a shout out to my lady still living in contention, I haven't heard from her in a couple days so I think she must be mad at me, why else won't she return my calls, Bethany Ann Laberbarra if you're listening, I love you, now that I think about it, no one from contention has returned my calls, huh from JR pronounced JR not Jr from twitter slash the city, well JR not Jr I once had me a little wolfy guy who would never return my calls, the only thing that got her attention was when I threw a brick covered in crawdad grease through her window in the dead of night, she finally started talking to me though it may have been that would prevent true love from blossoming, speaking of bad shit going down that prevents any of us from finding true happiness, this is the news, last time our intrepid former old lady and her spell performing friends on the way down to some kind of massive dank aquatic interrogation chamber, on metal catwalks above murky green water they found Francis beans interrogating Kathy Piston while lowering George Piston into the foul aquarium, unsurprisingly a bit of a tussle ensued, also unsurprisingly Keith Vigna found his way into the water, but as he was climbing up George Piston's body to escape from an unknown creature in the depths that very beast swallowed the two of them and dove back into the hideous and from user bruzka on the subreddit we have surpassed this 100 review mark, thank you so much to each and every one of you, these reviews really do help spread the madness further and further, wolf bless you my children, every one of you, for your efforts we are sponsoring a giveaway slash contest over on the subreddit, r slash pretending to be people, we will randomly select two entries and both lucky listeners will win a dnd 5e starter in addition the second entry selected will also receive a box of dnd dungeon tiles that
273.88 293.04 speaker1  aspect the cast of pretending to be people will choose their favorite submission and
284.98 399.92 speaker0  not one but two rulebooks the agent's handbook and the handler's guide as well as five sets of dice to prepare you and four friends for the fight to hold back the relentless darkness bow
391.12 416.88 speaker3  guy on a role-playing podcast don't call me a hero
408.88 522.16 speaker2  my heroic rugged face and you can see that heroic rugged face on our instagram at pretending pod woof let's dive into it while we on that jovial note yeah on to the rope and swings across to the other side of the catwalk the chain yes sorry the chain she grabs on to this wet mossy covered chain and swings across to the other side and then walks toward you guys with the chain with the fish hook on the end of it and she begins walking toward
516.72 581.44 speaker3  as she's approaching with the fish hook like she's stretching the chain out behind her right like
573.68 815.04 speaker2  jump on you and immediately turns it around and shoves it into your let's see what damage would and she shoves it directly into your shoulder and the fish hook goes and you can feel it break into the metal underneath your skin and then push through the metal that is just on the other side of your skin as it goes into your shoulder what's that put your hit points at what did she so lick thought we called his name and so he came barging into the it was a dexterity check so i'm even though you crit succeeded i'm going to give her the same role but i'm going to give her a negative 40 to her dexterity which actually puts her dexterity which actually puts her dexterity at 30 so if she can roll why even roll why don't you a success on a 30 then she can avoid francis beans shoves this small girl shoves this big fish hook this big like rusty fish hook into she is actually going to smack her head on the side of the catwalk as she falls in and her limp body immediately just like belly flops onto the water kathy piston starts hollering she's like oh lies floating on top of the dark green murky water below we're gonna cut to luke oh what
813.04 859.44 speaker3  end so i was like oh i think they're calling me
851.12 1161.20 speaker2  of george piston who is inside this creature with you first off i need you to roll sanity times three times on a d100 uh 67 all righty okay i like that one what's the last one 84 is 84 is plutomania which is the obsessive by an evil spirit so now keith vigna oh i like this you have both had the empathy taken from you correct and you also believe yourself to be inhabited by an evil spirit it's a very fun i'm gonna need you to do as you are pushing your back against this disgusting membrane you actually feel the mucus and the the viscous sludge that is the inside of this creature perhaps burning what is that feeling it's it's not quite burning it's it smells terrible in here and you feel pain and are only getting more inside fish man creature okay uh i just continue crawling up as you begin climbing up this massive disgusting creature is going to attempt to swallow harder in order to down from where you were and it is clear that the muscle muscly walls on either side of you are pushing you further into this fish creature and you are exactly where you were last round go
1152.96 1189.36 speaker3  and instead of crawling up i take out my very small very powerful pistol and fire off as many shots as i can around you know like a not in the same spot but around the same spot to try to
1182.40 1245.76 speaker2  that you are within as it begins to freak out and it's swimming all or like the movement is uncanny compared to how smooth everything was before i mean your gun fires and you can feel the pressure that you've blown into the inside of this fish but there's no water gushing in from the side or anything yet and it decides to continue its plan of swallowing you further so it is going you will take no damage from this mucus yeah and you are still in the same spot you're in
1236.64 1286.08 speaker3  what i want to do is i want to pull out a frag grenade stick it in the hole that i've made with
1281.12 1350.80 speaker2  out a frag grenade you knew exactly where they were on your belt or inside i'm sorry inside your cargo shorts used as swimming trunks that's a lie i live in southwest missouri i've definitely you've made with your small but powerful gun and then you grab the underneath the arms of george piston and move him directly over the position which he would usually i think he would win the do you think that part of your action of doing this is caused by your new belief that there's
1345.12 1369.76 speaker3  it's there's an evil spirit inside of me and i literally part of my brain that has empathy is
1363.52 1439.44 speaker2  let's go ahead and i'm gonna roll some damage here actually i'll have you roll the damage okay what do you want me to roll i'm sure that there is a specific amount of damage taken from a frag grenade but i'm gonna say that you're gonna roll 46 because you are putting him literally right damage rounding up so you take six more damage okay however you have successfully blown a hole in the side of this creature you immediately feel cold water rushing in whereas before you were just surrounded by warm wet mucus and guts but now there's this cold murky water coming in
1430.32 1474.24 speaker3  ace ventura the grenade explodes shrapnel pretty much blows george in half so that's the reason why water's rushing in instead of him being stuck up next to it is his body's blown in half he may right up against my like forehead uh-huh and i start ripping this fish open and i'm just wiggling my face out to where it's barely out and then i with all my strength push myself out
1468.80 1492.48 speaker2  into the water out of this is this did did it's always sunny do the exact same joke as ace to you after this i think frank uh danny divido comes out of a couch yeah very similar all right
1486.24 1522.32 speaker3  well you are birthed out of this massive creature i pull a jonah except i think jonah was less
1514.40 1702.08 speaker2  standing on this wet catwalk looking down at the body of francis beans underneath the surface of the water deep down somewhere below you feel this massive quake and there's a rumbling of the entire catwalk and it shakes you violently back and forth you hold your footing but you see this burst of light from inside the murky water below and then you start to see bubbles coming up onto the surface of this disgusting water and looking at the body of francis beans you see right next to her the water break and popping up to the surface is keith vigna
1696.64 1785.92 speaker3  look at kathy and i'm like you know what i don't care you gotta know i shot my way out couldn't didn't really work so i stuck a grenade in the hole that i made i put george right up against that hole to shield if he had i hope he had a quick death but he was screaming as i as i squirmed my way out
1778.72 1888.88 speaker2  kind of like sideswipe his face but he's like literally covered in this disgusting mucusy goo that hasn't quite rinsed off completely and the butt of your gun just kind of slides right off the side of his head okay so i turn it around and i point it at his face and i say what the fuck
1881.60 1908.80 speaker3  want to keith you have experience in this water get her out i look at i look i'm like we can try
1904.24 1919.44 speaker2  noticed this giant rusty fish yeah you just you just have a lot of slack so you're able to keep
1915.12 1967.60 speaker3  but she might have something on her we want to get out but otherwise i think we just continue on and can keep going or if you want to fish her out she might have something on her but a minute face down
1959.36 2008.16 speaker2  deserves anything that you fucking deem necessary now will you fucking let me down please well wait
2001.36 2059.44 speaker3  better people for you generally then than she were but i don't actually want to get you off them chains until you ask that last question she had what did the circle of knowledge use
2050.72 2100.64 speaker2  and she is hanging grotesquely from mid forearms she is in just an insane amount of pain and emotional torment so that while coming to her as a surprise does not necessarily garner a massive
2096.56 2111.04 speaker1  and try and help her down i don't know how to do that can i do joe doesn't know how to do that
2105.60 2158.88 speaker2  like mechanical engineering or she's a little bit too far away from me you'd have to like jump out to her i mean looking over there is a lever that you saw francis using to lower george piston in for but whoever has the highest intelligence could roll intelligence to to figure this one out i'd say
2152.08 2173.76 speaker3  it out definitely without severing any major arteries or hurting you in any way as we get you
2167.28 2235.60 speaker2  her up and as soon as you start fiddling with it she drops fully into the water the chain releases and it moves all the way down and it continues to lower and lower and lower and now the top of the chain or the bottom that you can see of the chain right up against the water is dry and has no algae or rust on it so you know that this is in fully engaged all the way down position oh well okay you can set you can definitely kick it it breaks off it breaks off completely yeah there you go
2230.00 2240.96 speaker3  swing the hook into uh francis to try to pull her up and see if we can't search her george
2235.60 2245.36 speaker2  pistons hook yeah you're trying to hook francis beans with george pistons hook is it's it's not
2240.96 2305.68 speaker3  is it still stuck in the fish no no it was hanging yeah it's hanging yeah is she on that
2299.20 2511.44 speaker2  on your skin as you begin swimming down directly following the chain yeah you are going down there i'm imagining that your mind is just filling up with all of these thoughts a sanity check okay your ears are completely filled up with water but something i think i hear something it's perfect god you're right here with me inside of your mind and as you're going down i need you to roll out of her arms and follow the chain back up to the surface don't say i never did anything for francis beans and you can drag her over to where you can and then i dump it onto the catwalk the
2505.52 2525.20 speaker3  keys or any anything that we can use to continue our path into the glass compound while he's
2517.36 2563.12 speaker2  doing that keith you're going through the pockets and really all you find is a uh a stun gun and a
2559.20 2605.44 speaker3  is there any way to check and see if that works is there like a light that lights up or anything on
2597.36 2673.04 speaker2  more recently than you did yeah so keith as you begin doing cpr you realize that you have broken guys have all been on for some time now but he's gag reflexing all over keith yeah well
2666.40 2749.36 speaker3  they climb onto francis's floating dead body to uh hoist themselves up so that we can grab them
2741.92 2779.92 speaker2  vomit that john lee pettymore just put there and she starts screaming she's like you you you
2772.32 2826.56 speaker3  have uh felt your own pulse on her neck instead of hers i don't think that she was actually alive when we fished her out of there i'm sorry oh i'm not actually sorry though she's a bitch so clark the heat of the moment man he's like you know what he didn't do it correctly and he felt the and it worked so made up for it so clark you might once we once we're done with this you might need
2821.36 2867.28 speaker1  to take another first aid class but i think that's the least of our concerns today on that cpr that's
2860.32 2928.96 speaker3  addled my brains i was under for quite a while if me and uh clark and kathy walk on down there little you can i'll walk down a little bit with you but i'll hold back so i'll be i'll be close good idea that everybody should just do that and as you do that behind the person they're trying
2920.48 2968.24 speaker2  you tell me where leo is then i will absolutely join you leo my brother-in-law he went missing he didn't well we don't know where'd all the missing people go well we're trying we're trying if you really are john lee pettymore and you two are fucking who you are then you know that everyone in contention's been gone missing and where are they well you think we took them we're
2962.88 3034.24 speaker3  but whose fault it is and we know this for fact it's marvin it's marvin glasses
3029.76 3038.16 speaker2  clark you know maggie they're at the circle of knowledge she's been using them and i know how
3034.24 3048.96 speaker1  mag has been using them do you know how marvin's been using them i didn't know marvin was using
3043.28 3103.20 speaker2  but you know he certainly i don't know you know he he uses them for fights which isn't great you know obviously but we he normally breeds them first and then you know they're not born into a world where they're really known to any sort of comfort so i guess it makes it slightly better but mostly i'm just getting that sweet sweet money and i you know i've been using all those people down there uh you know uh getting getting my clicks from my business you are an awful sack different than jim jim cook yeah jim cook yeah he used to run he used to run the circle of knowledge been working with jim for years and i've been working with marvin for years and uh you know i always felt fine handing people over to they'd always come back and they'd you know keep staying
3098.40 3148.88 speaker3  with me for a while but i was confused i thought marvin had inherited some kind of thing from jim
3140.40 3196.56 speaker1  keep it contained wherever the plan of existence it's in they need people in that plan at all times chanting to keep it there so they have a kind of continuous rotation of homeless people who kind of sort of volunteer for it like they they they they're glad to be keeping that thing they're
3192.16 3207.84 speaker3  we need to be arguing with each other right now i think we need to go get this guy off the hook get him to help us we got plenty of guns for all of us to go storm marvin's place i'm gonna help
3203.36 3241.76 speaker1  i'll take a gun i'm gonna help kathy to her feet and pull a pistol out of my waistband and hand it keith can attest to the fact that she's a crack shot she hit she hit me nailed her nailed his
3236.48 3376.08 speaker3  a crack shot damn it i forgot you shot keith and that makes you at least half all right in my book lowered down in i just want to move him back over to close to the catwalk and try to get him down
3369.76 3395.60 speaker2  edges than her old man was that's for sure she's been fine to deal with on my end but you know she
3390.00 3423.04 speaker1  any chance in the last year or two um they were coming back any different if the homeless people ever spoken to you about changes or things that have been different about their time there at the
3418.40 3469.84 speaker2  anyway uh yeah no he was a he was a fine man to deal with seemed like he had his head on his shoulders straight you know maybe a little bit of an alcohol problem but past that man who doesn't have a vice but come to think of it i i haven't seen any of the the people i've dropped off with her uh in the past uh week you know i typically you know she they'd normally keep them for a while so i haven't gotten any back from her i will say i used to get them back from jim you know we'd
3465.44 3496.56 speaker1  you're you're like an independent contractor are you you're not part of the circle are you no
3491.52 3582.80 speaker2  he said he saw him disappear and then he said disappear which i have no idea what the fuck that
3581.36 3632.24 speaker1  i have no idea
3625.60 3641.68 speaker3  illegitimate bullshit i've actually listened to every episode uh about five times and there's parts where like i feel like they don't even remember what they were doing
3637.68 3646.88 speaker2  all right thomas luke can you guys use your radio voices from here on out
3641.68 3717.52 speaker3  yeah i'll just use my voice you wanted us to sound sexy we can do a little bit of that
3710.56 3769.76 speaker2  keith vigna and john lee pettymore to pull down doug jacobs in the body of agent and chad and the
3764.00 3776.64 speaker3  i look at uh both my fellow i guess former officers at this point but both my fellow officers and kathy and and trent chad and i like beckon behind us and i'm like we came do
