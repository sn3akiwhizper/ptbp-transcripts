00:00.000 --> 00:07.960
This is yet another introduction to the radio show known as 694.2 PTBP,

00:07.960 --> 00:15.720
the galaxy's only radio station that is technically also maybe a toxic waste site.

00:15.720 --> 00:21.480
You all know me, and if you don't, my name's DJ Wolf the dog,

00:21.480 --> 00:29.200
here to howl out some things at y'all before something else starts happening right after I stop talking.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.360
Have I ever stuck around even one second after my segment ends?

00:34.360 --> 00:36.520
Damn, you know I haven't.

00:36.520 --> 00:42.840
I clock out and skitter as fast as my limbs can skitter out to the municipal dump.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.200
It's all you can eat every day, baby.

00:46.200 --> 00:51.400
And speaking of howling, and skittering, and me, Wolf the dog,

00:51.400 --> 00:55.680
it's time to skitter on over to a new howling with Wolf.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.280
Howl

00:58.280 --> 01:04.480
This show's howling with Wolf is from Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina,

01:04.480 --> 01:08.680
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

01:08.680 --> 01:13.480
What's that? You haven't tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod?

01:13.480 --> 01:15.400
That's so weird.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.840
You should be more like Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina,

01:19.840 --> 01:23.760
and tweet about the show and tag at Pretending Pod.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.200
Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina, writes,

01:27.200 --> 01:29.120
Greetings, Wolf.

01:29.120 --> 01:36.000
I'm writing you from some weird liminal dimension I stumbled into while cleaning carpets in some old church.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.400
Overall, it isn't too bad.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.880
I just wish they had more food than these strange bits of jerky with hair on them,

01:43.880 --> 01:47.400
and wine that tastes more like pennies than wine.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.960
I want to give a shout out to my best friend Ash and girlfriend Kaylee,

01:51.960 --> 01:55.520
as well as everyone who works on this podcast.

01:55.520 --> 02:01.120
Y'all have got me through more hard times than I can count and made me laugh just as many.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.120
Damn.

02:02.120 --> 02:09.120
Well, I hope you can turn that liminal dimension into a liminalade dimension, you know what I'm saying?

02:09.120 --> 02:13.560
And if you could, uh, email me some of them jerky bits,

02:13.560 --> 02:20.760
I would be mighty delighted to partake in whatever or whoever it is.

02:20.760 --> 02:27.400
Now, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter,

02:27.400 --> 02:32.000
fuck the musk, tag at Pretending Pod on Instagram, fuck the zuck,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.680
or tag pretending to be people on Facebook, fuck the zuck double time.

02:36.680 --> 02:41.040
Or write us up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice,

02:41.040 --> 02:44.800
and make sure it gets in front of my dang eyeballs.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.800
And fuck whoever owns podcasts.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.920
And if you happen to have forgotten, the links are in the show notes.

02:52.920 --> 02:53.920
That's right.

02:53.920 --> 02:59.480
Whether you want to give us money in exchange for bonus content on Patreon,

02:59.480 --> 03:02.680
or cop some new drip at the merch store,

03:02.680 --> 03:07.400
or join the listener communities on Discord and Reddit,

03:07.400 --> 03:14.600
or vibe to a selection of tracks from the PTBPOST on YouTube,

03:14.600 --> 03:18.240
you can find those links in the show notes.

03:18.240 --> 03:23.880
And now, for our top ten shortest news segments, it's the news.

03:23.880 --> 03:27.440
Last time, the gang went to the Zeitgeist,

03:27.440 --> 03:31.480
the abandoned and very unimpressive city Space Needle,

03:31.480 --> 03:34.240
and then Dr. Brock Hargrave,

03:34.240 --> 03:36.840
no, no way, this can't be right,

03:36.840 --> 03:42.240
says here, Dr. Hargrave brought a couple of sedated folks on leashes

03:42.280 --> 03:45.880
up to the spot he'd been digging, smoked some meth,

03:45.880 --> 03:49.840
plunged a syringe in the dude, stuck a finger in his own ear

03:49.840 --> 03:52.120
and then promptly into his own mouth,

03:52.120 --> 03:55.440
and then that very zonked-out dude

03:55.440 --> 04:00.440
just climbed into the abdomen of Dr. Brock Hargrave

04:00.440 --> 04:02.520
and disappeared?

04:02.520 --> 04:06.320
Also making a disappearance for the final time,

04:06.320 --> 04:11.320
it's Hudson Freeman with muscles all sprees.

04:42.240 --> 05:12.040
You are now listening to the final episode

05:12.040 --> 05:15.680
of our four-episode series, Fuck Me.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.400
Oh, do you want to take that one again?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.320
Do you want to do that?

05:19.320 --> 05:20.640
What a gentleman.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.920
Holy cow farms, leave it in.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.960
Oh, right, no, we now know that burps are not only important

05:27.960 --> 05:30.080
but life-changing to our listeners,

05:30.080 --> 05:31.880
so we got to leave them in.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.120
Also, we're sponsored by Aldi and those burps,

05:34.120 --> 05:38.680
brought to you by Aldi Generic Sparkling Water.

05:38.680 --> 05:43.520
It's Bell V Sparkling Water Tangerine by Pure Aqua.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.080
Hey, Zach, I'm sorry, but you have a dozen cases of those

05:46.080 --> 05:48.000
in your house and you don't know what the fuck it's called

05:48.000 --> 05:49.160
without looking at the can.

05:49.160 --> 05:53.160
It's because you have the koozie.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.880
That's exactly right, I'm covering it up constantly.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.520
24-7 koozied up.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.200
And he knows how to read, for sure.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.920
I just think it's weird to not use a koozie

06:00.920 --> 06:04.360
and touch a cold can, like that's fucked up to me.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.480
I have so many koozies in a drawer of my house

06:09.120 --> 06:11.120
and I've never once used any of them.

06:11.120 --> 06:15.000
Same, Zach and his wife have the same drawer

06:15.000 --> 06:17.240
but they use them all the time and it's pretty great,

06:17.240 --> 06:20.000
honestly, they're always like handing you one

06:20.000 --> 06:21.920
when you have a cold beverage at their house.

06:21.920 --> 06:22.760
It's a nice touch.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.880
You're making me question my koozie behavior.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.120
Yeah, I mean, you've got them.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.400
Keep them in the drawer, that's where mine are.

06:29.400 --> 06:33.360
You don't fuse, you're gonna lose.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.480
That's exactly right.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.320
That's what they always say.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.400
I forgot how to say the word.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
That's what Taylor's back tattoo says.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.840
Right above Richard Nixon.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.440
It was supposed to be a cover up

06:48.440 --> 06:49.880
but it just looks cooler now.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.920
Sweet, does your wife really have a tattoo

06:52.920 --> 06:54.200
of Richard Nixon on her back?

06:54.200 --> 06:57.040
No, Roger Stone does.

06:57.040 --> 06:57.880
Oh, right.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.120
What happened last week?

06:59.120 --> 07:01.360
Wolf already told us, let's dive into this shit.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.520
Oh yeah, thanks Wolf.

07:03.360 --> 07:08.000
I think maybe we need to go talk to him or get him,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.720
but I am not leaving here without dropping this

07:10.720 --> 07:11.560
in the hole.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.080
You say as you roll grip,

07:13.080 --> 07:18.080
as you all see this dude disappear into the torso

07:19.200 --> 07:20.640
of Dr. Brock Hargrave.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.040
I pass.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.560
Shelly passes also.

07:26.560 --> 07:30.440
I've opened enough people to, you know.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.280
Same.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.840
The hook passes as well.

07:32.840 --> 07:36.480
Okay, everyone is going to lose one grip still.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.720
This is strange enough that it stops you all in your tracks

07:39.720 --> 07:42.720
and you're left just watching.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.640
Just checking.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.800
Did you guys also see that guy roll up his belly

07:47.800 --> 07:51.400
like it was a carpet and put another man inside?

07:51.400 --> 07:52.240
We sure did.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.360
How does a man fit in another man like that?

07:55.360 --> 07:56.480
He just walked right in.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.160
He absolutely devoured him like my career.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.800
It was like he went into a tiny set of stairs,

08:02.800 --> 08:05.240
like there was a vanishing point

08:05.240 --> 08:07.880
and he got smaller as he walked towards the belly,

08:07.880 --> 08:10.240
but it didn't make any sense.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.400
It was kind of amusing.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.320
We got to go save that woman before she walks

08:14.320 --> 08:15.680
into his belly.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.000
There's only one quick way down.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.480
I made hook.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.320
I know what you're thinking.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.280
I think we got to ride the Bigfoot.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.120
Well, okay.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.640
That's not what's going to happen.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.080
I'm sorry, you're going to die.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.520
If you try that.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.360
With a Bigfoot landing.

08:32.360 --> 08:37.000
I would like to pry open the elevator doors.

08:37.000 --> 08:37.840
Oh, fuck yeah.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.040
And look down the shaft

08:39.040 --> 08:43.720
and see if my good old buddy elevator cable is still there.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.360
Go ahead and roll criminology.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.440
Nope.

08:48.720 --> 08:53.160
Okay, so you get these elevator doors pried open

08:53.160 --> 08:56.200
and you're looking at the shaft,

08:56.200 --> 08:58.280
the empty shaft ahead of you.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.920
And you see that the cables that go all the way

09:01.920 --> 09:04.520
down the bottom are like frayed to the point

09:04.520 --> 09:06.880
to where you think if you were to like jump on

09:06.880 --> 09:11.600
and try to shimmy down, it might break.

09:11.600 --> 09:15.400
Dang, my usual method of going downstairs

09:15.400 --> 09:17.320
is out of adequate question.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.160
It's okay.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.520
I'm sure we'll encounter a sewer very soon.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.680
Fellas, any ideas about how to save that woman's life?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.440
We got to check the toilets.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.280
Maybe there's a cow toilet.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.840
See if we can get flushed down.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.680
Yes, maybe there's a cow toilet in the restaurant.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.000
We don't know how fresh their beef was.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.280
Is there a giant cow-sized toilet

09:35.280 --> 09:37.040
to get flushed down on this level?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.720
All right, let me roll now.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.200
Meat hook in this line of work,

09:43.200 --> 09:45.920
sometimes the person gets eaten.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.800
You all don't even care.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.520
You look so complacent.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.520
Isn't this your dude, Shelly?

09:51.520 --> 09:52.640
Why is he doing that?

09:52.640 --> 09:54.200
It's not that we don't care.

09:54.200 --> 09:58.360
It's just that stopping him is our only option here.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.440
And right now we've got to find a way to stop him.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.200
We also don't know that they're not perfectly fine in there.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.320
We can also take this out on our children

10:07.320 --> 10:09.300
or wives or whatever later.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.440
Specifically for that we've written down.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.560
Yeah, like subtracting from your bonds.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.680
Something like that, yeah.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.720
Metaphorically.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.000
Is there a door to where the old observation deck

10:21.000 --> 10:23.520
used to be even though I know the deck fell off?

10:23.560 --> 10:25.040
That is correct, there is a door

10:25.040 --> 10:27.280
and it's got tape like over it

10:27.280 --> 10:31.800
trying to warn people to not go in this general area

10:31.800 --> 10:34.560
as it is dangerous as the door is not there.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.340
It's just the open wind, the summer wind coming through

10:38.340 --> 10:40.360
and the smell of the parking lot.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.280
Does it happen to be right over the holes?

10:43.280 --> 10:44.560
Oh yeah, of course it is.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.080
I can't get open.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.760
Do something, throw something at him.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.400
Hey, take this and we'll do it at the same time

10:51.400 --> 10:54.000
and I give her the small Bigfoot

10:54.000 --> 10:56.280
and I dangle the Bigfoot over the hole

10:56.280 --> 10:58.280
which he happens to be close to, right?

10:58.280 --> 11:00.480
On the count of three we're gonna clap

11:00.480 --> 11:05.000
which requires both hands which will make us drop these.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.080
I see exactly what you're going for and I'm in.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.860
One, two, three.

11:11.960 --> 11:12.840
Go ahead and roll.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.020
The foot's full.

11:14.020 --> 11:15.740
What are we rolling for?

11:16.600 --> 11:20.680
I think you can either roll dexterity or athletics here.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.520
Or Bigfoot.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.920
Or Bigfoot obviously, dropping Bigfoot

11:23.920 --> 11:24.760
if that's a craft skill.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.760
Yeah, I got a 46, that's a pass.

11:26.760 --> 11:27.720
Nice.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.440
I didn't hear any of the things that you said

11:30.440 --> 11:31.260
to go for. What did you roll?

11:31.260 --> 11:32.100
25.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.720
Oh, what is your dexterity or athletics?

11:34.720 --> 11:35.560
More than that.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.000
Yes it is and with that,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.220
describe these two bigfoots falling please.

11:41.220 --> 11:43.760
It's just like a long beard

11:43.760 --> 11:48.760
and a kind of Neanderthal face with a hairy body

11:49.760 --> 11:52.880
but it's got, it's like a plastic troll doll underneath

11:52.880 --> 11:56.600
so it's pretty hard when it's coming at speed.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.440
Oh yeah.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.260
Flung.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.840
It's companion, same thing, much larger

12:01.840 --> 12:03.540
and I said it was stuffed, it's not.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.540
It's also got the big, hard troll body.

12:05.540 --> 12:09.860
And they're somersaulting through the air

12:09.860 --> 12:13.760
as if they're in a beautiful ballet in the sky.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.920
It's stuffed with trolls.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.160
Exactly, and the truth.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.160
I'm aiming for the dude.

12:20.160 --> 12:24.720
I wanna distract him so that he comes after us

12:24.720 --> 12:26.480
and we can save this woman's life.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.320
Fantastic.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.600
I'm aiming for the hole.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.080
Okay, one bigfoot, large one?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.640
I had the large one, yes.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.840
Goes directly, perfect hit, dude perfect

12:35.840 --> 12:40.160
from the top of the zeitgeist into the bottom of this hole

12:40.160 --> 12:42.440
and as it hits the bottom.

12:42.440 --> 12:46.280
Vincenti braces to be teleported back to non-existence.

12:47.240 --> 12:51.640
It bounces and then lands softly, lifelessly

12:51.640 --> 12:55.200
like a stuffed bigfoot that you might get at a carnival

12:55.200 --> 12:56.900
at the bottom of a dirt pit.

12:56.900 --> 13:00.400
And the other bigfoot knocks Dr. Brock Hargrave

13:00.400 --> 13:04.240
right in the hand as he pulls out a syringe, shatters it.

13:04.240 --> 13:08.720
I rolled combat for the woman who he was going for

13:08.720 --> 13:10.380
and Luke, what did I roll?

13:10.380 --> 13:14.520
You rolled what I assume is a critical success with a 22.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.880
And then I rolled damage for when she grabs the shovel.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.820
Right, she grabbed a shovel which I assume is a D8.

13:21.820 --> 13:24.400
So he rolled a D8 and he got an eight.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.720
Even up from like from up here, we can see it glistens.

13:27.720 --> 13:32.720
And the sharp tip goes directly in to the soft belly.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.360
That's where all the people are.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.360
Of Dr. Brock Hargrave.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.840
The extra soft belly.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.160
He falls to his knees.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.040
You see blood splattering out onto the ground.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.640
I need everyone to roll grip again for violence.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.880
Can Shelley celebrate?

13:49.880 --> 13:50.720
18.

13:50.720 --> 13:51.540
A custom.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.640
I am happy at this violence.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.880
Vincente goes, fucking excellent shot kid.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.060
And then he throws up.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.960
Lose one grip.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.800
For failing?

14:04.800 --> 14:05.620
For failing.

14:05.620 --> 14:06.460
Shelley lost.

14:06.460 --> 14:09.840
Lose one grip for failing as you also have

14:09.840 --> 14:12.880
just like a stomach turning reaction.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.160
That should have been me.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.920
Don't worry doc, there's a lot of professional rivals

14:21.920 --> 14:23.280
you might one day get to kill.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.480
I believe Jimmy Corrigan is.

14:25.480 --> 14:26.360
I thought he was adapted.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.360
That was actually a different character.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.760
So I rolled and passed which makes sense.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.220
Cause he's seen a lot of death.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.520
Seen a lot of death, seen a lot of blood.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.680
It continues to just ooze out

14:37.680 --> 14:41.400
and you see one of his intestines falls out of the hole

14:41.400 --> 14:43.600
onto the ground, dripping.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.800
And he's just kind of shaking violently on his knees

14:47.800 --> 14:48.640
and then he falls.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.280
I feel like we should go down there.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.920
But if Meadhope glances around the top of this observatory

14:53.920 --> 14:56.400
real quick, is there anything else of interest up here?

14:56.400 --> 14:57.360
What are you looking for?

14:57.360 --> 15:01.600
What about a length of rope that they used to hang aliens

15:01.600 --> 15:03.840
off the side of during the parties?

15:04.680 --> 15:07.640
Or perhaps a banner?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.120
A banner is good.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.160
Rush hour two style.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.040
Okay, we've had a couple of bad experiences

15:12.040 --> 15:13.720
but I think we're all getting pretty lazy.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.520
I think we can handle the stairs.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.000
Vincent has his eyes closed.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.540
I rolled a hundred.

15:25.540 --> 15:30.540
Oh, wait, I'm gonna use my, wait, what this word?

15:31.040 --> 15:31.880
That's a one.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.200
Ooh, he found a loophole.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.800
I'm gonna use my luck.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.160
He can make it a one?

15:37.160 --> 15:38.000
Yeah.

15:38.000 --> 15:38.820
Boom.

15:38.820 --> 15:39.660
Luck spent.

15:39.660 --> 15:40.480
Ooh, I like it.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.280
You only have half a luck, take mine.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.840
Vincent grabs half of a luck,

15:45.840 --> 15:49.200
forms it with his own half luck, spins it to...

15:49.200 --> 15:52.400
You almost fall head first into a closet, but then...

15:52.400 --> 15:57.320
Look at this industrial strength rope with climbing gear.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.600
Yeah, with a crit success,

15:59.600 --> 16:01.280
you just find like a fireman's ladder

16:01.320 --> 16:04.080
that's used for exactly this purpose.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.240
Yeah, it's in the closet.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.640
It's just in the back of the closet.

16:06.640 --> 16:07.480
You move some stuff out of the way.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.480
You have to clown fireman's ladder

16:08.480 --> 16:10.440
so it's shoved in there, but when you get it out.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.240
It goes to the ground, there's a hole in the ground.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.900
Yeah, because ladders are easier to go down than stairs.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.120
Everybody knows that.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.360
Right, less dangerous, more stable.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.280
Oh, you guys don't have to roll for a fireman's ladder.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.560
He does the, he presses the extendo release button

16:25.560 --> 16:28.040
on the fireman's ladder and it just shoots down

16:28.040 --> 16:29.880
to the bottom and I look at Mead Hook

16:29.880 --> 16:31.400
and say, get scuttling, kid.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.800
I scuttle.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.200
When I's told to scuttle, I scuttle.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.680
A tear forms in Jimmy's eyes and he's like,

16:39.680 --> 16:41.200
he didn't say shimmy.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.840
I need everyone shimmying down to roll.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.960
I'm taking the stairs.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.680
Alertness or dexterity.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.600
And if you're taking the stairs, do the same.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.880
Just an eight, a definite success.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.720
Success in here.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.440
Finally able to go up and or down.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.360
Something fashion to do just that.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.880
We get to use your hands and your feet on this one,

17:05.880 --> 17:06.720
so it's easier.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.400
I pass my scuttle.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.600
Scuttle.

17:11.600 --> 17:15.300
I pass my stairs, but I fail my alertness,

17:15.300 --> 17:17.040
which makes sense because I'm the only one

17:17.040 --> 17:18.720
going down the stairwell.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.560
I failed.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.400
Dead silent.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.640
Oh, I didn't roll alertness.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.080
Fail alert.

17:25.080 --> 17:25.920
Not alert.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.960
I'm focusing on safely scuttling.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.320
I pass alertness.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.180
Okay, as the four of you are heading down

17:34.180 --> 17:36.620
to the base of the zeitgeist,

17:36.620 --> 17:40.000
Jimmy Corrigan and the stairs all alone meet Hook

17:40.000 --> 17:42.720
and Vincent D'Bori focusing deeply

17:42.720 --> 17:44.800
on making their way down the pole.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.800
Scuttle, scuttle, scuttle.

17:45.800 --> 17:50.800
And Shelly St. Blythe, who is lively going down

17:51.440 --> 17:53.880
and you notice that there's a window actually

17:53.920 --> 17:56.320
out this side, just like a thin window

17:56.320 --> 17:57.680
going all the way down.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.560
So you've got a clear view as you head down

18:00.560 --> 18:03.740
this fireman's pole for not a single fireman in sight.

18:03.740 --> 18:06.560
And you see this woman just shaking,

18:06.560 --> 18:08.800
her hands covered in blood,

18:08.800 --> 18:12.160
and she kicks the body of Dr. Brock Hargrave

18:12.160 --> 18:15.240
into one of the holes and begins covering it

18:15.240 --> 18:17.400
with the mound of dirt that's next to it

18:17.400 --> 18:18.800
as fast as she can.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.520
Wait, we'll help you.

18:20.520 --> 18:21.760
We saw everything.

18:21.760 --> 18:22.600
What?

18:22.600 --> 18:23.440
You're all right.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.120
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.220
No one could have seen that.

18:28.220 --> 18:29.060
No one could have known.

18:29.060 --> 18:29.880
We're the good guys.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.480
Who the fuck are you?

18:31.480 --> 18:32.520
My name's Brandy.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.620
You're a fine girl.

18:33.620 --> 18:36.120
If you were worried about being incriminated,

18:36.120 --> 18:37.880
now I got more information.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.040
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.120
Brandy, it's okay.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.800
I'm just trying to teach you a little bit about the world

18:45.800 --> 18:47.800
as my dads did for me.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.440
Brandy, how'd this guy find you?

18:50.440 --> 18:54.160
We were just, we were just at a bar.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.680
Oh shit, shit, shit, where, where's, where's.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.400
Which bar did he find you at?

19:01.120 --> 19:01.960
The Iliad.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.560
Fuck, fuck, where's Brandon?

19:05.560 --> 19:06.480
Where's Brandon?

19:06.480 --> 19:08.000
Jimmy sighs deeply and he's like,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.960
your boyfriend's name is Brandon.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.880
Oh shit, my name's Brandy.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.920
Okay, I see, I hear it now.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.840
You never heard it before?

19:16.840 --> 19:18.720
Nobody ever thought that was weird?

19:19.720 --> 19:21.280
You're just now getting this.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.040
I didn't, no, it's not the time.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.040
It's not the time, but I also wanna say,

19:26.040 --> 19:27.400
Brandy, we don't know for sure

19:27.400 --> 19:28.840
that if you hadn't gutted that man,

19:28.840 --> 19:31.920
we couldn't have gotten Brandon safely out of there.

19:31.920 --> 19:32.960
Out of where?

19:32.960 --> 19:35.400
Yeah, he's in his stomach.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.960
We might as well try.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.880
And he brushes away some of the dirt

19:39.880 --> 19:42.600
and tries to open the stomach.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.280
Do you hop down into the?

19:44.280 --> 19:45.440
No, I peer in.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.160
Okay, so you're gonna have to like lay down

19:47.160 --> 19:48.360
on the ground to like. Sure.

19:48.880 --> 19:49.920
Okay, so you lay down on the ground

19:49.920 --> 19:53.880
with your arms outstretched down to the bottom of this pit.

19:53.880 --> 19:57.440
You're like pulling at the wound?

19:57.440 --> 20:01.320
Yeah, at the wound, I guess, yeah.

20:01.320 --> 20:05.160
Or like trying to, did I see him belly button pull?

20:05.160 --> 20:08.200
I mean, now there's a gash there

20:08.200 --> 20:10.520
where she stabbed him with the shovel.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.880
So it's really easy to do now.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.960
Yeah, I use that opening.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.240
Roll grip, because that's fucking gross.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.080
It is.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.920
40 on a 40.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.760
Damn.

20:22.760 --> 20:26.160
With his success, you lose no grip on reality

20:26.160 --> 20:28.400
as you have done this kind of shit before.

20:28.400 --> 20:33.400
And everyone kind of notices the like steady sure hand

20:33.960 --> 20:38.440
that Vincentibori is taking as he pulls apart the abdomen

20:38.440 --> 20:41.760
of Dr. Brock Hargrave inside of this pit.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.360
I worked at the old man's meat shop.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.680
I done it a hundred times, except on like animals, but.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.640
Intestines begin falling out.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.320
Blood is just covering your hands now, Vincenti.

20:52.320 --> 20:56.680
And you see there's a kidney's spleen.

20:56.680 --> 21:01.080
It's just like all just in your hands as you're reaching in.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.200
Yeah, there's no, there's no Brandon in here.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.040
What?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.880
She just throws up all over the ground.

21:07.880 --> 21:11.640
I thought he was just there.

21:11.640 --> 21:12.480
Starts crying.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.320
It's okay, Brandon.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.120
You kind of fucked this whole thing up for us, Brandy.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.800
I'm gonna touch her hair to calm her.

21:19.000 --> 21:19.840
It's okay.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.480
I seen people do this.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.960
Hey doctor, do you know anything

21:27.960 --> 21:29.440
about what's in that syringe?

21:29.440 --> 21:30.360
I'm almost there.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.200
Give me a moment.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.960
He's coming down the last few rungs.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.800
What did I miss?

21:35.800 --> 21:36.640
What did I miss?

21:36.640 --> 21:37.680
Oh, doc.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.720
Vincenti.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.240
They're not in his intestines.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.920
Eviscerated somebody.

21:43.080 --> 21:43.920
I see.

21:43.920 --> 21:44.760
It's okay though.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.240
He went to work in his old man's meat shop.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.200
I guess the intestines

21:47.200 --> 21:48.160
were already out. I did.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.920
So there was that.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.320
And I suppose you did not find the man inside there.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.600
No, Brandon, this is Brandy.

21:55.600 --> 21:56.640
Hey Brandy.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.400
And her boyfriend's name was Brandon.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.800
Yee-hoo!

21:59.800 --> 22:01.440
Brandy and Brandon, huh, yes.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.520
We all saw him go in there though.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.520
There's gotta be a trap door to this belly or something.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.720
I do wanna pick up that syringe and take a look at it.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.400
I've got 40 forensics.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.080
Is that something that would cover?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.000
It wouldn't, no.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.520
I've also got, oh no, I don't have-

22:15.520 --> 22:16.800
Oh, I have pharmacy.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.640
Yeah.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.400
Pharmacy will do it.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.960
Hold on.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.600
I've seen a syringe or two in my day.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.160
Let me take a look-see.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.880
Thank you, laughter.

22:30.880 --> 22:31.960
That's a 17.

22:31.960 --> 22:32.800
That'll do.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.360
Ooh.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.440
What does that mean?

22:35.440 --> 22:37.160
What's in the syringe?

22:37.160 --> 22:40.640
You kind of squirt some out the tip of the syringe

22:40.640 --> 22:43.640
and smell it and you know that it is

22:43.640 --> 22:48.640
some sort of a tranquilizer, like a horse tranquilizer,

22:48.920 --> 22:51.680
some like ketamine adjacent.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.520
So nothing supernatural.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.360
No.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.400
Hey, Rowan, are you still up in that tower?

22:56.400 --> 22:57.240
Yes, I am.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.240
Thank you for asking.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.680
God, why are you just the worst?

23:02.800 --> 23:03.960
So unambitious.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.800
Do you know anything about what's happening here?

23:06.800 --> 23:09.480
Rowan is just shaking their head vigorously,

23:09.480 --> 23:11.400
just back and forth.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.040
No, no, no.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.440
We could put it in him and see what it does

23:16.440 --> 23:17.840
and then he won't talk anymore.

23:17.840 --> 23:18.680
No.

23:18.680 --> 23:23.240
And you see that the face of Rowan kind of disappears

23:23.240 --> 23:24.720
as they walk backwards.

23:24.720 --> 23:28.080
Once you say an idea, we gotta do it.

23:28.080 --> 23:33.080
She shoves the needle in her hand, broken or not,

23:33.360 --> 23:34.360
into his arm.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.760
As he slides down the pole.

23:36.840 --> 23:41.160
Rowan walks up to the group and you shove the syringe

23:41.160 --> 23:44.200
into their arm and they're just like completely

23:44.200 --> 23:45.600
not ready for it.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.120
Completely caught off guard.

23:47.120 --> 23:47.960
It's all right.

23:47.960 --> 23:48.800
It's all right.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.960
I'm a raptor.

23:56.960 --> 23:57.840
Nobody panic.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.800
I don't think they're actually a raptor.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.000
I feel like a raptor.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.360
Okay.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.560
And Rowan is just like laughing, giggling,

24:06.560 --> 24:10.840
and then they just kind of go quiet, staring at the ground.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.520
I think he's just regular high.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.000
This is a Christian podcast,

24:15.000 --> 24:16.040
so we don't know what that's like.

24:16.040 --> 24:19.120
So you imagine you're a dinosaur, right?

24:19.120 --> 24:22.160
No, I mean, the only time I've done ketamine, the...

24:22.160 --> 24:27.160
You were a raptor?

24:27.440 --> 24:29.960
One of the people in the room thought he was a raptor,

24:29.960 --> 24:32.040
started jumping up on all the furniture

24:32.040 --> 24:34.920
with a couple of claws out, just kind of being a goober.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.520
That didn't have anything to do with the ketamine.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.720
That guy was probably just a raptor.

24:38.720 --> 24:42.400
With my arms, it's still inside Dr. Prock.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.520
So what the fuck do we do now?

24:45.520 --> 24:46.360
Well.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.640
This was the guy we were looking for.

24:47.640 --> 24:51.880
I mean, I guess we could just tell Ruth Moses Esther

24:51.880 --> 24:52.720
that we found him.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.800
It seems like mission accomplished, yes.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.320
I'm gonna give her a call.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.960
Oh, I don't have a cell phone, though.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.640
I like, yeah, I like kind of like nod my head to-

25:00.640 --> 25:02.520
Turn your head to the side like you just did.

25:02.520 --> 25:05.640
Yeah, nod my head to like where my back pocket,

25:05.640 --> 25:06.480
where my cell phone is.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.840
That's weird.

25:07.840 --> 25:12.840
I'm laying down on the ground with blood all over my hands.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.040
I grab the phone.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.600
I give her a ring.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.400
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.080
Vincenzi, Vincenzi, what's going on?

25:21.080 --> 25:26.080
Hello, it is me, Meat Hook, on the telephone.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.920
Great phone etiquette, kid.

25:28.920 --> 25:31.360
Yeah, so Meat Hook, is Vincenzi okay?

25:31.360 --> 25:32.200
Is everyone okay?

25:32.200 --> 25:33.280
Have you figured it out?

25:33.280 --> 25:35.160
Have you found Dr. Prock?

25:35.160 --> 25:36.800
We found him.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.520
Everyone is not okay.

25:39.520 --> 25:44.520
Dr. Hargrave's guts are outside his body.

25:44.560 --> 25:48.840
And, well, do you know anything about supernaturally

25:48.840 --> 25:51.720
putting people inside yourself?

25:51.720 --> 25:55.440
No, did you see anything like that occur?

25:55.440 --> 25:59.960
Or I assume that you could get inside.

25:59.960 --> 26:00.800
Do you know how it's done?

26:00.800 --> 26:01.960
Do you know how it's done?

26:01.960 --> 26:02.800
Did he tell you?

26:02.800 --> 26:04.600
Well, we can't get any information

26:04.640 --> 26:07.960
because he was murdered before we arrived here.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.120
Hold on, let me check his pulse.

26:10.120 --> 26:14.320
And I just kind of, don't move my hand for a little bit.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.880
Is there, do I feel a pulse?

26:16.880 --> 26:20.840
The blood has stopped like splooshing

26:20.840 --> 26:22.680
like at a heartbeats rate.

26:22.680 --> 26:26.400
Yeah, no, we can't ask him anything right now.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.720
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.560
So how, did you take him out?

26:30.560 --> 26:32.160
We met someone named Brandy.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.480
She's wearing club wear.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.520
And she's just, it was kind of self-defense.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.520
Brandy, are you there?

26:38.520 --> 26:40.360
Let me give her the phone.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.200
Oh shit.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.000
Cool, I enjoy talking to your own NBC.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.240
I like that he paused.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.040
So you wanted to rip off comedy bang bang, right?

26:51.040 --> 26:53.240
Until, all until you.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.280
Completely forgot.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.200
He paused to wait for a response.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.040
Was the deal.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.360
I would have to answer that.

26:58.360 --> 27:02.360
Let's see how it's done.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.600
Did you see anything strange or out of the ordinary

27:07.600 --> 27:08.720
throughout the process?

27:12.680 --> 27:14.080
She's useless, take her out.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.760
Like that's why they call it a handler.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.160
Take her out, out.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.800
Yeah, casualties are acceptable on this mission.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.320
If I didn't tell you that before,

27:24.320 --> 27:26.080
I think you should know by now.

27:26.120 --> 27:30.120
Hey, Meat Hook, I think it's time you prove yourself.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.080
No, I don't want to kill her.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.440
Good, you proved yourself.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.600
Ruth, how should we proceed?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.480
I mean, we found the target.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.760
I guess you bring her back here, I guess.

27:42.760 --> 27:46.440
And did you learn what he was trying to figure out?

27:46.440 --> 27:47.280
No.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.480
Shelly kind of walks up.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.960
Does lost in the fungus mean anything to you?

27:51.960 --> 27:53.280
To the fungus.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.400
I mean, yeah, I've heard people going missing,

27:56.400 --> 27:59.800
people talk about people getting lost in the fungus.

27:59.800 --> 28:00.640
Disappear.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.000
That's just an expression?

28:04.400 --> 28:05.880
It's common between the cowboys.

28:05.880 --> 28:09.280
It's an old city expression, yeah.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.640
Lazarus, you seem a bit agitated.

28:12.640 --> 28:13.720
You seem a bit agitated.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.520
No, everything is so clear now.

28:15.520 --> 28:19.400
You seem a bit more manic than when we last spoke.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.680
Manic because I'm on the right path

28:20.680 --> 28:21.960
doing all the right things.

28:22.440 --> 28:25.800
Is this the path that our mutual friends have set you on

28:25.800 --> 28:28.040
or is this a path of self-discovery?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.000
What's the difference?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.680
You take your directions from me

28:31.680 --> 28:34.120
because I am the handler, I'm in charge.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.320
It's possible she's become a raptor,

28:36.320 --> 28:37.600
if you know what I mean.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.880
I'm getting big raptor energy here.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.480
Hey, we never asked and we should have.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.760
Why did your place reek of cat piss when there were no cats?

28:45.760 --> 28:47.960
I've been trying to, I've been having to stay up,

28:47.960 --> 28:50.920
I've been having to stay up to take care of this mission.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.800
What does that have to do with cat piss?

28:52.800 --> 28:56.440
Oh, you've been buying from the strummers.

28:56.440 --> 28:57.840
Or producing.

28:57.840 --> 29:01.880
Okay, okay, oh, oh, oh, I'm all high and mighty.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.720
I've never done anything weird or bad

29:03.720 --> 29:06.240
that the dare officer would disapprove of in my life.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.600
I'm a fucking piece of shit square.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.680
Okay, like that's, we got to do with the things

29:11.680 --> 29:13.960
that the commission makes us have to do

29:13.960 --> 29:16.600
because I had to stay awake and I had to find the numbers

29:16.600 --> 29:20.200
and I had to figure it out and it's 836, 836.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.000
It's around holy cow farms and it's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.320
Hey, 836, we found holes that say that.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.840
I don't know if we should give her any more information.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.800
Yes, I feel that she may be compromised.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.640
That's what time we were supposed to meet.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.160
At the Bible study.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.320
Holy shit.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.360
That's right, that's right.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.240
That's some fucking good note taking.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.760
Hey, this is something that's not come up as players ever.

29:44.760 --> 29:48.720
What do you do when your Delta Green handler is insane?

29:49.240 --> 29:50.080
Who do you call?

29:52.120 --> 29:54.560
I mean, not the obvious answer to that question.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.720
Yeah, just the cops.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.880
The cops.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.080
I don't know what to do.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.160
Meat Hook, could you take her off speakerphone

30:05.160 --> 30:06.560
for just a second?

30:06.560 --> 30:07.400
Yeah.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.960
Don't take me off speakerphone.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.520
I'm sorry, Lazarus, Ruth, we need to have a sidebar.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.840
I already hung up on her.

30:13.840 --> 30:17.200
So I think we got to, I get up off the ground.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.120
I stopped playing with his guts.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.080
Wet hands.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.120
Maybe she knows something about the numbers though.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.360
Maybe that's a bigger clue.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.320
Eight, three, six.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.880
I don't know.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.520
Do you think there's anything to be learned

30:32.520 --> 30:34.320
at Trigate Supply?

30:35.280 --> 30:36.880
I guess not until the morning.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.240
Well, she wanted us to bring his body back,

30:42.240 --> 30:44.320
but that feels very incriminating.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.000
I mean, we didn't even kill him.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.320
Also, you should probably get all that blood

30:48.360 --> 30:49.600
off your hands, Vincente.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.360
He is also already in a hole.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.160
A whole lot of trouble.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.600
Usually I just do what she asked me to do

30:55.600 --> 30:58.360
and it's proven to be the best choice so far.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.280
So, I mean, I think we just-

31:01.280 --> 31:03.040
Vincente, you heard her.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.360
She's not the same person

31:04.360 --> 31:06.080
who was making those calls before.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.400
She's gone.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.320
She's not gone.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.880
We can help, maybe we can help her.

31:09.880 --> 31:10.720
Now that the mission's over.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.640
Maybe we have to eliminate her.

31:11.640 --> 31:12.800
Kill Ruth?

31:12.800 --> 31:14.480
She basically said it herself.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.960
This wasn't a mission, it's something she gave us.

31:16.960 --> 31:20.080
But she's the handler, the guys, the lizard people,

31:20.080 --> 31:22.040
whoever give it to her. Who handles the handler.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.840
I never asked and I never really cared.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.120
I think we take the body to her,

31:26.120 --> 31:27.960
we find out she probably knows about the numbers.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.120
What if enabling her enables something much worse?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.760
I'm not here to discern that.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.840
I'm here to do a job.

31:34.840 --> 31:38.040
Then we have to rethink this whole parenthood situation.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.400
What do you think, Shelly?

31:39.400 --> 31:42.360
Shelly's been kinda staring down in the hole at the body

31:42.360 --> 31:44.840
and he wants to jump down into the hole.

31:44.840 --> 31:45.680
Can you do that?

31:45.680 --> 31:46.520
Yeah.

31:46.920 --> 31:47.760
Look in the ear,

31:47.760 --> 31:49.120
cause he stuck his finger in his ear

31:49.120 --> 31:50.000
and then into his mouth.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.520
I wanna see if he got anything out of there.

31:52.520 --> 31:55.520
You smell it first when you kinda get down close

31:55.520 --> 31:57.520
to look inside.

31:57.520 --> 32:01.840
It's like a salty, horrible earwax smell

32:01.840 --> 32:05.680
mixed with like the ocean,

32:05.680 --> 32:07.520
mixed with like an earthy.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.520
Is it perhaps fungus-like?

32:09.520 --> 32:13.160
I mean, when something earthy

32:13.160 --> 32:16.640
is like mixed with the wet and the saline

32:16.640 --> 32:17.480
for long enough.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.920
Those are the conditions there, too.

32:19.920 --> 32:24.840
It's almost as if something might be growing.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.720
Comrades, down here please for your attention.

32:28.720 --> 32:33.720
There seems to be a growth of sorts in Hargrave's ear.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.440
I believe I found the aforementioned fungus

32:37.440 --> 32:38.560
that one gets lost in.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.120
Is it in his fucking brain?

32:40.120 --> 32:41.280
Be very careful, doctor.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.960
I can't tell how deep it goes,

32:43.640 --> 32:45.600
but it does look as though it's cultivated here.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.000
Can you get a sample?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.160
I will attempt to do so now.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.080
Do I need to roll?

32:52.080 --> 32:52.920
No.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.400
I think he pulls just a pin out of his pocket.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.360
No, just touch it.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.240
Yeah, just touch it, you fucking idiot.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.560
Use the little puppet hands.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.960
They'll fit right in there.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.400
I whip out Craig Mile.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.680
Craig Mile, I know this isn't your normal job.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.680
I need you now.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.600
You put a little lab coat and goggles on.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.320
Tiny little rubber gloves on the ends.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.760
And he maneuvers Craig Mile's hand in there

33:18.760 --> 33:21.400
and makes it do a perfect scooping motion.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.320
And pulls it out.

33:26.320 --> 33:29.840
And then he grabs a sandwich bag that he always has on him

33:29.840 --> 33:30.800
from after lunch.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.280
Yeah, of course.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.360
And scoops it into the bag.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.840
After lunch is my favorite of the before trilogy.

33:38.560 --> 33:42.200
Can we do a little experiment with that?

33:42.240 --> 33:43.080
What do you think?

33:43.080 --> 33:43.920
Hey, Rowan.

33:44.920 --> 33:49.920
Rowan looks up at you, bags so deep under the eyes,

33:50.560 --> 33:53.320
falling even heavier, seemingly,

33:53.320 --> 33:56.120
as these dead eyes look at you.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.960
It's time for a snack.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.800
I pass the bag up to Meat Hook here.

33:59.800 --> 34:00.640
Are you hungry?

34:00.640 --> 34:01.460
Yeah.

34:01.460 --> 34:02.300
There you go, Meat Hook.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.280
I do believe it is time for science.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.120
Okay.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.200
Shelly's also starting to get out of the hole

34:07.200 --> 34:10.320
and on his way out, he spits on the body of Hargrave.

34:10.320 --> 34:13.520
He steps on his nose.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.360
I'm gonna, when you're picking up dog poop

34:18.360 --> 34:20.720
and you put your hand on the outside of the plastic bag,

34:20.720 --> 34:23.440
but don't touch what's inside, but reversed.

34:24.760 --> 34:28.720
And I'm gonna put just a little bit into his mouth.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.560
Okay.

34:32.080 --> 34:32.920
Hey, Becca.

34:34.460 --> 34:35.300
Thanks.

34:40.680 --> 34:42.280
Meat Hook is the closest

34:47.640 --> 34:52.340
to Rowan when this happens.

34:53.200 --> 34:57.040
And as the substance that was in the ear

34:57.040 --> 35:01.040
of Dr. Brock Hargrave touches the mouth

35:01.040 --> 35:06.040
and goes into the esophagus of Rowan Fitzpatrick.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.680
Meat Hook, you are overcome with a need,

35:09.720 --> 35:14.720
a feverish, rabid desire to get in the belly

35:15.880 --> 35:20.240
of Rowan Fitzpatrick by any means necessary.

35:20.240 --> 35:24.880
I need you to roll power at a negative 40

35:24.880 --> 35:26.120
to fight against this.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.280
Oof, get in my belly.

35:28.280 --> 35:33.120
Yeah, I'm gonna get in that belly.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.320
Kid, don't do it.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.520
What are you talking about?

35:35.520 --> 35:36.360
I'm gonna get in.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.200
It's my creep now.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.040
It is really.

35:38.040 --> 35:41.080
My dads highly advise you against getting in that belly.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.640
Okay, so I rolled a 35.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.960
My power is a 60.

35:47.860 --> 35:50.320
But you needed me to roll a 20 or below.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.160
I did.

35:51.160 --> 35:53.000
Oh, man.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.080
So I just start digging in that belly button

35:57.960 --> 36:02.480
to make a little spot, a little basement nest,

36:02.480 --> 36:04.480
if you will, for a rat curl.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.040
I can't lose another daughter.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.840
We've got a basement nest for you here.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.360
Basement creep now.

36:09.360 --> 36:12.120
Remember how repulsed you were by this person earlier.

36:12.120 --> 36:15.240
So we are going to go into combat order here,

36:15.240 --> 36:17.700
which is in order of dexterity.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.640
So call out your dexterity, please.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.480
70.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.320
50.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.140
50.

36:22.140 --> 36:22.980
65.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.400
Okay, so it's gonna start with Meat Hook,

36:25.400 --> 36:28.160
go to Vincenty, and then because we're already

36:28.160 --> 36:30.280
going that way, we'll go Shelly and then Jimmy.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.040
And with that, Meat Hook,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.760
you are fighting tooth and nail

36:35.760 --> 36:39.920
to get inside Rowan Fitzpatrick.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.520
Hell yes, I am.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.080
This is the answer I've been waiting for all my life.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.200
Who would have ever thought Rowan Fitzpatrick

36:46.200 --> 36:47.280
would hold it?

36:47.280 --> 36:50.680
But now I need to know what's in there.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.240
And I just try and rip it open.

36:54.240 --> 36:58.680
Yeah, and because you did the syringe, there's no contest.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.480
So if you succeed, you succeed.

37:00.480 --> 37:04.760
I rolled a 77 and I needed a 50, so that's a crit fail.

37:04.760 --> 37:05.760
Oh, shit.

37:06.880 --> 37:09.040
So is that, that might be good for us.

37:09.040 --> 37:09.860
I don't know.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.120
That depends on your goal.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.220
It definitely depends on your goal.

37:15.220 --> 37:19.400
With a critical failure, as you are desperately

37:19.400 --> 37:24.400
trying to crawl into the stomach area of Rowan Fitzpatrick,

37:24.680 --> 37:28.000
you slip and one of, your hand reaches out

37:28.000 --> 37:30.840
and just goes directly soft through,

37:30.840 --> 37:33.960
like you're putting your hand into a bowl of jello,

37:33.960 --> 37:37.600
just like into the middle of Rowan Fitzpatrick.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.000
And you hold on, and I need you to roll a grip

37:41.000 --> 37:45.780
as you hold on to this weird kind of like bouncy,

37:45.780 --> 37:48.920
synthetic feeling substance on the other side.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.240
Zach is in grip to me in grip.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.120
88 would be a crit fail.

37:53.120 --> 37:57.880
Holy shit, wow.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.640
All right, okay.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.600
So two crit fails in a row.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.040
No.

38:07.040 --> 38:08.760
Oh, that means you get slimed.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.080
Click the button.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.040
It's not working.

38:16.760 --> 38:21.760
So I need you to, well, I was gonna have you roll a D8

38:22.640 --> 38:27.080
and add one for your grip loss, but when you crit fail,

38:27.080 --> 38:29.360
you just take the maximum.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.560
So that's nine.

38:30.560 --> 38:31.480
Okay.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.280
So you lose nine grip in one fell swoop,

38:34.280 --> 38:38.280
which means that you are on a temporary loss

38:38.280 --> 38:40.120
of yourself from reality.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.320
We weren't there already?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.160
Okay.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.840
I just start humming Mamma Mia.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.920
And is it because you have three dads now?

38:50.920 --> 38:51.760
Yeah, exactly.

38:51.760 --> 38:52.680
Yes, exactly.

38:56.680 --> 38:57.520
Genius.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.920
You feel a hand reach out and grab your wrist.

39:02.920 --> 39:03.760
Holy shit.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.800
Oh, my friend, you found me.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.640
Brandon, I'm coming.

39:09.640 --> 39:10.480
I'm coming.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.320
I'm coming.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.160
I'm coming.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.000
I'm coming.

39:13.000 --> 39:13.840
I'm coming.

39:13.840 --> 39:14.680
I'm coming.

39:14.680 --> 39:15.520
I'm coming.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.360
I'm coming.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.440
Brandon, I'm coming.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.920
And now it is the turn of Vincenty Bory.

39:22.920 --> 39:27.920
You've got Meat Hook up to one elbow in Rowan Fitzpatrick,

39:28.440 --> 39:30.200
a normal role-playing sentence.

39:32.920 --> 39:36.080
Vincenty's thinking when Hargrave died,

39:36.080 --> 39:39.280
his portal belly went away.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.200
She's how far in?

39:41.200 --> 39:42.040
Just an arm?

39:42.040 --> 39:43.080
Elbow, yep, single elbow.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.480
Meat Hook, I'm so fucking sorry.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.520
And I pull my revolver out

39:47.520 --> 39:51.120
and I want to shoot Rowan in the face.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.120
You have good firearms?

39:52.120 --> 39:53.320
I got good firearms.

39:55.040 --> 39:55.880
Okay.

39:55.880 --> 39:56.720
What?

39:56.720 --> 39:57.560
Strong choice.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.560
Go ahead and roll firearms.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.080
I do not pass my firearms.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.640
85 on a 50.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.840
You didn't have good firearms.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.480
50's like I went to college

40:10.480 --> 40:13.040
and got a doctorate in firearms.

40:13.040 --> 40:13.880
No.

40:16.960 --> 40:17.800
According to the rules.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.000
I think according to the rule book,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.600
a 50 would be above a college degree in something.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.680
It's firearms.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.360
I forgot to load my fucking revolver

40:27.720 --> 40:31.560
in this particular chamber.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.400
That's an out that doesn't kill Meat Hook.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.400
And your turn's over.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.360
And we move on to Shelly Seamblithe.

40:37.360 --> 40:40.200
Shelly sees that Meat Hook is going in

40:40.200 --> 40:42.240
so he wants to grab a leg.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.720
He's pulling back the other way.

40:43.720 --> 40:44.560
Tug of war.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.400
Yep, tug of war time.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.080
That's a way more logical move.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.680
As you roll strength.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.120
My basement creep, you're coming with us.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
I rolled an eight.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.280
Oh, that is good if it wasn't in a contest.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.840
Yep, hold on.

41:00.880 --> 41:01.760
Yeah, I did that math right.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.480
Okay, I've got an 80 firearms and an 85 strength.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.720
So I'm going to join Shelly.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.440
I was going to say, I just passed with a 24.

41:07.440 --> 41:10.800
So you can add your success onto the eight

41:10.800 --> 41:12.960
to try to beat a 24.

41:12.960 --> 41:13.960
It's a 96.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.000
Oh no.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.640
Doesn't an eight beat a 24?

41:17.640 --> 41:18.480
It's got to be.

41:18.480 --> 41:19.480
Not in a contest.

41:19.480 --> 41:20.480
Yeah, if it's a contest,

41:20.480 --> 41:23.760
you have to roll higher under the score.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.160
The worst critical thing.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.440
Higher under?

41:26.440 --> 41:28.120
Your rules are nutty.

41:28.120 --> 41:28.960
It's blackjack rules.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.240
That's what Thomas keeps saying.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.120
Yeah, I don't like them either.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.680
But they're not our rules.

41:34.680 --> 41:36.200
Because you're telling the dice to roll low.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.840
You know, you can't tell the dice two things.

41:37.840 --> 41:38.680
I know, exactly.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.760
You got to tell the dice to roll as high as possible

41:41.600 --> 41:42.440
while still being a success.

41:42.440 --> 41:46.080
But it makes sense because if you have a higher level skill,

41:46.080 --> 41:49.760
you can roll a higher number and still win.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.320
Yeah, but it feels weird.

41:52.920 --> 41:53.760
You're not wrong.

41:53.760 --> 41:56.880
I've been on Zach's side this whole time.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.040
But holy shit, that's not good.

41:59.040 --> 42:01.760
So yeah, Thomas did the crit-est of crit fails

42:01.760 --> 42:02.600
in our own rules.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.040
Yeah, I didn't roll a 69.

42:04.040 --> 42:07.560
I rolled a 96 trying to pull you out with.

42:07.560 --> 42:08.760
Not nice.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.120
That's like two angry people

42:10.120 --> 42:11.640
that don't even want to look at each other.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.920
Yeah, they're not pleasuring each other orally.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.720
They're farting on each other with their backs turned.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.680
Yeah, they're sleeping in fetal positions

42:19.680 --> 42:20.920
in opposite directions.

42:20.920 --> 42:21.940
One's upside down.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.640
Angry in it, opposite end of the bed.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.720
Meat Hook is gonna-

42:28.720 --> 42:29.680
I'm gonna turn my back to you.

42:29.680 --> 42:34.680
Grab onto this hand that she found inside the belly.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.040
I kind of want to try and pull the hand out,

42:37.080 --> 42:41.120
but I'm wondering if the need to go inside the belly

42:41.120 --> 42:42.480
has changed at all.

42:42.480 --> 42:45.680
Or if my crit fail means I'm just jumping on it.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.080
I love the pulling at the hand.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.200
Yeah, that's fun.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.640
Hold on, what's in here?

42:50.640 --> 42:53.680
What grip did you have and what was your breaking point?

42:53.680 --> 42:54.520
Oh.

42:54.520 --> 42:55.340
I'm not at the breaking point yet.

42:55.340 --> 42:57.280
That's right, but you rolled over five.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.120
So we're gonna actually go-

42:59.120 --> 43:01.360
I'm sorry, I completely missed that.

43:01.360 --> 43:02.200
Basically at this point what we do-

43:02.200 --> 43:03.840
I'll be the DM for a minute.

43:03.840 --> 43:04.880
Thank you.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.560
At this point, we roll a D6

43:07.560 --> 43:12.480
and we put in order fight, flight, or freeze.

43:12.480 --> 43:15.240
And so if you think that Meat Hook

43:15.240 --> 43:17.240
would be most likely to fight,

43:17.240 --> 43:21.400
you put that at the top and that would be four, five, and six.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.840
You text flight to fight to four, five, six.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.080
Four, two, oh, six, nine, six, nine.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.560
And if you think it's second-

43:26.560 --> 43:28.200
Wait, no, it only gets two numbers.

43:28.200 --> 43:29.040
Five and six.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.360
And then the second most likely that you think

43:31.360 --> 43:34.280
if you roll a two or a three,

43:34.720 --> 43:35.560
then you do that one.

43:35.560 --> 43:37.480
And then the last one that you think is the least likely

43:37.480 --> 43:38.320
is just a one.

43:38.320 --> 43:41.720
You mean given my insanity what's most and least likely?

43:41.720 --> 43:42.560
That is correct.

43:42.560 --> 43:45.000
Okay, well flight means crawling in this belly.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.720
So that's the most likely.

43:46.720 --> 43:47.560
Okay.

43:47.560 --> 43:50.920
Fight is probably her natural inclination.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.000
So that's next.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.640
And then freeze, yeah, that's the least likely.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.520
Okay, that's perfect.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.040
Oh no. It's a five.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.840
Five is flight.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.280
We jump on it.

44:01.280 --> 44:04.360
I take the hand and I let the hand pull me

44:04.360 --> 44:06.520
as I just relax my body.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.240
Yeah.

44:09.240 --> 44:12.840
You all see Meat Hook fully engulfed

44:12.840 --> 44:15.880
by the midriff of Rowan Fitzpatrick.

44:15.880 --> 44:17.520
I need you all to roll grip.

44:17.520 --> 44:18.760
Completely inside?

44:18.760 --> 44:22.680
As she disappears from view entirely.

44:22.680 --> 44:25.080
You see a steel-tipped boot

44:25.080 --> 44:30.080
with a lot of extra studs and spikes stuck out of it.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.200
Kind of get caught on the edge of the skull buckle

44:33.200 --> 44:34.560
and then before going in.

44:36.280 --> 44:41.160
I am not okay with seeing our new adoptive child

44:41.160 --> 44:43.200
sucked up into that man's belly.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.600
This is fish face all over again.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.440
Did I mention I'm 27?

44:45.440 --> 44:46.400
It's okay though.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.440
I failed.

44:49.720 --> 44:50.960
How old were you when your parents

44:50.960 --> 44:53.760
dropped you off at the place?

44:53.760 --> 44:54.800
Seven.

44:54.800 --> 44:55.640
Oh, okay.

44:55.640 --> 44:56.880
20 years in the hole.

44:56.880 --> 44:59.120
So that's where I'm stuck mentally, you know?

45:00.120 --> 45:02.960
So then fish face is still very problematic.

45:02.960 --> 45:03.800
Oh yeah.

45:03.800 --> 45:04.640
Oh yeah.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.000
Well, no one ever debated that.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.280
Joe, how did Shelly St. Blythe do that?

45:10.280 --> 45:11.360
I passed.

45:11.360 --> 45:13.440
Okay, so the single pass here on the grip.

45:13.440 --> 45:17.440
You only lose one with the disappearance of Meat Hook.

45:17.440 --> 45:21.920
The other two of you, I need you to roll a D6 and add one.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.720
So when, fuck.

45:24.720 --> 45:27.200
That's an eight for me.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.840
Puts me past, well past my breaking point.

45:28.840 --> 45:30.960
How could it be A is D6 plus one?

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
You said plus two, I thought.

45:31.960 --> 45:33.000
Oh, sure.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.080
He did not.

45:34.080 --> 45:37.160
Oh, well a seven still puts me past my breaking point.

45:37.160 --> 45:39.360
And a temporary grip loss.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.680
Teacher, didn't we have a quiz?

45:40.680 --> 45:42.560
No, I never fucking said we had a quiz.

45:43.960 --> 45:46.440
When Corrigan failed his, Extreme failed

45:46.440 --> 45:48.980
his strength check, I think he fell backwards

45:48.980 --> 45:49.820
and it knocked me off.

45:49.820 --> 45:52.640
I was gonna say, yeah, we didn't ever resolve that.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.680
Cause I was still holding on to her leg,

45:54.680 --> 45:56.880
but we'll say that I am not now.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.120
No, you definitely fell back.

45:58.600 --> 46:00.760
Along with the critical failure there.

46:00.760 --> 46:03.520
I lost four grip, but I'm still well above

46:03.520 --> 46:04.360
my breaking point.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.020
Okay, and with four, you don't need to fight

46:06.020 --> 46:08.460
flight or freeze, however.

46:08.460 --> 46:11.340
I'm going fight, fight, freeze.

46:11.340 --> 46:12.680
You said D6 plus one?

46:12.680 --> 46:13.500
Yes, I did.

46:13.500 --> 46:14.340
So I lost five.

46:14.340 --> 46:15.860
And you're gonna do the same.

46:15.860 --> 46:16.700
Freeze.

46:16.700 --> 46:17.520
Freeze.

46:17.520 --> 46:21.240
Fincenzi Bori freezes in his tracks, unable to move.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.440
Lost in thought.

46:22.440 --> 46:25.640
Jimmy Corrigan fights, he fucking thrusts

46:25.640 --> 46:28.640
both arms into the belly of Rowan.

46:28.640 --> 46:33.100
And as you do so, I need you to roll a D4 minus one

46:33.100 --> 46:33.940
for damage.

46:35.680 --> 46:36.800
That made a cool noise.

46:36.800 --> 46:37.640
Two.

46:37.640 --> 46:39.140
Two minus one?

46:39.140 --> 46:40.120
Two minus one is one?

46:40.120 --> 46:40.960
No, no, no.

46:42.720 --> 46:45.080
And so with a two hit point loss,

46:45.080 --> 46:48.200
you just punch with both fists into the stomach.

46:48.200 --> 46:50.360
The abs you feel just like, oh,

46:50.360 --> 46:53.680
you get a slight response out of Rowan for the first time.

46:53.680 --> 46:58.080
And then it's just, and then just continues

46:58.080 --> 47:00.120
to just dead eyes look at the ground.

47:00.120 --> 47:01.180
Where's that ear fungus?

47:01.180 --> 47:03.220
Give me that fucking ear fungus.

47:03.220 --> 47:05.800
Is the bag that had the fungus lying anywhere?

47:05.800 --> 47:08.240
That would be on the ground.

47:08.240 --> 47:10.040
I'll use my luck to have dropped it.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.880
Yeah, no, I think you could have dropped it.

47:11.880 --> 47:13.160
I like that, I like that.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.560
We'll let it ride.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.480
So you've dropped it on the ground there,

47:16.480 --> 47:21.200
but I actually at this point need a roll.

47:21.200 --> 47:24.800
I need a con roll from Meat Hook.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.640
Oh.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.840
Oh, pass, 49 under 50.

47:30.840 --> 47:34.120
What wonders is she going to see in there?

47:34.120 --> 47:37.460
You're not sure about anything that's been happening

47:37.460 --> 47:40.720
so far, Jimmy Corrigan, but you do know that

47:40.720 --> 47:44.400
when you punch the stomach of Rowan Fitzpatrick,

47:44.400 --> 47:49.400
they explode like in half.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.920
Exactly where you punch, just like right at the midriff,

47:51.920 --> 47:54.760
exactly where Meat Hook just went in.

47:54.760 --> 47:58.400
They just, something like as if the building

47:58.400 --> 48:01.800
was being dropped, but all the detonation spots

48:01.800 --> 48:03.800
were like halfway through.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.440
It just boom, and then the top half just kind of falls

48:06.440 --> 48:10.240
a little bit, slump, slop on slop, human inside

48:10.240 --> 48:11.560
on human inside.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.660
And the top half falls, and then the knees fall,

48:15.660 --> 48:18.680
just like when you shot people in the dick in GoldenEye.

48:18.680 --> 48:20.320
Do I need to roll a grip for that?

48:20.320 --> 48:21.160
Yeah.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.520
Uh, that's a fail.

48:23.520 --> 48:26.800
I need grip checks from the other two of you as well.

48:26.800 --> 48:28.160
Jesus.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.220
I pass.

48:29.220 --> 48:31.520
One grip loss with a pass.

48:31.520 --> 48:35.120
I'm going to death of a thousand cuts, lose my mind.

48:35.120 --> 48:37.720
Again, 1d4 plus one.

48:37.720 --> 48:39.320
I crit failed.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.720
That's five again.

48:40.720 --> 48:41.560
Awesome.

48:42.860 --> 48:44.280
I also, five.

48:45.640 --> 48:46.480
Jesus.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.840
Absolutely meltdown.

48:51.840 --> 48:54.320
So what Jimmy Corrigan does is-

48:54.320 --> 48:56.360
I hit a breaking point again.

48:56.360 --> 48:58.960
He grabs the syringe of ketamine,

48:58.960 --> 49:01.760
and he's going to try to inject it into the nearest person.

49:01.760 --> 49:04.800
Okay, let's roll and see who the nearest person is.

49:04.800 --> 49:08.360
It is just three other people standing here now.

49:08.360 --> 49:12.960
It is Vincenzi Bori, Shelly St. Blythe, and-

49:12.960 --> 49:13.800
Brandy.

49:13.800 --> 49:14.620
Brandy.

49:14.620 --> 49:15.600
Oh, Brandy's still here?

49:16.600 --> 49:17.840
What the fuck?

49:18.880 --> 49:19.720
Oh my God.

49:20.880 --> 49:22.600
I thought we were going to have to kill one of the dads

49:22.600 --> 49:24.840
to save the child, but unfortunately I-

49:24.840 --> 49:27.000
She runs off into the woods.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.440
I athletics, I run after her.

49:29.440 --> 49:32.080
As you tackle her into the ground

49:32.080 --> 49:33.440
and you're doing what now?

49:33.440 --> 49:35.200
Injecting that ketamine.

49:35.200 --> 49:36.020
Yep.

49:36.020 --> 49:39.080
You do so, and she like almost immediately

49:39.080 --> 49:41.480
just like falls unconscious.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.320
It's okay.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.880
Where you're going is probably a better place.

49:44.880 --> 49:45.760
We're not going to punch you.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.020
We're not going to make you explode,

49:47.020 --> 49:48.520
but we got to get our daughter back.

49:48.520 --> 49:51.240
And well, you know, sorry.

49:51.240 --> 49:55.460
And he walks back to the ear fungus and eats a little bit.

49:55.460 --> 49:56.300
Wait.

49:56.300 --> 49:57.120
Well, before he does that, he-

49:57.120 --> 49:57.960
Too late.

49:57.960 --> 49:58.800
Oh my God.

49:58.800 --> 49:59.620
He said it.

49:59.620 --> 50:00.460
He just fucking said it.

50:00.460 --> 50:01.280
He said it.

50:01.280 --> 50:02.120
Well, wait a minute.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.920
I mean, one of us has to eat some to get in there, right?

50:04.920 --> 50:05.760
We can't-

50:05.760 --> 50:06.580
No.

50:06.580 --> 50:07.420
You think we can feed it to her?

50:07.420 --> 50:08.780
If it goes in her mouth.

50:08.780 --> 50:10.640
Have we seen anybody open a portal?

50:10.640 --> 50:11.480
Oh, we did.

50:11.480 --> 50:12.320
That's what this whole thing is.

50:12.320 --> 50:13.400
That's what just happened.

50:13.400 --> 50:14.740
Well, I'm insane.

50:15.640 --> 50:16.800
I feel like once you say a thing,

50:16.800 --> 50:18.360
the thing can't be unsaid.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.280
He walks away from her.

50:20.280 --> 50:25.080
He kind of eats her and then eats the whole thing himself.

50:25.080 --> 50:26.640
I thought that's how it worked.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.720
I mean, that is what Dr. Brock Hargrave did.

50:29.720 --> 50:31.200
Exactly.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.280
So if your goal is to open yourself up,

50:33.280 --> 50:35.440
perhaps that would be the way of doing it.

50:36.880 --> 50:37.720
Yeah.

50:37.720 --> 50:39.440
He eats it and he says,

50:39.440 --> 50:41.620
save our baby girl.

50:41.620 --> 50:42.880
And he looks at you too.

50:44.240 --> 50:45.720
That doesn't make sense, does it?

50:45.720 --> 50:48.320
Should we just rerecord me feeding it to her?

50:48.320 --> 50:49.280
That's why it's funny.

50:49.280 --> 50:50.400
I think it makes sense

50:50.400 --> 50:52.640
because you don't have all your wits about you.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.680
Yeah, I think it absolutely makes sense

50:54.680 --> 50:56.400
that you're walking back to them

50:56.400 --> 50:58.360
as you put it in your mouth.

50:59.320 --> 51:01.840
Vincenty also does not have his wits about him.

51:01.840 --> 51:02.660
With that-

51:02.660 --> 51:05.720
I give you the ketamine, I take the earwax.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.640
And I need a power roll at a negative 40

51:07.640 --> 51:09.480
from Vincenty Bory.

51:09.480 --> 51:12.060
I've got a pretty good chance here.

51:12.060 --> 51:13.260
A 20 on a five.

51:17.740 --> 51:19.620
It's like a primal urge.

51:19.620 --> 51:22.240
It's like a hunger deep within you.

51:22.240 --> 51:26.500
You feel just like completely drawn without hesitation.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.580
Vincenty gets in like the-

51:29.580 --> 51:30.420
Let me be clear,

51:30.420 --> 51:32.660
to crawl into the stomach of Jimmy Corrigan

51:32.660 --> 51:34.260
is what you feel like doing.

51:34.260 --> 51:37.000
Vincenty gets in position like you would

51:37.000 --> 51:39.160
at the beginning of a track race.

51:42.620 --> 51:45.220
And takes off sprinting

51:45.220 --> 51:49.220
and is gonna try to just dive head first into the stomach.

51:52.820 --> 51:55.260
Jimmy Corrigan, how are you responding to this?

51:55.260 --> 51:57.660
I like make myself a bigger target

51:57.660 --> 52:00.620
and I say, you go get our girl.

52:00.620 --> 52:02.180
Holy shit.

52:05.060 --> 52:08.180
Oh yeah, I need a con check from Jimmy Corrigan.

52:08.180 --> 52:09.660
Like a really important one.

52:13.060 --> 52:14.180
Pass.

52:15.300 --> 52:16.860
That's good.

52:16.860 --> 52:18.620
Vincenty takes off

52:18.620 --> 52:21.200
and as his feet leave the ground

52:21.200 --> 52:23.340
and his head is heading towards the stomach,

52:23.340 --> 52:25.480
he just says, I'm not real anyway,

52:25.480 --> 52:27.100
so it don't fucking matter.

52:27.100 --> 52:27.940
I'm coming.

52:29.020 --> 52:31.980
And through the torso of Jimmy Corrigan,

52:31.980 --> 52:34.700
Vincenty Bory just disappears.

52:34.700 --> 52:39.700
I'm pulling that out

52:40.700 --> 52:42.660
and using it for all the previous ones.

52:44.580 --> 52:45.420
You're welcome.

52:46.460 --> 52:50.540
Jimmy Corrigan, you are completely gripless.

52:50.540 --> 52:51.360
In Seattle.

52:53.100 --> 52:54.260
Should I say Blythe?

52:54.260 --> 52:55.340
We are at the Space Needle.

52:55.340 --> 52:56.940
Go ahead and roll a grip for me.

52:59.260 --> 53:00.420
Hey, I passed that one.

53:00.420 --> 53:03.020
Okay, so you just lose one again.

53:03.100 --> 53:04.820
It's all good here.

53:04.820 --> 53:06.340
I'm just nodding enthusiastically.

53:06.340 --> 53:11.180
I'm like, Shelley, we're gonna get our daughter back.

53:18.780 --> 53:20.580
I need to know what the two of you

53:20.580 --> 53:22.860
who have just left yourselves alone.

53:22.860 --> 53:26.820
There is one dead body in a hole in the ground

53:26.820 --> 53:29.360
that is like not covered up.

53:29.360 --> 53:34.360
There is a exploded kid on the ground halved

53:35.960 --> 53:40.500
and then there's an unconscious woman off to the side

53:40.500 --> 53:43.360
down the path heading back to the parking lot

53:43.360 --> 53:46.160
and the two of you are just looking at each other.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.100
How does it feel?

53:47.100 --> 53:50.440
I mean, a little jiggly, I guess.

53:50.440 --> 53:52.520
I really thought stabbing her with ketamine

53:52.520 --> 53:54.480
would do something else.

53:54.480 --> 53:55.320
Oh, I could tell.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.600
I thought maybe you got mixed up on who was who.

53:57.600 --> 53:59.080
I got mixed up, I got mixed up.

53:59.680 --> 54:00.960
I thought she was one of the dads.

54:00.960 --> 54:01.880
I understand.

54:01.880 --> 54:03.600
Luke and Joe, could you guys take off

54:03.600 --> 54:04.640
your headphones real quick?

54:04.640 --> 54:05.660
Yeah.

54:05.660 --> 54:10.400
Hey, Thomas, Jimmy's never felt anything like that ever

54:10.400 --> 54:14.600
and it was like the coolest, best feeling

54:14.600 --> 54:15.900
that you've ever had.

54:16.920 --> 54:17.800
Oh no.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.200
I'm just saying.

54:19.200 --> 54:21.540
Okay, yeah.

54:21.540 --> 54:22.840
Should we bird him?

54:22.840 --> 54:24.120
Yeah, they can be birded.

54:24.120 --> 54:24.960
Love the bird.

54:26.040 --> 54:27.700
Wait, unbird, I'm sorry.

54:29.800 --> 54:30.640
D-bird.

54:30.640 --> 54:31.480
D-bird, D-bird.

54:31.480 --> 54:32.580
D-bird, D-bird, D-bird.

54:32.580 --> 54:36.040
If I eat more, he will want to come into my belly.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.880
Oh, you've lost enough grip now.

54:37.880 --> 54:40.440
Yeah, you're pretty sure how this works now.

54:40.440 --> 54:43.000
So basically when you eat the substance,

54:43.000 --> 54:46.440
the person closest to you seemingly

54:46.440 --> 54:48.260
wants to get in your belly.

54:48.260 --> 54:49.320
Okay, okay, okay.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.720
So yeah, bird, bird.

54:51.720 --> 54:53.360
That's not the bird.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.000
I'm doing it quickly and I have dice in my hands.

54:56.960 --> 54:59.080
I wonder why he just went thumbs like that.

55:01.080 --> 55:02.960
Shelley, how does it feel?

55:02.960 --> 55:05.560
It feels fantastic to be a family.

55:06.860 --> 55:10.840
And you notice he's starting to like nibble

55:10.840 --> 55:13.040
a little bit more out of the plastic bag.

55:13.040 --> 55:15.100
It's time that you joined us.

55:16.360 --> 55:19.800
Joe, just looking at Zach like, help me.

55:19.800 --> 55:22.400
I've never seen such a help me look ever.

55:22.400 --> 55:25.520
I didn't know if my sanity loss makes me want to do this.

55:25.880 --> 55:26.840
I think with the passing,

55:26.840 --> 55:30.000
I'm going to let you keep your wits about you enough.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.320
But I mean, obviously this is chipping away

55:32.320 --> 55:34.480
your ability to sense reality.

55:34.480 --> 55:35.660
Okay, I eat a little more.

55:35.660 --> 55:38.000
No, I'm not hungry, sorry.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.920
No, no, Shelley, you don't have to eat any.

55:40.920 --> 55:42.520
But aren't you hungry for family?

55:42.520 --> 55:45.300
I mean, I miss Meat Hook, of course.

55:45.300 --> 55:48.240
And Chedi, I didn't know him terribly well,

55:48.240 --> 55:50.040
but he seemed nice.

55:50.040 --> 55:53.640
But no, I don't want to go inside of you to find them.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.640
That's where our little basement troll is.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.480
They haven't returned and I don't know if I will return.

55:58.480 --> 56:01.040
I firmly placed my hands on his shoulders.

56:01.040 --> 56:02.200
You want to get in there.

56:02.200 --> 56:05.760
I don't want to get inside of you, Jimmy.

56:06.760 --> 56:09.440
It's so cool in here, doctor.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.360
My belly button like whistles.

56:14.680 --> 56:17.480
But also you just hear that in your head.

56:17.480 --> 56:19.080
She's calling for you, doc.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.880
That's the real Bigfoot.

56:20.880 --> 56:23.440
Basement creep, basement creep, is that you?

56:23.440 --> 56:24.800
It's me.

56:24.800 --> 56:29.280
They've got so many types of rocks in here.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.400
Rocks.

56:30.400 --> 56:31.240
There's a lot of rocks in here, doc.

56:31.240 --> 56:34.800
Igneous, the, limestone.

56:34.800 --> 56:35.800
Limestone.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.480
I mean, it's your head telling you this,

56:37.480 --> 56:41.080
so it's rattling off all the rocks that you love most.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.520
Igneous, limestone.

56:42.520 --> 56:43.360
The.

56:46.640 --> 56:49.760
Stand back, cannon ball.

56:49.760 --> 56:54.760
So, yeah.

56:58.520 --> 57:00.520
Jimmy opens his arm wide again

57:00.520 --> 57:03.280
and just like has a huge grin on his face.

57:03.280 --> 57:06.040
And it's almost like he's reaching for like an embrace,

57:06.040 --> 57:09.000
but he's just inviting you to jump in.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.200
I get a running start and go in feet first.

57:12.120 --> 57:13.360
Knees tucked to chest.

57:17.040 --> 57:19.080
I don't have to roll for you.

57:19.240 --> 57:22.240
You do have to roll a constitution.

57:22.240 --> 57:23.520
Oh, I know that look.

57:23.520 --> 57:26.440
That's the look of deciding whether or not he wants to lie.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.880
It is.

57:31.880 --> 57:33.880
It's just, I have a cool thing to do.

57:33.880 --> 57:35.120
You better do it quick.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.760
Would have failed, Gibby.

57:37.760 --> 57:42.760
You, as Shelley St. Blythe dives feet first,

57:49.160 --> 57:51.320
like he's going down a water slide

57:51.320 --> 57:55.440
at fucking Splashylvania, two fanged plunge in there.

57:55.440 --> 57:57.840
You look down at the ground

57:57.840 --> 58:02.840
and see the split in half body of Rowan Fitzpatrick.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.400
And you feel like,

58:05.400 --> 58:07.600
hmm, what happened to Rowan

58:07.600 --> 58:09.320
is gonna happen to you any second now.

58:09.320 --> 58:10.200
You can feel it.

58:10.200 --> 58:12.200
What do you do with your last thoughts?

58:12.200 --> 58:13.280
Get inside your own stomach.

58:13.280 --> 58:14.120
Shut up, Luke.

58:14.120 --> 58:14.960
That's my whole deal.

58:18.440 --> 58:19.840
I get inside my own stomach.

58:26.280 --> 58:28.000
Knowing I'm a ticking time bomb,

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
I watched like the last long white hair

58:32.000 --> 58:33.880
breezing by of Shelley get in me.

58:33.880 --> 58:36.240
And I just try to shove my head in there after him.

58:36.240 --> 58:39.440
As you get your head close, you feel like.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.960
While munching on some fungus.

58:43.840 --> 58:46.920
You shove the last little bit of it into your mouth,

58:46.920 --> 58:51.080
shove your face and hands into your own stomach.

58:51.080 --> 58:53.800
It just falls away.

58:53.800 --> 58:56.920
And just so you feel this like warm wetness.

58:56.920 --> 58:59.920
It's like, you smell saline in the air

58:59.920 --> 59:02.200
and you hear this like weird noise

59:02.200 --> 59:04.400
as your hands go through

59:04.400 --> 59:07.440
and you feel the grip of friends hands,

59:07.440 --> 59:11.000
family's hands on the other side, pulling you through.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.840
You made it.

59:12.840 --> 59:14.360
It's like in the labyrinth

59:14.360 --> 59:16.680
when she goes down the tunnel.

59:20.680 --> 59:24.520
Just as I'm ecstatic about those hands on mine,

59:25.600 --> 59:29.200
I remember my wife and children.

59:29.920 --> 59:33.400
We're your family now.

59:33.400 --> 59:37.400
Yeah, my family's in me.

59:40.400 --> 59:43.720
The four of you on the other side

59:43.720 --> 59:48.160
of Jimmy Corrigan's unnatural stomach.

59:49.560 --> 59:50.680
Plus Brandon.

59:50.680 --> 59:51.520
Right?

59:51.520 --> 59:53.000
Plus Brandon.

59:53.000 --> 59:53.840
Oh, hey.

59:53.840 --> 59:56.200
And the coworker.

59:57.880 --> 59:59.320
Co-workers nowhere to be seen,

59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.400
but you're all-

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.560
Further on in the territory.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.560
Looking at a sprawling town park

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.120
straight out of the 1950s idea of the future.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.080
Perfectly manicured trees

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.480
like enormous emerald cake pops line,

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.440
a colorful synthetic walkway

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.280
that you've been pulled up onto

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.360
in this slightly bouncy, comfortable sidewalk

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.080
would take you all the way around

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.760
this gigantic green area around you

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.880
where on the far side,

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:31.880
maybe, I don't know, 124.3 meters away or so,

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.840
people in yellow and green uniforms are running around

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.640
and all the way across this park.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.040
So monumental, they are clear from here.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.560
There are two statues of men,

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.440
each about 26.3 meters tall,

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.880
made of green rock.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.240
Yeah, dude.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.400
They stand in front of a gorgeous building

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.120
seemingly made of glass and grass

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.280
and a woman in judge's robes

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.440
and a powdered wig wearing electric blue heels

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.960
looks at you and says,

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.360
or very quickly we need to get you inside and hidden.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.840
Quick, everyone, before anyone sees.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.360
And that is the end of Holy Cow Farms.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.320
Thank you so much.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.240
Holy, holy shit.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.800
Okay.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.640
Yeah.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.480
First you tell Becca what happened.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.320
Oh my, I knew it.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.160
Yeah.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.000
Oh my gosh.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:23.840
Yeah.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.680
I just want to go to this place.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.120
That's a place that's in another part of our podcast.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.360
This is the easiest way to say all that.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.240
It's very nice here.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.680
Yeah, it seems that way, huh?

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.520
It's growing.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.360
It's growing.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.200
It's growing.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.040
It's growing.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:39.880
It's growing.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.720
It's growing.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.560
It's growing.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.400
It's growing.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.240
It's growing.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.080
It's growing.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.920
It's growing.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.760
It's growing.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.480
It's Grover's Gorge, which is like,

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.320
Oh!

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.080
Which is like if Walmart had a city

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.760
that all its employees lived in.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.800
Oh yeah, actually they do have one of those

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.400
and they've got some pretty good concerts.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.480
Yeah.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.160
Oh shit.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.680
Becca, Scott, thank you so much for coming on

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.760
and joining us for this four episode run

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.600
here in season two.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.880
Thank you so much.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.200
But also this was so much fun.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.040
The series.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:14.880
Such a blast to play with you.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.720
Aw.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.360
Thomas, Joe, Luke.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.200
Nailed it.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.040
Thank you for having me.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.880
Oh, we're in the mind palace now.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.240
And also the MVP was Dylan.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.080
Absolutely.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:26.920
The straight ass dude.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.760
Do it.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.600
Shout out to him.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.160
Zeitgeist is so cool.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.520
Zeitgeist, for the win.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.360
For the win?

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.520
For the win, dude.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.560
Epic.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.520
I love some cosmic horror that ends up

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.760
in everybody dying and little explained.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.840
That's my way to roll play.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.640
So thank you so much for letting me be a part.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.400
Yeah.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.120
This was actually a fate worse than death, I think.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:51.920
Which is fun.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.520
Sometimes when a belly opens up,

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.840
you just need to either dive right in or cannonball.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.680
Yeah.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.520
Yeah.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.080
Cannonball.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.320
That's the only mystic advice my dad gave me about dating.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.160
Oh yeah.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.480
I've never used it, but I've wondered what it meant.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.760
When I was in sixth grade,

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:14.120
my dad told me that you have to make the woman come first.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.360
That was inappropriate for me.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.200
Yeah, that's true.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.920
Really sage advice.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.160
But he's a Christian, so we don't listen to him.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.600
Good job, dad.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.440
All right.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.560
And, Becca, do you want to give the people

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.040
like a shout out for where they can find you

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.040
on the internet?

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.040
Look into the cameras, tell the people

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.400
what you got going on.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.360
Besides the show notes, which there will be a link

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.640
to your website and your Twitter account.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.320
Or anything else you want.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.320
Or whatever you want.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.560
Look at them show notes.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.800
There's a bunch of backlog of me running

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.760
Call of Cthulhu games on my YouTube channel,

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.200
Good Time Society.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.440
You can find me on the internet at the Becca Scott.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.280
So go do it.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.120
Do it.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.160
Absolutely do it.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.280
I'm going to do it right now.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.480
Go learn how to play a game

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.720
because she does the coolest tutorials on board games.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.560
That's how I've learned how to play a game.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.200
Thank you.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200
I do do that.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.200
Joe was so fucking excited when I said Becca Scott

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.040
was going to be on.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.000
I'm a big fan.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.120
I'm a very big fan.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:13.960
Doo doo.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.240
Thank you so much for coming.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.000
Yeah, and doo doo to you listeners.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.080
Doo doo all around.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.280
Doo doo unto you.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.720
Oh my God.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.560
Yeah, that was fucking tight.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.400
Well thanks, Francis.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.240
Thank you so much.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.080
Thank you so much.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:26.920
That was awesome.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.560
I lost audio at 70 minutes.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.080
No shit.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.120
Are you for real?

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.160
How long was it supposed to be?

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.200
Oh, well I have an hour 17.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.080
So you lost the last seven.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.760
I think that was just some bullshit.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.280
Yeah, and also I have a recording of us.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.120
Through that, yeah.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:47.960
Through OBS.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.800
We'll be fine.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.480
So we'll be fine.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.320
Oh, thank God.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.160
That was scary.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.280
Did you write down?

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.880
Yeah, I wrote down everything.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.120
I need a second.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.200
You've got to run the calculations to see.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.440
836.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.920
Which Bible verse is that?

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.720
Oh, you don't know?

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.560
I know.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.520
We're not a Christian podcast.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.480
Thou shalt climb in the belly of your brethren

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.080
and be with him internally inside his own guts.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.040
That sounds right, yeah.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.360
Yeah, and also if your brother dies, you marry his wife.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:47.200
If it's some consolation

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.200
It's a lie

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:57.200
It's a lie

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.200
It's a lie

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.200
It's a lie

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:15.200
If it's some consolation

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:22.200
I was thinking the same thing

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:28.200
I am now mechanization

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:33.200
All my muscles work like swings

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.200
All my muscles work like swings

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.200
It's like a primal urge.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.200
It's like a hunger deep within you.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.200
It's like a paranoia.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.200
Looking over my back.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.200
It's like a whirlwind.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200
It's Linkin Park.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.200
And it's all my fault.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.200
Thanks for watching!
