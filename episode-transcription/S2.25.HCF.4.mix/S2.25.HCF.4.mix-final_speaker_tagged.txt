0.00 73.48 speaker0  This is yet another introduction to the radio show known as 694.2 PTBP, It's all you can eat every day, baby. And speaking of howling, and skittering, and me, Wolf the dog,
68.68 107.40 speaker1  What's that? You haven't tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod? That's so weird. You should be more like Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina, and tweet about the show and tag at Pretending Pod. Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina, writes, Greetings, Wolf. Overall, it isn't too bad.
103.88 152.00 speaker0  and wine that tastes more like pennies than wine. I would be mighty delighted to partake in whatever or whoever it is.
147.40 214.24 speaker1  fuck the musk, tag at Pretending Pod on Instagram, fuck the zuck, and make sure it gets in front of my dang eyeballs. And fuck whoever owns podcasts. That's right. Whether you want to give us money in exchange for bonus content on Patreon, or cop some new drip at the merch store, you can find those links in the show notes. And now, for our top ten shortest news segments, it's the news. Last time, the gang went to the Zeitgeist,
211.48 232.12 speaker0  and then Dr. Brock Hargrave,
229.84 319.32 speaker1  and then promptly into his own mouth, and then that very zonked-out dude just climbed into the abdomen of Dr. Brock Hargrave and disappeared?
317.40 353.16 speaker2  Do you want to do that? but life-changing to our listeners, so we got to leave them in. Also, we're sponsored by Aldi and those burps, brought to you by Aldi Generic Sparkling Water. Hey, Zach, I'm sorry, but you have a dozen cases of those in your house and you don't know what the fuck it's called without looking at the can.
349.16 368.48 speaker3  It's because you have the koozie.
365.76 384.88 speaker2  I have so many koozies in a drawer of my house but they use them all the time and it's pretty great, honestly, they're always like handing you one when you have a cold beverage at their house. It's a nice touch.
382.76 386.12 speaker3  You're making me question my koozie behavior.
384.88 412.92 speaker2  Yeah, I mean, you've got them. That's what they always say. I forgot how to say the word. That's what Taylor's back tattoo says. Right above Richard Nixon. It was supposed to be a cover up but it just looks cooler now.
411.04 417.04 speaker3  Sweet, does your wife really have a tattoo of Richard Nixon on her back?
414.20 417.88 speaker2  No, Roger Stone does.
417.04 430.72 speaker3  Oh, right. What happened last week?
428.00 433.08 speaker2  but I am not leaving here without dropping this
431.56 440.64 speaker3  You say as you roll grip,
439.20 452.84 speaker2  of Dr. Brock Hargrave. I've opened enough people to, you know.
451.28 456.48 speaker3  The hook passes as well.
452.84 463.64 speaker2  Okay, everyone is going to lose one grip still. This is strange enough that it stops you all in your tracks and you're left just watching.
462.72 475.36 speaker3  Just checking. Did you guys also see that guy roll up his belly like it was a carpet and put another man inside?
472.24 482.80 speaker2  How does a man fit in another man like that? He just walked right in.
479.16 501.48 speaker3  It was like he went into a tiny set of stairs, like there was a vanishing point and he got smaller as he walked towards the belly, but it didn't make any sense. into his belly. There's only one quick way down.
500.64 504.28 speaker2  I made hook. I know what you're thinking.
502.32 507.64 speaker3  I think we got to ride the Bigfoot. Well, okay.
506.24 517.84 speaker2  That's not what's going to happen. I'm sorry, you're going to die. With a Bigfoot landing.
517.00 523.72 speaker3  Oh, fuck yeah. And look down the shaft
519.04 527.44 speaker2  and see if my good old buddy elevator cable is still there. Go ahead and roll criminology.
526.60 536.20 speaker3  Nope.
533.16 557.32 speaker2  and you're looking at the shaft, the empty shaft ahead of you. And you see that the cables that go all the way down the bottom are like frayed to the point to where you think if you were to like jump on and try to shimmy down, it might break.
555.40 565.44 speaker3  is out of adequate question.
563.68 570.68 speaker2  We got to check the toilets. Maybe there's a cow toilet. See if we can get flushed down.
568.36 578.72 speaker3  Yes, maybe there's a cow toilet in the restaurant. to get flushed down on this level?
577.04 589.52 speaker2  All right, let me roll now. Meat hook in this line of work, sometimes the person gets eaten.
587.80 598.36 speaker3  You look so complacent. Isn't this your dude, Shelly? Why is he doing that?
594.20 612.44 speaker1  It's just that stopping him is our only option here. And right now we've got to find a way to stop him.
610.48 621.00 speaker2  Specifically for that we've written down. Yeah, like subtracting from your bonds. Something like that, yeah.
617.72 625.04 speaker3  Is there a door to where the old observation deck
623.56 644.56 speaker2  That is correct, there is a door and it's got tape like over it trying to warn people to not go in this general area as it is dangerous as the door is not there. It's just the open wind, the summer wind coming through and the smell of the parking lot.
643.28 651.40 speaker3  Oh yeah, of course it is.
648.76 660.48 speaker2  Hey, take this and we'll do it at the same time and I give her the small Bigfoot and I dangle the Bigfoot over the hole which he happens to be close to, right?
658.28 674.02 speaker3  On the count of three we're gonna clap
672.84 675.74 speaker2  The foot's full.
674.02 681.52 speaker3  What are we rolling for?
680.68 686.76 speaker2  Or Bigfoot. Or Bigfoot obviously, dropping Bigfoot if that's a craft skill.
684.76 690.44 speaker3  Yeah, I got a 46, that's a pass.
687.72 703.76 speaker2  I didn't hear any of the things that you said to go for. What did you roll? Yes it is and with that, describe these two bigfoots falling please.
701.22 717.44 speaker3  It's just like a long beard and a kind of Neanderthal face with a hairy body but it's got, it's like a plastic troll doll underneath
716.60 740.16 speaker2  Oh yeah. Flung. It's companion, same thing, much larger And they're somersaulting through the air as if they're in a beautiful ballet in the sky.
738.16 748.60 speaker3  I'm aiming for the dude. I wanna distract him so that he comes after us
747.32 829.88 speaker2  I'm aiming for the hole. I had the large one, yes. Goes directly, perfect hit, dude perfect from the top of the zeitgeist into the bottom of this hole and as it hits the bottom. Vincenti braces to be teleported back to non-existence. It bounces and then lands softly, lifelessly like a stuffed bigfoot that you might get at a carnival at the bottom of a dirt pit. right in the hand as he pulls out a syringe, shatters it. I rolled combat for the woman who he was going for and Luke, what did I roll? So he rolled a D8 and he got an eight. And the sharp tip goes directly in to the soft belly. You see blood splattering out onto the ground. I need everyone to roll grip again for violence.
828.68 840.06 speaker3  Can Shelley celebrate? I am happy at this violence.
838.88 893.92 speaker2  And then he throws up. Lose one grip. just like a stomach turning reaction. Don't worry doc, there's a lot of professional rivals you might one day get to kill. I believe Jimmy Corrigan is. So I rolled and passed which makes sense. Cause he's seen a lot of death. Seen a lot of death, seen a lot of blood. It continues to just ooze out and you see one of his intestines falls out of the hole onto the ground, dripping. And he's just kind of shaking violently on his knees and then he falls.
890.28 897.36 speaker3  But if Meadhope glances around the top of this observatory
896.40 931.88 speaker2  What are you looking for? off the side of during the parties? A banner is good. Rush hour two style. Okay, we've had a couple of bad experiences I think we can handle the stairs. Vincent has his eyes closed. I rolled a hundred. Oh, wait, I'm gonna use my, wait, what this word?
931.04 934.80 speaker3  That's a one. Ooh, he found a loophole.
933.44 942.28 speaker2  I'm gonna use my luck. Boom. Luck spent. Ooh, I like it.
940.48 945.84 speaker4  You only have half a luck, take mine.
943.36 961.28 speaker2  Vincent grabs half of a luck, forms it with his own half luck, spins it to...
959.60 966.64 speaker4  you just find like a fireman's ladder that's used for exactly this purpose. Yeah, it's in the closet.
965.24 972.24 speaker2  It's just in the back of the closet. You move some stuff out of the way. You have to clown fireman's ladder so it's shoved in there, but when you get it out.
970.44 981.28 speaker3  It goes to the ground, there's a hole in the ground. Yeah, because ladders are easier to go down than stairs. Everybody knows that.
979.36 995.20 speaker2  Oh, you guys don't have to roll for a fireman's ladder. on the fireman's ladder and it just shoots down to the bottom and I look at Mead Hook and say, get scuttling, kid.
992.80 999.68 speaker3  When I's told to scuttle, I scuttle.
996.76 1015.88 speaker2  A tear forms in Jimmy's eyes and he's like, he didn't say shimmy. I need everyone shimmying down to roll.
1012.60 1026.72 speaker3  Just an eight, a definite success. Finally able to go up and or down. Something fashion to do just that.
1025.88 1045.08 speaker2  so it's easier. I pass my scuttle. which makes sense because I'm the only one Dead silent.
1044.24 1045.92 speaker3  Fail alert.
1045.08 1101.76 speaker2  Not alert. I'm focusing on safely scuttling. to the base of the zeitgeist, Jimmy Corrigan and the stairs all alone meet Hook and Vincent D'Bori focusing deeply on making their way down the pole. And Shelly St. Blythe, who is lively going down and you notice that there's a window actually out this side, just like a thin window going all the way down. So you've got a clear view as you head down this fireman's pole for not a single fireman in sight. And you see this woman just shaking, her hands covered in blood, and she kicks the body of Dr. Brock Hargrave into one of the holes and begins covering it with the mound of dirt that's next to it as fast as she can.
1100.52 1106.12 speaker3  We saw everything. What? You're all right.
1103.96 1116.12 speaker4  Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
1113.62 1123.12 speaker3  If you were worried about being incriminated, now I got more information.
1122.04 1125.80 speaker4  Brandy, it's okay.
1123.12 1137.68 speaker3  I'm just trying to teach you a little bit about the world as my dads did for me. Brandy, how'd this guy find you?
1134.16 1149.96 speaker4  Oh shit, shit, shit, where, where's, where's. The Iliad. Fuck, fuck, where's Brandon? Where's Brandon?
1148.00 1152.88 speaker2  your boyfriend's name is Brandon.
1151.48 1158.72 speaker4  Oh shit, my name's Brandy. Okay, I see, I hear it now.
1156.84 1166.04 speaker3  Nobody ever thought that was weird?
1164.04 1172.96 speaker2  It's not the time, but I also wanna say, Brandy, we don't know for sure that if you hadn't gutted that man,
1171.92 1176.96 speaker4  Out of where?
1175.40 1197.44 speaker2  We might as well try. And he brushes away some of the dirt and tries to open the stomach. on the ground to like. Sure. Okay, so you lay down on the ground with your arms outstretched down to the bottom of this pit.
1193.88 1205.16 speaker3  You're like pulling at the wound?
1201.32 1273.32 speaker2  Or like trying to, did I see him belly button pull? Roll grip, because that's fucking gross. It is. Damn. With his success, you lose no grip on reality as you have done this kind of shit before. And everyone kind of notices the like steady sure hand that Vincentibori is taking as he pulls apart the abdomen of Dr. Brock Hargrave inside of this pit. Blood is just covering your hands now, Vincenti. And you see there's a kidney's spleen. What?
1272.48 1291.20 speaker3  It's okay, Brandon. I'm gonna touch her hair to calm her. It's okay. I seen people do this. Hey doctor, do you know anything about what's in that syringe?
1290.36 1301.92 speaker4  Give me a moment.
1300.24 1303.92 speaker3  Eviscerated somebody.
1303.08 1308.16 speaker2  I see. It's okay though. He went to work in his old man's meat shop.
1307.20 1316.64 speaker3  were already out. I did. So there was that.
1315.60 1344.60 speaker4  Hey Brandy. Brandy and Brandon, huh, yes. I do wanna pick up that syringe and take a look at it. I've got 40 forensics. Is that something that would cover?
1340.96 1357.16 speaker3  I've seen a syringe or two in my day. Let me take a look-see. Thank you, laughter. That's a 17. That'll do.
1355.44 1376.40 speaker2  What's in the syringe? You kind of squirt some out the tip of the syringe and smell it and you know that it is some sort of a tranquilizer, like a horse tranquilizer,
1374.36 1378.24 speaker3  Hey, Rowan, are you still up in that tower?
1377.24 1386.80 speaker2  Thank you for asking.
1383.96 1389.48 speaker3  Do you know anything about what's happening here?
1386.80 1408.08 speaker2  Rowan is just shaking their head vigorously, just back and forth. We could put it in him and see what it does and then he won't talk anymore. No.
1404.72 1415.76 speaker3  Once you say an idea, we gotta do it. She shoves the needle in her hand, broken or not, into his arm.
1414.36 1427.96 speaker2  As he slides down the pole. into their arm and they're just like completely not ready for it. Completely caught off guard.
1427.12 1436.96 speaker4  It's all right.
1433.80 1487.64 speaker2  I'm a raptor. Nobody panic. I don't think they're actually a raptor. I feel like a raptor. And Rowan is just like laughing, giggling, This is a Christian podcast, so we don't know what that's like. So you imagine you're a dinosaur, right? No, I mean, the only time I've done ketamine, the... started jumping up on all the furniture with a couple of claws out, just kind of being a goober. That guy was probably just a raptor. So what the fuck do we do now?
1486.36 1506.48 speaker3  This was the guy we were looking for. I mean, I guess we could just tell Ruth Moses Esther that we found him.
1505.64 1516.60 speaker2  where my cell phone is. That's weird.
1515.04 1532.20 speaker3  I give her a ring.
1531.36 1536.80 speaker4  Is everyone okay? Have you figured it out?
1535.16 1555.44 speaker3  We found him. Everyone is not okay. Dr. Hargrave's guts are outside his body. And, well, do you know anything about supernaturally
1551.72 1567.96 speaker2  No, did you see anything like that occur? Do you know how it's done? Did he tell you?
1564.64 1574.32 speaker3  because he was murdered before we arrived here.
1570.12 1592.16 speaker2  And I just kind of, don't move my hand for a little bit. Is there, do I feel a pulse? like at a heartbeats rate.
1590.56 1611.04 speaker3  We met someone named Brandy. She's wearing club wear. Let me give her the phone.
1608.24 1614.28 speaker2  So you wanted to rip off comedy bang bang, right?
1613.24 1644.32 speaker4  Completely forgot. Was the deal. I would have to answer that. throughout the process? She's useless, take her out.
1642.80 1660.48 speaker2  If I didn't tell you that before, I think you should know by now. Hey, Meat Hook, I think it's time you prove yourself. Good, you proved yourself.
1658.60 1666.44 speaker3  I mean, we found the target.
1662.76 1682.00 speaker4  And did you learn what he was trying to figure out? Shelly kind of walks up. people talk about people getting lost in the fungus. Disappear.
1680.64 1685.88 speaker3  That's just an expression?
1684.40 1692.64 speaker4  It's common between the cowboys.
1689.28 1700.68 speaker2  Lazarus, you seem a bit agitated. You seem a bit agitated. No, everything is so clear now. You seem a bit more manic than when we last spoke.
1699.40 1717.60 speaker4  Manic because I'm on the right path doing all the right things. What's the difference? You take your directions from me because I am the handler, I'm in charge.
1716.32 1722.48 speaker3  if you know what I mean.
1720.72 1730.92 speaker2  Hey, we never asked and we should have. Why did your place reek of cat piss when there were no cats?
1727.96 1736.44 speaker4  I've been having to stay up to take care of this mission.
1732.80 1737.84 speaker2  Oh, you've been buying from the strummers.
1736.44 1775.16 speaker4  Or producing. that the dare officer would disapprove of in my life. I'm a fucking piece of shit square. Okay, like that's, we got to do with the things that the commission makes us have to do because I had to stay awake and I had to find the numbers and I had to figure it out and it's 836, 836. It's around holy cow farms and it's, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1773.64 1784.76 speaker3  At the Bible study.
1781.60 1808.96 speaker2  Hey, this is something that's not come up as players ever. What do you do when your Delta Green handler is insane? Who do you call? I mean, not the obvious answer to that question. Yeah, just the cops. The cops. I don't know what to do. Meat Hook, could you take her off speakerphone for just a second? Yeah.
1807.40 1813.84 speaker4  Don't take me off speakerphone.
1812.52 1821.12 speaker3  I already hung up on her.
1819.32 1830.88 speaker2  I stopped playing with his guts. Wet hands. Maybe that's a bigger clue.
1829.32 1858.36 speaker3  I don't know. Do you think there's anything to be learned at Trigate Supply? Well, she wanted us to bring his body back, but that feels very incriminating. I mean, we didn't even kill him. Also, you should probably get all that blood off your hands, Vincente.
1855.60 1872.80 speaker2  and it's proven to be the best choice so far. So, I mean, I think we just- Vincente, you heard her. She's not the same person who was making those calls before. She's gone. She's not gone. We can help, maybe we can help her. Now that the mission's over. Maybe we have to eliminate her.
1871.64 1876.96 speaker4  Kill Ruth?
1874.48 1891.12 speaker2  This wasn't a mission, it's something she gave us. But she's the handler, the guys, the lizard people, whoever give it to her. Who handles the handler. I never asked and I never really cared. I think we take the body to her, we find out she probably knows about the numbers.
1887.96 1894.84 speaker4  What if enabling her enables something much worse?
1893.76 1904.84 speaker2  I'm here to do a job. Then we have to rethink this whole parenthood situation.
1902.36 1917.52 speaker4  and he wants to jump down into the hole. Can you do that? Yeah. Look in the ear, cause he stuck his finger in his ear and then into his mouth. I wanna see if he got anything out of there.
1915.52 1948.72 speaker2  to look inside. It's like a salty, horrible earwax smell mixed with like the ocean, I mean, when something earthy is like mixed with the wet and the saline for long enough. Those are the conditions there, too. It's almost as if something might be growing.
1945.72 1961.28 speaker4  Comrades, down here please for your attention. There seems to be a growth of sorts in Hargrave's ear. I believe I found the aforementioned fungus that one gets lost in.
1960.12 1965.60 speaker2  Be very careful, doctor.
1963.64 1979.56 speaker4  but it does look as though it's cultivated here. Can you get a sample? I will attempt to do so now. No, just touch it. Yeah, just touch it, you fucking idiot.
1978.24 1983.40 speaker2  Use the little puppet hands. They'll fit right in there.
1982.08 2023.08 speaker4  I whip out Craig Mile. I need you now. and makes it do a perfect scooping motion. And pulls it out. And then he grabs a sandwich bag that he always has on him from after lunch. Yeah, of course. And scoops it into the bag.
2022.24 2033.32 speaker3  What do you think? Hey, Rowan.
2030.56 2040.64 speaker2  falling even heavier, seemingly, as these dead eyes look at you. It's time for a snack.
2039.80 2047.20 speaker3  Are you hungry? Yeah. There you go, Meat Hook.
2045.12 2060.72 speaker2  Shelly's also starting to get out of the hole
2058.36 2097.04 speaker3  and you put your hand on the outside of the plastic bag,
2093.20 2128.28 speaker2  And as the substance that was in the ear of Dr. Brock Hargrave touches the mouth and goes into the esophagus of Rowan Fitzpatrick. I need you to roll power at a negative 40 to fight against this.
2126.12 2135.52 speaker4  Oof, get in my belly.
2134.32 2138.04 speaker2  What are you talking about?
2137.20 2146.96 speaker4  It is really.
2144.64 2169.36 speaker3  My power is a 60. But you needed me to roll a 20 or below. I did. to make a little spot, a little basement nest, if you will, for a rat curl.
2168.52 2175.24 speaker4  Basement creep now.
2172.12 2180.48 speaker2  So we are going to go into combat order here, which is in order of dexterity.
2179.64 2182.14 speaker3  70.
2181.32 2204.08 speaker2  50. 65. Okay, so it's gonna start with Meat Hook, go to Vincenty, and then because we're already going that way, we'll go Shelly and then Jimmy. And with that, Meat Hook, to get inside Rowan Fitzpatrick.
2201.52 2218.68 speaker3  This is the answer I've been waiting for all my life. Who would have ever thought Rowan Fitzpatrick would hold it? But now I need to know what's in there.
2214.24 2229.86 speaker2  Yeah, and because you did the syringe, there's no contest. So if you succeed, you succeed. Oh, shit.
2229.04 2239.40 speaker4  I don't know.
2235.22 2293.08 speaker2  With a critical failure, as you are desperately trying to crawl into the stomach area of Rowan Fitzpatrick, you slip and one of, your hand reaches out and just goes directly soft through, like you're putting your hand into a bowl of jello, just like into the middle of Rowan Fitzpatrick. And you hold on, and I need you to roll a grip as you hold on to this weird kind of like bouncy, synthetic feeling substance on the other side. Zach is in grip to me in grip. So two crit fails in a row.
2291.76 2307.08 speaker5  Click the button. It's not working.
2302.64 2311.48 speaker2  and add one for your grip loss, but when you crit fail, you just take the maximum. So that's nine.
2310.56 2318.28 speaker3  Okay.
2314.28 2327.84 speaker2  which means that you are on a temporary loss of yourself from reality.
2325.20 2332.68 speaker3  I just start humming Mamma Mia. And is it because you have three dads now?
2331.76 2350.48 speaker5  Yes, exactly. Holy shit.
2349.64 2353.00 speaker2  I'm coming. I'm coming.
2352.16 2356.36 speaker4  I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
2355.52 2367.92 speaker3  I'm coming. Brandon, I'm coming.
2362.92 2385.48 speaker2  You've got Meat Hook up to one elbow in Rowan Fitzpatrick, a normal role-playing sentence. his portal belly went away. She's how far in? Just an arm?
2383.08 2387.52 speaker4  Meat Hook, I'm so fucking sorry.
2385.48 2442.24 speaker2  And I pull my revolver out and I want to shoot Rowan in the face. I got good firearms. Go ahead and roll firearms. I do not pass my firearms. 85 on a 50. No. It's firearms. in this particular chamber. That's an out that doesn't kill Meat Hook. And your turn's over.
2440.20 2445.40 speaker4  so he wants to grab a leg. He's pulling back the other way.
2444.56 2488.12 speaker2  Yep, tug of war time. Okay, I've got an 80 firearms and an 85 strength. So I'm going to join Shelly. I was going to say, I just passed with a 24. to try to beat a 24. Oh no. It's got to be. Not in a contest. Yeah, if it's a contest,
2486.44 2492.12 speaker3  Your rules are nutty. It's blackjack rules. That's what Thomas keeps saying.
2490.24 2497.84 speaker2  Yeah, I don't like them either.
2496.20 2502.44 speaker3  You know, you can't tell the dice two things.
2501.60 2522.60 speaker2  while still being a success. But it makes sense because if you have a higher level skill, you can roll a higher number and still win. But holy shit, that's not good.
2521.76 2524.04 speaker4  in our own rules.
2522.60 2528.76 speaker2  Yeah, I didn't roll a 69.
2527.56 2531.64 speaker3  Not nice.
2530.12 2539.68 speaker2  that don't even want to look at each other. Yeah, they're not pleasuring each other orally. They're farting on each other with their backs turned.
2537.64 2568.08 speaker3  Yeah, they're sleeping in fetal positions in opposite directions. One's upside down. Grab onto this hand that she found inside the belly. I kind of want to try and pull the hand out, but I'm wondering if the need to go inside the belly has changed at all.
2565.68 2574.52 speaker2  I love the pulling at the hand. Yeah, that's fun.
2573.68 2581.36 speaker3  Oh. I'm not at the breaking point yet.
2579.12 2622.56 speaker2  I'm sorry, I completely missed that. Basically at this point what we do- I'll be the DM for a minute. Thank you. and we put in order fight, flight, or freeze. And so if you think that Meat Hook would be most likely to fight, And if you think it's second- And then the second most likely that you think if you roll a two or a three, then you do that one. And then the last one that you think is the least likely is just a one.
2621.72 2638.04 speaker3  That is correct. Okay, well flight means crawling in this belly. So that's the most likely. Fight is probably her natural inclination. So that's next.
2636.52 2644.36 speaker2  Oh no. It's a five. Five is flight.
2641.28 2652.84 speaker3  I take the hand and I let the hand pull me as I just relax my body.
2649.24 2665.08 speaker2  You all see Meat Hook fully engulfed by the midriff of Rowan Fitzpatrick. I need you all to roll grip.
2662.68 2683.20 speaker3  You see a steel-tipped boot with a lot of extra studs and spikes stuck out of it. Kind of get caught on the edge of the skull buckle
2681.16 2706.00 speaker2  sucked up into that man's belly. This is fish face all over again. Did I mention I'm 27? I failed. dropped you off at the place? Seven. Oh, okay. 20 years in the hole. Oh yeah.
2704.64 2711.36 speaker3  Well, no one ever debated that.
2710.28 2742.56 speaker2  I passed. Okay, so the single pass here on the grip. You only lose one with the disappearance of Meat Hook. Puts me past, well past my breaking point. Oh, sure. Oh, well a seven still puts me past my breaking point.
2740.68 2760.76 speaker4  No, I never fucking said we had a quiz. When Corrigan failed his, Extreme failed his strength check, I think he fell backwards and it knocked me off. Cause I was still holding on to her leg, but we'll say that I am not now. No, you definitely fell back.
2758.60 2891.56 speaker2  Along with the critical failure there. I lost four grip, but I'm still well above my breaking point. flight or freeze, however. I'm going fight, fight, freeze. You said D6 plus one? Yes, I did. So I lost five. Freeze. Freeze. Fincenzi Bori freezes in his tracks, unable to move. Lost in thought. Jimmy Corrigan fights, he fucking thrusts both arms into the belly of Rowan. And as you do so, I need you to roll a D4 minus one for damage. And so with a two hit point loss, you just punch with both fists into the stomach. The abs you feel just like, oh, you get a slight response out of Rowan for the first time. to just dead eyes look at the ground. Where's that ear fungus? Give me that fucking ear fungus. Is the bag that had the fungus lying anywhere? I like that, I like that. We'll let it ride. So you've dropped it on the ground there, but I actually at this point need a roll. so far, Jimmy Corrigan, but you do know that when you punch the stomach of Rowan Fitzpatrick, Exactly where you punch, just like right at the midriff, exactly where Meat Hook just went in. They just, something like as if the building was being dropped, but all the detonation spots were like halfway through. It just boom, and then the top half just kind of falls
2890.24 2895.66 speaker4  on human inside.
2893.20 2957.84 speaker2  And the top half falls, and then the knees fall, just like when you shot people in the dick in GoldenEye. Do I need to roll a grip for that? I need grip checks from the other two of you as well. Jesus. One grip loss with a pass. Again, 1d4 plus one. I crit failed. Awesome. I also, five. Jesus. So what Jimmy Corrigan does is- I hit a breaking point again. He grabs the syringe of ketamine, and he's going to try to inject it into the nearest person. It is just three other people standing here now. It is Vincenzi Bori, Shelly St. Blythe, and- Brandy. Oh, Brandy's still here?
2956.60 2964.84 speaker5  What the fuck?
2962.60 2985.76 speaker2  to save the child, but unfortunately I- and you're doing what now? just like falls unconscious. It's okay. Where you're going is probably a better place.
2984.88 3016.80 speaker6  We're not going to punch you. We're not going to make you explode, but we got to get our daughter back. And he walks back to the ear fungus and eats a little bit. Wait. Well, before he does that, he- Too late. Oh my God. He said it. He just fucking said it. He said it. I mean, one of us has to eat some to get in there, right? We can't- No. You think we can feed it to her? If it goes in her mouth. Have we seen anybody open a portal? Oh, we did. That's what this whole thing is. That's what just happened.
3015.64 3033.28 speaker5  I feel like once you say a thing, the thing can't be unsaid.
3031.20 3039.44 speaker2  So if your goal is to open yourself up, perhaps that would be the way of doing it.
3037.72 3045.72 speaker5  He eats it and he says,
3044.24 3049.28 speaker6  That doesn't make sense, does it?
3048.32 3056.40 speaker5  That's why it's funny.
3054.68 3073.26 speaker2  that you're walking back to them as you put it in your mouth. With that- from Vincenty Bory.
3072.06 3079.62 speaker6  A 20 on a five.
3077.74 3090.42 speaker2  It's like a primal urge. It's like a hunger deep within you. You feel just like completely drawn without hesitation.
3089.58 3092.66 speaker6  Let me be clear,
3090.42 3097.00 speaker2  to crawl into the stomach of Jimmy Corrigan is what you feel like doing.
3094.26 3129.66 speaker6  Vincenty gets in position like you would at the beginning of a track race. and is gonna try to just dive head first into the stomach. and I say, you go get our girl. Holy shit.
3128.18 3141.20 speaker2  Like a really important one. That's good.
3138.62 3147.10 speaker6  and as his feet leave the ground and his head is heading towards the stomach,
3145.48 3154.70 speaker4  so it don't fucking matter. I'm coming.
3151.98 3165.42 speaker2  Vincenty Bory just disappears. and using it for all the previous ones.
3164.58 3171.36 speaker3  You're welcome.
3170.54 3186.34 speaker2  In Seattle. Should I say Blythe? We are at the Space Needle. Go ahead and roll a grip for me. Okay, so you just lose one again.
3184.82 3200.58 speaker6  I'm just nodding enthusiastically.
3198.78 3227.10 speaker2  I need to know what the two of you who have just left yourselves alone. There is one dead body in a hole in the ground that is like not covered up. There is a exploded kid on the ground halved and then there's an unconscious woman off to the side down the path heading back to the parking lot and the two of you are just looking at each other.
3226.16 3232.52 speaker4  How does it feel?
3230.44 3237.60 speaker6  I really thought stabbing her with ketamine would do something else.
3235.32 3244.64 speaker4  I thought maybe you got mixed up on who was who. I got mixed up, I got mixed up.
3243.60 3264.12 speaker2  your headphones real quick? Hey, Thomas, Jimmy's never felt anything like that ever and it was like the coolest, best feeling that you've ever had. Oh no. I'm just saying.
3262.84 3277.88 speaker6  Yeah, they can be birded. D-bird, D-bird.
3276.04 3296.00 speaker2  Oh, you've lost enough grip now. Yeah, you're pretty sure how this works now. So basically when you eat the substance, the person closest to you seemingly wants to get in your belly. Okay, okay, okay.
3293.36 3325.52 speaker6  I'm doing it quickly and I have dice in my hands. It feels fantastic to be a family. It's time that you joined us.
3322.40 3332.32 speaker4  I didn't know if my sanity loss makes me want to do this. I think with the passing,
3330.00 3338.00 speaker2  But I mean, obviously this is chipping away your ability to sense reality.
3335.66 3342.52 speaker4  No, I'm not hungry, sorry.
3340.92 3348.24 speaker6  But aren't you hungry for family?
3345.30 3379.08 speaker4  And Chedi, I didn't know him terribly well, but he seemed nice. But no, I don't want to go inside of you to find them. They haven't returned and I don't know if I will return.
3377.48 3390.40 speaker2  She's calling for you, doc.
3389.28 3397.48 speaker3  Rocks. Igneous, the, limestone.
3395.80 3402.52 speaker2  I mean, it's your head telling you this, so it's rattling off all the rocks that you love most.
3401.08 3443.52 speaker6  Igneous, limestone. The. Jimmy opens his arm wide again and just like has a huge grin on his face. And it's almost like he's reaching for like an embrace, but he's just inviting you to jump in.
3442.24 3451.88 speaker2  Oh, I know that look. That's the look of deciding whether or not he wants to lie.
3450.28 3455.12 speaker5  It is.
3453.88 3471.32 speaker6  You better do it quick. Would have failed, Gibby.
3469.16 3508.00 speaker2  like he's going down a water slide at fucking Splashylvania, two fanged plunge in there. You look down at the ground and see the split in half body of Rowan Fitzpatrick. And you feel like, hmm, what happened to Rowan is gonna happen to you any second now. You can feel it. Get inside your own stomach. That's my whole deal.
3506.28 3521.96 speaker6  Knowing I'm a ticking time bomb, I watched like the last long white hair breezing by of Shelley get in me. And I just try to shove my head in there after him.
3519.44 3556.68 speaker2  While munching on some fungus. You shove the last little bit of it into your mouth, shove your face and hands into your own stomach. It just falls away. And just so you feel this like warm wetness. It's like, you smell saline in the air and you hear this like weird noise and you feel the grip of friends hands, family's hands on the other side, pulling you through.
3554.36 3569.20 speaker3  when she goes down the tunnel.
3565.60 3588.16 speaker6  I remember my wife and children.
3583.72 3677.80 speaker2  of Jimmy Corrigan's unnatural stomach. Right? Looking at a sprawling town park straight out of the 1950s idea of the future. Perfectly manicured trees like enormous emerald cake pops line, a colorful synthetic walkway that you've been pulled up onto in this slightly bouncy, comfortable sidewalk would take you all the way around this gigantic green area around you where on the far side, maybe, I don't know, 124.3 meters away or so, people in yellow and green uniforms are running around and all the way across this park. So monumental, they are clear from here. There are two statues of men, each about 26.3 meters tall, made of green rock. They stand in front of a gorgeous building seemingly made of glass and grass and a woman in judge's robes and a powdered wig wearing electric blue heels looks at you and says, And that is the end of Holy Cow Farms. Thank you so much.
3676.96 3697.36 speaker4  Okay. Yeah. First you tell Becca what happened. Oh my, I knew it. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I just want to go to this place.
3696.52 3700.72 speaker6  It's growing. It's growing. It's growing.
3699.88 3704.92 speaker5  It's growing. It's growing. It's growing.
3704.08 3721.48 speaker6  It's growing. and they've got some pretty good concerts.
3720.40 3729.76 speaker5  Yeah.
3726.68 3733.20 speaker2  and joining us for this four episode run here in season two. Thank you so much.
3731.88 3739.20 speaker6  But also this was so much fun. The series. Such a blast to play with you. Aw.

3746.08 3756.56 speaker2  The straight ass dude. Shout out to him. Zeitgeist is so cool. Zeitgeist, for the win.
3755.72 3758.52 speaker5  Epic.
3756.56 3767.40 speaker3  I love some cosmic horror that ends up in everybody dying and little explained. That's my way to roll play.
3766.56 3771.92 speaker4  Yeah.
3771.08 3776.84 speaker6  Which is fun.
3773.52 3784.32 speaker3  you just need to either dive right in or cannonball. Yeah.
3780.08 3797.20 speaker6  That's the only mystic advice my dad gave me about dating. Oh yeah. I've never used it, but I've wondered what it meant.
3796.36 3812.04 speaker5  Yeah, that's true.
3809.56 3828.80 speaker2  like a shout out for where they can find you on the internet? to your website and your Twitter account. Or anything else you want.
3826.56 3839.48 speaker3  There's a bunch of backlog of me running Call of Cthulhu games on my YouTube channel, Good Time Society. You can find me on the internet at the Becca Scott. So go do it. Do it. Absolutely do it. I'm going to do it right now.
3838.28 3846.20 speaker4  Go learn how to play a game because she does the coolest tutorials on board games. That's how I've learned how to play a game.
3845.20 3850.04 speaker3  I do do that.
3849.20 3853.96 speaker2  was going to be on. I'm a big fan.
3853.12 3856.24 speaker5  Doo doo.
3854.44 3860.08 speaker2  Thank you so much for coming. Yeah, and doo doo to you listeners.

3866.08 3881.08 speaker6  That was awesome. Are you for real? How long was it supposed to be?
3879.20 3887.12 speaker3  So you lost the last seven.
3886.28 3890.48 speaker2  Through that, yeah. Through OBS. We'll be fine.
3888.80 3918.92 speaker4  So we'll be fine.
3917.20 3928.48 speaker6  Which Bible verse is that? I know.
3924.52 3947.20 speaker3  Thou shalt climb in the belly of your brethren
3942.20 4006.20 speaker4  If it's some consolation It's a lie It's a lie It's a lie It's a lie
4004.20 4009.20 speaker2  It's like a hunger deep within you. It's like a paranoia. Thanks for watching!
