1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
This is yet another introduction to the radio show known as 694.2 PTBP,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,720
the galaxy's only radio station that is technically also maybe a toxic waste site.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,480
You all know me, and if you don't, my name's DJ Wolf the dog,

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:29,200
here to howl out some things at y'all before something else starts happening right after I stop talking.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,360
Have I ever stuck around even one second after my segment ends?

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,520
Damn, you know I haven't.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,840
I clock out and skitter as fast as my limbs can skitter out to the municipal dump.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,200
It's all you can eat every day, baby.

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,400
And speaking of howling, and skittering, and me, Wolf the dog,

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,680
it's time to skitter on over to a new howling with Wolf.

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,280
Howl

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,480
This show's howling with Wolf is from Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina,

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,680
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,480
What's that? You haven't tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod?

15
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,400
That's so weird.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,840
You should be more like Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina,

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,760
and tweet about the show and tag at Pretending Pod.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,200
Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina, writes,

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,120
Greetings, Wolf.

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm writing you from some weird liminal dimension I stumbled into while cleaning carpets in some old church.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
Overall, it isn't too bad.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,880
I just wish they had more food than these strange bits of jerky with hair on them,

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,400
and wine that tastes more like pennies than wine.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,960
I want to give a shout out to my best friend Ash and girlfriend Kaylee,

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,520
as well as everyone who works on this podcast.

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,120
Y'all have got me through more hard times than I can count and made me laugh just as many.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Damn.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Well, I hope you can turn that liminal dimension into a liminalade dimension, you know what I'm saying?

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,560
And if you could, uh, email me some of them jerky bits,

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,760
I would be mighty delighted to partake in whatever or whoever it is.

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,400
Now, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter,

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,000
fuck the musk, tag at Pretending Pod on Instagram, fuck the zuck,

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,680
or tag pretending to be people on Facebook, fuck the zuck double time.

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,040
Or write us up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice,

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,800
and make sure it gets in front of my dang eyeballs.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
And fuck whoever owns podcasts.

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,920
And if you happen to have forgotten, the links are in the show notes.

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
That's right.

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,480
Whether you want to give us money in exchange for bonus content on Patreon,

40
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,680
or cop some new drip at the merch store,

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,400
or join the listener communities on Discord and Reddit,

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,600
or vibe to a selection of tracks from the PTBPOST on YouTube,

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,240
you can find those links in the show notes.

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,880
And now, for our top ten shortest news segments, it's the news.

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,440
Last time, the gang went to the Zeitgeist,

46
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,480
the abandoned and very unimpressive city Space Needle,

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,240
and then Dr. Brock Hargrave,

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,840
no, no way, this can't be right,

49
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,240
says here, Dr. Hargrave brought a couple of sedated folks on leashes

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,880
up to the spot he'd been digging, smoked some meth,

51
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,840
plunged a syringe in the dude, stuck a finger in his own ear

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,120
and then promptly into his own mouth,

53
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,440
and then that very zonked-out dude

54
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,440
just climbed into the abdomen of Dr. Brock Hargrave

55
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,520
and disappeared?

56
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Also making a disappearance for the final time,

57
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,320
it's Hudson Freeman with muscles all sprees.

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:05:12,040
You are now listening to the final episode

59
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,680
of our four-episode series, Fuck Me.

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,400
Oh, do you want to take that one again?

61
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,320
Do you want to do that?

62
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,640
What a gentleman.

63
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,920
Holy cow farms, leave it in.

64
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,960
Oh, right, no, we now know that burps are not only important

65
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,080
but life-changing to our listeners,

66
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,880
so we got to leave them in.

67
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,120
Also, we're sponsored by Aldi and those burps,

68
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,680
brought to you by Aldi Generic Sparkling Water.

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,520
It's Bell V Sparkling Water Tangerine by Pure Aqua.

70
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
Hey, Zach, I'm sorry, but you have a dozen cases of those

71
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,000
in your house and you don't know what the fuck it's called

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,160
without looking at the can.

73
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,160
It's because you have the koozie.

74
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,880
That's exactly right, I'm covering it up constantly.

75
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,520
24-7 koozied up.

76
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,200
And he knows how to read, for sure.

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,920
I just think it's weird to not use a koozie

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,360
and touch a cold can, like that's fucked up to me.

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,480
I have so many koozies in a drawer of my house

80
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
and I've never once used any of them.

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,000
Same, Zach and his wife have the same drawer

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,240
but they use them all the time and it's pretty great,

83
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,000
honestly, they're always like handing you one

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,920
when you have a cold beverage at their house.

85
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
It's a nice touch.

86
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,880
You're making me question my koozie behavior.

87
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,120
Yeah, I mean, you've got them.

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,400
Keep them in the drawer, that's where mine are.

89
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,360
You don't fuse, you're gonna lose.

90
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,480
That's exactly right.

91
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,320
That's what they always say.

92
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,400
I forgot how to say the word.

93
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
That's what Taylor's back tattoo says.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,840
Right above Richard Nixon.

95
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,440
It was supposed to be a cover up

96
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,880
but it just looks cooler now.

97
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,920
Sweet, does your wife really have a tattoo

98
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,200
of Richard Nixon on her back?

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,040
No, Roger Stone does.

100
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,880
Oh, right.

101
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,120
What happened last week?

102
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
Wolf already told us, let's dive into this shit.

103
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,520
Oh yeah, thanks Wolf.

104
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,000
I think maybe we need to go talk to him or get him,

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,720
but I am not leaving here without dropping this

106
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,560
in the hole.

107
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,080
You say as you roll grip,

108
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,080
as you all see this dude disappear into the torso

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,640
of Dr. Brock Hargrave.

110
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,040
I pass.

111
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,560
Shelly passes also.

112
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,440
I've opened enough people to, you know.

113
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,280
Same.

114
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,840
The hook passes as well.

115
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,480
Okay, everyone is going to lose one grip still.

116
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,720
This is strange enough that it stops you all in your tracks

117
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,720
and you're left just watching.

118
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,640
Just checking.

119
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,800
Did you guys also see that guy roll up his belly

120
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,400
like it was a carpet and put another man inside?

121
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,240
We sure did.

122
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
How does a man fit in another man like that?

123
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,480
He just walked right in.

124
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,160
He absolutely devoured him like my career.

125
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,800
It was like he went into a tiny set of stairs,

126
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,240
like there was a vanishing point

127
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,880
and he got smaller as he walked towards the belly,

128
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,240
but it didn't make any sense.

129
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,400
It was kind of amusing.

130
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,320
We got to go save that woman before she walks

131
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,680
into his belly.

132
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
There's only one quick way down.

133
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
I made hook.

134
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,320
I know what you're thinking.

135
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,280
I think we got to ride the Bigfoot.

136
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,120
Well, okay.

137
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,640
That's not what's going to happen.

138
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,080
I'm sorry, you're going to die.

139
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,520
If you try that.

140
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,360
With a Bigfoot landing.

141
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,000
I would like to pry open the elevator doors.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
Oh, fuck yeah.

143
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,040
And look down the shaft

144
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,720
and see if my good old buddy elevator cable is still there.

145
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,360
Go ahead and roll criminology.

146
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
Nope.

147
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,160
Okay, so you get these elevator doors pried open

148
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,200
and you're looking at the shaft,

149
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,280
the empty shaft ahead of you.

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,920
And you see that the cables that go all the way

151
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,520
down the bottom are like frayed to the point

152
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,880
to where you think if you were to like jump on

153
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,600
and try to shimmy down, it might break.

154
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,400
Dang, my usual method of going downstairs

155
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,320
is out of adequate question.

156
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
It's okay.

157
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,520
I'm sure we'll encounter a sewer very soon.

158
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,680
Fellas, any ideas about how to save that woman's life?

159
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,440
We got to check the toilets.

160
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,280
Maybe there's a cow toilet.

161
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,840
See if we can get flushed down.

162
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,680
Yes, maybe there's a cow toilet in the restaurant.

163
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,000
We don't know how fresh their beef was.

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,280
Is there a giant cow-sized toilet

165
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,040
to get flushed down on this level?

166
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,720
All right, let me roll now.

167
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,200
Meat hook in this line of work,

168
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,920
sometimes the person gets eaten.

169
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,800
You all don't even care.

170
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,520
You look so complacent.

171
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Isn't this your dude, Shelly?

172
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,640
Why is he doing that?

173
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,200
It's not that we don't care.

174
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,360
It's just that stopping him is our only option here.

175
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,440
And right now we've got to find a way to stop him.

176
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,200
We also don't know that they're not perfectly fine in there.

177
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,320
We can also take this out on our children

178
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,300
or wives or whatever later.

179
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,440
Specifically for that we've written down.

180
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,560
Yeah, like subtracting from your bonds.

181
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,680
Something like that, yeah.

182
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,720
Metaphorically.

183
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,000
Is there a door to where the old observation deck

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,520
used to be even though I know the deck fell off?

185
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,040
That is correct, there is a door

186
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,280
and it's got tape like over it

187
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,800
trying to warn people to not go in this general area

188
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,560
as it is dangerous as the door is not there.

189
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,340
It's just the open wind, the summer wind coming through

190
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,360
and the smell of the parking lot.

191
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,280
Does it happen to be right over the holes?

192
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,560
Oh yeah, of course it is.

193
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,080
I can't get open.

194
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,760
Do something, throw something at him.

195
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,400
Hey, take this and we'll do it at the same time

196
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,000
and I give her the small Bigfoot

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,280
and I dangle the Bigfoot over the hole

198
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
which he happens to be close to, right?

199
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,480
On the count of three we're gonna clap

200
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,000
which requires both hands which will make us drop these.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,080
I see exactly what you're going for and I'm in.

202
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,860
One, two, three.

203
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,840
Go ahead and roll.

204
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,020
The foot's full.

205
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,740
What are we rolling for?

206
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,680
I think you can either roll dexterity or athletics here.

207
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,520
Or Bigfoot.

208
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,920
Or Bigfoot obviously, dropping Bigfoot

209
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,760
if that's a craft skill.

210
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Yeah, I got a 46, that's a pass.

211
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,720
Nice.

212
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,440
I didn't hear any of the things that you said

213
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,260
to go for. What did you roll?

214
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,100
25.

215
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,720
Oh, what is your dexterity or athletics?

216
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,560
More than that.

217
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes it is and with that,

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,220
describe these two bigfoots falling please.

219
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,760
It's just like a long beard

220
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,760
and a kind of Neanderthal face with a hairy body

221
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,880
but it's got, it's like a plastic troll doll underneath

222
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,600
so it's pretty hard when it's coming at speed.

223
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Oh yeah.

224
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,260
Flung.

225
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,840
It's companion, same thing, much larger

226
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,540
and I said it was stuffed, it's not.

227
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,540
It's also got the big, hard troll body.

228
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,860
And they're somersaulting through the air

229
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,760
as if they're in a beautiful ballet in the sky.

230
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,920
It's stuffed with trolls.

231
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,160
Exactly, and the truth.

232
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
I'm aiming for the dude.

233
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,720
I wanna distract him so that he comes after us

234
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,480
and we can save this woman's life.

235
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,320
Fantastic.

236
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm aiming for the hole.

237
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,080
Okay, one bigfoot, large one?

238
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,640
I had the large one, yes.

239
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,840
Goes directly, perfect hit, dude perfect

240
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,160
from the top of the zeitgeist into the bottom of this hole

241
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,440
and as it hits the bottom.

242
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,280
Vincenti braces to be teleported back to non-existence.

243
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,640
It bounces and then lands softly, lifelessly

244
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,200
like a stuffed bigfoot that you might get at a carnival

245
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,900
at the bottom of a dirt pit.

246
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,400
And the other bigfoot knocks Dr. Brock Hargrave

247
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,240
right in the hand as he pulls out a syringe, shatters it.

248
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,720
I rolled combat for the woman who he was going for

249
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,380
and Luke, what did I roll?

250
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,520
You rolled what I assume is a critical success with a 22.

251
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,880
And then I rolled damage for when she grabs the shovel.

252
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,820
Right, she grabbed a shovel which I assume is a D8.

253
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,400
So he rolled a D8 and he got an eight.

254
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,720
Even up from like from up here, we can see it glistens.

255
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,720
And the sharp tip goes directly in to the soft belly.

256
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,360
That's where all the people are.

257
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Of Dr. Brock Hargrave.

258
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,840
The extra soft belly.

259
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,160
He falls to his knees.

260
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,040
You see blood splattering out onto the ground.

261
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,640
I need everyone to roll grip again for violence.

262
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,880
Can Shelley celebrate?

263
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,720
18.

264
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,540
A custom.

265
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,640
I am happy at this violence.

266
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
Vincente goes, fucking excellent shot kid.

267
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,060
And then he throws up.

268
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,960
Lose one grip.

269
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,800
For failing?

270
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,620
For failing.

271
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,460
Shelley lost.

272
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,840
Lose one grip for failing as you also have

273
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,880
just like a stomach turning reaction.

274
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
That should have been me.

275
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,920
Don't worry doc, there's a lot of professional rivals

276
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,280
you might one day get to kill.

277
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,480
I believe Jimmy Corrigan is.

278
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,360
I thought he was adapted.

279
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
That was actually a different character.

280
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,760
So I rolled and passed which makes sense.

281
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,220
Cause he's seen a lot of death.

282
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,520
Seen a lot of death, seen a lot of blood.

283
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,680
It continues to just ooze out

284
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,400
and you see one of his intestines falls out of the hole

285
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,600
onto the ground, dripping.

286
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,800
And he's just kind of shaking violently on his knees

287
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,640
and then he falls.

288
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,280
I feel like we should go down there.

289
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,920
But if Meadhope glances around the top of this observatory

290
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,400
real quick, is there anything else of interest up here?

291
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,360
What are you looking for?

292
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,600
What about a length of rope that they used to hang aliens

293
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,840
off the side of during the parties?

294
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,640
Or perhaps a banner?

295
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,120
A banner is good.

296
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,160
Rush hour two style.

297
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,040
Okay, we've had a couple of bad experiences

298
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,720
but I think we're all getting pretty lazy.

299
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,520
I think we can handle the stairs.

300
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
Vincent has his eyes closed.

301
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,540
I rolled a hundred.

302
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,540
Oh, wait, I'm gonna use my, wait, what this word?

303
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,880
That's a one.

304
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,200
Ooh, he found a loophole.

305
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,800
I'm gonna use my luck.

306
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,160
He can make it a one?

307
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah.

308
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,820
Boom.

309
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,660
Luck spent.

310
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,480
Ooh, I like it.

311
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,280
You only have half a luck, take mine.

312
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,840
Vincent grabs half of a luck,

313
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,200
forms it with his own half luck, spins it to...

314
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,400
You almost fall head first into a closet, but then...

315
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,320
Look at this industrial strength rope with climbing gear.

316
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,600
Yeah, with a crit success,

317
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,280
you just find like a fireman's ladder

318
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,080
that's used for exactly this purpose.

319
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,240
Yeah, it's in the closet.

320
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,640
It's just in the back of the closet.

321
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,480
You move some stuff out of the way.

322
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
You have to clown fireman's ladder

323
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,440
so it's shoved in there, but when you get it out.

324
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,240
It goes to the ground, there's a hole in the ground.

325
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,900
Yeah, because ladders are easier to go down than stairs.

326
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,120
Everybody knows that.

327
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,360
Right, less dangerous, more stable.

328
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,280
Oh, you guys don't have to roll for a fireman's ladder.

329
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,560
He does the, he presses the extendo release button

330
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,040
on the fireman's ladder and it just shoots down

331
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,880
to the bottom and I look at Mead Hook

332
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,400
and say, get scuttling, kid.

333
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,800
I scuttle.

334
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,200
When I's told to scuttle, I scuttle.

335
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,680
A tear forms in Jimmy's eyes and he's like,

336
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,200
he didn't say shimmy.

337
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,840
I need everyone shimmying down to roll.

338
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,960
I'm taking the stairs.

339
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,680
Alertness or dexterity.

340
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,600
And if you're taking the stairs, do the same.

341
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,880
Just an eight, a definite success.

342
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,720
Success in here.

343
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,440
Finally able to go up and or down.

344
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,360
Something fashion to do just that.

345
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,880
We get to use your hands and your feet on this one,

346
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,720
so it's easier.

347
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,400
I pass my scuttle.

348
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,600
Scuttle.

349
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,300
I pass my stairs, but I fail my alertness,

350
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,040
which makes sense because I'm the only one

351
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,720
going down the stairwell.

352
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,560
I failed.

353
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,400
Dead silent.

354
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,640
Oh, I didn't roll alertness.

355
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,080
Fail alert.

356
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,920
Not alert.

357
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,960
I'm focusing on safely scuttling.

358
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,320
I pass alertness.

359
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,180
Okay, as the four of you are heading down

360
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,620
to the base of the zeitgeist,

361
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,000
Jimmy Corrigan and the stairs all alone meet Hook

362
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
and Vincent D'Bori focusing deeply

363
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,800
on making their way down the pole.

364
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Scuttle, scuttle, scuttle.

365
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,800
And Shelly St. Blythe, who is lively going down

366
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,880
and you notice that there's a window actually

367
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,320
out this side, just like a thin window

368
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,680
going all the way down.

369
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,560
So you've got a clear view as you head down

370
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,740
this fireman's pole for not a single fireman in sight.

371
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,560
And you see this woman just shaking,

372
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,800
her hands covered in blood,

373
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,160
and she kicks the body of Dr. Brock Hargrave

374
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,240
into one of the holes and begins covering it

375
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,400
with the mound of dirt that's next to it

376
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
as fast as she can.

377
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,520
Wait, we'll help you.

378
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,760
We saw everything.

379
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,600
What?

380
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,440
You're all right.

381
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,120
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

382
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

383
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,220
No one could have seen that.

384
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,060
No one could have known.

385
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,880
We're the good guys.

386
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,480
Who the fuck are you?

387
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,520
My name's Brandy.

388
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,620
You're a fine girl.

389
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,120
If you were worried about being incriminated,

390
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,880
now I got more information.

391
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,040
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

392
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,120
Brandy, it's okay.

393
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,800
I'm just trying to teach you a little bit about the world

394
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
as my dads did for me.

395
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,440
Brandy, how'd this guy find you?

396
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,160
We were just, we were just at a bar.

397
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,680
Oh shit, shit, shit, where, where's, where's.

398
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,400
Which bar did he find you at?

399
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,960
The Iliad.

400
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,560
Fuck, fuck, where's Brandon?

401
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,480
Where's Brandon?

402
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,000
Jimmy sighs deeply and he's like,

403
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,960
your boyfriend's name is Brandon.

404
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
Oh shit, my name's Brandy.

405
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,920
Okay, I see, I hear it now.

406
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,840
You never heard it before?

407
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,720
Nobody ever thought that was weird?

408
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,280
You're just now getting this.

409
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,040
I didn't, no, it's not the time.

410
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
It's not the time, but I also wanna say,

411
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,400
Brandy, we don't know for sure

412
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,840
that if you hadn't gutted that man,

413
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,920
we couldn't have gotten Brandon safely out of there.

414
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,960
Out of where?

415
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,400
Yeah, he's in his stomach.

416
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,960
We might as well try.

417
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,880
And he brushes away some of the dirt

418
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,600
and tries to open the stomach.

419
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,280
Do you hop down into the?

420
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,440
No, I peer in.

421
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,160
Okay, so you're gonna have to like lay down

422
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,360
on the ground to like. Sure.

423
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,920
Okay, so you lay down on the ground

424
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,880
with your arms outstretched down to the bottom of this pit.

425
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,440
You're like pulling at the wound?

426
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,320
Yeah, at the wound, I guess, yeah.

427
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,160
Or like trying to, did I see him belly button pull?

428
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,200
I mean, now there's a gash there

429
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,520
where she stabbed him with the shovel.

430
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,880
So it's really easy to do now.

431
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,960
Yeah, I use that opening.

432
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,240
Roll grip, because that's fucking gross.

433
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,080
It is.

434
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
40 on a 40.

435
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,760
Damn.

436
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,160
With his success, you lose no grip on reality

437
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,400
as you have done this kind of shit before.

438
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,400
And everyone kind of notices the like steady sure hand

439
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,440
that Vincentibori is taking as he pulls apart the abdomen

440
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,760
of Dr. Brock Hargrave inside of this pit.

441
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,360
I worked at the old man's meat shop.

442
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,680
I done it a hundred times, except on like animals, but.

443
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
Intestines begin falling out.

444
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,320
Blood is just covering your hands now, Vincenti.

445
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,680
And you see there's a kidney's spleen.

446
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,080
It's just like all just in your hands as you're reaching in.

447
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,200
Yeah, there's no, there's no Brandon in here.

448
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,040
What?

449
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,880
She just throws up all over the ground.

450
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,640
I thought he was just there.

451
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
Starts crying.

452
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,320
It's okay, Brandon.

453
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,120
You kind of fucked this whole thing up for us, Brandy.

454
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm gonna touch her hair to calm her.

455
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,840
It's okay.

456
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,480
I seen people do this.

457
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,960
Hey doctor, do you know anything

458
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,440
about what's in that syringe?

459
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,360
I'm almost there.

460
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,200
Give me a moment.

461
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
He's coming down the last few rungs.

462
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,800
What did I miss?

463
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,640
What did I miss?

464
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,680
Oh, doc.

465
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,720
Vincenti.

466
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,240
They're not in his intestines.

467
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,920
Eviscerated somebody.

468
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,920
I see.

469
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,760
It's okay though.

470
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,240
He went to work in his old man's meat shop.

471
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,200
I guess the intestines

472
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,160
were already out. I did.

473
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,920
So there was that.

474
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,320
And I suppose you did not find the man inside there.

475
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,600
No, Brandon, this is Brandy.

476
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,640
Hey Brandy.

477
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
And her boyfriend's name was Brandon.

478
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
Yee-hoo!

479
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,440
Brandy and Brandon, huh, yes.

480
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
We all saw him go in there though.

481
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,520
There's gotta be a trap door to this belly or something.

482
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,720
I do wanna pick up that syringe and take a look at it.

483
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,400
I've got 40 forensics.

484
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
Is that something that would cover?

485
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,000
It wouldn't, no.

486
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,520
I've also got, oh no, I don't have-

487
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,800
Oh, I have pharmacy.

488
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,640
Yeah.

489
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,400
Pharmacy will do it.

490
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,960
Hold on.

491
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,600
I've seen a syringe or two in my day.

492
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,160
Let me take a look-see.

493
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,880
Thank you, laughter.

494
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,960
That's a 17.

495
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,800
That'll do.

496
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,360
Ooh.

497
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,440
What does that mean?

498
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,160
What's in the syringe?

499
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,640
You kind of squirt some out the tip of the syringe

500
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,640
and smell it and you know that it is

501
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,640
some sort of a tranquilizer, like a horse tranquilizer,

502
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,680
some like ketamine adjacent.

503
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,520
So nothing supernatural.

504
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,360
No.

505
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,400
Hey, Rowan, are you still up in that tower?

506
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,240
Yes, I am.

507
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Thank you for asking.

508
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,680
God, why are you just the worst?

509
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,960
So unambitious.

510
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,800
Do you know anything about what's happening here?

511
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,480
Rowan is just shaking their head vigorously,

512
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,400
just back and forth.

513
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,040
No, no, no.

514
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,440
We could put it in him and see what it does

515
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,840
and then he won't talk anymore.

516
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,680
No.

517
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,240
And you see that the face of Rowan kind of disappears

518
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,720
as they walk backwards.

519
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,080
Once you say an idea, we gotta do it.

520
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,080
She shoves the needle in her hand, broken or not,

521
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,360
into his arm.

522
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,760
As he slides down the pole.

523
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,160
Rowan walks up to the group and you shove the syringe

524
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,200
into their arm and they're just like completely

525
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,600
not ready for it.

526
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,120
Completely caught off guard.

527
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,960
It's all right.

528
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,800
It's all right.

529
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,960
I'm a raptor.

530
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,840
Nobody panic.

531
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,800
I don't think they're actually a raptor.

532
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,000
I feel like a raptor.

533
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,360
Okay.

534
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,560
And Rowan is just like laughing, giggling,

535
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,840
and then they just kind of go quiet, staring at the ground.

536
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,520
I think he's just regular high.

537
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
This is a Christian podcast,

538
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,040
so we don't know what that's like.

539
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,120
So you imagine you're a dinosaur, right?

540
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,160
No, I mean, the only time I've done ketamine, the...

541
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,160
You were a raptor?

542
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,960
One of the people in the room thought he was a raptor,

543
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,040
started jumping up on all the furniture

544
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,920
with a couple of claws out, just kind of being a goober.

545
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,520
That didn't have anything to do with the ketamine.

546
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,720
That guy was probably just a raptor.

547
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,400
With my arms, it's still inside Dr. Prock.

548
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,520
So what the fuck do we do now?

549
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,360
Well.

550
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,640
This was the guy we were looking for.

551
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,880
I mean, I guess we could just tell Ruth Moses Esther

552
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,720
that we found him.

553
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,800
It seems like mission accomplished, yes.

554
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,320
I'm gonna give her a call.

555
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,960
Oh, I don't have a cell phone, though.

556
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,640
I like, yeah, I like kind of like nod my head to-

557
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,520
Turn your head to the side like you just did.

558
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,640
Yeah, nod my head to like where my back pocket,

559
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,480
where my cell phone is.

560
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,840
That's weird.

561
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,840
I'm laying down on the ground with blood all over my hands.

562
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,040
I grab the phone.

563
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,600
I give her a ring.

564
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,400
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

565
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,080
Vincenzi, Vincenzi, what's going on?

566
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Hello, it is me, Meat Hook, on the telephone.

567
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

568
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,920
Great phone etiquette, kid.

569
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,360
Yeah, so Meat Hook, is Vincenzi okay?

570
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,200
Is everyone okay?

571
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,280
Have you figured it out?

572
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,160
Have you found Dr. Prock?

573
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,800
We found him.

574
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,520
Everyone is not okay.

575
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Dr. Hargrave's guts are outside his body.

576
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,840
And, well, do you know anything about supernaturally

577
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,720
putting people inside yourself?

578
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,440
No, did you see anything like that occur?

579
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,960
Or I assume that you could get inside.

580
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,800
Do you know how it's done?

581
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,960
Do you know how it's done?

582
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,800
Did he tell you?

583
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,600
Well, we can't get any information

584
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,960
because he was murdered before we arrived here.

585
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,120
Hold on, let me check his pulse.

586
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,320
And I just kind of, don't move my hand for a little bit.

587
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,880
Is there, do I feel a pulse?

588
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,840
The blood has stopped like splooshing

589
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,680
like at a heartbeats rate.

590
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah, no, we can't ask him anything right now.

591
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,720
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

592
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,560
So how, did you take him out?

593
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,160
We met someone named Brandy.

594
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,480
She's wearing club wear.

595
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,520
And she's just, it was kind of self-defense.

596
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Brandy, are you there?

597
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,360
Let me give her the phone.

598
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,200
Oh shit.

599
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,000
Cool, I enjoy talking to your own NBC.

600
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,240
I like that he paused.

601
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,040
So you wanted to rip off comedy bang bang, right?

602
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,240
Until, all until you.

603
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,280
Completely forgot.

604
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,200
He paused to wait for a response.

605
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,040
Was the deal.

606
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,360
I would have to answer that.

607
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Let's see how it's done.

608
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,600
Did you see anything strange or out of the ordinary

609
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,720
throughout the process?

610
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,080
She's useless, take her out.

611
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,760
Like that's why they call it a handler.

612
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,160
Take her out, out.

613
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,800
Yeah, casualties are acceptable on this mission.

614
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,320
If I didn't tell you that before,

615
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,080
I think you should know by now.

616
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Hey, Meat Hook, I think it's time you prove yourself.

617
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,080
No, I don't want to kill her.

618
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,440
Good, you proved yourself.

619
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,600
Ruth, how should we proceed?

620
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,480
I mean, we found the target.

621
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,760
I guess you bring her back here, I guess.

622
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,440
And did you learn what he was trying to figure out?

623
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,280
No.

624
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,480
Shelly kind of walks up.

625
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,960
Does lost in the fungus mean anything to you?

626
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,280
To the fungus.

627
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,400
I mean, yeah, I've heard people going missing,

628
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,800
people talk about people getting lost in the fungus.

629
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,640
Disappear.

630
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
That's just an expression?

631
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,880
It's common between the cowboys.

632
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,280
It's an old city expression, yeah.

633
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,640
Lazarus, you seem a bit agitated.

634
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,720
You seem a bit agitated.

635
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,520
No, everything is so clear now.

636
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,400
You seem a bit more manic than when we last spoke.

637
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,680
Manic because I'm on the right path

638
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,960
doing all the right things.

639
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,800
Is this the path that our mutual friends have set you on

640
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,040
or is this a path of self-discovery?

641
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,000
What's the difference?

642
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,680
You take your directions from me

643
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,120
because I am the handler, I'm in charge.

644
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,320
It's possible she's become a raptor,

645
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,600
if you know what I mean.

646
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,880
I'm getting big raptor energy here.

647
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,480
Hey, we never asked and we should have.

648
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,760
Why did your place reek of cat piss when there were no cats?

649
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,960
I've been trying to, I've been having to stay up,

650
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,920
I've been having to stay up to take care of this mission.

651
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,800
What does that have to do with cat piss?

652
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,440
Oh, you've been buying from the strummers.

653
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,840
Or producing.

654
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,880
Okay, okay, oh, oh, oh, I'm all high and mighty.

655
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,720
I've never done anything weird or bad

656
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,240
that the dare officer would disapprove of in my life.

657
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,600
I'm a fucking piece of shit square.

658
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,680
Okay, like that's, we got to do with the things

659
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,960
that the commission makes us have to do

660
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,600
because I had to stay awake and I had to find the numbers

661
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,200
and I had to figure it out and it's 836, 836.

662
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,000
It's around holy cow farms and it's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

663
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,320
Hey, 836, we found holes that say that.

664
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,840
I don't know if we should give her any more information.

665
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,800
Yes, I feel that she may be compromised.

666
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,640
That's what time we were supposed to meet.

667
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,160
At the Bible study.

668
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

669
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,320
Holy shit.

670
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,360
That's right, that's right.

671
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,240
That's some fucking good note taking.

672
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,760
Hey, this is something that's not come up as players ever.

673
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,720
What do you do when your Delta Green handler is insane?

674
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,080
Who do you call?

675
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,560
I mean, not the obvious answer to that question.

676
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,720
Yeah, just the cops.

677
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,880
The cops.

678
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,080
I don't know what to do.

679
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,160
Meat Hook, could you take her off speakerphone

680
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,560
for just a second?

681
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,400
Yeah.

682
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,960
Don't take me off speakerphone.

683
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,520
I'm sorry, Lazarus, Ruth, we need to have a sidebar.

684
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,840
I already hung up on her.

685
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,200
So I think we got to, I get up off the ground.

686
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,120
I stopped playing with his guts.

687
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,080
Wet hands.

688
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,120
Maybe she knows something about the numbers though.

689
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,360
Maybe that's a bigger clue.

690
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,320
Eight, three, six.

691
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,880
I don't know.

692
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,520
Do you think there's anything to be learned

693
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,320
at Trigate Supply?

694
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,880
I guess not until the morning.

695
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,240
Well, she wanted us to bring his body back,

696
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,320
but that feels very incriminating.

697
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,000
I mean, we didn't even kill him.

698
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,320
Also, you should probably get all that blood

699
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,600
off your hands, Vincente.

700
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,360
He is also already in a hole.

701
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,160
A whole lot of trouble.

702
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,600
Usually I just do what she asked me to do

703
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,360
and it's proven to be the best choice so far.

704
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,280
So, I mean, I think we just-

705
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,040
Vincente, you heard her.

706
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,360
She's not the same person

707
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,080
who was making those calls before.

708
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,400
She's gone.

709
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,320
She's not gone.

710
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,880
We can help, maybe we can help her.

711
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,720
Now that the mission's over.

712
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,640
Maybe we have to eliminate her.

713
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,800
Kill Ruth?

714
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,480
She basically said it herself.

715
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,960
This wasn't a mission, it's something she gave us.

716
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,080
But she's the handler, the guys, the lizard people,

717
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,040
whoever give it to her. Who handles the handler.

718
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,840
I never asked and I never really cared.

719
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,120
I think we take the body to her,

720
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,960
we find out she probably knows about the numbers.

721
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,120
What if enabling her enables something much worse?

722
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,760
I'm not here to discern that.

723
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm here to do a job.

724
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,040
Then we have to rethink this whole parenthood situation.

725
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,400
What do you think, Shelly?

726
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,360
Shelly's been kinda staring down in the hole at the body

727
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,840
and he wants to jump down into the hole.

728
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,680
Can you do that?

729
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,520
Yeah.

730
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,760
Look in the ear,

731
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,120
cause he stuck his finger in his ear

732
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,000
and then into his mouth.

733
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,520
I wanna see if he got anything out of there.

734
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,520
You smell it first when you kinda get down close

735
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
to look inside.

736
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,840
It's like a salty, horrible earwax smell

737
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,680
mixed with like the ocean,

738
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,520
mixed with like an earthy.

739
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Is it perhaps fungus-like?

740
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,160
I mean, when something earthy

741
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,640
is like mixed with the wet and the saline

742
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,480
for long enough.

743
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,920
Those are the conditions there, too.

744
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,840
It's almost as if something might be growing.

745
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Comrades, down here please for your attention.

746
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,720
There seems to be a growth of sorts in Hargrave's ear.

747
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,440
I believe I found the aforementioned fungus

748
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,560
that one gets lost in.

749
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,120
Is it in his fucking brain?

750
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,280
Be very careful, doctor.

751
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,960
I can't tell how deep it goes,

752
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,600
but it does look as though it's cultivated here.

753
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
Can you get a sample?

754
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,160
I will attempt to do so now.

755
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,080
Do I need to roll?

756
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,920
No.

757
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,400
I think he pulls just a pin out of his pocket.

758
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,360
No, just touch it.

759
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
Yeah, just touch it, you fucking idiot.

760
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,560
Use the little puppet hands.

761
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,960
They'll fit right in there.

762
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,400
I whip out Craig Mile.

763
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,680
Craig Mile, I know this isn't your normal job.

764
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
I need you now.

765
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,600
You put a little lab coat and goggles on.

766
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,320
Tiny little rubber gloves on the ends.

767
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,760
And he maneuvers Craig Mile's hand in there

768
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,400
and makes it do a perfect scooping motion.

769
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,320
And pulls it out.

770
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,840
And then he grabs a sandwich bag that he always has on him

771
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,800
from after lunch.

772
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,280
Yeah, of course.

773
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,360
And scoops it into the bag.

774
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,840
After lunch is my favorite of the before trilogy.

775
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,200
Can we do a little experiment with that?

776
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,080
What do you think?

777
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,920
Hey, Rowan.

778
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Rowan looks up at you, bags so deep under the eyes,

779
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,320
falling even heavier, seemingly,

780
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,120
as these dead eyes look at you.

781
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,960
It's time for a snack.

782
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,800
I pass the bag up to Meat Hook here.

783
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,640
Are you hungry?

784
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,460
Yeah.

785
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,300
There you go, Meat Hook.

786
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,280
I do believe it is time for science.

787
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,120
Okay.

788
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,200
Shelly's also starting to get out of the hole

789
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,320
and on his way out, he spits on the body of Hargrave.

790
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,520
He steps on his nose.

791
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,360
I'm gonna, when you're picking up dog poop

792
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,720
and you put your hand on the outside of the plastic bag,

793
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,440
but don't touch what's inside, but reversed.

794
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,720
And I'm gonna put just a little bit into his mouth.

795
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,560
Okay.

796
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,920
Hey, Becca.

797
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,300
Thanks.

798
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,280
Meat Hook is the closest

799
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,340
to Rowan when this happens.

800
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,040
And as the substance that was in the ear

801
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,040
of Dr. Brock Hargrave touches the mouth

802
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,040
and goes into the esophagus of Rowan Fitzpatrick.

803
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,680
Meat Hook, you are overcome with a need,

804
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,720
a feverish, rabid desire to get in the belly

805
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,240
of Rowan Fitzpatrick by any means necessary.

806
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,880
I need you to roll power at a negative 40

807
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,120
to fight against this.

808
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,280
Oof, get in my belly.

809
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,120
Yeah, I'm gonna get in that belly.

810
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,320
Kid, don't do it.

811
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,520
What are you talking about?

812
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,360
I'm gonna get in.

813
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,200
It's my creep now.

814
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,040
It is really.

815
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,080
My dads highly advise you against getting in that belly.

816
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,640
Okay, so I rolled a 35.

817
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,960
My power is a 60.

818
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,320
But you needed me to roll a 20 or below.

819
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,160
I did.

820
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,000
Oh, man.

821
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,080
So I just start digging in that belly button

822
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,480
to make a little spot, a little basement nest,

823
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
if you will, for a rat curl.

824
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,040
I can't lose another daughter.

825
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,840
We've got a basement nest for you here.

826
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,360
Basement creep now.

827
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,120
Remember how repulsed you were by this person earlier.

828
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,240
So we are going to go into combat order here,

829
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,700
which is in order of dexterity.

830
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,640
So call out your dexterity, please.

831
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,480
70.

832
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,320
50.

833
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,140
50.

834
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,980
65.

835
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,400
Okay, so it's gonna start with Meat Hook,

836
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,160
go to Vincenty, and then because we're already

837
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,280
going that way, we'll go Shelly and then Jimmy.

838
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,040
And with that, Meat Hook,

839
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,760
you are fighting tooth and nail

840
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,920
to get inside Rowan Fitzpatrick.

841
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,520
Hell yes, I am.

842
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,080
This is the answer I've been waiting for all my life.

843
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,200
Who would have ever thought Rowan Fitzpatrick

844
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,280
would hold it?

845
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,680
But now I need to know what's in there.

846
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,240
And I just try and rip it open.

847
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,680
Yeah, and because you did the syringe, there's no contest.

848
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,480
So if you succeed, you succeed.

849
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,760
I rolled a 77 and I needed a 50, so that's a crit fail.

850
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
Oh, shit.

851
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,040
So is that, that might be good for us.

852
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,860
I don't know.

853
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,120
That depends on your goal.

854
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,220
It definitely depends on your goal.

855
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,400
With a critical failure, as you are desperately

856
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,400
trying to crawl into the stomach area of Rowan Fitzpatrick,

857
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,000
you slip and one of, your hand reaches out

858
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,840
and just goes directly soft through,

859
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,960
like you're putting your hand into a bowl of jello,

860
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,600
just like into the middle of Rowan Fitzpatrick.

861
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,000
And you hold on, and I need you to roll a grip

862
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,780
as you hold on to this weird kind of like bouncy,

863
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,920
synthetic feeling substance on the other side.

864
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,240
Zach is in grip to me in grip.

865
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,120
88 would be a crit fail.

866
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,880
Holy shit, wow.

867
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,640
All right, okay.

868
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,600
So two crit fails in a row.

869
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,040
No.

870
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,760
Oh, that means you get slimed.

871
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,080
Click the button.

872
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,040
It's not working.

873
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,760
So I need you to, well, I was gonna have you roll a D8

874
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,080
and add one for your grip loss, but when you crit fail,

875
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,360
you just take the maximum.

876
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,560
So that's nine.

877
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,480
Okay.

878
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,280
So you lose nine grip in one fell swoop,

879
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,280
which means that you are on a temporary loss

880
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,120
of yourself from reality.

881
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,320
We weren't there already?

882
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,160
Okay.

883
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,840
I just start humming Mamma Mia.

884
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,920
And is it because you have three dads now?

885
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,760
Yeah, exactly.

886
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,680
Yes, exactly.

887
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,520
Genius.

888
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,920
You feel a hand reach out and grab your wrist.

889
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,760
Holy shit.

890
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,800
Oh, my friend, you found me.

891
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,640
Brandon, I'm coming.

892
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,480
I'm coming.

893
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,320
I'm coming.

894
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,160
I'm coming.

895
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm coming.

896
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,840
I'm coming.

897
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,680
I'm coming.

898
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm coming.

899
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,360
I'm coming.

900
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,440
Brandon, I'm coming.

901
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,920
And now it is the turn of Vincenty Bory.

902
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,920
You've got Meat Hook up to one elbow in Rowan Fitzpatrick,

903
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,200
a normal role-playing sentence.

904
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,080
Vincenty's thinking when Hargrave died,

905
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,280
his portal belly went away.

906
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,200
She's how far in?

907
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,040
Just an arm?

908
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,080
Elbow, yep, single elbow.

909
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,480
Meat Hook, I'm so fucking sorry.

910
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,520
And I pull my revolver out

911
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,120
and I want to shoot Rowan in the face.

912
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
You have good firearms?

913
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,320
I got good firearms.

914
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,880
Okay.

915
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,720
What?

916
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,560
Strong choice.

917
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,560
Go ahead and roll firearms.

918
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,080
I do not pass my firearms.

919
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,640
85 on a 50.

920
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,840
You didn't have good firearms.

921
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,480
50's like I went to college

922
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,040
and got a doctorate in firearms.

923
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,880
No.

924
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,800
According to the rules.

925
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,000
I think according to the rule book,

926
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,600
a 50 would be above a college degree in something.

927
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,680
It's firearms.

928
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,360
I forgot to load my fucking revolver

929
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,560
in this particular chamber.

930
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,400
That's an out that doesn't kill Meat Hook.

931
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
And your turn's over.

932
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,360
And we move on to Shelly Seamblithe.

933
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,200
Shelly sees that Meat Hook is going in

934
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,240
so he wants to grab a leg.

935
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,720
He's pulling back the other way.

936
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,560
Tug of war.

937
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,400
Yep, tug of war time.

938
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,080
That's a way more logical move.

939
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,680
As you roll strength.

940
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,120
My basement creep, you're coming with us.

941
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I rolled an eight.

942
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,280
Oh, that is good if it wasn't in a contest.

943
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,840
Yep, hold on.

944
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,760
Yeah, I did that math right.

945
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,480
Okay, I've got an 80 firearms and an 85 strength.

946
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,720
So I'm going to join Shelly.

947
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,440
I was going to say, I just passed with a 24.

948
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,800
So you can add your success onto the eight

949
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,960
to try to beat a 24.

950
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
It's a 96.

951
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh no.

952
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,640
Doesn't an eight beat a 24?

953
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,480
It's got to be.

954
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Not in a contest.

955
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Yeah, if it's a contest,

956
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,760
you have to roll higher under the score.

957
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,160
The worst critical thing.

958
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,440
Higher under?

959
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,120
Your rules are nutty.

960
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,960
It's blackjack rules.

961
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,240
That's what Thomas keeps saying.

962
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,120
Yeah, I don't like them either.

963
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,680
But they're not our rules.

964
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,200
Because you're telling the dice to roll low.

965
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,840
You know, you can't tell the dice two things.

966
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,680
I know, exactly.

967
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,760
You got to tell the dice to roll as high as possible

968
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,440
while still being a success.

969
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,080
But it makes sense because if you have a higher level skill,

970
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,760
you can roll a higher number and still win.

971
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,320
Yeah, but it feels weird.

972
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,760
You're not wrong.

973
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,880
I've been on Zach's side this whole time.

974
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,040
But holy shit, that's not good.

975
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,760
So yeah, Thomas did the crit-est of crit fails

976
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,600
in our own rules.

977
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,040
Yeah, I didn't roll a 69.

978
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,560
I rolled a 96 trying to pull you out with.

979
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,760
Not nice.

980
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,120
That's like two angry people

981
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,640
that don't even want to look at each other.

982
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,920
Yeah, they're not pleasuring each other orally.

983
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,720
They're farting on each other with their backs turned.

984
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,680
Yeah, they're sleeping in fetal positions

985
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,920
in opposite directions.

986
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,940
One's upside down.

987
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,640
Angry in it, opposite end of the bed.

988
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,720
Meat Hook is gonna-

989
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,680
I'm gonna turn my back to you.

990
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,680
Grab onto this hand that she found inside the belly.

991
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,040
I kind of want to try and pull the hand out,

992
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,120
but I'm wondering if the need to go inside the belly

993
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,480
has changed at all.

994
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,680
Or if my crit fail means I'm just jumping on it.

995
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,080
I love the pulling at the hand.

996
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,200
Yeah, that's fun.

997
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,640
Hold on, what's in here?

998
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,680
What grip did you have and what was your breaking point?

999
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,520
Oh.

1000
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,340
I'm not at the breaking point yet.

1001
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,280
That's right, but you rolled over five.

1002
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,120
So we're gonna actually go-

1003
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,360
I'm sorry, I completely missed that.

1004
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,200
Basically at this point what we do-

1005
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,840
I'll be the DM for a minute.

1006
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,880
Thank you.

1007
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,560
At this point, we roll a D6

1008
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,480
and we put in order fight, flight, or freeze.

1009
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,240
And so if you think that Meat Hook

1010
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
would be most likely to fight,

1011
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,400
you put that at the top and that would be four, five, and six.

1012
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,840
You text flight to fight to four, five, six.

1013
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,080
Four, two, oh, six, nine, six, nine.

1014
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,560
And if you think it's second-

1015
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,200
Wait, no, it only gets two numbers.

1016
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,040
Five and six.

1017
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,360
And then the second most likely that you think

1018
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,280
if you roll a two or a three,

1019
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,560
then you do that one.

1020
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,480
And then the last one that you think is the least likely

1021
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,320
is just a one.

1022
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,720
You mean given my insanity what's most and least likely?

1023
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,560
That is correct.

1024
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,000
Okay, well flight means crawling in this belly.

1025
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,720
So that's the most likely.

1026
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,560
Okay.

1027
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,920
Fight is probably her natural inclination.

1028
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,000
So that's next.

1029
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,640
And then freeze, yeah, that's the least likely.

1030
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,520
Okay, that's perfect.

1031
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,040
Oh no. It's a five.

1032
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,840
Five is flight.

1033
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,280
We jump on it.

1034
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,360
I take the hand and I let the hand pull me

1035
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,520
as I just relax my body.

1036
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,240
Yeah.

1037
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,840
You all see Meat Hook fully engulfed

1038
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,880
by the midriff of Rowan Fitzpatrick.

1039
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,520
I need you all to roll grip.

1040
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,760
Completely inside?

1041
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,680
As she disappears from view entirely.

1042
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,080
You see a steel-tipped boot

1043
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,080
with a lot of extra studs and spikes stuck out of it.

1044
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,200
Kind of get caught on the edge of the skull buckle

1045
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,560
and then before going in.

1046
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,160
I am not okay with seeing our new adoptive child

1047
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,200
sucked up into that man's belly.

1048
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,600
This is fish face all over again.

1049
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,440
Did I mention I'm 27?

1050
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,400
It's okay though.

1051
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,440
I failed.

1052
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,960
How old were you when your parents

1053
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,760
dropped you off at the place?

1054
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,800
Seven.

1055
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,640
Oh, okay.

1056
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,880
20 years in the hole.

1057
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,120
So that's where I'm stuck mentally, you know?

1058
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,960
So then fish face is still very problematic.

1059
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,800
Oh yeah.

1060
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,640
Oh yeah.

1061
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,000
Well, no one ever debated that.

1062
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,280
Joe, how did Shelly St. Blythe do that?

1063
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,360
I passed.

1064
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,440
Okay, so the single pass here on the grip.

1065
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,440
You only lose one with the disappearance of Meat Hook.

1066
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,920
The other two of you, I need you to roll a D6 and add one.

1067
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,720
So when, fuck.

1068
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,200
That's an eight for me.

1069
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,840
Puts me past, well past my breaking point.

1070
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,960
How could it be A is D6 plus one?

1071
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
You said plus two, I thought.

1072
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,000
Oh, sure.

1073
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,080
He did not.

1074
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,160
Oh, well a seven still puts me past my breaking point.

1075
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,360
And a temporary grip loss.

1076
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,680
Teacher, didn't we have a quiz?

1077
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,560
No, I never fucking said we had a quiz.

1078
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,440
When Corrigan failed his, Extreme failed

1079
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,980
his strength check, I think he fell backwards

1080
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,820
and it knocked me off.

1081
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,640
I was gonna say, yeah, we didn't ever resolve that.

1082
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,680
Cause I was still holding on to her leg,

1083
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,880
but we'll say that I am not now.

1084
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,120
No, you definitely fell back.

1085
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,760
Along with the critical failure there.

1086
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,520
I lost four grip, but I'm still well above

1087
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,360
my breaking point.

1088
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,020
Okay, and with four, you don't need to fight

1089
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,460
flight or freeze, however.

1090
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,340
I'm going fight, fight, freeze.

1091
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,680
You said D6 plus one?

1092
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,500
Yes, I did.

1093
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,340
So I lost five.

1094
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,860
And you're gonna do the same.

1095
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,700
Freeze.

1096
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,520
Freeze.

1097
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,240
Fincenzi Bori freezes in his tracks, unable to move.

1098
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,440
Lost in thought.

1099
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,640
Jimmy Corrigan fights, he fucking thrusts

1100
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,640
both arms into the belly of Rowan.

1101
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,100
And as you do so, I need you to roll a D4 minus one

1102
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:33,940
for damage.

1103
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,800
That made a cool noise.

1104
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,640
Two.

1105
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,140
Two minus one?

1106
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,120
Two minus one is one?

1107
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,960
No, no, no.

1108
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,080
And so with a two hit point loss,

1109
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,200
you just punch with both fists into the stomach.

1110
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,360
The abs you feel just like, oh,

1111
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,680
you get a slight response out of Rowan for the first time.

1112
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,080
And then it's just, and then just continues

1113
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,120
to just dead eyes look at the ground.

1114
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,180
Where's that ear fungus?

1115
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,220
Give me that fucking ear fungus.

1116
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,800
Is the bag that had the fungus lying anywhere?

1117
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,240
That would be on the ground.

1118
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,040
I'll use my luck to have dropped it.

1119
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,880
Yeah, no, I think you could have dropped it.

1120
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,160
I like that, I like that.

1121
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,560
We'll let it ride.

1122
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,480
So you've dropped it on the ground there,

1123
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,200
but I actually at this point need a roll.

1124
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,800
I need a con roll from Meat Hook.

1125
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,640
Oh.

1126
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,840
Oh, pass, 49 under 50.

1127
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,120
What wonders is she going to see in there?

1128
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,460
You're not sure about anything that's been happening

1129
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,720
so far, Jimmy Corrigan, but you do know that

1130
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,400
when you punch the stomach of Rowan Fitzpatrick,

1131
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,400
they explode like in half.

1132
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,920
Exactly where you punch, just like right at the midriff,

1133
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,760
exactly where Meat Hook just went in.

1134
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,400
They just, something like as if the building

1135
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,800
was being dropped, but all the detonation spots

1136
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,800
were like halfway through.

1137
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,440
It just boom, and then the top half just kind of falls

1138
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,240
a little bit, slump, slop on slop, human inside

1139
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,560
on human inside.

1140
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,660
And the top half falls, and then the knees fall,

1141
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,680
just like when you shot people in the dick in GoldenEye.

1142
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,320
Do I need to roll a grip for that?

1143
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,160
Yeah.

1144
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,520
Uh, that's a fail.

1145
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,800
I need grip checks from the other two of you as well.

1146
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,160
Jesus.

1147
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,220
I pass.

1148
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,520
One grip loss with a pass.

1149
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,120
I'm going to death of a thousand cuts, lose my mind.

1150
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,720
Again, 1d4 plus one.

1151
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,320
I crit failed.

1152
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,720
That's five again.

1153
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,560
Awesome.

1154
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,280
I also, five.

1155
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,480
Jesus.

1156
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,840
Absolutely meltdown.

1157
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,320
So what Jimmy Corrigan does is-

1158
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,360
I hit a breaking point again.

1159
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,960
He grabs the syringe of ketamine,

1160
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,760
and he's going to try to inject it into the nearest person.

1161
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,800
Okay, let's roll and see who the nearest person is.

1162
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,360
It is just three other people standing here now.

1163
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,960
It is Vincenzi Bori, Shelly St. Blythe, and-

1164
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,800
Brandy.

1165
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,620
Brandy.

1166
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,600
Oh, Brandy's still here?

1167
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,840
What the fuck?

1168
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,720
Oh my God.

1169
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,600
I thought we were going to have to kill one of the dads

1170
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,840
to save the child, but unfortunately I-

1171
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,000
She runs off into the woods.

1172
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,440
I athletics, I run after her.

1173
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,080
As you tackle her into the ground

1174
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,440
and you're doing what now?

1175
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,200
Injecting that ketamine.

1176
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,020
Yep.

1177
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,080
You do so, and she like almost immediately

1178
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,480
just like falls unconscious.

1179
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,320
It's okay.

1180
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,880
Where you're going is probably a better place.

1181
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,760
We're not going to punch you.

1182
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,020
We're not going to make you explode,

1183
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,520
but we got to get our daughter back.

1184
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,240
And well, you know, sorry.

1185
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,460
And he walks back to the ear fungus and eats a little bit.

1186
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,300
Wait.

1187
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,120
Well, before he does that, he-

1188
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,960
Too late.

1189
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,800
Oh my God.

1190
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,620
He said it.

1191
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,460
He just fucking said it.

1192
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,280
He said it.

1193
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,120
Well, wait a minute.

1194
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,920
I mean, one of us has to eat some to get in there, right?

1195
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,760
We can't-

1196
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,580
No.

1197
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,420
You think we can feed it to her?

1198
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,780
If it goes in her mouth.

1199
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,640
Have we seen anybody open a portal?

1200
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,480
Oh, we did.

1201
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,320
That's what this whole thing is.

1202
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,400
That's what just happened.

1203
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,740
Well, I'm insane.

1204
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,800
I feel like once you say a thing,

1205
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,360
the thing can't be unsaid.

1206
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,280
He walks away from her.

1207
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,080
He kind of eats her and then eats the whole thing himself.

1208
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,640
I thought that's how it worked.

1209
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,720
I mean, that is what Dr. Brock Hargrave did.

1210
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,200
Exactly.

1211
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,280
So if your goal is to open yourself up,

1212
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,440
perhaps that would be the way of doing it.

1213
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,720
Yeah.

1214
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,440
He eats it and he says,

1215
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,620
save our baby girl.

1216
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,880
And he looks at you too.

1217
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,720
That doesn't make sense, does it?

1218
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,320
Should we just rerecord me feeding it to her?

1219
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,280
That's why it's funny.

1220
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,400
I think it makes sense

1221
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,640
because you don't have all your wits about you.

1222
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,680
Yeah, I think it absolutely makes sense

1223
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,400
that you're walking back to them

1224
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,360
as you put it in your mouth.

1225
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,840
Vincenty also does not have his wits about him.

1226
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,660
With that-

1227
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,720
I give you the ketamine, I take the earwax.

1228
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,640
And I need a power roll at a negative 40

1229
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,480
from Vincenty Bory.

1230
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,060
I've got a pretty good chance here.

1231
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,260
A 20 on a five.

1232
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,620
It's like a primal urge.

1233
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,240
It's like a hunger deep within you.

1234
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,500
You feel just like completely drawn without hesitation.

1235
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,580
Vincenty gets in like the-

1236
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,420
Let me be clear,

1237
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,660
to crawl into the stomach of Jimmy Corrigan

1238
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,260
is what you feel like doing.

1239
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,000
Vincenty gets in position like you would

1240
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,160
at the beginning of a track race.

1241
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,220
And takes off sprinting

1242
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,220
and is gonna try to just dive head first into the stomach.

1243
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,260
Jimmy Corrigan, how are you responding to this?

1244
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,660
I like make myself a bigger target

1245
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,620
and I say, you go get our girl.

1246
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,180
Holy shit.

1247
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,180
Oh yeah, I need a con check from Jimmy Corrigan.

1248
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,660
Like a really important one.

1249
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,180
Pass.

1250
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,860
That's good.

1251
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,620
Vincenty takes off

1252
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,200
and as his feet leave the ground

1253
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,340
and his head is heading towards the stomach,

1254
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,480
he just says, I'm not real anyway,

1255
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,100
so it don't fucking matter.

1256
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,940
I'm coming.

1257
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,980
And through the torso of Jimmy Corrigan,

1258
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,700
Vincenty Bory just disappears.

1259
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:39,700
I'm pulling that out

1260
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,660
and using it for all the previous ones.

1261
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,420
You're welcome.

1262
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,540
Jimmy Corrigan, you are completely gripless.

1263
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,360
In Seattle.

1264
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,260
Should I say Blythe?

1265
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,340
We are at the Space Needle.

1266
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,940
Go ahead and roll a grip for me.

1267
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,420
Hey, I passed that one.

1268
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,020
Okay, so you just lose one again.

1269
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,820
It's all good here.

1270
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,340
I'm just nodding enthusiastically.

1271
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:11,180
I'm like, Shelley, we're gonna get our daughter back.

1272
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,580
I need to know what the two of you

1273
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,860
who have just left yourselves alone.

1274
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:26,820
There is one dead body in a hole in the ground

1275
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,360
that is like not covered up.

1276
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,360
There is a exploded kid on the ground halved

1277
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,500
and then there's an unconscious woman off to the side

1278
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,360
down the path heading back to the parking lot

1279
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,160
and the two of you are just looking at each other.

1280
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,100
How does it feel?

1281
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,440
I mean, a little jiggly, I guess.

1282
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,520
I really thought stabbing her with ketamine

1283
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,480
would do something else.

1284
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,320
Oh, I could tell.

1285
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,600
I thought maybe you got mixed up on who was who.

1286
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,080
I got mixed up, I got mixed up.

1287
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,960
I thought she was one of the dads.

1288
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,880
I understand.

1289
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,600
Luke and Joe, could you guys take off

1290
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,640
your headphones real quick?

1291
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,660
Yeah.

1292
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:10,400
Hey, Thomas, Jimmy's never felt anything like that ever

1293
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,600
and it was like the coolest, best feeling

1294
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,900
that you've ever had.

1295
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,800
Oh no.

1296
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,200
I'm just saying.

1297
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,540
Okay, yeah.

1298
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,840
Should we bird him?

1299
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,120
Yeah, they can be birded.

1300
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:24,960
Love the bird.

1301
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,700
Wait, unbird, I'm sorry.

1302
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,640
D-bird.

1303
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,480
D-bird, D-bird.

1304
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,580
D-bird, D-bird, D-bird.

1305
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,040
If I eat more, he will want to come into my belly.

1306
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,880
Oh, you've lost enough grip now.

1307
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,440
Yeah, you're pretty sure how this works now.

1308
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,000
So basically when you eat the substance,

1309
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,440
the person closest to you seemingly

1310
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,260
wants to get in your belly.

1311
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,320
Okay, okay, okay.

1312
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,720
So yeah, bird, bird.

1313
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,360
That's not the bird.

1314
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm doing it quickly and I have dice in my hands.

1315
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,080
I wonder why he just went thumbs like that.

1316
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,960
Shelley, how does it feel?

1317
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,560
It feels fantastic to be a family.

1318
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:10,840
And you notice he's starting to like nibble

1319
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,040
a little bit more out of the plastic bag.

1320
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,100
It's time that you joined us.

1321
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,800
Joe, just looking at Zach like, help me.

1322
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,400
I've never seen such a help me look ever.

1323
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,520
I didn't know if my sanity loss makes me want to do this.

1324
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,840
I think with the passing,

1325
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,000
I'm going to let you keep your wits about you enough.

1326
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,320
But I mean, obviously this is chipping away

1327
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,480
your ability to sense reality.

1328
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,660
Okay, I eat a little more.

1329
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,000
No, I'm not hungry, sorry.

1330
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,920
No, no, Shelley, you don't have to eat any.

1331
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,520
But aren't you hungry for family?

1332
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,300
I mean, I miss Meat Hook, of course.

1333
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,240
And Chedi, I didn't know him terribly well,

1334
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,040
but he seemed nice.

1335
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,640
But no, I don't want to go inside of you to find them.

1336
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,640
That's where our little basement troll is.

1337
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,480
They haven't returned and I don't know if I will return.

1338
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,040
I firmly placed my hands on his shoulders.

1339
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,200
You want to get in there.

1340
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,760
I don't want to get inside of you, Jimmy.

1341
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,440
It's so cool in here, doctor.

1342
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,360
My belly button like whistles.

1343
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,480
But also you just hear that in your head.

1344
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,080
She's calling for you, doc.

1345
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,880
That's the real Bigfoot.

1346
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,440
Basement creep, basement creep, is that you?

1347
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,800
It's me.

1348
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,280
They've got so many types of rocks in here.

1349
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,400
Rocks.

1350
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,240
There's a lot of rocks in here, doc.

1351
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,800
Igneous, the, limestone.

1352
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Limestone.

1353
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,480
I mean, it's your head telling you this,

1354
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,080
so it's rattling off all the rocks that you love most.

1355
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,520
Igneous, limestone.

1356
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,360
The.

1357
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,760
Stand back, cannon ball.

1358
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,760
So, yeah.

1359
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,520
Jimmy opens his arm wide again

1360
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,280
and just like has a huge grin on his face.

1361
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,040
And it's almost like he's reaching for like an embrace,

1362
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,000
but he's just inviting you to jump in.

1363
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,200
I get a running start and go in feet first.

1364
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,360
Knees tucked to chest.

1365
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,080
I don't have to roll for you.

1366
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,240
You do have to roll a constitution.

1367
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,520
Oh, I know that look.

1368
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,440
That's the look of deciding whether or not he wants to lie.

1369
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,880
It is.

1370
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,880
It's just, I have a cool thing to do.

1371
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,120
You better do it quick.

1372
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,760
Would have failed, Gibby.

1373
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,760
You, as Shelley St. Blythe dives feet first,

1374
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,320
like he's going down a water slide

1375
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:55,440
at fucking Splashylvania, two fanged plunge in there.

1376
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,840
You look down at the ground

1377
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,840
and see the split in half body of Rowan Fitzpatrick.

1378
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,400
And you feel like,

1379
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,600
hmm, what happened to Rowan

1380
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,320
is gonna happen to you any second now.

1381
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,200
You can feel it.

1382
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,200
What do you do with your last thoughts?

1383
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,280
Get inside your own stomach.

1384
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,120
Shut up, Luke.

1385
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:14,960
That's my whole deal.

1386
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,840
I get inside my own stomach.

1387
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,000
Knowing I'm a ticking time bomb,

1388
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I watched like the last long white hair

1389
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,880
breezing by of Shelley get in me.

1390
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,240
And I just try to shove my head in there after him.

1391
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,440
As you get your head close, you feel like.

1392
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,960
While munching on some fungus.

1393
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,920
You shove the last little bit of it into your mouth,

1394
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,080
shove your face and hands into your own stomach.

1395
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,800
It just falls away.

1396
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,920
And just so you feel this like warm wetness.

1397
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,920
It's like, you smell saline in the air

1398
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,200
and you hear this like weird noise

1399
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,400
as your hands go through

1400
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,440
and you feel the grip of friends hands,

1401
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,000
family's hands on the other side, pulling you through.

1402
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,840
You made it.

1403
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,360
It's like in the labyrinth

1404
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,680
when she goes down the tunnel.

1405
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,520
Just as I'm ecstatic about those hands on mine,

1406
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,200
I remember my wife and children.

1407
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,400
We're your family now.

1408
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,400
Yeah, my family's in me.

1409
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,720
The four of you on the other side

1410
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,160
of Jimmy Corrigan's unnatural stomach.

1411
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,680
Plus Brandon.

1412
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,520
Right?

1413
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,000
Plus Brandon.

1414
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,840
Oh, hey.

1415
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,200
And the coworker.

1416
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,320
Co-workers nowhere to be seen,

1417
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,400
but you're all-

1418
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,560
Further on in the territory.

1419
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,560
Looking at a sprawling town park

1420
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,120
straight out of the 1950s idea of the future.

1421
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,080
Perfectly manicured trees

1422
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,480
like enormous emerald cake pops line,

1423
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,440
a colorful synthetic walkway

1424
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,280
that you've been pulled up onto

1425
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,360
in this slightly bouncy, comfortable sidewalk

1426
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,080
would take you all the way around

1427
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,760
this gigantic green area around you

1428
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,880
where on the far side,

1429
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,880
maybe, I don't know, 124.3 meters away or so,

1430
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,840
people in yellow and green uniforms are running around

1431
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,640
and all the way across this park.

1432
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,040
So monumental, they are clear from here.

1433
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,560
There are two statues of men,

1434
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,440
each about 26.3 meters tall,

1435
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,880
made of green rock.

1436
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,240
Yeah, dude.

1437
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,400
They stand in front of a gorgeous building

1438
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,120
seemingly made of glass and grass

1439
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,280
and a woman in judge's robes

1440
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,440
and a powdered wig wearing electric blue heels

1441
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,960
looks at you and says,

1442
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,360
or very quickly we need to get you inside and hidden.

1443
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,840
Quick, everyone, before anyone sees.

1444
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,360
And that is the end of Holy Cow Farms.

1445
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,320
Thank you so much.

1446
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,240
Holy, holy shit.

1447
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,800
Okay.

1448
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,640
Yeah.

1449
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,480
First you tell Becca what happened.

1450
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,320
Oh my, I knew it.

1451
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,160
Yeah.

1452
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,000
Oh my gosh.

1453
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,840
Yeah.

1454
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,680
I just want to go to this place.

1455
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,120
That's a place that's in another part of our podcast.

1456
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,360
This is the easiest way to say all that.

1457
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,240
It's very nice here.

1458
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,680
Yeah, it seems that way, huh?

1459
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,520
It's growing.

1460
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,360
It's growing.

1461
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,200
It's growing.

1462
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,040
It's growing.

1463
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,880
It's growing.

1464
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,720
It's growing.

1465
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,560
It's growing.

1466
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,400
It's growing.

1467
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,240
It's growing.

1468
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,080
It's growing.

1469
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,920
It's growing.

1470
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,760
It's growing.

1471
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,480
It's Grover's Gorge, which is like,

1472
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,320
Oh!

1473
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,080
Which is like if Walmart had a city

1474
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,760
that all its employees lived in.

1475
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,800
Oh yeah, actually they do have one of those

1476
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,400
and they've got some pretty good concerts.

1477
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,480
Yeah.

1478
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,160
Oh shit.

1479
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,680
Becca, Scott, thank you so much for coming on

1480
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,760
and joining us for this four episode run

1481
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,600
here in season two.

1482
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,880
Thank you so much.

1483
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,200
But also this was so much fun.

1484
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,040
The series.

1485
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:14,880
Such a blast to play with you.

1486
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,720
Aw.

1487
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,360
Thomas, Joe, Luke.

1488
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,200
Nailed it.

1489
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,040
Thank you for having me.

1490
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,880
Oh, we're in the mind palace now.

1491
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,240
And also the MVP was Dylan.

1492
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,080
Absolutely.

1493
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:26,920
The straight ass dude.

1494
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,760
Do it.

1495
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,600
Shout out to him.

1496
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,160
Zeitgeist is so cool.

1497
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,520
Zeitgeist, for the win.

1498
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,360
For the win?

1499
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,520
For the win, dude.

1500
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,560
Epic.

1501
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,520
I love some cosmic horror that ends up

1502
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,760
in everybody dying and little explained.

1503
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,840
That's my way to roll play.

1504
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,640
So thank you so much for letting me be a part.

1505
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,400
Yeah.

1506
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,120
This was actually a fate worse than death, I think.

1507
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:51,920
Which is fun.

1508
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,520
Sometimes when a belly opens up,

1509
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,840
you just need to either dive right in or cannonball.

1510
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,680
Yeah.

1511
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,520
Yeah.

1512
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,080
Cannonball.

1513
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,320
That's the only mystic advice my dad gave me about dating.

1514
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,160
Oh yeah.

1515
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,480
I've never used it, but I've wondered what it meant.

1516
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,760
When I was in sixth grade,

1517
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,120
my dad told me that you have to make the woman come first.

1518
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,360
That was inappropriate for me.

1519
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,200
Yeah, that's true.

1520
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,920
Really sage advice.

1521
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,160
But he's a Christian, so we don't listen to him.

1522
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,600
Good job, dad.

1523
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,440
All right.

1524
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,560
And, Becca, do you want to give the people

1525
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,040
like a shout out for where they can find you

1526
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,040
on the internet?

1527
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,040
Look into the cameras, tell the people

1528
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,400
what you got going on.

1529
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,360
Besides the show notes, which there will be a link

1530
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,640
to your website and your Twitter account.

1531
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,320
Or anything else you want.

1532
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,320
Or whatever you want.

1533
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,560
Look at them show notes.

1534
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,800
There's a bunch of backlog of me running

1535
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,760
Call of Cthulhu games on my YouTube channel,

1536
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,200
Good Time Society.

1537
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,440
You can find me on the internet at the Becca Scott.

1538
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,280
So go do it.

1539
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,120
Do it.

1540
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,160
Absolutely do it.

1541
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,280
I'm going to do it right now.

1542
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,480
Go learn how to play a game

1543
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,720
because she does the coolest tutorials on board games.

1544
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,560
That's how I've learned how to play a game.

1545
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,200
Thank you.

1546
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
I do do that.

1547
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,200
Joe was so fucking excited when I said Becca Scott

1548
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,040
was going to be on.

1549
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,000
I'm a big fan.

1550
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,120
I'm a very big fan.

1551
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:13,960
Doo doo.

1552
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,240
Thank you so much for coming.

1553
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,000
Yeah, and doo doo to you listeners.

1554
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,080
Doo doo all around.

1555
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,280
Doo doo unto you.

1556
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,720
Oh my God.

1557
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:23,560
Yeah, that was fucking tight.

1558
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,400
Well thanks, Francis.

1559
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,240
Thank you so much.

1560
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,080
Thank you so much.

1561
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:26,920
That was awesome.

1562
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,560
I lost audio at 70 minutes.

1563
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,080
No shit.

1564
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,120
Are you for real?

1565
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,160
How long was it supposed to be?

1566
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,200
Oh, well I have an hour 17.

1567
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,080
So you lost the last seven.

1568
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,760
I think that was just some bullshit.

1569
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,280
Yeah, and also I have a recording of us.

1570
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,120
Through that, yeah.

1571
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:47,960
Through OBS.

1572
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,800
We'll be fine.

1573
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,480
So we'll be fine.

1574
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,320
Oh, thank God.

1575
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,160
That was scary.

1576
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,280
Did you write down?

1577
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,880
Yeah, I wrote down everything.

1578
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,120
I need a second.

1579
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:12,200
You've got to run the calculations to see.

1580
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,440
836.

1581
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,920
Which Bible verse is that?

1582
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:20,720
Oh, you don't know?

1583
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,560
I know.

1584
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,520
We're not a Christian podcast.

1585
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:28,480
Thou shalt climb in the belly of your brethren

1586
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,080
and be with him internally inside his own guts.

1587
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,040
That sounds right, yeah.

1588
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,360
Yeah, and also if your brother dies, you marry his wife.

1589
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,200
If it's some consolation

1590
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,200
It's a lie

1591
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:57,200
It's a lie

1592
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,200
It's a lie

1593
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:07,200
It's a lie

1594
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:15,200
If it's some consolation

1595
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:22,200
I was thinking the same thing

1596
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:28,200
I am now mechanization

1597
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:33,200
All my muscles work like swings

1598
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,200
All my muscles work like swings

1599
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,200
It's like a primal urge.

1600
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,200
It's like a hunger deep within you.

1601
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,200
It's like a paranoia.

1602
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,200
Looking over my back.

1603
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,200
It's like a whirlwind.

1604
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,200
It's Linkin Park.

1605
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,200
And it's all my fault.

1606
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,200
Thanks for watching!
