0	8800	You are tuned in to 694.2 PTPP here in the idyllic town of Contention.
8800	16200	It's your oral doula, Wolf the Dog, here to guide you through this warmer than usual December 4th.
16200	26200	We are supported today by a dear friend who is making a deliciously positive impact in some place called Springfield, Missouri.
26200	29600	Jake's Vegan Burgers.
29800	33800	Now y'all know Wolf the Dog loves to get his grub on.
33800	41800	Well, Jake sent us a few samples over and I've never had meat that wasn't meat that tasted so much like meat.
41800	50600	You can find Jake's Burgers and Taco Meat at Mama Jean's, Jake's Patty Melt and Quinoa Sausage Bowl at Druff's,
50600	58000	Jake's Breakfast Sausage at Gailey's and Jake's Italian Sausage at Piccolo in Nixa.
58000	69400	Whether you are vegan, vegetarian or just plain hungry, follow him at Jake's Underscore Vegan Underscore Burgers on Instagram.
69400	79400	Y'all been on that Instagram before, seen a whole lot of pictures of dogs on there, saw some people taking pictures of sandwiches and whatnot.
79400	83600	And now y'all know that shit's wild to your old buddy Wolf.
83600	88800	And speaking of some wild shit, it's news time my babies.
88800	97800	John Lee and Don D. Bettymore gave us a glimpse into the accident that propelled John into a life of civic duty.
97800	109200	They were chased by a couple of giant, gaunt, suited men that seemed to vanish when the pair of Bettymores came across John's nemesis, Large Eddie.
109400	116600	Now Large Eddie was roughing up Don's car in the parking lot and Don wasn't taken too kindly to it.
116600	128600	The altercation ended with a deliriously concussed John Lee Bettymore seeing his second cousin father figure scorch Large Eddie's fist with only his hand.
128600	137000	Back in the current timeline, the officers went to the First Church of Condention, which was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it.
137000	142800	The lunch was made by the pastor's wife and children and served by the youth group.
142800	154400	The officers, well, mostly Keith, broke into Pastor Adam Kane's office, stole the motorcycle helmet he bought from Old Mildred Mitchell's booth at Forgotten Treasures,
154400	161600	and learned that he is working on legislation to allow motorcyclists to ride without helmets.
161600	171400	Motorcycles are death traps, so roll down the windows of your full wheeled transportation and turn it up. It's Kudzu with no backbone.
191600	193200	I think they're just called D-Pants.
193200	194000	D-Pants?
194000	194800	Something like that.
194800	195600	What do you have, though?
195600	196800	E-Pants. They're one better.
196800	198200	Yep. Exactly.
198200	199600	One closer to the end.
199600	201800	Okay, what are we doing?
201800	206000	All right, everybody, we've got Luke here playing Keith Vigna.
206000	206600	True.
206600	211800	And this week we have a special guest. We have our friend Jake sitting in.
211800	212600	Hi.
212600	221800	He's playing Ferguson Beans, the brother of the child Keith Beans.
221800	232600	And we're going to do a flashback to the childhood of a young seven-year-old Keith Beans and a nine-year-old Ferguson Beans.
232600	234600	So let's hop right into it.
234600	241000	The home of William and Lena Beans was a beautiful estate that sat just outside of contention.
241000	248400	The grounds were sprawling and filled with well-kept gardens and ponds and bridges and statues.
248400	250400	There were multiple buildings on the land.
250400	254200	The Beans' home was the largest and most grand.
254200	260200	There was a separate housing facility for the staff.
260200	266400	And there was also a small office building where William spent most of his days and nights working on his projects.
266400	267800	This was one of those days.
267800	272200	William was off in his shop and Lena was in her room on the phone.
272200	277600	Keith and Ferguson are having breakfast in a massive pristine kitchen.
277600	281200	The sunlight shining in through the windows on a beautiful day.
281200	283600	And what do these young boys look like?
283600	284600	Keith, if you want to kick it off.
284600	289600	I look a lot like Keith Vigna just 22 years younger.
289600	291200	Are you still wearing weird pants?
291200	295600	My pants are Ferguson's old pants, so they are a little big on me.
295600	298600	Yeah, I've pretty much had big pants my whole life.
298600	302600	Other than that, I look, you know, just like a normal boy.
302600	303400	A young boy?
303400	305000	A young boy, Keith.
305000	305600	Young Keith.
305600	306400	Pre-Vigna Keith.
306400	307600	Picture of Keith.
307600	310600	Go back to the first episode and listen to how I describe myself.
310600	312600	And then make it smaller.
312600	314600	That's a good tactic.
314600	319600	And Ferguson, what does young Ferguson look like?
319600	321600	Ferguson is beautiful.
321600	326600	He's just kind of like, you kind of want to describe him as a handsome boy.
326600	328600	But that seems weird.
328600	333600	Yeah, just almost like some kind of alien or something where you're just like, whoa.
333600	334600	Right.
334600	337600	This country has a problem with sexualizing young alien boys.
337600	338600	Right.
338600	341600	Is it a boy that you go to jail over?
341600	342600	No.
342600	343600	No.
343600	348600	He's just like, you know, like the golden child, I think is kind of how I think.
348600	350600	And you know, already very tall.
350600	351600	Too skinny.
351600	352600	Like a very skinny kid.
352600	353600	Okay.
353600	354600	Awesome.
354600	361600	The beans chef Helga has been told repeatedly that Fergie is to be served first.
361600	366600	But we see her hand a plate of eggs Benedict to both children at the same time.
366600	373600	Oh, what are you going to do with your day today?
373600	378600	More of the cops and robbers and king of the hill nonsense, I presume.
378600	379600	What?
379600	380600	That's right.
380600	384600	The chef, the lady chef who made your food for you.
384600	387600	She's just asking what you're going to do with your day.
387600	388600	Helga.
388600	389600	Yes, Helga.
389600	390600	She says, sorry, my voice.
390600	392600	There's something weird in my voice.
392600	394600	No, you sound great, Helga.
394600	396600	It's good to see you and thank you for breakfast.
396600	399600	It'll fuel us for our games today.
399600	400600	Yeah.
400600	404600	Eggs Benedict are a particularly difficult dish to make.
404600	407600	And we just wanted to tell you that we really appreciate it.
407600	409600	Did I get the Hollandaise sauce right?
409600	410600	Nailed it.
410600	413600	Oh, that's so sweet of you to say.
413600	414600	Yum.
414600	420600	And you guys slam down your breakfast.
420600	424600	She says, well, it's time to change into your playing clothes.
424600	428600	And yes, my favorite playing clothes.
428600	430600	He only has like one pair of clothes.
430600	434600	So I'd say it's the same clothes.
434600	436600	Ferguson's got these like beautiful threads.
436600	440600	Ferguson, I would imagine has like a walk-in closet.
440600	447600	And a lot of like sometimes he just likes to wear the frilled like ruffled collars, like
447600	449600	which is not period appropriate.
449600	453600	Hey, can I, can I try one of your shirts on Ferguson?
453600	457600	It may look a little big on you, but you're welcome to.
457600	458600	Thank you.
458600	461600	And I go and I pick out a Bulls jersey.
461600	462600	Yeah.
462600	467600	That checks out, uh, out of, out of my several walk-in closets.
467600	469600	He's very, you know, vain.
469600	472600	And one of them's just for sports jerseys.
472600	473600	Yeah.
473600	475600	But today is play.
475600	480600	So, you know, Ferguson probably was a little confused by your selection of a sports clothes
480600	484600	for a play time, but he pardons the insanity.
484600	486600	That's awfully kind of you.
486600	489600	Uh, so what is Ferguson wearing to play?
489600	491600	Probably some linens.
491600	493600	Some loose fitting linens.
493600	494600	Yeah.
494600	497600	Fresh, fresh linens that have never been worn before.
497600	501600	Uh, because if they ever get stains on them, they're immediately discarded.
501600	502600	Amazing.
502600	503600	Okay.
503600	508600	So you guys walk out of the front door of the house into the, uh, the sprawling estate.
508600	514600	Ahead of you is a massive fountain and the circle drive that comes right in front of
514600	515600	the home.
515600	519600	And you can see the different buildings on the land that your father owns.
519600	521600	And what do you guys, uh, what do you guys want to do?
521600	523600	Where do you guys want to run off to?
523600	525600	The sun is shining high.
525600	527600	It's what a game day for play day.
527600	531600	I go out to the fountain and I, I get a little handful of water and I splash Ferguson with
531600	532600	it.
532600	538600	I'd imagine that upon receiving the splash, Ferguson is, uh, admiring some of the statues
538600	543600	in the works of the masters and, um, does not immediately react to the splash because
543600	544600	it's so engrossed.
544600	549600	But, uh, upon realizing that this was intended to be an offense committed by the younger
549600	551600	brother, probably shoots him a look.
551600	556600	I snicker and I head back to the fountain to do it again.
556600	557600	Keith, please.
557600	560600	This is, this is not my preferred method of playing.
560600	561600	What do you want to do then?
561600	562600	You're boring.
562600	563600	I'm not boring.
563600	564600	I'm just deep in thought.
564600	565600	About what?
565600	571600	And I splash him against this beautiful Pieta in front of us that we've been blessed with.
571600	572600	Look, that one has a wiener.
573600	574600	Yes, wieners are funny.
574600	580600	And that one's got boobs and I go up and I act like I'm going to squeeze one of the statues
580600	581600	boobs.
581600	582600	Give it a honk.
582600	584600	Make like a clown honk noise.
584600	586600	Ferguson laughs at that.
586600	590600	You guys look over as this is happening and you're both giggling and you look over and
590600	595600	there's just like an old, old woman who's a servant for your father who's just staring
595600	597600	at you, shaking your head as she walks away.
597600	599600	What do you want to do?
599600	600600	These statues are boring.
600600	603600	Well, we've, uh, we've had a good run of cops and robbers lately.
603600	605600	Perhaps we should continue that.
605600	606600	Can I be the robber this time?
606600	608600	I knew you were going to say that.
608600	614600	So, and immediately Ferguson, you were looking at Keith and you see that he has this like
614600	619600	black bandit cloth wrapped around his eyes, like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with the
619600	624600	little eye holes cut out and he's wearing a all black and white striped shirt with black
624600	629600	pants and he's holding two bags that just have big dollar signs on them.
629600	636600	Fergus, uh, coyly smiles and removes from hidden in a pocket a, uh, blue English style
636600	642600	bobby cap and gives it a little flick and it goes from being folded up into a thing
642600	643600	and places it on his head.
643600	648600	And Keith, when you look at your older brother, you see him as this hat is placed upon his
648600	653600	head in full officer regalia.
653600	657600	He's got a look in his eyes that says the law's coming all over you.
657600	659600	Coming for a naughty boy.
659600	664600	I reach into one of my bag, my money bags and I get a fistful of coins out and I throw
664600	668600	it down on the ground in front of him to, you know, make him lose his balance when he
668600	669600	runs after me.
669600	674600	Fergus looks at the coins in horror and says, these are my coins, Keith.
674600	677600	And I throw another handful and I run away.
677600	682600	I just run into the yard and I go bang bang.
683600	687600	Ferguson is annoyed that his brother's stolen his coin collection and use them as a weapon
687600	691600	against him, but he's patient and begins to collect the coins.
691600	693600	You'll never catch me, copper!
693600	700600	So Ferguson, as you are chasing this Keith robber about the property, you guys come across
700600	701600	this building.
701600	706600	It's got Ivy crawling all up along the sides and you know this to be your father's workshop
706600	711600	where you guys aren't supposed to hang out by, but Keith is running and trying to hide
711600	715600	around the backside because I think maybe he knows that you won't go there.
715600	719600	Around the backside of the workshop that was forbidden to us by our father?
719600	720600	Correct.
720600	721600	Oh, okay.
721600	723600	I think that probably, I mean, how far away?
723600	725600	What's the distance between us?
725600	726600	Between you and Keith?
726600	727600	20 yards.
727600	728600	Okay.
728600	732600	I probably would imagine that Ferguson would be doing a kind of a loud whisper sort of
732600	733600	thing.
733600	734600	Hey, Keith.
734600	735600	Keith, get out of there.
735600	736600	Get on it.
736600	737600	Get on out of there, you goof.
738600	742600	My name is not Keith, I'm...
742600	745600	Fuck.
745600	748600	I thought you were going to say the gingerbread man for sure.
748600	750600	I'm not Keith, I'm the gingerbread man.
750600	752600	I'm the gingerbread man.
752600	754600	I'm not Keith, I'm Ricky the robber.
754600	757600	All right, fine, Ricky the robber.
757600	759600	You still got to get on out of there.
759600	761600	We're not supposed to be there.
761600	764600	I'm not that easy to catch, copper.
764600	769600	Yeah, but I mean, this is also not like, this is outside of playtime.
769600	772600	I don't understand what you're talking about, policeman.
772600	776600	As you guys are having this conversation, you hear something that you've only heard maybe
776600	781600	once before in your lives, and it was when you were much, much younger, but you hear
781600	787600	these alarms going off all over the entire estate, and it's just like this, wow, wow,
787600	790600	wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
790600	796600	And you know that that means that there are intruders on the property, and as you're looking
796600	802600	about, you actually see security is like breaking out into different formations all over the
802600	803600	property.
803600	808600	You probably see two or three guys coming in your direction, in your general direction,
808600	815600	and as they're running toward you, you see three figures that you can't make out what
815600	819600	they look like, but they are almost landing.
819600	824600	You think that it looks like they're landing on the ground near you, however, you didn't
824600	832600	actually see them in the air, and these things are massive, gaunt humanoids in these black
832600	840600	suits with translucent skin, and as you're being picked up by security and running away,
840600	844600	these things are being put down by the security guards.
844600	850600	The guns are firing all around you, the alarms are still going off, and your father is nowhere
850600	857600	to be seen, but security is all over the entire place as you guys are tucked back into the
857600	865600	home where it is safe, and later that night, your dad comes in, William Beans, and he sits
865600	874600	you both down, and he says, boys, what happened today was the reason for all of the security
874600	879600	and the alarms that we have on the estate.
879600	885600	Ferguson, you know that my top priority is to keep you safe, and I will do everything
885600	891600	that I can in order to make sure that you stay safe.
891600	892600	Thank you.
892600	893600	Thank you.
893600	897600	I want you to come with me, and he stands up, and he reaches out his hand toward you.
897600	903600	Ferguson kind of looks over to Keith, and a small tear is running down my eye and my
903600	906600	face reaches out to take his father's hand.
906600	912600	And William walks out of the room with you, and you guys go outside, and Keith, no one's
912600	919600	really around, so you can either go back into your room, or you can follow them and kind
919600	920600	of like hide.
920600	921600	Did you guys go outside?
921600	922600	Yeah, they're leaving the house.
922600	925600	I'm going to go to a window and see where they go.
925600	926600	Okay.
926600	931600	They're walking toward the office with the ivy climbing the walls where William works,
931600	935600	that you've never been in before, and neither is Ferguson, to your knowledge.
935600	942600	I'm going to go quickly change into some of Ferguson's all black clothes and sneak and
942600	944600	try to hide and follow and see what happens.
944600	945600	Okay.
945600	950600	So as you make your way there, you would eventually come to a spot in the wood on the property,
950600	956600	maybe behind a well-sculpted bush or a nice tree.
956600	959600	Why did you make that face when I said well-sculpted bush?
959600	963600	I was thinking of a statue with pubic hair on it.
963600	964600	With good pubic hair?
964600	965600	Yeah.
965600	967600	I think that, yeah, it was like a bait and switch.
967600	969600	Okay, that's fair.
969600	975600	And as you're hiding, you're within earshot of your father and your older brother, and
976600	982600	William comes out of the door of the office and he takes a knee and looks at you, Ferguson,
982600	984600	and he's holding something.
984600	986600	It's a watch.
986600	995600	Ferguson, I don't know how much longer I'll be around, and I had hoped that I would be
995600	1002600	the one who would be able to fulfill the prophecy, but it is not me.
1002600	1004600	It is you.
1004600	1008600	You are the anointed.
1008600	1013600	When the time is right, you must go back and save the world.
1013600	1018600	And he puts this watch around your wrist, and it's way too big for you.
1018600	1020600	Yeah, probably pretty heavy too.
1020600	1023600	And it doesn't have anything on the face of it.
1023600	1031600	And, Keith, when you see it go around Ferguson's wrist, something on his face changes, and
1031600	1033600	he looks kind of different.
1033600	1038600	And then William says to Ferguson, it will fit when the time is right.
1038600	1040600	Is that because it's a watch?
1040600	1041600	The time?
1041600	1043600	When the time is right?
1062600	1064600	It was awful, but it was so good.
1064600	1066600	We're all standing up by the cruisers at this point.
1066600	1069600	Should we do anything with this helmet right now, or should we just head on to the mill
1069600	1070600	with it in tow?
1070600	1073600	I think we should head with it, because I'm not going to put it on my head.
1073600	1074600	Should we go lock it up?
1074600	1076600	Let's lock it up and let's put it in evidence.
1076600	1080600	Do we have all the other artifacts locked up somewhere?
1080600	1081600	Let's do that now.
1081600	1083600	Let's put them all in the same spot.
1083600	1085600	Maybe not all in the same spot.
1085600	1087600	What if they activate?
1087600	1089600	Are you talking about a Megazord situation?
1089600	1091600	Yeah, exactly.
1092600	1094600	You're the weirdest nerd sometimes.
1094600	1096600	Where do you get this stuff from?
1096600	1098600	I thought you were just like Wheel of Fortune.
1098600	1101600	Power Rangers is on Saturday mornings when I wake up.
1101600	1103600	Only if you turn the TV on.
1103600	1107600	Do we have like lockers, like little lockers at the PD probably?
1107600	1108600	Yeah.
1108600	1110600	Let's put them each in their own separate locker.
1110600	1111600	Okay.
1111600	1112600	Lock them up.
1112600	1114600	Put them something a little, yeah, or maybe more secure.
1114600	1115600	I don't know.
1115600	1118600	It's a locker at a police department.
1118600	1120600	I mean, our evidence room probably has...
1120600	1121600	Individual.
1121600	1122600	Individual.
1122600	1123600	Yeah.
1123600	1124600	We can do that.
1124600	1130600	Okay, so you have now put, well, in order, let's say the camera, the gun, the radio,
1130600	1136600	and the helmet all in four separate lockers within the evidence room of the police station.
1136600	1140600	Yeah, and when they get close to each other, do we notice anything funny, like tubes glowing
1140600	1142600	or lights changing?
1142600	1143600	You don't.
1143600	1144600	Okay.
1144600	1145600	However...
1145600	1146600	Drew dies.
1146600	1150600	However, Drew's dead now.
1150600	1154600	Does it smell like radioactivity in here?
1154600	1155600	A real ozone-y smell.
1155600	1156600	Yeah.
1156600	1159600	Did somebody spray some like hairspray or something?
1159600	1164600	Not to throw a wrench into things real quick, but what did we ever do with that silver
1164600	1165600	ball that we found?
1165600	1167600	Did we get it sent off somewhere?
1167600	1168600	No.
1168600	1172600	It is in John Lee Pettymore's inventory, like on his body.
1172600	1173600	In my character inventory.
1173600	1174600	Yeah.
1174600	1180600	Is there anything else that you guys have acquired throughout the campaign so far that
1180600	1185600	you would like to put in these lockers, or is it just these four main items?
1185600	1186600	Just the four main items.
1186600	1187600	I think just those four, yeah.
1187600	1188600	Let's keep that bag with us.
1188600	1189600	Yeah, because that could be useful.
1189600	1190600	You think?
1190600	1194600	Yeah, because if we got rid of something quick, there's no reason to hold onto it.
1194600	1195600	For sure.
1195600	1196600	Who's got the bag?
1196600	1197600	Who got the bag?
1197600	1198600	I got the bag.
1198600	1199600	Yeah, you got the bag.
1199600	1200600	Clark's got the bag.
1200600	1203600	Clark's got the bag.
1203600	1208600	When you were looking at all four of the items that you put into the lockers at the
1208600	1212600	police station, you would notice that they all have the red light showing, except for
1212600	1215600	the camera, which has the green light showing.
1215600	1216600	Okay.
1216600	1217600	Duly noted.
1217600	1218600	Perfect.
1218600	1219600	Oh, shit.
1219600	1220600	I don't want to mess with it right now.
1220600	1222600	I'd like to mess with it just a little bit.
1222600	1223600	Okay.
1223600	1229600	When we have all those items together, I want to try to move the objects around in different
1230280	1234600	orders in relation to each other and just see if that changes the lights at all.
1234600	1235600	Okay.
1235600	1236600	That takes some time.
1236600	1240480	I mean, one of the objects is a pretty heavy radio, so maybe you move the items around
1240480	1242920	it or you move all of them, whatever, either way.
1242920	1247320	It takes some time, but you would notice that the lights don't change.
1247320	1249720	The camera is green.
1249720	1254400	The radio, the gun, and the helmet are all red light showing.
1254400	1255400	What happened the last time we took a picture?
1255400	1260200	Last time the camera turned green was in front of a weird spot, right?
1260200	1261600	It was back at Splashylvania.
1261600	1265280	Yeah, and it had a picture of the guy in the...
1265280	1266280	In the stocks.
1266280	1267280	In the stocks.
1267280	1268280	I think we should take a picture.
1268280	1269280	I think we should, too.
1269280	1272680	Wait, if you look through the lens, can you see anything through it that's out of the
1272680	1273680	ordinary?
1273680	1274680	Is there a viewfinder?
1274680	1275680	There is.
1275680	1277280	Do I see a spooky thing through the...
1277280	1278280	Okay.
1278280	1279280	You never have.
1279280	1280280	Take a picture.
1280280	1282880	I'm pretty nervous, but let's go take a picture outside.
1282880	1287640	What if I put the helmet on and put the radio on my shoulder like a boombox and I held the
1287640	1289760	gun and you took a picture of me like that?
1289760	1290760	That'd be cool, huh?
1290760	1291760	No way.
1291760	1292760	No.
1292760	1293760	No?
1293760	1294760	No.
1294760	1295760	No.
1295760	1296760	Okay.
1296760	1297760	No.
1297760	1298760	Okay, that's fine.
1298760	1299760	Well...
1299760	1300760	Come on.
1300760	1301760	I can put it on my...
1301760	1302760	I got an Instagram recently.
1302760	1303760	I can put it on there.
1303760	1307960	We know the camera is the only one with a green light right now, so let's see what it does
1307960	1309400	and then we'll go from there.
1309400	1310400	Sure.
1310400	1311400	All right.
1311400	1312400	Has the light been on this whole time?
1312920	1316080	You mean it's been on the whole time we've been talking about it?
1316080	1318640	It hasn't been sitting in evidence with a green light on, has it?
1318640	1323320	I've called for a couple rules that would have alerted you to the fact that it has a
1323320	1328160	green light, but taking it out and putting it somewhere, you would obviously recognize
1328160	1330240	that there's a green light on it.
1330240	1333000	It is currently December 4th.
1333000	1335480	It was last used the night of December 2nd.
1335480	1341400	I thought you were prepping us because this photo was going to warp us through time.
1341400	1346520	Just so you know, it's December 4th now, and when you wake up, it's November 8th.
1346520	1350960	Okay, I take a picture of Keith.
1350960	1351960	I'm outside.
1351960	1353400	I'm doing two thumbs up.
1353400	1359680	No, I got my gun in one hand and I'm doing a thumbs up in the other, and I say to John,
1359680	1363080	hey, if this does take a picture of me, I'm going to take it.
1363080	1364080	You guys should follow me.
1364080	1370160	I'm Keith0911 on Instagram, and then I make sure the safety's on and it's not, so I turn
1370200	1374120	the safety on with my gun, and I'm like, take my picture, click.
1374120	1379920	There is an extremely bright flash that is almost blinding, and as each of your visions
1379920	1386600	come back into focus, you see a piece of paper being smoothly printed out of the bottom of
1386600	1388480	this camera.
1388480	1389960	Everyone roll Sanity.
1389960	1390960	Fail.
1390960	1391960	Fail.
1391960	1392960	Fail.
1392960	1393960	Beautiful.
1393960	1395960	I rolled a 95.
1395960	1403440	Okay, one at a time, go ahead and roll a D4 for how much Sanity you lose.
1403440	1405440	Let's start with John and go around.
1405440	1407440	I didn't leave a D4 out.
1407440	1408440	That's four.
1408440	1409440	Four, yeah.
1409440	1411080	Can I see your D4?
1411080	1413520	You might want to use a different one, but yeah.
1413520	1414520	Three.
1414520	1415520	Three.
1415520	1417520	Holy shit, that's a chunk.
1417520	1418520	Four.
1418520	1419520	Oh, fuck.
1419520	1420520	I got a four also.
1420520	1425080	John Lee Pettymore loses four Sanity, Keith Vigno loses three Sanity, and Clark Bishop
1425080	1426520	loses four Sanity.
1426520	1428400	I am at my breaking point.
1428400	1429520	What is everybody at now?
1429520	1432040	I'm at 30, my breaking point is 30.
1432040	1434840	I'm at 36, and my breaking point is 32.
1434840	1438000	I'm at 37, with my breaking point at 31.
1438000	1439000	La-dee-da.
1439000	1445800	All right, Keith, we will discuss your next disorder in between sessions, but for now...
1445800	1450320	You've got a crippling fear of getting your picture taken right after you got your first
1450320	1451880	Instagram account.
1451880	1453960	Oh no!
1453960	1455520	Every time I get a like, I just break down.
1455520	1458200	My social media presence is crippled.
1458200	1463180	You all gather around to look at the picture that prints out from the bottom of this camera,
1463180	1468860	and you see a picture that shows two men in a room made of darkness.
1468860	1473560	You can barely make out the two figures in the picture, thanks to the light from a small
1473560	1477860	candle, also made out of a substance without color.
1477860	1483760	The candle is sitting on a table made of the same unbelievably black texture, and of the
1483760	1489280	two men, one is a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt, revealing tribal tattoo sleeves
1489280	1493040	on both arms going down to his hands and fingertips.
1493040	1498720	He is kneeling before another man who looks like a no-bullshit John Wayne-style cowboy.
1498720	1503500	This man seems to be aware of the picture being taken, holding his hand up to block
1503500	1507040	his face from the camera's flash and sight.
1507040	1512200	On John Lee Pettymore's hands, you see that inky black substance, and it's dripping onto
1512200	1514580	the ground from the camera and the picture.
1514580	1520400	It's pooling on the ground, and you can swear it's moving, but when you blink, the substance
1520400	1521880	is gone.
1521880	1528680	John's hands are clean, and he's holding this odd device, and this even odder picture.
1533560	1535280	Fuck that.
1535280	1540240	John still feels like there's goo on his- he is freaking out a little bit.
1540240	1541240	Cool cool cool.
1541280	1546880	Also, if I could get an alertness roll from both Keith and Clark.
1546880	1549640	I fail.
1549640	1550640	I pass.
1550640	1551640	43 out of 70.
1551640	1555800	Okay, if Thomas and Luke could leave the room just for a quick second, I'm going to keep
1555800	1556960	the recording going.
1556960	1560720	If you guys just want to dip out on the other side of the door, and la la la.
1565520	1570700	Okay, so Clark, when you saw that inky black liquid dripping all over the camera and picture
1570740	1576780	in John's hands, you looked up, and saw that exact same substance oozing out of John Lee
1576780	1582820	Pettymore's eyes, his nose, his mouth, and his ears.
1582820	1584540	Even still?
1584540	1587340	As soon as you blink, the substance is gone.
1591100	1595780	Okay, so would you guys like to do anything, or would you like to just get the camera-
1595780	1598940	By the way, the camera, the light is now red again.
1599340	1602580	Do you fellas recognize anybody in that picture there?
1602580	1604580	Can I roll?
1604580	1605580	I don't, do I?
1605580	1607860	Tribal Tats looks pretty cool.
1607860	1610580	Tribal Tats and Contingent would like stick out, right?
1610580	1611580	Is this John Wayne?
1611580	1613580	That guy looks like John Wayne.
1613580	1615180	Is that guy John- no, but he does.
1615180	1617820	He looks like an actual cowboy.
1617820	1618820	That's kind of silly.
1618820	1624100	Out of character, have any cowboys been part of this at all?
1624100	1627380	Yeah, everyone in Contingent is a cowboy.
1627380	1628700	We're all cowboys.
1628700	1632140	Yeah, this is the 1840s.
1632140	1635900	Where's your hen at?
1635900	1638620	Would any of us recognize somebody with tribal tattoos?
1638620	1640340	Yeah, do we know these people?
1640340	1644300	Yeah, would any of us recognize the guy with tribal tattoos, because that would stick out
1644300	1645300	in contention.
1645300	1646300	No.
1646300	1649040	Yeah, I don't know any of these folks here.
1649040	1651820	It's like he knew you were taking a picture, though.
1651820	1654020	He's got his hand right in front of the flash.
1654020	1659980	This might seem a little nuts, but it seems like, well it's not exactly a portal, but
1659980	1661360	something came through.
1661360	1664080	This is some kind of gateway.
1664080	1668700	So the last picture this camera took- Or a look into another dimension, another place.
1668700	1673180	It could be the now, but it could also be like it's spitting out old pictures.
1673180	1676980	So the pictures that we've seen that this camera's taken, the last one was a guy in
1676980	1678260	stocks.
1678260	1683240	One was, was it people in front of like a black building in like old timey clothes?
1683880	1688480	That's the pictures we found on- Right, that one wasn't one that we took, but it was found
1688480	1689480	with the camera.
1689480	1690480	Yeah.
1690480	1691480	What was her name?
1691480	1693000	That was in Julie Maxwell's car.
1693000	1695880	Was that the only other picture that we found over there too with her?
1695880	1698840	I think that is the only one that I think John found.
1698840	1702600	Hey y'all, if you'll remember, that man in the picture was John Peters.
1702600	1703600	In the stocks?
1703600	1704600	In the stocks.
1704600	1705600	Oh, that's right.
1705600	1706600	Oh, that's right.
1706600	1707600	That's right.
1707600	1711160	I don't know what that means, but that is just some information to ponder over.
1711160	1712760	Anybody gotta hit the restroom before we go?
1713280	1714280	This is Joe real fast.
1714280	1716560	Did we, we still don't know anything about where he is, right?
1716560	1717560	John Peters?
1717560	1718560	I don't think so.
1718560	1719560	We haven't answered any questions.
1719560	1721520	If we do know, I would like to be reminded.
1721520	1722520	Okay.
1722520	1723520	Oh, shit.
1723520	1728840	Um, so Billy Harrison, who was part of the team, as far as we understand, they were just
1728840	1730560	looking for that bag, right?
1730560	1731560	Uh, sorta.
1731560	1734880	I think didn't the, I think the FBI agents mentioned John, John Peters to me.
1734880	1735880	Right.
1735880	1737880	But the reason they wanted to get to him was because they had the bag.
1737880	1738880	You're right.
1738880	1739880	You're right.
1739880	1740880	You're right.
1741000	1747560	Maybe John was involved in whatever they were, this, this organization, this phone number.
1747560	1748700	Maybe John was a part of that.
1748700	1749800	They were working together.
1749800	1752320	Maybe John brought all this stuff here.
1752320	1753320	Maybe got out of here.
1753320	1755360	A rogue agent or something.
1755360	1756360	What was he betting on?
1756360	1758480	I mean, I think something got out of hand.
1758480	1759480	MMA fights or something.
1759480	1761920	Oh, I forgot all about that, Keith.
1761920	1762920	He was betting on fights.
1762920	1763920	It seemed like.
1763920	1765360	Fights or was it races?
1765360	1767360	We figured out one of them was an MMA fighter.
1767360	1768360	One of the names.
1768360	1769360	Oh, that's right.
1769360	1771200	He had a whole list of funny fighter names.
1771200	1775680	His name was Oz Mayhem Wolf.
1775680	1776680	Ah-woo.
1776680	1777680	Ah-woo.
1777680	1783480	And they were all versus-ing like the world crusher or something like that.
1783480	1784480	Yeah.
1784480	1785480	What was it?
1785480	1786480	Squaring off against.
1786480	1787480	How about that?
1787480	1788480	Instead of versus-ing.
1788480	1789480	Thank you.
1789480	1791600	They were all squaring off against planet juggernaut.
1791600	1792600	Planet juggernaut.
1792600	1795920	I was close with the world crusher.
1795920	1796920	Yeah.
1796920	1797920	Juggernaut.
1797920	1799200	I barely knew her not.
1799240	1801040	Also, a quick reminder.
1801040	1803900	Just about things that you've already seen.
1803900	1810760	The Fonzie woman at the hotel motel said that Marvin sent them to contention to find out
1810760	1815360	what happened to Jermaine Glass and Alfred Glass when they came to collect money from
1815360	1816360	John Peters.
1816360	1817360	Okay.
1817360	1820000	Only Alfred came back and he's a blubbering idiot now.
1820000	1822260	He won't shut up about some gun.
1822260	1824980	He sounded like a lunatic and Jermaine is missing.
1824980	1825980	So here's what I'm thinking.
1825980	1829380	The Glass dudes are associated with the mobster guy.
1829380	1835440	John Peters probably bet on these fights and lost and they are like sharks coming to get
1835440	1836440	money from them.
1836440	1837440	Well, yeah.
1837440	1838440	Yeah.
1838440	1839440	Did we already think that?
1839440	1842740	That's just- I think that's what he just said.
1842740	1843740	Yeah.
1843740	1844740	You know what?
1844740	1846940	I think I can fit that in my mouth and clean it up.
1846940	1849740	Will you describe- Give him the light bulb.
1849740	1850740	Give him the light bulb.
1850740	1851740	Dude.
1851740	1852740	Oh yeah.
1852740	1853740	That's a good gangster thing.
1853740	1854740	Put this in your mouth.
1855500	1857460	Will you describe the picture as we hold it now?
1857460	1860860	Imagine the unlucky idiot who figured that out for the first time.
1860860	1861860	Yeah.
1861860	1865500	That would be so awful.
1865500	1866500	So much pain.
1866500	1868940	Let's saw shit.
1868940	1872520	As you look at the picture now, you see the same thing.
1872520	1878180	So it's a darkly lit room, a table made of that nothingness, a candle made of that nothingness.
1878180	1879780	The room is made of nothingness.
1879780	1883940	A substance without color, an unbelievably black texture.
1883940	1885020	There are two men.
1885020	1887020	We've seen almost everything made out of this stuff.
1887020	1890980	It's also- Tribal guy is standing- The tribal guy's kneeling before another man.
1890980	1891980	I'm sorry.
1891980	1892980	Okay.
1892980	1893980	So he's kneeling, the John Wayne guy is standing.
1893980	1894980	Yes.
1894980	1895980	Yes.
1895980	1897660	And we don't get a clear view of his face because of his hand?
1897660	1898660	Correct.
1898660	1899660	All right.
1899660	1905020	I mean- Let's stick this with the other pictures and try to figure it out later, but I think
1905020	1906380	we should head off to the mill.
1906380	1907380	I agree.
1907380	1908380	Sounds- Yeah.
1908380	1911180	A mystery for- Next Tuesday.
1912180	1918220	Hey, also, I don't want to do this, but just to make the thing better, I did cocaine and
1918220	1920680	you said it would only last for a few hours, so.
1920680	1923060	So you feel like hot, sweet garbage.
1923060	1925260	Also, it is 1 p.m. now.
1925260	1926260	Okay.
1926260	1929540	Hey guys, I got to go pee real quick before we head out to the mill.
1929540	1931660	I'll be right back.
1931660	1932660	Okay.
1932660	1933660	Thanks for telling us.
1933660	1934940	I go to the bathroom and I rip a line of cocaine.
1934940	1937060	Go ahead and roll a D6 for me.
1937060	1939260	Rip a line of cocaine.
1939260	1940260	It's a four.
1940340	1941700	You're good for four more hours.
1941700	1943140	You're good until 5 p.m.
1943140	1944140	Cool.
1944140	1945140	You are coked up to the gills.
1945140	1946140	Hell yeah, baby.
1946140	1947140	You are coked.
1947140	1950820	You did a fat line in the bathroom of the police station.
1950820	1956100	I walk out of the bathroom with my smartphone in my hand and it's playing-
1956100	1958100	Keith, were you doing coke in there?
1958100	1960460	Hold on, let me- That's cute.
1960460	1963660	Let me explain to you how you see me before you ask me.
1963660	1968100	Well, we just see you with all that- You just came out of the bathroom without any time
1968100	1969100	passing.
1969140	1970780	Yeah, you didn't flush.
1970780	1975460	I walk out of the bathroom like maybe 15 seconds after I enter the bathroom.
1975460	1980380	I've got my phone out up to my ear and it's playing Life's Been Good by Joe Walsh and
1980380	1983300	I'm like banging my head to the guitar riff.
1983300	1985420	Okay, yeah, I'm good to go now.
1987180	1988180	Okay.
1988180	1989180	All right.
1989180	1990700	Thanks for telling us.
1990700	1993220	Okay, so you guys are heading off to the mill?
1993220	1994220	I think that's what we want to do.
1994220	1995780	Can I ride with one of you guys?
1995780	1997500	I just kind of want to like jam.
1997500	1998660	I'll ride with Clark then.
1998660	1999660	Sorry, Clark.
1999660	2000660	Yeah, Clark.
2000660	2001660	Okay, cool.
2001660	2003060	Yeah, we're going to have a good time on the way up there, dude.
2003060	2005380	It's going to be a really good time.
2005380	2006540	I just don't feel like driving right now.
2006540	2010020	I think it would be safer if the two of us were right up there together, you know?
2010020	2011020	Okay, yeah, yeah.
2011020	2012500	I'm already walking out the door.
2012500	2016260	Okay, so John, are you driving separately as well?
2016260	2020660	Okay, so you guys begin driving off to the mill.
2020700	2030300	As you take the main drag in contention north up to the highway to head toward the city,
2030300	2032420	Zach is just puking off Mike.
2032420	2035380	Our DM is literally vomiting with excitement.
2035380	2037940	He's looking like Ramona right now.
2037940	2038940	Meow.
2038940	2041580	I really want some fried rice.
2041580	2049060	About halfway in between downtown and the highway, you go over a overpass that leads
2049060	2050260	over the creek.
2050260	2054900	It's actually, you would know, it's the same creek that runs behind the first church of
2054900	2055900	contention.
2055900	2059460	In fact, as you take the main drag, looking to your right on the other side of the creek,
2059460	2062820	you can see the back of the first church of contention.
2062820	2069420	Going over that bridge, that overpass, you do see lots of animals in the water at this
2069420	2071400	juncture as well.
2071400	2072700	This is a different place?
2072700	2074700	Yes, different part of the same creek.
2074700	2076780	Hey, I call out over the radio.
2077300	2082060	Hey, you know, this is just a thought, and we'll have to wait to look into it, but maybe
2082060	2088740	having a cat mind, or a person mind in a cat body, we'll find her cat husband because he'll
2088740	2091300	be the only goddamn cat that's not in that creek.
2091300	2092300	Oh my God.
2092300	2093300	That could be.
2093300	2094300	Good job.
2094300	2096660	Is he letting Vigna use your radio?
2096660	2097660	No.
2097660	2102540	If I had seen him going for my radio, I would have smacked his hand.
2102540	2104100	He's definitely doing coke, right?
2104100	2105100	Over.
2105100	2106100	Yes, I am.
2106100	2107100	He says yes he is.
2107100	2108100	Over.
2108100	2109100	Yeah, I heard.
2109100	2110100	Over.
2110100	2111100	Keith, you're doing coke?
2111100	2112100	I mean, not right now.
2112100	2113100	I did it.
2113100	2114100	Why are you doing coke?
2114100	2115100	Why my hand?
2115100	2117740	Because I don't feel very good without it.
2117740	2119580	We could have got you a cup of coffee.
2119580	2120580	I know.
2120580	2125300	Well, the powers that be told me that that wouldn't work.
2125300	2126520	The powers that be?
2126520	2127520	Just go with it, man.
2127520	2129020	I don't, you know.
2129020	2130280	Are you hearing voices, Keith?
2130280	2133340	The more you talk about it, the more nervous I'm going to get.
2133340	2134340	Let's just roll with it.
2134340	2135720	Just act like I'm normal.
2136340	2137340	I am normal.
2137340	2142460	Are you going to be at the top of your game if shit goes down?
2142460	2145840	If I wasn't on coke, I wouldn't be at the top of my game.
2145840	2147520	I would not be able to function.
2147520	2148520	I'll tell you that.
2148520	2149520	Alright.
2149520	2150520	That's why I went to...
2150520	2151880	Keith, we're going to talk about your dependency later.
2151880	2152880	I'm not dependent.
2152880	2153880	I'm just, it's useful for me right now.
2153880	2157040	That's the definition of dependency if the top of your game is with it.
2157040	2160600	Well, it doesn't seem to have caused any problems yet.
2160600	2161600	Let's just go.
2161600	2162600	Why are you guys talking about...
2162600	2163600	Just make sure it's that way.
2163600	2164600	You usually don't care this much about me.
2165480	2169360	Keith, it's not that I don't care.
2169360	2170360	What is it then?
2170360	2174480	It's that I don't care a whole lot.
2174480	2181480	Well, thanks for the pep talk.
2181480	2184800	I crawl over the console into the backseat.
2184800	2186800	Well, no, it's a cop car.
2186800	2187800	I can't do that.
2187800	2189800	I attempt to and then I remember where I am.
2189800	2193200	You just bang your forehead on the cage.
2193200	2194200	I just want you to know...
2194800	2197800	Life's been good to me so far.
2197800	2198800	Keith!
2198800	2199800	Keith!
2199800	2206800	You had your hands on the call button this whole time.
2206800	2208800	To the mail, to the mail, to the mail, mail, mail.
2208800	2209800	Okay, cool.
2209800	2214680	So real quick, the three of you are almost to the highway.
2214680	2216880	John or Clark, who is ahead?
2216880	2217880	Who is behind?
2217880	2223200	I threw my lights on and sped a decent way ahead of them after the whole radio conversation.
2223200	2224200	Okay, fair enough.
2224200	2228200	Go ahead and, John, make me an alertness check.
2228200	2229200	Six!
2229200	2231200	I finally passed one of those.
2231200	2235320	You see the sky ahead of you begin to swirl.
2235320	2240280	About thirty feet above the ground, a flat oval begins to form.
2240280	2246760	The sky around it spirals like cloth, making folds as it gathers in bunches in certain
2246760	2249320	places in the sky.
2249320	2256240	The oval is black, but a technicolor energy is erupting from its darkness, and then the
2256240	2260640	sky is just as it was, but something is falling.
2260640	2261640	Roll sand.
2261640	2262640	Fail.
2262640	2266640	Alright, go ahead and roll a D4 for me.
2266640	2269800	God damn it, four again.
2269800	2274800	That puts you at your breaking point!
2274800	2279120	John Lee Pettymore is at 32 sanity, and his breaking point is 32.
2279120	2280680	I'm broke, y'all.
2280680	2282400	We're going crazy together, brother.
2282400	2284840	I'm not crazy.
2284840	2290800	John Lee Pettymore, the windshield of your vehicle is smashed in, and tiny shards of
2290800	2294680	glass immediately cover everything around you.
2294680	2301000	Slumped across your dashboard is the lifeless body of a grown man, and blood is splattered
2301000	2302480	everywhere.
2302480	2303480	Roll sanity.
2303480	2306760	Oh hell, what the hell, what the shit?
2306760	2311600	That's not the craziest thing I've ever seen, I guess.
2311600	2314360	You lose one more sanity, so you're down at 31.
2314360	2317640	Now real quick, Clark, I need you to roll a drive check.
2317640	2319560	Oh shit.
2319560	2322000	Pretty important drive check.
2322000	2324800	I fail.
2324800	2329960	I got a 78 on a 15.
2330840	2336840	You slam on your brakes as this body from a technicolor rip in the sky slams into your
2336840	2338120	windshield.
2338120	2344200	You instantly feel another violent impact, this time from behind, as Clark plows into
2344200	2345720	your cruiser.
2345720	2349620	You lose control of the vehicle and swerve into oncoming traffic.
2349620	2355800	You hear the sound of a horn blaring, and you vaguely remember the sight of a minivan
2355840	2362240	driving in the oncoming lane before this chaos of disorienting glass and blood and pain.
2362240	2367560	You see a flash of color fly by out of the corner of your eye and then, as your car finally
2367560	2374840	jerks to a stop, you hear a deafening crash, and the rumble of fire.
2385800	2405720	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
