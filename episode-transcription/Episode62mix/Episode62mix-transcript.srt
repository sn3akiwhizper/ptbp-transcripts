1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,160
Oh, I didn't see you there my babies, come on in.

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,080
I was just reading this amazing book by a bright new genius author called Finding Your

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:29,760
Inner Clam Gravy, Diving Through This Dumpster We Call Life, written by me, Wolf the Dog.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,920
It's an autobiography by me, Wolf the Dog, about me, Wolf the Dog, I'll probably never

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,460
release it though.

6
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:45,800
This book holds far too much knowledge and power, but then again, money does let a dog

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,120
get closer to his dream of opening a trash can centric theme park.

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,240
Speaking of trash, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from jdg222 on Instagram, who wrote

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,560
a 5-star review on iTunes, which is apparently a great way to help guide my dulcet tones

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,500
into ears that have not yet had my pleasure, mmm delicious.

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,200
Jeff writes, If Wolf could give a shout out to my companions at The Traveler's Path, that

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,760
would be amazing.

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,400
They've been with me through thick and thin.

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,080
Our handler Alan has given us weeks of adventure.

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,560
My friends have become brothers and sisters in arms.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,840
I can't wait to share more adventures with them.

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:42,000
Aaron, Bob, Justin, Willis, Nick, Connor, Victoria, Emma, and Tony, I love you guys

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,440
and will see you next session.

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:53,520
Now I most certainly will not give a shout out to Aaron, Bob, Justin, Willis, Nick,

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,920
Connor, Victoria, Emma, and Tony, there's just no way you can make me do it.

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,040
Never in a million years, Jeff from Instagram.

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,080
I appreciate you writing though, even if I definitely did not honor your request.

23
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,680
Remember, if you want to write up something for your Walter Hal, tag at PretendingPod

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,200
review on iTunes, baby, and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,960
I agree with you that Mark Zucker Buttface should be reprimanded for falsifying numbers

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,360
to pull in more native content.

31
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,400
The most recent one is a delta green one shot based on a Wikipedia article sent in by one

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,120
of our dear honorary police officers.

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,980
A big difference between contention police officers and our honorary police officers

34
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,100
over on patreon is Wolf the dog loves his honorary police officers.

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,160
Wolf the dog ain't never been hassled while diving snout first into a dumpster filled

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,460
with wet sloppy Mississippi roast by one of his honorary police officers.

37
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,920
Jesus, last time was grievous.

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,880
The reason for the season is seemingly malfeasance for the sake of convenience.

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,360
Given credence to the frequently indecent, it's time for the news.

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,640
This segment of the news comes in the form of a multiple choice question.

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,320
The question is this, if someone begins chanting and you would like them to stop, you should

42
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
a.

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,640
Ask them to stop b.

44
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,300
Cover the mouth c.

45
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:04,240
Use that cool gun Leon had that Clark is holding which knocks people unconscious or d.

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,680
Immediately shoot them.

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,920
If you answer d.

48
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,120
You might be a contention police officer.

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,260
Everyone is dead.

50
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,160
So let's spread some dread.

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,200
I got something around here that will fit this somber mood orgastically.

52
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,400
It's kudzu with no backbone.

53
00:04:51,200 --> 00:05:01,160
Do you have your car back yet?

54
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Are we recording?

55
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,160
We're always recording.

56
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:12,500
I woke myself and my girlfriend up in the middle of the night screaming Luke no because

57
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,560
I was having a dream where I was riding shotgun with you and we were having this discussion

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,960
and we were trying to prove points on our phones or whatever basically and you got super

59
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,200
distracted from driving and I noticed I look up and I see this young woman in the middle

60
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,640
of the road right in front of us that you're about to just plow over and I screamed Luke

61
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,040
no in real life and woke myself and my girlfriend and the cats up.

62
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
What did she look like?

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,080
She was wearing a white dress.

64
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,880
I bet that symbolizes something.

65
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,400
Well I did recently murder somebody but just not with my car.

66
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,760
It's weird that there was a car in the dream.

67
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,240
I was driving a van so it's totally different.

68
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,360
Luke what was she wearing?

69
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:03,240
Oh I don't know I was in a blind fury so I don't remember.

70
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,560
I only see her face when I close my eyes.

71
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,840
She just looked like my dad.

72
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,760
Luke I thought your new year's resolution was to not murder anyone this year.

73
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Well you know how new year's resolutions go.

74
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,660
By the wayside quickly.

75
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,160
Did anyone else make any new year's resolutions?

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,840
I never do and I didn't.

77
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,640
Hey Kameel good job.

78
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,000
Perfect as it is.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Justin?

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,240
Oh I got way too many rezzies when I get fit-ish not like jacked.

81
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Go Kameel.

82
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Not like Zach.

83
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,080
I don't want to be as fit as Zach.

84
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,200
For the listeners who don't know Zach is just fucking ripped.

85
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Just pumping iron.

86
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,480
Honestly when I stand next to Zach it's like Kevin Hart standing next to The Rock.

87
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
That is true.

88
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
A lot like that.

89
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:04,360
The other day I went into work and one of my fellow co-workers who does go to the gym

90
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,160
greeted me by grabbing my bicep and then immediately looked me in the eyes and said did I just

91
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,720
touch bone on both sides?

92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Did he?

93
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Oh yeah he got bone baby.

94
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
What do you mean?

95
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,040
Of course you can do that.

96
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Who was it?

97
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
It was Phil.

98
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Doxum.

99
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
There's no way I could feel bone in his arm.

100
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,520
Well it's a good thing because I didn't feel emasculated at all.

101
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
So it makes sense.

102
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,040
I felt really normal about it.

103
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:37,680
Oh no you can't feel bone you're... it's too much fat.

104
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,480
Thomas was just groping me that whole time.

105
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,840
A few weeks ago I was talking to Phil I forget where we were but I was talking to him.

106
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,720
I was just saying like yeah the first time I met you I knew you were going to be a douchebag

107
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,680
and then like you weren't and it's crazy to me still.

108
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,120
You said that to him or he said that to you?

109
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
I said that to him.

110
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,080
That could go either way in my opinion.

111
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,600
But he was like oh yeah like I get that a lot it kind of sucks but I and then he like

112
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,640
looks down at himself it's like it's because I look like this I'm like well kind of kind

113
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
of proved my point.

114
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Confirmed.

115
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
Confirmed.

116
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,360
That's two douchebags talking to each other right after that day.

117
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
I'm just a small douchebag.

118
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
Kevin Hart size douchebag.

119
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,480
That's my New Year's resolution is go get as jacked as Ferri and also probably grow

120
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,200
six inches would be nice too.

121
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,720
My New Year's resolution is to stop taking Zach's shit in this fucking game.

122
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,440
Well the intro we have today is gonna maybe go opposite to that.

123
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,040
Let's go ahead and recap what happened last time so that Thomas cannot take my shit.

124
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,120
The five of you approached the jingle ball.

125
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,120
You find students there and faculty there acting strangely and a man began begins screaming

126
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,120
of the familiar phrase towel a la coal.

127
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,360
What was going through your guys's mind at that moment?

128
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,020
Like what what uh?

129
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,100
Same shit different day.

130
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,160
Mine was stop them immediately.

131
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah that dude sounds like he's casting a spell.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,560
And I don't like spells.

133
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,520
I've heard enough spells to know they ain't usually good.

134
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:13,480
So Keith shot him and these students and faculty, Thomas's great school shooting joke from last

135
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,200
week aside, they all see this chanting man get shot probably for the first time.

136
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Not a joke.

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,480
I just listened to this episode.

138
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,400
I legitimately suggested hey maybe we don't shoot up this fucking school.

139
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,880
I thought it was hilarious.

140
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,600
We found very funny and then immediately discarded that thought.

141
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,720
So everyone in this room starts acting even stranger.

142
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Thoughts?

143
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,640
Hey, that's a I just find that kind of language like pretty derogatory thoughts anymore.

144
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,240
I kind of felt gross coming out of my mouth.

145
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Yeah.

146
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Them hoes.

147
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
We're just kidding.

148
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I forgot.

149
00:09:50,240 --> 00:10:03,980
I'm uh taking the word back so I'm empowering it.

150
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,980
You are a thought.

151
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,980
Wow.

152
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,980
Never mind.

153
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
I don't like it.

154
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:16,200
That did not last long.

155
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,480
Justin took it and then gave it right back.

156
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,440
Released it back to the universe.

157
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,800
So then John shot and killed a girl and he also shot two reindeer.

158
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
His idea.

159
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,400
It was totally on purpose.

160
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,360
Keith shot a young muscular man dressed as Santa Claus right between the eyes and these

161
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,500
students and faculty all see this and begin acting violently towards themselves and they

162
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,580
begin chanting and then the original chanting guy killed himself.

163
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
After I shot him though.

164
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,660
I want to make that clear.

165
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
Yes.

166
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Yes, of course.

167
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,700
He was dying and then he killed himself.

168
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,700
That's college, baby.

169
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,920
So where do we stand?

170
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,900
Any final thoughts there?

171
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,700
Anything you want to talk about?

172
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,500
I don't know that we did the right thing, but guess what?

173
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Can't change the past.

174
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,540
And the best we can.

175
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
I mean, yeah.

176
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,740
Not for lack of trying.

177
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,220
That's all anyone can expect of us, right?

178
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,860
With the information we've been presented.

179
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
We did our best.

180
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,860
We did.

181
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
So I was thinking a lot about that.

182
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Okay, wait.

183
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
Hold on.

184
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,020
This lady was shaving reindeer, sharpening their horns.

185
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,120
Animal abuse was happening and everybody seemed to be on her side.

186
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,660
And those elves looked at me wrong.

187
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,260
And I think hot Santa made us all feel kind of bad about our bodies.

188
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Yeah.

189
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,020
He had to die.

190
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:52,660
Well, I was kind of getting worried that maybe I hadn't given you guys enough information.

191
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,680
So I reached out to a few listeners and just kind of asked them a couple of questions about

192
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,140
what they thought was going on and they all get it.

193
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,700
At least most of the ones that I talked to understand where we're at.

194
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,520
So now I don't feel bad about what I've done to you and the choices that you've made and

195
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
I'm very happy.

196
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,680
You know what, hypothetical listeners out there that Zach may or may not have conjured

197
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
up out of his own.

198
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Listeners like Deborah.

199
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Deborah, stand up.

200
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Oh shit.

201
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
He brought him.

202
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Hey.

203
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Hey Deborah.

204
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Well, that's one.

205
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Sup.

206
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
And Jamie.

207
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
Hey.

208
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Fuck.

209
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
I love the podcast.

210
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Okay.

211
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,920
Two doesn't prove anything.

212
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,120
Listeners like these can prove many things.

213
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
No, no, no.

214
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,520
I'm not impressed unless you bring in at least one more listener.

215
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,920
Well, Jared's here.

216
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Here's the deal.

217
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Some listeners have listened to...

218
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Jared.

219
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Hold on.

220
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Jared's trying to talk.

221
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Hey.

222
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
It's Jared here.

223
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
I totally have this whole podcast figured out.

224
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,640
I don't know why you guys don't know what's going on.

225
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
It's obvious.

226
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
What can you tell us, Jared?

227
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
I'm not going to fall for that one.

228
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
See?

229
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
See?

230
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Yeah.

231
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,840
He's not going to fall for it because it'll be more fun when you guys figure it out eventually.

232
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Okay.

233
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,360
I just want to tell the three of you who just stepped into this room that when you're playing

234
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:19,760
in the moment and drunk and kind of high and also doing these mysteries two, three weeks

235
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,200
apart sometimes, it's hard.

236
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
It's hard to keep track of those things.

237
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Excuse me.

238
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Excuse me.

239
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I was going to say there are some people that have listened to 60-ish hours of this podcast

240
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
in a row.

241
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
In a row.

242
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
We like you.

243
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,080
In one day.

244
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,440
I have listened to this podcast only twice.

245
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:45,120
Every episode I've heard of twice, well, the first time is playing it and making it and

246
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,320
the second time is week by week for what are we at?

247
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:56,080
Like a thousand weeks now, you know, a thousand weeks since we started pushing this boulder

248
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
up the hill.

249
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:10,260
A thousand weeks if I could just ... Was that Bernie doing it?

250
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,160
If you did a thousand miles but you had two people, you could break it up and you could

251
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,640
each do 500 miles each.

252
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,760
Remember five minutes ago when we almost started the episode for the listeners and then we

253
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
just went back to that bullshit?

254
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Zach, can you draw up your room?

255
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Yeah, Zach.

256
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,120
It pains me to only now realize that there was a jingle ball playlist thumping for the

257
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,920
entire duration of the last episode.

258
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Not canon.

259
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Not canon.

260
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,180
Retroactively, I would like to say that blaring the entire time during all that super fucked

261
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,680
up shit was the classical Paul McCartney Christmas hit, Wonderful Christmas Time, but someone

262
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,360
had mashed it up so Danny Brown was rapping Grown Up over the top of it.

263
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
That sounds amazing.

264
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,880
Can I just say that song gets so much fucking shit and I love it.

265
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
I know.

266
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I'm with you too.

267
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,320
Wait, the Paul McCartney song or the Danny Brown song?

268
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,400
The Paul McCartney song.

269
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,280
It's one of the most hated Christmas songs.

270
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
It's a great song.

271
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Really?

272
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Yeah.

273
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
People fucking hate that song.

274
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
People really fucking hate it.

275
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,080
It's just because they go to the mall and then they hear it 17 times and it's not all

276
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,440
I want for Christmas is you.

277
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,560
I'm not trying to say that, but it's cool.

278
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
It's weird.

279
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,560
It's like Paul.

280
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Yeah.

281
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
I like it.

282
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,220
Did you see the tweet that talked about how it was a guy who thought for sure that that's

283
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,500
a song about a guy who is doing a ritual and gets walked in on.

284
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,780
The first lyric is like, the moon is up, the something something and then he have been

285
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,780
a wonderful Christmas.

286
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,820
And then he's like, oh, hey, simply having a wonderful Christmas.

287
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,200
The moon is right.

288
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,820
The spirits up.

289
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,180
We're here tonight.

290
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,180
And that's enough.

291
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,880
And then a guy walks in a wonderful Christmas time.

292
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,360
So as that beautiful, meaningful mashup concludes, the playlist cross fades into the new version

293
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,800
of Santa Baby by Tyler, the creator.

294
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,160
And the camera slowly pans around to survey the aftermath.

295
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Is that real?

296
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
No, but I wish it was.

297
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,640
I was like, I've never heard that.

298
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,060
I was like, that sounds amazing.

299
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,140
The camera pans around to survey the aftermath of these last three minutes.

300
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:21,340
We see two lifeless, partially shaved reindeer next to a dead college student, all sharing

301
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,260
all mercy killings of dark red blood.

302
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,500
We see a Santa Claus who has been shot in the head laying next to two well wrapped person

303
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,540
shaped Christmas presents.

304
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,220
We see a man impaled on the elf's four poster chair and beyond him in Santa's throne.

305
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:43,400
A woman in a bathrobe is splayed headfirst neck snapped in the throne's belly button.

306
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,360
Her legs limply akimbo on either side of the armrests.

307
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,000
The elves blood has frozen their corpses to the skating rink that has become their grave

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,280
in the regular place of a mop connected to a mopstick.

309
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:05,640
An upside down naked man is slumped face first and lungs full in the mop bucket.

310
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,160
Next to due to a past luck roll by Joe a very sturdy laptop.

311
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,400
Emilia Clark breathes her last breath in the arms of Clark Bishop.

312
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Is her name Emilia Clark?

313
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
It wasn't Emilia Clark, right?

314
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm sorry?

315
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
We went over the fact that I wasn't.

316
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
What was her actual name?

317
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Locke.

318
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Emilia Locke.

319
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Oh, motherfucker.

320
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
I even wrote Emilia Locke.

321
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,680
You have fucked that up literally every single time.

322
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,880
I don't think you've said it correctly once.

323
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,840
Thomas just tried to look at my notes.

324
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,000
I just wanted to look at that one word and then I was like, oh, that's dumb.

325
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,000
I sit next to Zach now and I could theoretically blow this game wide open if I just leaned

326
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
a little bit to the right.

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,640
But I'm not going to do that.

328
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
That's appreciated.

329
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,200
So I need everyone to roll sanity.

330
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Well, I ain't got none of that.

331
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Oh, shit.

332
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
I pass.

333
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Six.

334
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
I fail.

335
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Fail.

336
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Pass.

337
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Actually, I don't know how much sanity I...

338
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Oh, I do pass.

339
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Barely though.

340
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Okay.

341
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
So I am going to need...

342
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Oh, I need a...

343
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Thanks, baby.

344
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,600
John and Clark to roll a D6.

345
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Fuck.

346
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Five.

347
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Fuck.

348
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Six.

349
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Joe!

350
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,600
God damn it.

351
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,520
And everybody needs to leave the room.

352
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,920
Everyone except me needs to leave the room.

353
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,200
When you're at your breaking point, that's...

354
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,120
When you're at that number, you hit it, right?

355
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Yes.

356
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Okay.

357
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
I exactly hit my breaking point.

358
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I'm down to eight sanity.

359
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,000
I hit my breaking point also, and I am at two sanity now.

360
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Damn.

361
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Holy shit, y'all.

362
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,240
How did you lose so much?

363
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
I had a...

364
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
I forget.

365
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,200
There was some reason I had a really low amount really early on.

366
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Like I got really screwed.

367
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,760
I guess mine doesn't go down too often because I don't care when violence happens.

368
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,160
You adapted to that.

369
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Yeah.

370
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
What is your sanity?

371
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
My current sanity is 23 right now.

372
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Fuck you.

373
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
What was your max sanity?

374
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
50.

375
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Oh, damn.

376
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
I started at 60, apparently.

377
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,840
I started at 60.

378
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,000
But when we woke up in the mausoleum the second time, actually the first time we were there,

379
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,960
I think I was down to already like 16 or something like that.

380
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,320
I've been real low since we started this whole second life.

381
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,800
I think, yeah, my saving grace is that I have no empathy, so...

382
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,920
I also got ripped out of my own spine and put myself into my daddy's spine.

383
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,320
I don't think that helped.

384
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
I don't think it would.

385
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,320
I went ahead and rolled sanity for Leon Simpson, and Joe, can you see what I rolled?

386
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
He rolled an 88.

387
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Ooh.

388
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Which Leon obviously has 100, so that's a crit success.

389
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,080
All right, let's get some of you out of here and keep some of you.

390
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
I'm going to hold on to Joe first.

391
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,120
Everybody else, leave the room.

392
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
Hold on to me.

393
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Oh, fuck.

394
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Okay, I was...

395
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
I watched...

396
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Oh, we were watching.

397
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Oh, actually, hold up.

398
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Sorry.

399
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm going to hold on to Luke and Justin.

400
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:23,360
Luke and Justin, Keith Vigna, where are you standing in this room at the end of all this

401
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
chaos?

402
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,520
I think I was running back up the stairs.

403
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,360
I think you were running back up the stairs, which is where you would see Donovan, and

404
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:40,240
The very first person you notice is Leon Simpson, who immediately falls to the ground and starts

405
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,160
writhing all over the floor of the Accord Student Union, and he starts chanting.

406
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,480
And as he's chanting these numbers, two, five, one, four, one, nine, one, three, nine, two,

407
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,840
zero, eight, oh, one, two, five, one, four, one, oh, one, nine, one, three, nine, two,

408
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,120
zero, eight, and then he immediately goes and just starts running around trying to find

409
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,160
something to write with.

410
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,320
He's spreading out any liquid on the floor and drawing these letters out, these numbers

411
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,480
all over the ground.

412
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,400
I pull my phone out and I start writing down the numbers that he's saying.

413
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,720
I look at it and I'm immediately like, oh, hell yeah, I'll have to look at this later.

414
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:28,960
And as you do that, you notice that Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore are also drawing

415
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,760
numbers on the ground.

416
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Are they the same numbers?

417
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
I'm chanting.

418
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,040
No, they are the numbers earlier that you would recognize as Bruce Robin.

419
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Okay.

420
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,640
Is Leon still occupied with this?

421
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
Very occupied.

422
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,000
I want to go over and just give him just a slap on the face to like snap out of it.

423
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,320
He does not pay attention whatsoever to the slap.

424
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,280
Donovan, what did you do to him?

425
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,160
I didn't do anything.

426
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,680
Donovan's just like freaking out.

427
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,640
Just eyes super wide, looking around, just like, uh, like it's frozen, just paralyzed.

428
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,520
I've never experienced this before, so he's just like, uh, very scared.

429
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,080
I grabbed Donovan by the shoulders.

430
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm like, are you okay?

431
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Here.

432
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
You didn't kill anybody, did you?

433
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
No, no.

434
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Thank God.

435
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
It's kind of a great feeling sometimes, but if you've never done it before, I wouldn't

436
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,560
want to help you handle this.

437
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
I didn't want to.

438
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,460
Leon just tried to help me though.

439
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,200
Was he acting like this the whole time or?

440
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,240
No, he just now dropped.

441
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,600
I go over to Clark and try to slap him and slap him out of it too.

442
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Same thing.

443
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Nothing.

444
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,960
Are Leon's headphones on?

445
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,480
Leon's headphones are on.

446
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,640
That would have been the only idea Donovan had.

447
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,240
I guess I'll take them off, see if it does anything.

448
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
It does not.

449
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
Okay.

450
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,600
So right now the five of us are the only people live in this room.

451
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
That is correct.

452
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,520
I don't fucking know.

453
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,480
I get on my phone and I start trying to decode this number.

454
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
It says Ben Smith.

455
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
That was easy.

456
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,920
Thanks for not making me do it.

457
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
You've done it before.

458
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Ben Smith.

459
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Have I ever heard that name before?

460
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
No.

461
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I Google it.

462
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Okay.

463
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Yeah.

464
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
You Google it and you find...

465
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,880
I Google Ben Smith CSU.

466
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,840
When you Google Ben Smith CSU, you find a student profile and you recognize the student

467
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:23,200
Ben Smith as the one who was standing doing squats on Santa's throne, who initially started

468
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
the chant.

469
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,520
I'm going to go over to...

470
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,040
Is he on Santa's throne or what did he impale himself on?

471
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,440
On the elf's four poster chair.

472
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Downstairs?

473
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,600
Down the stairs from the throne, yeah.

474
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,600
I'm going to go grab his wallet and just kind of like check and see what's on his person.

475
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Yeah.

476
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Ben Smith, student ID.

477
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,200
He's been a CSU student for two years now.

478
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,520
Nothing out of the ordinary in his pockets or anything?

479
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:53,960
There is a piece of paper that has the math that led to 330 Gift's house and then there's

480
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,400
another piece of paper that he wrote out the letters to play on the Casio keyboard.

481
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,880
So he got here the same way we did just by following the scavenger hunt?

482
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Must have.

483
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,760
Since I don't find anything else of interest on him, I want to go over to Clark.

484
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,240
Does he have the laptop still?

485
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,000
The laptop is on the ground, yeah.

486
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,480
I'm going to open the laptop up and power it on.

487
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,320
When you open up the laptop and power it on, you see that it is still kicking due to that

488
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,320
successful luck roll last game.

489
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,400
And there are a few things open on the desktop.

490
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,200
There are three screenshots from Twitter and two videos.

491
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,320
What are the screenshots of?

492
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,920
The screenshots are all from the CSU biology department and I'm going to send you a message

493
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,080
right now.

494
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
With those on?

495
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Okay, sweet.

496
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Just like text tweets?

497
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,640
Yes, but I made fake ones so it'll be fun.

498
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Tight.

499
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,840
So the three screenshots from Twitter and two videos are open.

500
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,220
What are those entitled?

501
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:57,280
They are not titled, but one is of a young woman that you recognize from pictures as

502
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:03,960
Harriet Marks sitting in her dorm room and the other is a very dark and distorted picture

503
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,160
and you can only make out a candle in the middle of the frame.

504
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,800
The one with the candle, does it remind me of like the pictures that we took with the

505
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
camera?

506
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,060
You know, where everything was black except certain...

507
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,800
Only in the sense that it's dark.

508
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,380
But it doesn't have that same like feel to it.

509
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,380
It does not.

510
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,380
And the only thing I can see is a candle.

511
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Yes.

512
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Okay.

513
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,360
Go ahead and check out those tweets I just sent.

514
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,180
Justin, do you want to read what's going on there?

515
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:36,320
We got who the tweet came from, what time it was sent, what day it was sent, and what

516
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
it says.

517
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,300
CSU Biology Department at CSU Bio.

518
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,960
This seems crazy, but a few of us who are not infected have quarantined ourselves in

519
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
the lab.

520
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,360
Please call 911.

521
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,160
Our calls are not going through.

522
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,680
1036 p.m. December 3rd.

523
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,780
Call 911.

524
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,780
Call 911.

525
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,780
Emergency.

526
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,760
CSU campus is infected with some sort of virus.

527
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Please help us.

528
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,900
We are trapped in the lab at CSU.

529
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Please call 911.

530
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,020
2 48 a.m. 4th of December.

531
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,920
We're still quarantined in the lab.

532
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,760
If you're the person or entity scrubbing this page, please have a heart.

533
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,600
We are running low on supplies.

534
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,560
2 48 p.m. 6th of December.

535
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,840
And today's date is?

536
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,480
The 6th of December.

537
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
And it is, what time is it now?

538
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,500
Like evening?

539
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Almost 9 o'clock.

540
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,880
It's like 8 30.

541
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,800
Where did it say they're quarantined at?

542
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
The lab.

543
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:34,520
Like in our travels to find the Accord Student Union, did I happen to see a biology hall?

544
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,040
Donovan would know where the biology lab is.

545
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Okay.

546
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,800
Okay, so I look at the laptop and I yell up to Donovan like, what do you study here?

547
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,440
I'm a communications major.

548
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,080
Have you ever taken a science class?

549
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,720
Yeah, you have to.

550
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,120
They wouldn't let me not take it.

551
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,000
We need to go to the science hall and then I run up the stairs and I show him the tweets

552
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
from the laptop.

553
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,420
Donovan, you would know that the science hall is called Glass Hall.

554
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,360
That's where all my classes are this semester.

555
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Glass Hall?

556
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
Oh my God, there's one at MSU.

557
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,900
Yeah, that's what I thought you were doing.

558
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,220
So at Missouri State University, we have a glass hall.

559
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,620
I forgot about that because I only went for five semesters.

560
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,480
This is my last semester and I'll finally, you know, I did it pretty quickly, but seven

561
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,180
years for a bachelor's is pretty, pretty average.

562
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
Well done, sir.

563
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,660
Eight years, baby.

564
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,540
Hell yeah.

565
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,060
We all took a while to do it, but hey.

566
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,060
We did it.

567
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
Luke hasn't done it yet.

568
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,180
I focused on booze a little harder than my classes sometimes.

569
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,340
So in the city, CSU's glass hall is named that because a certain amount of money was

570
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:47,180
given by a certain person and at that moment I'm going to get Thomas and Joe to join us

571
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,180
back in the room and in fact, you guys won't be here.

572
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
Cool.

573
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,980
Cause I have to take a tinkle time.

574
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:12,660
Hey Joe, hello Zachary.

575
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:18,700
So on this arc of pretending to be people, I'm running the sanity mechanics slightly

576
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,700
different.

577
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,100
However, this seems to line up perfectly with you hitting your breaking point.

578
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,660
So as we've done in the past, I'm going to have you roll a D100 three times and we will

579
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:37,020
choose a mania and this mania will need to overtake all of your decisions, all of your

580
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,540
words, all of your role-playing actions for the duration.

581
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,340
Holy shit.

582
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,820
Roll them up.

583
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,820
I got an 82.

584
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
82?

585
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
No.

586
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
Oh.

587
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,140
Get out of here.

588
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,420
Thomas just walked in like he was supposed to be in here, that goofball.

589
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,740
I got a 49.

590
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,740
49 and what is that last one?

591
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,020
A 48.

592
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
48.

593
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,420
Thankfully close.

594
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:12,180
So 82 is photomania, the pathological desire for light.

595
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
That's fun.

596
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
Interesting.

597
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:20,580
49 is goatomania, obsession with witches and witchcraft.

598
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:28,620
And geolomania, the uncontrollable compulsion to laugh.

599
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,620
Well, the left one is the easiest one to do.

600
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,940
Does Joe have a compulsion to laugh?

601
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,460
I have that in real life.

602
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,460
I have geolomania.

603
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,540
As we both laugh at that.

604
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,460
I think I would take the light thing.

605
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,980
I think that's interesting that I'm always searching for the light.

606
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,860
Obsessed and searching for light.

607
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,540
So when you say it takes over my character, can I be involved in discussions now or do

608
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,420
I have to be trying to get away from the group to find the light source at all times?

609
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:05,660
You know how Thomas has been kind of off topic but still going with what's happening in the

610
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,660
group?

611
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,660
Uh huh.

612
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,660
Like that.

613
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,660
Okay.

614
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,860
So obsessed but also, you know, don't ruin the podcast.

615
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
Yeah.

616
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Okay.

617
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
Yeah.

618
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,860
I think I can do that.

619
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,860
All right.

620
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
Sounds good.

621
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
I'm going to grab no one.

622
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,860
I'm going to get everyone and then we're going to happen.

623
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,860
Okay.

624
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:39,060
I'm going to get everyone and then we're going to happen.

625
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:44,220
Keith Vigna and Donovan Westerfuck, you guys, what's your last name?

626
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
West Haven.

627
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:52,300
In Donovan West Haven, the two of you notice the eyes light back up in Clark Bishop and

628
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,140
John Lee Pettymore and even in Leon Simpson.

629
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,980
And as you notice that happening, Leon Simpson gets up and starts boogieing down.

630
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,700
He's shaking his hips, he's snapping his fingers and he starts dancing down the stairs.

631
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,700
Okay.

632
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,940
So you said that people have figured this out, out of character.

633
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,900
One thing I have thought is that maybe some of your inspiration for this was like dancing

634
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
sickness.

635
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,580
I don't know what that is to me either.

636
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,940
It's what the movie Joker is about.

637
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
Didn't see it.

638
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
You should.

639
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
It's really good.

640
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:35,100
So I see them wake back up and I run over to Clark and I shove the laptop in his hands

641
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,540
and I'm like, look at this.

642
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,060
And the glow of the laptop illuminates your face.

643
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,060
I just stare at the laptop.

644
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
Sorry.

645
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
I meant dancing mania.

646
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Have you heard of that?

647
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,060
Yes, for sure.

648
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,540
And that is what this is all based off of.

649
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,740
I've only seen the parody Dirty Dancing Mania.

650
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,920
The dancing plague or dance epidemic of 1518 was a case of dancing mania that occurred

651
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:02,620
in Strasbourg, Alsace, now modern day France, and the Holy Roman Empire in July, 1518.

652
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,700
Around 400 people took to dancing for days without rest and over the period of about

653
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,540
one month, some of those affected collapsed or even died of heart attack, stroke or exhaustion.

654
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Do they know what?

655
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
Dancing mania.

656
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
Do they know what happened?

657
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,580
Well, let me go to the page for dancing mania.

658
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,980
Wait, that wasn't the page for dancing mania?

659
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,740
That's the page for the dancing plague of 1518, which is one of the most famous.

660
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,220
My guess is of the dancing prion.

661
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,740
Well, I think it's kind of related to like speaking in tongues.

662
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,860
It's just like a social like, oh, they did it on purpose.

663
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,460
I thought it was like a sickness.

664
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,140
I never spoke on tongues on purpose.

665
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,420
I've seen people speak.

666
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
Have you spoken in tongues?

667
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Yes.

668
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
Yes.

669
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,420
No, I've seen people speak in tongues and I don't think they're doing it on purpose.

670
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,900
I always threw in the F word.

671
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:51,780
I'd be like, are you speaking in tongues when you do tall?

672
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:57,220
As a sixth grader, I realized I was an atheist when I went to James river church camp and

673
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:02,940
they made us speak in tongues and I was like, oh, this isn't real.

674
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,300
So I just sent you guys screenshots of three tweets that were screenshotted and saved onto

675
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
the desktop of this computer.

676
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,980
The other two things on this desktop are videos and the like screenshot, the screen cap of

677
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,180
each video.

678
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,180
One is of a woman, the young woman that you recognize as Harriet marks.

679
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,420
She's sitting in her dorm room.

680
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:31,140
It looks to be like a webcam video and the other is a video that is very dark and distorted

681
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,580
looking and you can only make out a candle in the middle of the frame.

682
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Go ahead and read those tweets cause that's our next step.

683
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:44,580
Clark is staring at the laptop and slowly his face is getting closer and closer to the

684
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,460
screen until his forehead is just touching the screen.

685
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,900
I look at him do this.

686
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,540
I'm like, his forehead is touching the screen for like five or six seconds.

687
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,980
And I'm like, Clark, what, what do you, what are you doing?

688
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,740
Just uh, just getting, getting closer to it.

689
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,740
That's all.

690
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,940
Can you read those?

691
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
Read what?

692
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,460
Oh, those, those pictures, those screenshots of tweets.

693
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,460
Right.

694
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
Sure, sure, sure.

695
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
Yeah.

696
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,580
And he moves the laptop to a reading distance and reads them.

697
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,340
Uh, the first one says, this seems crazy, but a few of us, I'm sorry, these are tweets.

698
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,180
They're screenshots of tweets from the CSU biology department says, uh, this seems crazy.

699
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:29,260
Real quick, kudos to Zach for apparently learning Photoshop or maybe GIMP and putting these

700
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,260
together.

701
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
Maybe you had Justin do it.

702
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,980
This is a lot of, uh, this is a lot of work as well.

703
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,900
GIMPs transfer, um, pneumatic image processing.

704
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
Uh, I don't remember.

705
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,780
It's, it's a free, it's a free alternative to Photoshop.

706
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
That's fairly popular.

707
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Doesn't pneumatic start with a P?

708
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,780
Wouldn't it be PIMP?

709
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,780
It's new.

710
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
It's GNU.

711
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,900
It's some fucking freeware shit.

712
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
I don't know, man.

713
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
But it is GNU.

714
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,020
What do the tweets say?

715
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,500
The first one says, this seems crazy, but a few of us who are not infected have quarantined

716
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,740
ourselves in the lab.

717
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,740
Please call 911.

718
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,380
Our calls are not going through and they didn't finish writing the word through.

719
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,900
Uh, the second one says in all caps, call 911, call 911.

720
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Emergency CSU campus is infected with some sort of virus.

721
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Please help us.

722
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,400
We are trapped in the lab at CSU.

723
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Please call 911.

724
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,940
And the third and last tweet says, we're still quarantined in the lab.

725
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,820
If you are the person or entity scrubbing this page, please have a heart.

726
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,500
We are running low on supplies.

727
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,260
If you pay attention, the last tweet was sent out this afternoon.

728
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
Oh yeah.

729
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,640
So the first, the first tweet is dated December 3rd.

730
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,600
The second tweet is dated December 4th and the third tweet is dated December 6th.

731
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,800
So we should stay away from the lab, right?

732
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,080
This ain't really dramatic.

733
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,800
Well, I was, I was talking to Donovan.

734
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,640
He knows where the lab is.

735
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,920
It's in, it's in glass hall.

736
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,080
Not the one at Missouri state university, but the one at city state university.

737
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Exactly.

738
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,680
Uh, apparently Marvin has something to do with it.

739
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,800
Well, finance it.

740
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,400
But anyway, I was thinking, I think we got to go help.

741
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
See what's going on there.

742
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Yeah.

743
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,880
I think we should, uh, we should investigate the lab.

744
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,200
I mean, if they're survivors.

745
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Yeah.

746
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Well that's what I'm thinking.

747
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,780
They probably have, I mean, Donovan's a survivor and he's not, hasn't tried to hurt us yet.

748
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,080
So I think we might as well try to go help some other people.

749
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,120
Everybody roll alertness for me.

750
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Donovan.

751
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,920
You probably have pretty low alertness.

752
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
I pass.

753
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Oh fuck.

754
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Yeah.

755
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
I pass a 54 and a 60.

756
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,580
I got a 36 on a 60.

757
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:35,040
I was a 47 on a 70, 64 on what I assume is not.

758
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,020
So as the beautiful rendition of Santa baby by Tyler, the creator finishes, can you give

759
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:49,180
us just a little, uh, don't Justin will work on it.

760
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,740
We'll drop it later.

761
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,020
Well, actually, you know what?

762
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,820
Uh, we'll just message Tyler and see if he'll just, we're like, Hey Justin, we just mentioned

763
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,980
that in the art podcast world and Justin, sorry.

764
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,740
He's like, why are you calling me Justin in our world?

765
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,740
You're just in the grid.

766
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,020
You know, my secret name, I must do what you say.

767
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,660
I found out his last name isn't the creator.

768
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,660
That's wild.

769
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,660
It is wild.

770
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,980
No, they can't just, you can't just lie like that.

771
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Apparently he does.

772
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
No, it's not bad boy.

773
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
Legal.

774
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Yeah.

775
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,580
Well he would have had to change his name.

776
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:26,180
The room goes completely silent as the song ends and looking over, the only thing you

777
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:33,020
hear is the tapping feet of Leon Simpson as he is just fucking grinding and getting it

778
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,860
on the dance floor that no longer exists.

779
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,900
But you also hear the phone in his pocket is buzzing incessantly.

780
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,780
Leon, Leon, your phone, your phone's ringing.

781
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:55,020
Oh, two, five, one, four, one nine, one, three, nine, two, zero, okay.

782
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,020
Oh yeah.

783
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,020
I got it already.

784
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,020
Don't worry.

785
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,020
Get down.

786
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,340
As he's doing that, I gather Clark and John and I'm like, Hey, Donovan just watches.

787
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,540
I kind of like look at Donovan and I like wave him over.

788
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:10,580
I'm like, he can come over if he wants.

789
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,700
So you guys were, you guys were just out of it.

790
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:21,420
Like you, Leon, you were reciting the numbers that was for Robin and uh, no, I was, I was

791
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:27,580
carrying the laptop and the girl that I was just, you were at, you don't, you try to understand

792
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,580
what I'm doing.

793
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:34,300
Well, you guys were saying the words for Robin, for Bruce Robin and Leon was reciting those

794
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,940
same numbers and I looked it up and uh, it's for a name, Ben Smith.

795
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,820
And uh, I looked it up and it's, it's that one right there.

796
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:50,140
And he points to the man who was previously doing squats on Santa's throne and was the

797
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:58,380
first to chant Tawa Alakol before diving neck first on the four poster chair that the elf

798
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,020
might sit in for picture time.

799
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,860
You guys, we, we've been, you know, chanting and writing numbers that are for Bruce Robin

800
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,780
and Bruce was doing it for Harriet Marks, but Leon's doing it for Ben Smith.

801
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,260
How I'm just trying to wrap my mind around what, what's it mean?

802
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,540
Did Leon do anything with Ben's body?

803
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
Did he?

804
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,500
No, I, I shot Ben and then Ben jumped off and killed himself.

805
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,700
Donovan, you were with him last, right?

806
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,460
What was he, was he doing anything?

807
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,100
He just crumpled to the ground.

808
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,420
He started chanting the numbers and writhing like he was in pain.

809
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,420
Just all of a sudden.

810
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,420
Just out of nowhere.

811
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,420
Yeah, out of nowhere.

812
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,420
I saw it.

813
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,540
I thought it was having a seizure at first until he started talking and, and uh, he was

814
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,340
chanting the numbers and, and, and right, like trying to write them down on the ground.

815
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,220
It was, I don't know how these numbers affect us.

816
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,220
That's evident.

817
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:57,860
I do, but it's not my time to tell you, John, if you know, you gotta, you gotta tell us.

818
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,820
That's basically our whole job here.

819
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,820
Clack.

820
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,820
Clack.

821
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,020
Dear Clack, I don't know right now.

822
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,020
I will know.

823
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,180
Well, that's, that's how information works.

824
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Yes.

825
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,100
All right, Keith, you got any ideas?

826
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:23,780
I was thinking, I was thinking up until, I was thinking up until this point we were saying

827
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:29,540
Bruce Robin's numbers because, well, I mean, we didn't kill him, but I mean, basically

828
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,540
we did.

829
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,220
So I was thinking that he might've killed Harriet Marks, but now that doesn't make any

830
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,060
sense cause, cause Leon didn't kill Ben Smith.

831
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,540
Bruce Robin killed himself.

832
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,540
That's right.

833
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,540
That's yeah.

834
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,260
So in our, in our presence, is it when I was doing numbers just now, was I doing Ben Smith?

835
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,540
No, you were doing Bruce Robin still.

836
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,740
So maybe if you're in proximity of somebody who's doing the Talia Lecourt thing, you start

837
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,260
saying the numbers of their death?

838
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,580
Maybe, but I still just don't know what it means.

839
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,080
I'm thinking maybe Bruce Robbins is the one that's infected me and I can't be reinfected

840
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
by a new one.

841
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
Could be.

842
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
You're not, you're not doing numbers.

843
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:12,580
Donovan was, I was, I woke up, I woke up doing Bruce Robbins, but I mean, I, I haven't done

844
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,580
it recently.

845
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,740
I just haven't, both times that you guys have done it when I've seen you, you just, it was

846
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,380
like you left for a little bit.

847
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,460
It's like checked out.

848
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,060
It's like you've passed some kind of test that we've failed.

849
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
Seemingly.

850
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,060
I don't know.

851
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:33,460
And I look, I look down and I look down at Leon and yell, Leon, what are you doing?

852
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,620
He's fucking getting it.

853
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,620
That's the electric slide.

854
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:43,260
Does he not pay attention to, to the left, to the left, to the left, to the left, to

855
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,260
the right.

856
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,660
John and I, when we, when we do this, how do you snap us out of it?

857
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,660
I tried.

858
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,940
Well, Zach just yells and we come in the room.

859
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,620
All three of you guys just kind of like at the same time, just like, it was almost like

860
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,780
you were just not in reality and I slapped Leon and nothing happened.

861
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,340
I came up and I slapped you to try to get you out of it and nothing.

862
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,820
You just kept on and both times it's happened that I've seen, I just wait for you to snap

863
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,820
back into it.

864
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,660
My face hurts.

865
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,220
Please stop slapping us.

866
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,980
Well, that's odd cause I only slapped Clark.

867
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,060
I feel the pain of all crashes.

868
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,800
I think Leon might be a lost cause at this point.

869
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,580
I think we need to get over to that lab.

870
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,420
I don't know if we should bring Leon with us or the agony.

871
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,180
Clark is going to walk over to Leon and try and shake him.

872
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,620
I'm not going to hit him, but I'm going to like shake him by the shoulders.

873
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,740
Roll luck.

874
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,940
I pass a 48.

875
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,900
I've been rolling 48 and 47s on different dice all night.

876
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,900
How much luck do you have?

877
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,900
65.

878
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,900
Damn.

879
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Joe regained some health.

880
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,900
Luck.

881
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,220
Joe regained some luck.

882
00:42:53,220 --> 00:43:01,620
John looks up from the CSU campus beyond the ether and he winks at Joe.

883
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,620
Like Joe?

884
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,620
Holy shit.

885
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,620
Wow.

886
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:10,900
And in that exact moment, Ooh, that was creepy.

887
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,020
It must have worked cause Joe got chills.

888
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,020
Joe chill.

889
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,020
Wholesome joker.

890
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,900
You killed Batman's parents.

891
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:27,020
John looks at you and says, who's Joe?

892
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:34,980
And Clark shakes Leon who does not stop dancing, however, his buzzing cell phone falls out

893
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,980
of his trousers.

894
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,340
Hey, does he have angry birds on there?

895
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,940
It falls to the ground and you see that a number that is unknown is calling and then

896
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:52,820
the call ends and it has 25 missed calls from unknown and a few texts as well.

897
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,060
I want to read them texts straight away.

898
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,900
And it seems like it's only a matter of time before unknown calls again.

899
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,060
Also this, uh, this phone pretty bright for the room.

900
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,060
Nice.

901
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,060
What do you mean?

902
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,060
Pretty bright for the room.

903
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,140
It just like has a nice glow to it because it's dance party time at the jingle ball.

904
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,020
The lights are dimmed.

905
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,700
Pretty bright compared to the room.

906
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,700
Yes.

907
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,700
Okay.

908
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,700
Gotcha.

909
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,700
I just sent you guys a screenshot of the text message conversation that was on this phone.

910
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:25,540
You did and bold of you to assume that my phone would not be dead.

911
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,740
So unknown texts Leon and says, how's it going?

912
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:37,540
And Leon replies, the secretary is stubborn looking for another opinion.

913
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,540
Option.

914
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,300
It sounded just like Leon.

915
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,700
Hey, maybe don't save it as a JPEG next time.

916
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,500
You are doing such a good job of reading.

917
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
I'm proud of you.

918
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
Fucking got him.

919
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,260
I don't know what a JPEG has been recognized as ours though was.

920
00:44:52,260 --> 00:45:04,600
Oh, I think you, you would pronounce it, uh, it's a, it's a, hold on, how's it going?

921
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,820
The secretary is stubborn looking for another option.

922
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,220
I don't want excuses.

923
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,220
Pick up.

924
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,220
Okay.

925
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,220
Oh, sorry.

926
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,900
That is not as clear as I thought it would not clear at all.

927
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,900
Yeah.

928
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,380
So the first message is from unknown and it says, how's it going?

929
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,700
And then Leon replies, the secretary is stubborn looking for another option.

930
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,300
And then the rest of the messages go unanswered from unknown.

931
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,580
They say, I don't want excuses.

932
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,580
Pick up.

933
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,580
Okay.

934
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:37,260
I sent them T O it's capitalized to, we'll be ready for extraction.

935
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,500
Don't forget to get the signatures ETA question mark, and then another question mark.

936
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Jesus Christ.

937
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,500
What is going on?

938
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,700
That's also from unknown.

939
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,460
And then three, three question marks.

940
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:54,500
And then if he doesn't get here in time, this is all over everything we've worked for.

941
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:00,140
Everything that exists just gone for what your fucking conscience, morality won't save

942
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,140
us.

943
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,140
God.

944
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,140
Clark.

945
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,140
What are you looking at?

946
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:09,140
Uh, let me read it for you.

947
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:17,140
Okay, go ahead.

948
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,380
I did realize that, uh, Joe and I think probably Clark would to figure it out why that T O

949
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,420
is capitalized.

950
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,420
That's the overseer.

951
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,420
I believe.

952
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,420
Dang.

953
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,420
Nice.

954
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,420
Okay.

955
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,260
Can you figure out why ETA is capitalized?

956
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,260
It says, okay.

957
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,260
I sent them.

958
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,900
The overseer will be ready for extraction.

959
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,540
Don't forget the signatures.

960
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,580
I don't exactly know what any of it means, but it sounds like they were preparing for

961
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,580
the overseer.

962
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,380
Hey Clark, text him back.

963
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,380
Why?

964
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,460
Which I will, but I don't know what, I don't know.

965
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:53,980
I mean, I was hoping that I had the suggestion and you would figure out the rest from there.

966
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,820
This person seems to know Leon and knows what's going on.

967
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:02,180
Do you think I should just say Leon is compromised or Leon's got the numbers in him or just

968
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:16,420
just see what they say back to the numbers in that is baby grand pianos for a single.

969
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:24,380
I think just say, uh, say, say this, should you tell him that you're the overseer?

970
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,860
Well yeah, I think he knows, he knows, right?

971
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:31,380
I just text back, this is the overseer.

972
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,980
Now say, now say bitch.

973
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,300
I mean, I know he knows you are, but I'm saying if you sent, if you send him a text, should

974
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:45,620
you say it's you or no, no, we, we should pretend to be Leon on this phone unless we

975
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:50,740
make a total power move by being like this, the overseer, I won't be extracted ready for

976
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,360
my fist.

977
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,520
This last message message says if he doesn't get here in time, this is all over everything

978
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,520
we've worked for.

979
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,580
Anything that exists gone for what your fucking conscience morality won't save us.

980
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,780
So was this some kind of side mission that Leon was having us on?

981
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,920
I thought, I figured it was coming down from Maggie yourself, but Oh, maybe this is probably

982
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,640
Maggie isn't it?

983
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,640
It could be.

984
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,640
Guys, guys, does Maggie suck?

985
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,960
Just text back Maggie question mark.

986
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,960
You think I should?

987
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,960
He'd know that.

988
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,120
Well, he doesn't know anything right now.

989
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,120
I don't know.

990
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,120
But I mean, Leon.

991
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,120
I don't know.

992
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,120
That's what I'm saying.

993
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,120
Leon don't know anything right now.

994
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,120
Look at it.

995
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,120
Hold on.

996
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,120
Hold on.

997
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:44,120
Text her that those numbers or just any random numbers she might not respond.

998
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,920
I don't know if we could indicate that Leon is compromised.

999
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,920
Why don't we just say that?

1000
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,360
Why don't we just say this is a whatever the fuck Justin's character's name is Donovan

1001
00:48:53,360 --> 00:49:00,960
West, West and Donna Donovan Westerfuck and I am a student here and West Haven.

1002
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,260
I have a student here.

1003
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:08,340
He taught me how to shoot Leon Leon and trusted the mission to me.

1004
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,340
But he's gone.

1005
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,340
Yeah.

1006
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,340
Text that and then let's go to the lab.

1007
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,340
Let's just go to the lab.

1008
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,340
Fuck Maggie.

1009
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,360
If this is Maggie, I would worry that she would clam up that she wouldn't text back

1010
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,600
if she knew it wasn't Leon she was talking to you or at least a part of the circle of

1011
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
knowledge.

1012
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm just going to take I'm going to say, Hey, it's Clark.

1013
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,760
If we think it's her, I'll say, Hey, it's Clark and it will see what happens with the

1014
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,760
reply.

1015
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
If it's like, who's Clark?

1016
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
Be like, Hey, man.

1017
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,760
Say, Hey, it's Clark.

1018
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,760
I'm going to I do that.

1019
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,760
I reply back.

1020
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
Hey, it's Clark.

1021
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,760
Leon's compromised.

1022
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,760
Leon's compromised.

1023
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,760
Yeah.

1024
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,760
Okay.

1025
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,120
Well, while we wait for a text back, I think we ought to go to the lab and check that out.

1026
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,760
I'm going to try Leon one more time.

1027
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,200
Leon, do you want to do you want to come with us or y'all said, Oh, I'm getting it up.

1028
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,200
Oh, I'm getting it.

1029
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,200
Yeah.

1030
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,120
Do you want to dance walk with us?

1031
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,120
You can keep dancing.

1032
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:58,240
If you want to follow us, I look at you and I'm like, put a hand on his shoulder and like

1033
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,160
try to like push him in front of me and I'm like, let's just lead him that way.

1034
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,400
I mean, I don't know if we should leave him.

1035
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,400
He'll keep dancing.

1036
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Will he go with it?

1037
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400
Sure.

1038
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Let's do it.

1039
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,400
Where you lead.

1040
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,400
I will follow.

1041
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,400
Okay.

1042
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:18,720
So John definitely not looking at his phone, but you saw him looking at his phone earlier,

1043
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:24,480
but he just seems to speak out of like pure knowledge affecting thousands of people across

1044
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,000
several centuries.

1045
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,440
Dancing mania was not an isolated event and was well-documented.

1046
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,360
He says it like he's not reading it.

1047
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,960
Well-documented in contemporary reports.

1048
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,800
It was nevertheless poorly understood and remedies were based on guesswork.

1049
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,920
Often musicians accompanied dancers due to belief that music would treat the mania, but

1050
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,120
this sometimes backfired.

1051
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,400
No fucking chance.

1052
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:58,200
By encouraging more to join in.

1053
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:04,440
There is no consensus among modern day scholars as to the cause of dancing mania.

1054
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,160
That's real interesting.

1055
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,360
John was facing away from all of you while he said this.

1056
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:16,140
He was kind of saying it at a plant in the hallway.

1057
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:21,620
As soon as he finishes talking, I look at Clark, I don't have a good feeling about any of this.

1058
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,860
Something real bad's affected him, but he's not doing anything bad per se.

1059
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,780
I just kind of, I just want to go home.

1060
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,860
Let's go to that lab and see if there's anybody left here.

1061
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,460
Otherwise I'm going to get the fuck off this campus.

1062
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,460
Everybody run the alertness.

1063
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:42,380
Well, real quick, damn it.

1064
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,660
I fail 89 on a 60.

1065
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,740
I fail 94 on a less than that.

1066
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,700
I fail a 79 on a 70.

1067
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,700
Donovan?

1068
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,700
I rolled a six.

1069
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,700
Yeah!

1070
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:58,260
For the first time in Donovan's life, he is alert to his surroundings.

1071
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,260
Kind of.

1072
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,260
I don't know if I bastardized.

1073
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,540
Unfortunately, you only had five.

1074
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,580
Your bass is 20, I think.

1075
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,100
Thomas and Luke to leave the room.

1076
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,580
Sayonara suckers.

1077
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,580
Help.

1078
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:30,980
Clark, you're holding Leon's phone in your hand and you feel a buzz in your pocket and

1079
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:36,380
Donovan is standing right next to you and he hears the buzz from the phone in your pocket

1080
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,900
and you guys make direct eye contact with each other.

1081
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,900
You should answer that.

1082
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,700
I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to take this, Donovan.

1083
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,700
Yeah.

1084
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,700
Give me a second.

1085
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,740
I'm going to step away.

1086
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,740
Okay.

1087
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,740
Justin, get the fuck out of here.

1088
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,820
Well, you can, I don't, I didn't necessarily mean that.

1089
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,260
I kind of meant more from like the group, but.

1090
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,260
Just close your ears.

1091
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,260
Okay.

1092
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,620
You get a text on your burner phone.

1093
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,140
Do you remember what you had texted and what was texted back?

1094
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,140
I can tell you right now.

1095
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,620
If you can tell, I've get some of my notes.

1096
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:07,420
The last two texts sent, you received a text that said the book your parents died for is

1097
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,900
still hidden in an undisclosed location.

1098
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:19,660
Then you texted back what book where, and this text says your book, calm, comfy campground.

1099
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,460
I want to reply to this one with another, who is this, which I think I've already asked

1100
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,900
before, but I'm doing it again.

1101
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:31,780
You then receive a text on Leon's phone that says, fuck.

1102
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,780
What did you do?

1103
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,620
I replied back, I don't know.

1104
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,620
Who is this?

1105
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:43,460
Almost as soon as you send that text, both phones vibrate at the same time and they both

1106
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,780
have the exact same response.

1107
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,660
There's a single word reply, destiny.

1108
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,180
I don't know anybody named destiny.

1109
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:28,900
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
