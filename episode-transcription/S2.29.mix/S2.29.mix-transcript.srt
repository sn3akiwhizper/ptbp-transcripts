1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Greasy greetings to all of our fantastic listeners out there.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,900
It is I, the mesmerizing, masticating mutt, Wolf the dog,

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,500
Yo DJ, your host, Angel Parental Figure,

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
and you, fantastic listeners,

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,800
are doing a fantastic job of listening to us here at 694.2 PTBP,

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
coming at you live from some time somewhere.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,300
Who even knows when or where I am anymore?

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,000
I certainly don't.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,500
But what I do know is that we got ourselves another Howlin' with Wolf,

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,800
and that makes my teeth rattle with joy.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,300
This edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Ikaris,

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,200
who tweeted about the show and tagged "@pretendingpart",

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,600
the equivalent of 8.5 normal-sized good deeds or 3.6,

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,700
whatever, either way.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,700
Shouts out to Ikaris for telling folks the good news.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,500
Ikaris writes,

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,100
I'm sorry for picturing you drinking the grease I used to eject from the name-redacted fast food bin.

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,500
It still makes me sick, and I have no idea how you do it.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,100
But you do you, Mr. Wolf.

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,200
That grease has to go somewhere, and I guess you eating it is better than a landfill.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,600
Everyone listen to the podcast. It's a fantastic time, Phil.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,300
Thank you for your time.

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,600
Well, damn, thanks for writing in, Ikaris.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,000
I am the gleeful grease trap.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,900
You got grease you need disposed of?

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm here to gobble it up.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,200
And even if you don't want me to, I'll probably still grab a gulp of three.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Much of the grease I consume immediately spreads itself amongst my many hair follicles,

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,600
coating them and making me more...

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,100
aerodynamic?

31
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,400
I don't know, y'all.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,800
I just know that after I get that grease, I'm slipping around faster than hell.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Now, if you want to write up something for your greasy wolf to howl,

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,700
tag "@pretendingpart on Instagram",

35
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,000
tag "@pretendingpart on Twitter",

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
tag "@pretendingto be people on Facebook",

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,900
or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and holler at your wolf about it.

38
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:32,100
If you want to support the show and make sure it doesn't disappear into a smooth void,

39
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:40,200
exchange financial support for bonus content over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,800
If you want to find links to all our shit here at 694.2 PTBP,

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,200
the links are in the show notes.

42
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't blink, don't think, just sink into the deep.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,200
It's time for the news.

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Last time, the Cannes crew went to Julius and X's house,

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
cleaned up a bit and discussed next steps.

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,800
But Julius is clearly having a harder time dealing with recent events.

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,600
Will Cal and Beck agree to work alongside X?

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,600
This woman who clearly has no regard for Julius's health in the names of truth and journalism?

49
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,800
Will Stevie and Cal keep each other's trust?

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,600
Will Julius's loss of grip lead him to losing himself?

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Will Beck get even wilder?

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,600
All this and more coming at you right after Alter Girl with

53
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

54
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Cause my life is great and it's all mine.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I was saying, cause you build your sandwich here and then you go, yeah, you go to your next station.

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
You're only that next station.

58
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Yeah, I don't know, a bunch of shredded lettuce and then I fucking kill myself.

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I beat up who's ever keeping me from the meat bins and take what's mine.

60
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I'd take down a bunch of banana peppers probably. I'm a big fan of eating those, just raw.

61
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Yeah, that'd be good.

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Banana peppers are solid. Cuc, tomato, Sammy. Cuc on either side of the tomato with some Dijon mustard.

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Can you cut the part of him saying, I love eating those raw?

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I mean, if meats are out, bread's out.

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Yeah, the Sammy was the cucumber. The cuc was the bread.

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Can I have the fish scoopables?

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Like tuna?

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
The fish scoopables.

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,600
That's a main protein. I think that's excluded.

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Damn it. Cheese?

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Cheese is a topping. No, cheese goes on first.

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Technically cheese is part of that first bracket.

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Can I go somewhere else?

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
I don't like this restaurant.

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I'll just eat tomatoes with oil and vinegar.

76
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
There you go.

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,600
They have secret shakers up there and oregano is one of them.

78
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
You guys throw some oregano on there?

79
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Oh, he's definitely getting that on the tomato. Maybe a little salt and pepper too.

80
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm going to get the oregano shaker, put oil in it and eat that.

81
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Like soup, oregano soup.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Oregano soup.

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Can I throw it in the bread toaster?

84
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Oh, hey, my whole family's from Italy. We were from oregano.

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Why can you toast it?

86
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm going to say you can toast it.

87
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
You can toast it.

88
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
That's the perk.

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Then I will have shredded lettuce toasted, please.

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Line out the door immediately.

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Did you say shredded lettuce toasted?

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
That's it.

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Burnt ends, baby.

94
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,600
I'll have the vegan burnt ends.

95
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
That's just singed lettuce.

96
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
All right, I'll start recording.

97
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Yeah, we should have been recording that.

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You know how somebody's doing the transcripts for all the episodes?

99
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Oh, yeah. Can we shout out Cinder Crow?

100
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
A true American hero.

101
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Who's doing it?

102
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Or wherever you're from.

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
You're a hero to us in America, so you're an American hero.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
You're our American hero.

105
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Well, I was thinking, because I read through some of it,

106
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
and it's really detailed and good,

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,600
so what if we made some funny sounds and words to see what it does?

108
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Oh, yeah. We should really start trying to mess with this guy.

109
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Flurbin, lurbin, shlick.

110
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm going to say there, there, there, there.

111
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Which ones am I using?

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Oh, my gosh.

113
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
You're a nightmare to people like him.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Who knows?

115
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.

116
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Seriously.

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Cinder Crow.

118
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Huge shout out to Cinder Crow.

119
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Absolutely.

120
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
That is so insane.

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
You rock.

122
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Thank you so much.

123
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Bazinga.

124
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Now you've got to write Bazinga in your transcript.

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Yeah.

126
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Also, you get to write our season two recap episodes.

127
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Honestly, because of the transcripts, we don't have to do those.

128
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
I mean, that seems...

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Well, we can do those. It's just you've got notes.

130
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Okay. All right. I'll start now.

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Six months off.

132
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I don't think it'll be as hard this time.

133
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
No, I'll still do it.

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,600
The recap episodes, they were fun for you to do, right?

135
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
That was like a pleasurable part of this life venture, right?

136
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
This life venture, right?

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,600
I started sweating through both shirts.

138
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Seriously, if you haven't checked out the transcripts

139
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,600
or if you know someone who would be into the transcripts,

140
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
you can find them.

141
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
They're linked over on our Discord,

142
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
and you can find that Discord...

143
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
In the show notes.

144
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
In the show notes.

145
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Another big, big part of this is that I've been training in AI on those transcripts.

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
And so pretty soon, none of us will be necessary,

147
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,600
which means all of your Patreon money will go straight to making the pod better.

148
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,600
We're all cut out from that process as soon as I perfect this machine.

149
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I read one of the AI transcripts that you generated,

150
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,600
and my favorite part was the guy who is playing Luke,

151
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
and he says,

152
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
This mystery's mysterious!

153
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
And then fart noises for 45 seconds.

154
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
It's absurdly accurate.

155
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
That was a good one.

156
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Speaking of fart noises...

157
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Yeah.

158
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Human fart noise.

159
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Taylor just walked in.

160
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Wow.

161
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
And gave it to us good on the mic.

162
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
See you guys.

163
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Bye.

164
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Bye.

165
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
We can cut all that out.

166
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Just the end and the buy.

167
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Last night, this home security salesman came to my house,

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
and it was fucking...

169
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
It was after dark.

170
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I had not turned my French ports light on,

171
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
so I just get this knock on my door,

172
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
and I can see nothing.

173
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Ugh.

174
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
So I open it up, it's just the fucking...

175
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Did you turn the light on?

176
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I turned the light on.

177
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
It's the vivid guy.

178
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
It's good he wasn't blurry.

179
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
He's like,

180
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Hey, I assume you're the homeowner or the renter?

181
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
And I was like,

182
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Yeah, I'm the renter.

183
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
And he's like,

184
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Well, you know, this isn't the highest crime area,

185
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
but talking to some of your neighbors tonight,

186
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
I know there's a lot of petty crimes,

187
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
like package thefts and car break-ins,

188
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
so if you'd be interested in a camera or anything,

189
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
and I was like,

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Oh no, I'm the one doing all those,

191
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
so I don't want any more cameras.

192
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
What?

193
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Did you really?

194
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Yeah.

195
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh my god, what did he say?

196
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
He just laughed nervously,

197
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
and then I shut the door on him.

198
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
He said,

199
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
You should buy all my cameras then.

200
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Once they're gone, they're gone.

201
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I opened up my door the other day to a doorbell ring,

202
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
and it must have been the knock.

203
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
My doorbell doesn't work.

204
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:20,600
And a young lad on one of those bird scooters.

205
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
It wasn't a bird.

206
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
It was a plane.

207
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
You stand flat on it.

208
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Superman.

209
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
And there's just two wheels on either side of your feet.

210
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Oh, those.

211
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Like, yeah.

212
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Like a hoverboard thing.

213
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
They call them hoverboards.

214
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Yeah, the hoverboard.

215
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
He was just hoverboarding around the neighborhood.

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Nice.

217
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
How old was he?

218
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
He couldn't have been a day over, what?

219
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Seven.

220
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Seven, yeah.

221
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Those labor laws, man, in Missouri.

222
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
What was he selling?

223
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
How many Bibles did you buy?

224
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
He said pest control,

225
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,600
and I just closed my door and was like,

226
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

227
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,600
That's when they sprinkle the bag of pests on the lawn.

228
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Like, okay, I'll be back in a few weeks.

229
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Yeah, so as you can see, my legs are now covered.

230
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm not wearing pants.

231
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
These are ticks.

232
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
You got pests everywhere.

233
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Should we do it?

234
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Should we do it?

235
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Should we do it?

236
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm really excited to do it.

237
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I don't know what we're going to do.

238
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
You just said, like, pants made out of ticks.

239
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Are we not already in it?

240
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
That's what Beck Wilder sees.

241
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,600
No, as Beck Wilder, Cal Colorado, Julius Summers, his roommate, X, Stevie Godel, and Jeremy,

242
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
the intern.

243
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Jeremy.

244
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Do we need, do we need euphemisms like roommate now that we know?

245
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Okay, X.

246
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
We'll just go with X, his co-worker.

247
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Yeah, we'll say co-worker.

248
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
X.

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
That's, again, a euphemism.

250
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
But technically true.

251
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
But so his roommate is technically true as well.

252
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
She's many things.

253
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Isn't she your boss?

254
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Some people could look at it that way.

255
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Sure.

256
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Yeah, a little bit, maybe.

257
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:05,600
And they're all, you're all at the close to empty house where Julius and X are living.

258
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,600
It's Wednesday, July 6th, 2022, and it is quite late.

259
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,600
On a fairly rough note, even though he just taken the time to clean a few folks' guts

260
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:26,480
and spray from off himself and change suits, Julius is openly bleeding once again, half

261
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,600
of his face now scraped in raw, beating up with his own blood.

262
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,600
And on a more positive note, Stevie just realized they trust Cal Colorado.

263
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Jeremy, the intern, stands up from the Ikea couch and stretches his arms and legs while

264
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
letting out a big old yawn, signaling his exit.

265
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,600
And on his way out, he squares his shoulders to Cal and assures you,

266
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I won't say a word until you arrive at Cannes in 48 hours as the producer.

267
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Just idle nose and coffees for everyone.

268
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
And with that, he's off.

269
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
48 hours?

270
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,600
That's what X had told you is that she needed 48 hours to kind of clean up the Julius mess

271
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,600
before you were to be named the new producer.

272
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
And then that's when we can air the footage as well?

273
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Yep.

274
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,600
And X looking down at her phone says to Julius,

275
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I've just alerted the doctor.

276
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
She's on her way.

277
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Would I know this doctor?

278
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm not exactly sure if you've met this one, but one of the few in the city that

279
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
knows to look the other way, I suppose.

280
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
What's their name?

281
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
She looks down at her phone again.

282
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
I guess we just call her Dr. Murray.

283
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Dr. Murray.

284
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Hmm.

285
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Is it going to be the usual or, I mean, do we have access to those Godel things?

286
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
She kind of looks at the other three of you.

287
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I can attest that they work like a charm, dude.

288
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
He got killed.

289
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
No, not killed, but almost died from a rabbit.

290
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,600
He was very much impaled by a, not a real jackalope, but a rabbit who had been senselessly

291
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,600
tied up with antlers to resemble a jackalope and then left to wander willy nilly.

292
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
And of course it was going to impale someone.

293
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
You know, of course someone was going to trip and impale themselves on that.

294
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
It was a hazard.

295
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
It was a hazard.

296
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
But yes, the medicine thing they had.

297
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
It wasn't my fault.

298
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
It wasn't his fault.

299
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
But, like, it's me that's going to die now.

300
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
So, like, do we?

301
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Well, you don't look like you're going to die.

302
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I don't feel very good.

303
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
He kind of does, though.

304
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Look at him.

305
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
How many hit points do you have?

306
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,600
This is the first time you've cared about that in three days.

307
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
It's all rushing back to him.

308
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
It hurts.

309
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm at 40 percent capacity, it feels like.

310
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,600
You were at, like, 10 percent capacity and insisted we not take you to a hospital.

311
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Sometimes the heat of the moment.

312
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
I had the napkins shoved in me and they were helping.

313
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,600
And he points to the napkins shoved in his gun wound.

314
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
And Beck winks at Stevie.

315
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Yeah, man.

316
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Good work.

317
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Thanks.

318
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I do the best that I can.

319
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Is she coming here?

320
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Yes, she is close by.

321
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Stevie, as fine as your improvisational work was, we do need a real doctor to look at you.

322
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
The door slams open.

323
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
What is the doctor, Murray?

324
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
A doctor of?

325
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Yeah, the real doctor you say that you need.

326
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:35,600
And this elderly woman with thick gray hair, thin and wiry and built five feet tall and

327
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
created by Chainsaw Unicorn from Augusta, Georgia.

328
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Shout out to Chainsaw Unicorn.

329
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Unicorn noise.

330
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Whoa, is that what a unicorn sounds like?

331
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Yeah, the hiss and squish.

332
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Chainsaw Unicorn is patron at at least the $10 level over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.

333
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,600
And you too can send in an NPC or a location at that tier and support the show over there.

334
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
You know what not enough people take advantage of is they can describe the voice.

335
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
That's a very true statement, yes.

336
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
And I don't know if you can see.

337
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Because otherwise they all sound like this.

338
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I don't know if you can see, but I'm wearing clothes that are two sizes too big.

339
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Looks like a strong wind could turn me into a pretty awesome kite.

340
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
But yes, I'm here to help you.

341
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
I'm here to help you out.

342
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Who's the benevolent neither of the help.

343
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Oh, look at you.

344
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Look at your face.

345
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Julius looks at Cal and Beck and is like, yeah, they're generally pretty.

346
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
They're always this weird.

347
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,600
And I thought you hadn't met him.

348
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I hadn't, but I mean, like all the doctors that they send are this weird.

349
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
So why don't you want to go to a fucking hospital?

350
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,600
This is like been my only interaction with doctors ever.

351
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Yeah, sure. They're all a little weird, but not like this.

352
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Julius rips his shirt off and just points to his bloody mess with napkins and everything shoved in it.

353
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Oh, yeah. Okay. I see. I see.

354
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Okay, you're going to need to have your lay down on the on the kitchen island table over there, the countertop.

355
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Just strip on down to your baccas.

356
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Yeah, I heard I heard about the incident the last time.

357
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Oh, Mr. Big Thighs had had is the doctor.

358
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Things got bad.

359
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
And now we can we talk less?

360
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Maybe just kind of I'm for gossip.

361
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
That's kind of my whole thing.

362
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Okay. Tell me.

363
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,600
It's funny. Tell me the juiciest stuff, but it hurts and ripping the napkins about.

364
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,600
But with a Swift, let's see a Swift.

365
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Oh, a extreme.

366
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
It's not good.

367
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
No, it's extremely good.

368
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I rolled a 77, but she has an 80.

369
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Fuck yeah.

370
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I was just, you know, I figured that's pretty high.

371
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:23,600
One plus three is four hit points are restored back to you as she rips you up, tears you down and sews you up.

372
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Basically without you even realizing it.

373
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:34,600
And then for the final critical role trick here, she goes, oh, and I got something real fucking neat for your face.

374
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,600
And she has a suitcase with her that she cracks open for the first time.

375
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Everything previous has just been in her bag.

376
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:52,600
And inside the suitcase, you see a contraption that, while familiar, does have very specifically different sort of branding.

377
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Cal's trying to be subtle, but he, uh, he very clearly is like taking a picture of this and he's winking to Beck for the story.

378
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Yeah.

379
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
And everyone is like pretty in awe.

380
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Like this is as if we were standing around and someone pulled out like a very cool new contraption that yeah, like that we hadn't seen before.

381
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Like what would a new three.

382
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Thank you.

383
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Dicked dildo.

384
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Oh my God. Can you imagine?

385
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I've seen that.

386
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
New Xbox.

387
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Not with prehensile balls.

388
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Those are the two kinds of jokes you're going to get here pretending to be people.

389
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Oh doc, patch me up.

390
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
What do you call that thing?

391
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Well, I've been calling it the skin graft 2000.

392
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Awesome.

393
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
We can hook you up with some marketing people to work on that.

394
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
That does seem fair.

395
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I don't know what the folks upstairs are going to call it.

396
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,600
It's July of 2022, so 2000 doesn't seem very futuristic anymore.

397
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Well, they don't need names for stuff in the military probably.

398
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
No, no, they, they all have names for their things.

399
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Oh, well, who's the marketing people for the military?

400
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Oh, well, I mean.

401
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,600
And she slams, she slams this, uh, this device on, on Julius Summers face.

402
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
You know, when the question itself is so wrong, you don't know where to begin to answer.

403
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Does it feel good?

404
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
That's a good question.

405
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Beck, do you remember what it felt like?

406
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I think it was good.

407
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Yeah.

408
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Uh, go ahead and, sorry, I was waiting for whatever this is.

409
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Feels so good.

410
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Beck is filming the process and no one has a problem with that.

411
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Oh man, it feels good.

412
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Yeah.

413
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Dr. Murray says, and you feel the, these like warm rays like shining in, penetrating, and then you feel a sort of tingle almost like a, like a foaming sensation that you can hear.

414
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,600
And then it's, it's like, like pop rocks is kind of the vibe.

415
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Yeah.

416
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Pop rocks with a mouthful of Sprite.

417
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,600
And you feel warm.

418
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
You feel nice.

419
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:31,600
She pulls it off and everyone looking sees Julius Summers with a face, a whole face.

420
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Nothing but a face, so help me God.

421
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
It's his?

422
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Yeah.

423
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,600
It's just completely cleaned up every single cut and skin is smooth.

424
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Just matching the other half of his face.

425
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Julius, you look like a million bucks.

426
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
It feels great.

427
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I mean, God, we, we got to tell people about this stuff.

428
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Hey doc, can I get a hit of that?

429
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Yeah, what do you need?

430
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
What do you need?

431
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
What is going on?

432
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I mean, I just haven't felt a hundred percent the same since I fell on that Jackalope.

433
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Why don't you just give me a top up?

434
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Okay.

435
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
You said it was a, you sat on it.

436
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Yeah.

437
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
All right.

438
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Face down.

439
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Ass up.

440
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
All right.

441
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
That's the way I'll stitch you up.

442
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
You got it.

443
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Beck bends over the couch and he just flips up the shirt tails on his Hawaiian shirt and

444
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
jacket.

445
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Yeah.

446
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Jacket.

447
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
You receive four hit points.

448
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Yeah.

449
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Cal Cal took the camera from you and it's filming that, but his thumb is like over a

450
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:46,600
quarter of the lens, which is really hard to do on a camera like this.

451
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Huge thumbs.

452
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
We never talked about it.

453
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Did I recover any hit points from the face?

454
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Uh, healing.

455
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Uh, no, that was with two rolls.

456
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Unfortunately.

457
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
That was your sweet.

458
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Yeah.

459
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
At least I look good.

460
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Julius thinks and then makes a note to go check.

461
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Julius.

462
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
I have a little pocket mirror, uh, in my makeup kit that you could use.

463
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
All anchors carry these all reporters carry these.

464
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Take a look at that.

465
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Don't go back into that bathroom please.

466
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Uh, Hey doctor, doctor Murray, could I get one of those for, you know, before I go on

467
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
air?

468
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Oh, you want, you like, you want to have one.

469
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
I want to, I want to be able to do the face thing.

470
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Well, these are very important to the firm currently.

471
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
And uh, what, what firm?

472
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Well, the program, you know, the group, you know?

473
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Yeah.

474
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
What's that called?

475
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
No name for it.

476
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Obviously.

477
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Obviously.

478
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Julius chuckles too.

479
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Well, his name's for things that exist.

480
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
My dear boy.

481
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Yes.

482
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
And we don't exist.

483
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Wink, wink.

484
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
She winks.

485
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I look back at Beck and see if he was filming that.

486
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
I was.

487
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I wink at Beck.

488
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,600
That puts the lens cover on and off.

489
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Oh my God.

490
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,600
A little camera wink.

491
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
But you said that it was military issues.

492
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
So you're military.

493
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Well, you know, uh, I suppose every once in a while, you know, I get there, I become it.

494
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,600
What kind of doctor are you Dr. Murray?

495
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Mostly, uh, surgical.

496
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
People?

497
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
People.

498
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Yeah, of course people.

499
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Okay.

500
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Well, and if he got something else laying around, I'll look at it.

501
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Of course.

502
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Cal thinks about that.

503
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Of course.

504
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,600
We may have a person who's half a god turtle.

505
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
He probably, Stevie.

506
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,600
I mean, yeah, but we don't know where he is.

507
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
That should be our top priority though.

508
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Right?

509
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Finding your brother.

510
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
We've got a clear 48 hours.

511
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I think that's maybe our next plan of attack.

512
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Breaks in the news cycle like this don't come often, Stevie.

513
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Yeah.

514
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Yeah.

515
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
No, you're right.

516
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,900
That, that's exactly, that's exactly what we should do.

517
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:26,480
And they show you a Reddit post that only has like 460, that only has like 800 and 36

518
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
upvotes on it.

519
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
That's a lot.

520
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
Yeah.

521
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
It's doing all right.

522
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
Yeah.

523
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:41,480
And it is a hole in the ground somewhere in South America.

524
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Oh shit.

525
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Uh oh.

526
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,080
I don't know if he's like available.

527
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
He's gone international.

528
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,400
I want to show that to X and see what her reaction is.

529
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,200
Is this a particularly smooth hole?

530
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,920
Oh, it's an incredibly smooth hole.

531
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,400
How does she react to that?

532
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Um, wow.

533
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,240
Uh, what does the article say about it?

534
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:14,920
Yeah, it says that it's, um, there is some sort of like a lightning tornado storm and

535
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:23,080
now the, yeah, that no one's going near the hole cause they can actually see down, but

536
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:29,540
they can keep seeing down until they can't see any more down, I guess.

537
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,920
Does your brother have a place in South America or your family?

538
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Well, yeah.

539
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Where?

540
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,520
Is it a place like the gorge?

541
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,400
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

542
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,360
There's, there's no more of those.

543
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,960
So it's like a place that you vacation?

544
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,640
Well, no, I mean we have a home down there, but it's not even in the same country as this.

545
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:59,840
It's like, ah, we have, we have a, we have a home in Brazil and cow goes, I said it,

546
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,280
I said it normally zoom in and enhance that picture.

547
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Where's it from?

548
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,360
This happened in Chile.

549
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:12,400
She just swipes on the screen to enlarge it.

550
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
Do any of you guys speak Spanish?

551
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Okay.

552
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,640
See, that's, that's not a whole, and like one of the top comments is linking another

553
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,520
Reddit article that is in Europe and it's like a huge hole in the ground.

554
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
That's very smooth.

555
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,200
Stevie how many, how many of these are there?

556
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
I don't know.

557
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:39,120
I just started seeing them like today, but there, there seems to be a few, a fair, fair

558
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,720
amount of them.

559
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,120
Are they just all in the ground?

560
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,640
Are they in other, yeah.

561
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,440
One went through a building like half, like half of a building is just like gone.

562
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,560
So Stevie, do you know anything about this power your brother has or what these holes

563
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
are for?

564
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:09,080
I mean, I know that, um, they're starting to get tears in their eyes.

565
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:20,920
I know that my granddad and I guess my dad were keeping it trapped and we like let it

566
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
out or whatever.

567
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:27,040
And then I let it out or whatever.

568
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
On the bridge?

569
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
I didn't know it was there.

570
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,760
I didn't, he just did like immediately.

571
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
What did you see?

572
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,400
I mean, I saw the same as everybody else.

573
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,120
I saw, I saw the lightning, like the tunnel from like afar.

574
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,520
I wasn't even over there, but I didn't know what it was at first and it started dawning

575
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
on me.

576
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,760
This is a very important question, Stevie.

577
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,320
Between then and now, have you contacted anyone in your family?

578
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:05,120
No, just like the cops, you know, to like try to do the whole blackmail thing.

579
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,640
How come God couldn't teleport out of Grover's gorge?

580
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,800
Is there a spell?

581
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,200
No, I think he is.

582
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
I think he was in a turtle.

583
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,720
So being in a human is what caused?

584
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Or maybe there's a spell like, oh, that might be it.

585
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,600
When it was in a turtle, were there like little holes maybe?

586
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Or slow holes?

587
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,880
Oh, there you go.

588
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,360
Slow tiny holes.

589
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,520
Like aerated lawn or like, no, I don't.

590
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Little microbursts.

591
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,160
Not that I know of.

592
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,280
They might've looked like potholes, divots, but very smooth.

593
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,320
Sorry, it's like so late.

594
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,240
It's been a long day.

595
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
Okay.

596
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,040
Beck, get them an energy drink.

597
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
You got it.

598
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,200
Oh, energy drink?

599
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Give me one.

600
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Oh, okay.

601
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Yeah.

602
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I love energy drink.

603
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Me too.

604
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Go, go, go.

605
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Well, where are the...

606
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Where the fuck is he going next?

607
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,320
I don't know.

608
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Do you see any rhyme or reason to it?

609
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,320
Can we...

610
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,760
Let's maybe start plotting them out.

611
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,920
Like where are they ending up?

612
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Okay.

613
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Maybe it's a drawing.

614
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Maybe it's a symbol.

615
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,880
A good old fashioned connect the dots.

616
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
We saw symbols in the pit.

617
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,560
Maybe that's it.

618
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,800
Let's Google map them.

619
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,080
Let's Google map them.

620
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Let's Google map them.

621
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,720
Wait, Stevie, have any of the nerds in your phone started doing that already?

622
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,560
Oh, that's really smart.

623
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,240
Yeah, those Reddit tweets have been breaking a lot of shit on us.

624
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,600
Yeah, they could move this forward like so fast.

625
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,120
Can you talk to them?

626
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,200
Can you talk to them?

627
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,000
I feel like sometimes everything I say is wrong.

628
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,240
Oh, no, no, no.

629
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
I didn't mean like...

630
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
No, no.

631
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
No, it's good.

632
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
I can't.

633
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
I can't ask.

634
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,200
And they're just like going through the phone and...

635
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,560
Beck says, I'll help you out and Beck starts doing it too because that's where he lives

636
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
is online.

637
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,080
He's already had burner accounts that he can start putting stuff in different forms.

638
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,600
Do you have the stats to back that up?

639
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,840
I think I do.

640
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,040
I've got computer science if you want to use that.

641
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,800
Yeah, that's what I use to scroll Reddit.

642
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
Hold on.

643
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Yeah, that's it.

644
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,840
It does not take computer science to know how to troll on Reddit with backup accounts.

645
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,000
What skill do you want me to roll?

646
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,560
No, I'd like you to roll computer science, please.

647
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,040
It's the only one that makes sense.

648
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Oh, fuck.

649
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Hold on.

650
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,240
I think it intrinsically makes sense with Beck's character.

651
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,960
Oh, that it's automatic?

652
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
Yeah.

653
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
What's your percent?

654
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,440
I've got 60 in computer science and I rolled a seven.

655
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Okay.

656
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,240
Then suspicious activity was detected on your accounts.

657
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,360
You were upvoting.

658
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,320
It was clear that you were upvoting from the same like ISP on your multiple accounts.

659
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,520
God, I'm out of practice.

660
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:02,440
Julius pulls his phone out, but can't figure out how to navigate off of the leg day subreddit.

661
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,340
So he just puts it back.

662
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,520
He doesn't want to leave that page anyway.

663
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,920
No one on there is talking about it?

664
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,800
He scrolls through a few scrolls.

665
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Does he see anything?

666
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
What?

667
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Roll computer science?

668
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,400
I have zero.

669
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,920
The baseline is zero?

670
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Yeah.

671
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,560
I have U10 that's like giving Beck a 70, so I can't do that.

672
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,400
No, you can do that.

673
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:38,600
The only post he sees is the title is like, did a whole lot of leg workouts today.

674
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,400
It's spelled H-O-L-E.

675
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,120
And everybody gets what he's talking about.

676
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,800
So it's the highest upvoted on the page right now.

677
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,880
The weightlifter is spreading whole while showing off thighs.

678
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,920
So there's no map made or what?

679
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
Yeah.

680
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,920
How long is it going to take these nerds?

681
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
I don't know.

682
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:07,120
Like, I mean, they don't always crack everything like right away and even if they do, it might

683
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,200
just be like in some lost thread somewhere that we haven't found, but I'll keep looking.

684
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,680
I mean, just tell me where the points are and I got a map here somewhere probably.

685
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Okay.

686
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Let's do this.

687
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,640
Julius goes upstairs and finds just like a, he never hung it up on the wall, but like

688
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:35,480
a big map as art, not huge, like that Luke is holding his hands about two feet apart.

689
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,160
It's two feet map, two foot map.

690
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:44,200
Is a SIGINT specifically technology or could it be used to like decipher a cipher?

691
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
It's absolutely.

692
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
It's for deciphering.

693
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Specifically.

694
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
For deciphering.

695
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Yeah.

696
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
If we lay out the plots, can I use a SIGINT roll?

697
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Yeah.

698
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Me too.

699
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
All right.

700
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Let's roll those SIGINTs boys.

701
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Oh.

702
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Oh fuck.

703
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
I got an 86.

704
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
I got a 92.

705
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Oh my God.

706
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Damn.

707
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
I have a 70.

708
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,200
I thought that was a 69 at first.

709
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
Oh yeah.

710
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Joe, you're reading it wrong.

711
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
You got a 69.

712
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
Damn.

713
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Fuck.

714
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
God.

715
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,400
It's just like dots on a map.

716
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
It does.

717
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,680
It just looks like dots on a map.

718
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,120
Well, I think if we maybe give these Reddit nerds some time while we prepare in other

719
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,720
ways, maybe that will come to fruition for us.

720
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,520
Have we tried calling your brother?

721
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Uh, yeah.

722
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
Hmm.

723
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Where'd he say he was?

724
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,320
They hold their phone up and it's like outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing

725
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,200
call, outgoing call, outgoing call.

726
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Cal leans over the back and goes, rent free.

727
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,680
Stevie, when you like let him loose, did he like say anything?

728
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:02,480
Did he seem like he was himself at first or like, did he communicate with you at all?

729
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,280
He was, he was really, he was really wet.

730
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,960
And he looked afraid.

731
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,920
He looked afraid.

732
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,560
Wet and afraid was the alternative title of this podcast.

733
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:26,320
I've just felt this presence just emanate like through my mind and it was so scared.

734
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,760
And I, I just, I wanted to show that I was on its side and I wanted to, I thought that

735
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,560
if I could prove that I wasn't a threat, you know, like, I don't know, I, when he,

736
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,200
when he physically like went away from you, was he running?

737
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,160
Like, was he like scared?

738
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Scared?

739
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:56,160
No, no, we walked out the door and he just looked back at me and in his eyes it looked

740
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,880
like he, it looked like he was there.

741
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:08,520
It looked like, it looked like Greg and just like a single tear rolled down his face and

742
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,080
then he wasn't, rolled for what?

743
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:22,320
Greg, yeah, I just, I'm sopping wet, just walked away.

744
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:29,640
I called after him and I ran for him and I, I tried to grab onto him and push me off.

745
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,480
It wasn't, it wasn't him, it wasn't him anymore.

746
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,000
It wasn't, just kept walking.

747
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,040
Stevie did Greg display an interest in wet smooth holes from a young age?

748
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:55,600
What, why, why is everyone giggling?

749
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Well I personally think it was because of the pussy joke.

750
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,400
Oh, Cal turns very red.

751
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:12,440
This is, this is quite a lot and this whole time X has been just on her phone typing stuff,

752
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,120
swiping and such.

753
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,020
When we saw you at the bridge hole, were you, was that your first hole?

754
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,020
You saw her at the bridge?

755
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,520
Yeah, at the bridge hole.

756
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,440
You didn't tell me about the bridge hole.

757
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,280
Yes, I ran into your compatriots so we hadn't agreed whether you were going to bring them

758
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:39,000
in or not and yes, that was my, my first of these incidences of the holes.

759
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,800
Is it like coming up in your, on your guys's radar?

760
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,120
Yeah, it seems like maybe if you're investigating that first hole you'd be investigating the

761
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
subsequent holes.

762
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,800
Yes, I'm being told that the holes are being attended to.

763
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,360
But you and Julius were here before the hole.

764
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
What were you here doing?

765
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Hey, yeah.

766
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,800
Well, that Godel technology that you saw.

767
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Yeah.

768
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
Yeah.

769
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:11,560
Yeah, we would like to just like make the world aware that it's being used and his whole

770
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,280
situation.

771
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,760
Beck is pointing at the device.

772
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
You have one.

773
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Yeah.

774
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,840
I mean, we got them, they got them, but it's kind of like the government's scared to like

775
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,640
tell people so they want to expose it so that they're the bad guys that gets everybody scared

776
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,320
and then we can just make it normal.

777
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,760
What's, what's bad about these?

778
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
In my mind?

779
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Uh, nothing.

780
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Do you feel that?

781
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Yeah.

782
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Okay.

783
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,800
Why does Godel have to be the bad guy?

784
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Oh, because you know, some people are like, don't be God.

785
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,160
And so they can, if, Hey, if it's all good stuff, then Godel, that's good.

786
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,840
If it's all bad stuff, then it's not us.

787
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
That's good.

788
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,520
It turns out it's good.

789
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Everybody.

790
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
It's good for everybody.

791
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,600
Cow's looking at X. What power is this?

792
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:08,760
Oh, um, well, we're not like, like just hope.

793
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,660
Like the humanity's hope.

794
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,480
He looks at X to see if that was a good answer or not.

795
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,400
She's just kind of looking back at you with like, uh, as good as any.

796
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,560
How do you get that hope out of a human?

797
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,800
Oh no, no, it's, um, nothing so sinister.

798
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,680
We just don't know.

799
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,880
But do you suspect?

800
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,440
Well, Otherwise, what's wrong with the skin graft

801
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
2000?

802
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,320
It seems like a miracle technology.

803
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,640
Godel wouldn't be a bad guy if he released this, unless there's something sinister about

804
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
it.

805
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,400
Well, Nope, I guess you're wrong about that.

806
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Can I come at that?

807
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Yeah.

808
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
94.

809
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
39.

810
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,280
Cow's like, well, I have been wrong before.

811
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:09,120
Well, it's like, you know how you feel right now, the explanation that like, we don't know

812
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,120
and how that makes you feel, but that's going to be everybody.

813
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,440
And they're going to be mad about that.

814
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,220
I'm still a little confused, like how you have one, is he like a military contractor

815
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,920
and you got a hold of their part of their contract?

816
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,120
Did the Godels make one specifically for one for the military?

817
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,000
How mass produced are these things?

818
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,680
Those are all big questions, Mr. Wilder.

819
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,240
Yeah, I would say that, you know what you're talking about.

820
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Thanks.

821
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Absolutely.

822
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Yeah.

823
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:45,920
I, uh, I, I've got this one and, uh, I do know that if I, if something were to happen

824
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,840
to it, I probably wouldn't, you know, it'd be hard to get a replacement.

825
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,760
You know what I mean?

826
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,400
Do you have other stuff that Godels have engineered?

827
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:03,840
Dr. Murray is looking at X and X is looking at Dr. Murray and X kind of gives it a reluctant

828
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:11,720
nod and Dr. Murray is like, Oh yeah, like, like what?

829
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:19,000
I mean, I don't, I don't have the, um, necessarily the, uh, authorization to get into it, but,

830
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:29,080
I don't want to undersell you, but if you can imagine it, it can possibly be done now.

831
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,640
Like a machine that makes cappuccinos on demand?

832
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
Done.

833
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Well, we already did.

834
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Yes.

835
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,640
We already, uh, yeah, we already did that on all of the NPCs.

836
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
Okay.

837
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Cow's like, yeah.

838
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
Yeah.

839
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Beck.

840
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,640
I mean, we had one in the lobby for quite a while until, well, you remember, you kind

841
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,440
of knocked it over with your camera.

842
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Oh, it scared me.

843
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Yeah.

844
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
Yeah.

845
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Yeah.

846
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:03,080
I told you there's no, yes.

847
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,080
And I told you there's nothing to fear.

848
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:10,080
It's just a cappuccino maker.

849
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
All right.

850
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,120
Well, uh, you said anything I could think of, it's what I think everyone knows what I can

851
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
think of.

852
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Another one of those.

853
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
No, no, no, no, no.

854
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Dr. Murray X, can we have Dr. Murray's thing for our dangerous mission to find God?

855
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,760
You seem to have plenty.

856
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,360
You cannot fucking touch my, uh, my device here.

857
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,760
Seems like you answer to her.

858
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
Yes.

859
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
Uh, you cannot have her device.

860
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Uh, Dr. Murray, that will be all.

861
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
Thank you so much for your time.

862
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,600
Can I human that to see if she's lying and that we can have it?

863
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:55,080
I want to try a persuade role X please.

864
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:01,080
91 critical success.

865
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,080
Dr. Murray, it's always a pleasure.

866
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Yeah.

867
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

868
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,080
Of course.

869
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,080
I hope you're feeling better and, uh, everyone, uh, feel good and stuff.

870
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
Don't, don't have any need for me.

871
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Okay.

872
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,160
But if you do, I'll be just right around for you.

873
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
If we do.

874
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
Do you have a card?

875
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,280
Is there a way to get ahold of you?

876
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
And she shuts the door.

877
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,240
She opens the door real quick and she goes, Oh, I forgot to tell you that it was a crazy

878
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
fucking night.

879
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
Last night.

880
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:39,320
I found a parallel.

881
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:52,400
A pair of legs, lambs, lobsters, a paradise.

882
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,800
You found a paradise where, where was the paradise?

883
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
What is happening?

884
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,720
Dr. Murray, did you forget to tell us anything?

885
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
She's having a stroke.

886
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
She's just standing there.

887
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,000
I told you they're weird.

888
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,100
It's like she came back to ask for help.

889
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,880
You couldn't get it out.

890
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
She's just standing there.

891
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
Stuck frozen.

892
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,980
Hey Julius, could I have my makeup kit back?

893
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,780
Oh, he never looked at his face, but he, he gives it back.

894
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,780
Cow gives it like a quick kiss and is like, how are you doing old girl?

895
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,780
And slips it in his coat pocket.

896
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Legs.

897
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,780
What?

898
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:38,340
That's the, that's the first thing I said, and not even just one, but two, can we talk

899
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:44,700
about how you didn't say anything for like 10 minutes, two sets of legs and a top half.

900
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,700
It was nuts.

901
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,700
It was a woman.

902
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,540
I, it was a, no, I mean, obviously not one of the halves, a whole, whole woman had a

903
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,060
wild story in this whole time.

904
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,660
She's just poking her head out back into the door of Julius and X's place.

905
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,980
I, yeah, it was a, it was last night.

906
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,020
It was absolutely naughty.

907
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,820
Total cleanup over at the zeitgeist.

908
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,300
There was people in half.

909
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,300
Yeah.

910
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:13,020
Like two bottom halves and one top half is very weird.

911
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,020
It was very strange.

912
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,020
Did they see what happened?

913
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,420
Well, I mean, there was a woman there and she was like all sorts of wild.

914
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,120
I won't say a name, but what was her name?

915
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,780
She was a fine girl.

916
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,580
And tell us the initials.

917
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,060
She was telling me about this dirty girl.

918
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:34,580
Apparently like went into another person, like inside the tum tum of another person

919
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:41,140
is what she got eaten, like, but like in, like sucked into the belly or whatever.

920
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,500
And then like somebody else was punched in half, uh, it's happened at the bar.

921
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Yeah.

922
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,500
No, no, no.

923
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
At the zeitgeist.

924
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,500
Oh shit.

925
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,820
What was the bar called?

926
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,820
The printing press.

927
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,820
No, that's the drink.

928
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,820
Where are we?

929
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,820
We're at bucky kid's bar.

930
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,820
No, the first bar.

931
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,820
The foundry.

932
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,820
The foundry.

933
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,820
Sorry.

934
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,820
I was confused.

935
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,700
The zeitgeist is the city's famous secret spot to me.

936
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,700
Space Needle.

937
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,700
I think you just call them Space Needles.

938
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,420
They don't have another name, do they?

939
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:13,380
Um, not that I know of, I think it's just called a small Space Needle.

940
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,180
Well, last time I was up there, it didn't look like anybody been up there in forever.

941
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,180
Was it inside?

942
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,820
No, it was actually down on the ground.

943
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,860
Huh?

944
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,580
It's our city's famous spire.

945
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,260
Oh, yes, of course a spire.

946
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,820
My uh, my wife and I had our first date in the rotating restaurant.

947
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,020
Damn, you are old.

948
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,420
Yes, Julius.

949
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,340
Damn it.

950
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,740
Yes, I am.

951
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,580
Was it cool or was it like gimmicky?

952
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,060
Cal's eyes get misty and he like looks into the distance and a single tear rolls down

953
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,620
his cheek and he says, it was very cool.

954
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:04,820
Yeah, Julius honestly thought it was probably gimmicky until he just heard that and now

955
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:11,500
he longs to have been able to go to the rotating restaurant.

956
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Top class.

957
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,740
So, like, did you fix them or clean them up?

958
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,740
What happened?

959
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,580
Well, I didn't fix the halfs, no.

960
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,580
Does that thing?

961
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,500
Yeah, would it fix a half?

962
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
How much can that thing grow back?

963
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,140
Oh, not like a half on half, although.

964
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,340
And she gets a weird look in her eye and she goes, actually, gotta go and slams the door

965
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,340
open.

966
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:40,420
Son of a bitch, that thing rehaves halves.

967
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,420
What the?

968
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:45,340
That thing refools halves.

969
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:51,540
I mean, I know we're focused on finding God, but like we drew the dots and it's nothing.

970
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,300
What if we go check out the halves?

971
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,980
I think we should go.

972
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,780
I mean, we got two days until we can run the scratch fixer 2000 or what our skin graft

973
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,780
2000.

974
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,060
We've got the nerds working on this on the, on the, on the read it.

975
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,060
Yeah.

976
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:10,460
And then, I mean, we also got, we got other programmers out there fixing the holes or

977
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,100
something, right X?

978
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,100
Yes.

979
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,100
Let's go.

980
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,100
We can get a new news story about the halves.

981
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
Yeah.

982
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,900
We can make a whole like other story, the B block.

983
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,220
I mean, a dirty girl going into someone's belly.

984
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,660
It sounds like it's related to our whole thing.

985
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:34,100
The story can be called like, uh, it's like half, but it's like one over Z cause it happened

986
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,100
at the zeitgeist.

987
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,100
Sure.

988
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,100
Yeah.

989
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,100
We'll think about that.

990
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,100
We'll get the graphic department on there.

991
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,100
Yeah.

992
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,100
Yeah.

993
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,100
The two, that's amazing.

994
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,260
Z, I get it.

995
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,260
And it's halves.

996
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,260
Okay.

997
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,260
Yeah.

998
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,260
I was going to be the producer one day.

999
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,260
Yeah.

1000
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,300
I was going to be the producer.

1001
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,300
You're a pretty good producer.

1002
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,640
X, do you know anything about these halves?

1003
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:06,680
Not anything exactly about the halves, but Julius, you did tell me about someone else

1004
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,620
claiming that someone was trying to get into someone else's stomach.

1005
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,340
Their names were like silver and gold or something.

1006
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,340
Yeah.

1007
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,000
And there was, uh, beer, uh, something to do with beer involved.

1008
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I remember that.

1009
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,120
It's only been a few weeks, but it feels like almost a year ago.

1010
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,340
Yeah.

1011
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,040
I wonder whatever happened with that.

1012
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,220
Google it Julius.

1013
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,760
Google Kaylee silver.

1014
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,760
Yeah.

1015
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
When you Google Kaylee silver.

1016
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,600
Well, I mean, I'll need some help here.

1017
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,160
How long do these things take to go to trial?

1018
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,160
Oh, to trial?

1019
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
Depends.

1020
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:45,360
How about I just finished up.

1021
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,080
Cal's reading the article over your shoulder.

1022
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,840
He's like, wow, that was fast.

1023
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:55,080
If there's one thing about the city, it's the kind of lack of crazy crime.

1024
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,080
That's usually our thing.

1025
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,080
Yeah.

1026
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,080
Swift justice.

1027
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,080
What?

1028
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,080
Yeah.

1029
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,640
What do I find about Kaylee silver?

1030
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:09,040
I guess let's, uh, let's roll on whether or not she's had her just 50 50.

1031
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
Yeah.

1032
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,040
What do I want?

1033
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
High or low?

1034
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,040
Well, it depends if you roll low.

1035
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,080
We'll say that she already had her court date and if you roll high, it hasn't happened yet.

1036
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,080
Yep.

1037
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,320
Yeah.

1038
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
Rolled high.

1039
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,080
So hasn't happened yet.

1040
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,640
Hasn't happened yet, which is much more realistic.

1041
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,640
Yeah.

1042
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,520
She is currently, uh, in the system has not posted bail.

1043
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,640
There was like a crazy high bail posts for someone.

1044
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,640
Sure.

1045
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,640
Sure.

1046
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,640
For doing that.

1047
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,560
If you guys want it, we, we, we could maybe like set up an interview with her.

1048
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,560
Yeah.

1049
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,400
Let's, I'd like to go check out Z and see if, I mean, if that fucking lady is the one

1050
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,240
that found it, she didn't clean them up probably.

1051
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,240
Yeah.

1052
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
Yeah.

1053
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
They might still be there.

1054
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
She might've missed a half or two.

1055
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,880
We should probably go check Z out first and then, uh, then maybe, maybe Kaylee can help

1056
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,680
us fill in any gaps.

1057
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,680
Yeah.

1058
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,500
Can news away.

1059
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Pleasure meeting you X.

1060
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:09,120
The pleasure was, and she looks at Cal Colorado, all mine.

1061
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,880
Lady I used to want to ask you out, but now you scare me.

1062
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,840
Good day.

1063
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:20,000
On the way out of the house, uh, Julius like, um, stops and looks and it's the only like

1064
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,120
picture in the house, the only piece of artwork or anything.

1065
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:30,520
And it's just a framed picture of him and this guy with like long black stringy hair

1066
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:35,000
and like three long whiskers on his chin.

1067
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,440
And he looks at it and he kind of a bittersweet like head nod and then walks out of the house.

1068
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,800
Hey Julius, who's that creepy guy?

1069
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,800
Julius, uh, with that question, literally doesn't know what you're talking about.

1070
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:21,680
Well, there was that thing that happened on the other side of the city a few years ago,

1071
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,440
you know, with that crime Lord and his weird arena of death.

1072
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,840
That feels like it was hundreds of years ago to me.

1073
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,480
It was worked in the future.

1074
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,400
It was pre pandemic, which hasn't happened yet.

1075
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,600
Wait, this was 2022.

1076
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,600
Oh yeah.

1077
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,600
The big one hasn't happened yet.

1078
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
What?

1079
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
What?

1080
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
What?

1081
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,800
I'm a big fan of eating those just raw.
