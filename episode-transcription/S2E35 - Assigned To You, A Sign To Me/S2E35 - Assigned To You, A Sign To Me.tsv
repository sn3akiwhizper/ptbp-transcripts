0	4800	Introductions and greetings, my little furballs.
4800	8520	It's your best friend and worst enemy, Wolf the Dog,
8520	15840	here to gas you up, then make targeted insults that make you wonder if we were ever friends in the first place.
15840	18400	Nah, I'm just kidding.
18400	20120	Or am I?
20120	26720	I am the DJ of the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP.
26720	32440	I only demand one thing from you, my loyal, royal listeners.
32440	38320	Your unending love and admiration at all times, regardless of convenience.
38320	44800	Speaking of, this howlin' with Wolf is from Spencer Furnace in Akron, Ohio.
44800	48040	Wow, I hope the trip from Akron was worth it.
48040	54640	Spencer tagged at Pretending Pod on the internet, and for that I am eternally grateful.
54640	63480	Not eternally, just feelin' that gratitude ticklin' my intestinals for a finite period of time.
63480	65400	Spencer Furnace, right?
65400	70480	Well, hey there, Sir Wolf. Fancy seein' you round these parts.
70480	76280	I'd love to give a shout-out with all of my love to Tom and Steph, Joe and Rachel,
76280	82760	for givin' me a place to stay and a positive perspective to get through some of the hardest times.
82760	87400	And the boys at PTBP for givin' me an auditory hug
87400	92080	when I needed the sound of people who care for each other and my ear holes.
92080	94120	I'll leave y'all with a joke.
94120	98520	What do you call a hundred million year old pig?
98520	102120	Jurassic pork, baby, get you some.
102120	104960	Thank y'all for all you do.
104960	109960	Damn, I do love a good joke, Spencer from Ohio.
109960	113240	I'd love to hear one sometime.
113240	118680	See, two of us can do jokes, Spencer from Ohio.
118680	122800	But thanks for writin' in and sayin' those nice things about the show.
122800	128960	If you wanna write up somethin' for your fur-zaddy wolf to howl, tag us on the internet.
128960	131360	Yeah, yeah, we're still on the internet.
131360	135240	I know, I heard they're makin' everyone still on the internet.
135240	138600	Go to a classic Catholic confessional booth
138600	142360	and rattle off the sins to a lifelike blow-up doll
142360	147200	that kinda looks like Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
147200	150800	But not enough that it was actually modeled after him.
150800	152040	What was I sayin'?
152040	154640	The links are in the show notes.
154640	159400	Oh shit, another word for what's next is succession.
159400	162400	And I just realized that's the same guy.
162440	166240	Whoa, speaking of, it is time for the news.
166240	170800	Last time here at 694.2 PTBP,
170800	174920	the Cannes crew finished up the tense exchange with Ruth,
174920	179120	who is deathly thin, smokin' meth, doin' Adderall,
179120	181160	and looks every bit the part.
181160	183280	Julie has fed her another pill
183280	186680	with a thick GPS tracking device attached,
186680	189160	which is just awful.
189160	192160	And then, on the way to the city jail,
192160	195680	the city action news team learned a wild amount
195680	197760	about Julius's father,
197760	202040	takin' us now to the concrete steps of the city jail,
202040	204240	where Beck is filmin' Cal,
204240	207560	takin' concrete steps to get to the top.
207560	211320	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great
211320	214120	and It's All My Fault.
214120	218200	And it's all my fault
218200	223120	Cause my life is great
223120	225120	And it's all mine
232600	237480	Cause my life is great
237480	240480	And it's all my fault
248200	253280	We went around the neighborhood when I was in, like, fourth grade.
253280	256680	My brother was in, like, eighth grade with a video camera
256680	261680	and asked people to, like, for interviews for a school project,
261680	265000	and then we would just ask them random questions.
265000	268720	But the first question that we asked this one guy
268720	272160	was his thoughts on capital punishment.
272160	276760	And he talked to us about his views on capital punishment
276800	280040	for, like, 15 minutes, probably,
280040	282280	and we recorded the whole thing and then left,
282280	284720	and we're just like, I guess that was a prank.
284720	290040	Yeah, you thought you were fuckin' esoteric,
290040	291600	Longmont Potion Castle?
294240	295400	Find the humor in this, bitch.
295400	297760	We conducted interviews.
297760	300360	No, the whole time you were tellin' that story,
300360	302880	I couldn't stop thinking of burp.
302880	309000	Dude, at work the other day, I was, like, doing something with my boss,
309000	311200	and he's like, hold on, I'm getting a phone call.
311200	314480	And he, like, answers it. He's like, hello? What?
314480	317080	Uh, yes. Okay, bye.
317080	318160	And I was like, what was that?
318160	321360	And he's like, it was, like, a very young child asking me
321360	324400	if my refrigerator was running.
324400	326760	And I was like, did you know the number?
326760	328320	And he's like, I did not know the number.
328320	330440	He's like, I heard the mom in the background,
330480	333600	loud whispering, what to ask me.
333600	336680	Oh, wow.
336680	337800	Well, that's so weird.
337800	341480	It was, like, 1 p.m. on, like, a Tuesday.
341480	344920	I love the idea that the mom wanted to prank somebody,
344920	346840	but didn't have the balls to do it herself.
346840	350680	Isn't Maddie, like, nannying a kid or something?
350680	352200	Or is she just looking after a house?
352200	353080	Looking after a house.
353080	354040	Okay. Plants.
354040	355080	She got the house to call?
355080	357520	If it was, then yeah, the house called.
357520	359360	It was a haunted mansion.
359400	360320	My God.
361320	363320	Okay, this is not much spoilers.
363320	365400	This is not spoilers for The Sopranos.
365400	367760	But, Luke, you know at the very end
367760	370880	when Tony and the other guy are really feuding
370880	373480	and they try to go to his house to talk to him
373480	375560	and he's just, like, yelling at them from.
375560	376400	Yes.
376400	378040	Okay, so there's a joke on the subreddit
378040	380240	that he's just become a house.
380240	384240	And it's really fucking funny.
385080	390080	If you've seen The Sopranos, make sure to reach out and.
392080	392920	Are we recording?
392920	393760	Yeah.
396320	397160	That's good.
402280	404240	Let's get 30 seconds of silence.
406160	407960	Those bugs are loud as shit.
407960	409600	Yeah, we should actually, like,
409600	412040	maybe take a mic outside and get some of that.
412040	413120	Ooh, yeah.
413120	416360	Open the window up and get some background cicadas.
416360	417920	Get let some bugs in here.
419040	420800	They went in so bad.
420800	422720	Are those, like, a Midwestern thing
422720	423720	or are those everywhere?
423720	424560	They're everywhere.
424560	426120	I think they're Southern.
426120	427600	I don't know if they have them Northern.
427600	428880	I feel like there's some part of our country
428880	429720	that doesn't have them in there.
429720	431720	Are you trying to say this is the South?
431720	433840	But I think a lot of the East Coast has them.
433840	435560	You know, they go in cycles.
435560	437680	But there's pretty much, like, always a cycle running.
437680	439440	Have you guys always called them cicadas?
439440	440800	Yeah. Yeah.
440800	442520	Some people call them June bugs.
442520	443360	June bugs are different.
443360	444200	Those are different things.
444200	446520	Those are totally different things.
446520	448760	June bugs are, we got June bugs, buddy.
448760	450760	I thought people called the chirping cicadas
450760	451760	June bugs sometimes.
451760	452800	I've never heard that.
452800	453640	I haven't either.
453640	456320	But there is another name for cicadas.
456320	457640	Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong word.
457640	458600	This is a cicada.
458600	459920	Sleeping beauties.
459920	461200	Yeah, no, I know what a cicada is.
461200	463160	But a June bug is the brown one.
463160	464000	The green and brown thing.
464000	465600	The brown beetles that just fly dumbly
465600	466800	into you. Just straight into you.
466800	467640	Yeah.
467640	469320	Starting around late May.
469320	470440	Really picking up in June.
470960	472800	A cicada and a locust are different things, right?
472800	475000	Locust is what I was thinking of.
475000	476760	But yeah, I think they are slightly different.
476760	479600	Well, locusts are like grasshopper kind of things.
479600	481680	Yeah, June bug is like, that's what I think of
481680	482840	when I think of a June bug.
482840	486280	No, that's like a scarab.
486280	487280	Why is it so green?
488160	489280	They turn green.
489280	490760	They get like shiny.
490760	493120	They're like that and then they're green too.
493120	495000	You used to tie a little string around their leg
495000	496800	and let them fly around like a kite.
496800	497640	Katie did.
497640	498480	Katie did.
498480	499320	Katie did.
499320	500160	Katie did.
500760	503440	It does say that people do call cicadas locusts also.
503440	505240	Anyway, they're loud at night.
505240	506400	They're loud at night.
506400	507240	Tell you what.
507240	508080	Tell you what.
508080	510440	I went outside, I said, ooh, my ears are hurting.
510440	511480	Oh, I swear to God.
511480	514740	Oh my God, these bugs are gonna be the death of me.
514740	515580	The death of you?
515580	517320	The death of me.
517320	518160	Oh, okay.
518160	519000	They're so damn loud.
519000	519960	Katie did's are different.
519960	521560	Yeah, Katie did's are like grasshoppers.
521560	522400	Yeah.
522400	523240	Guys, bugs, you know.
523240	524080	Bush crickets.
524080	525720	Do they have bugs everywhere?
525720	528320	Do you guys, send in what bug you think of
528360	530120	when you think of where you live?
531280	532680	I would say cicadas.
532680	534060	I am sick of this.
534060	537160	We have plenty of role-playing to get into
537160	540800	and I refuse to not play this story for any longer.
540800	542040	Hell yeah, let's do it.
542040	542880	Okay.
542880	544240	Sorry to break it to you, Zach,
544240	545600	but we're on podcast strike.
545600	546440	Oh, no.
548080	549680	Actually, we don't write any of it,
549680	550520	so you should be on strike.
550520	552920	The writers, the directors, they folded.
552920	554680	The actors, we're the actors.
554680	555500	We're actors.
555500	556560	Well, I didn't write anything for this,
556600	558520	so we'll see what happens.
558520	559880	Yeah, but we're not gonna play it.
559880	561400	Give us something.
561400	562920	What do you want?
562920	567920	Like, get us new La Croixs.
568240	569080	Rejected!
569080	570160	Oh, no, I can do that.
572400	574000	We got them, boys.
574000	575400	They folded so fast.
575400	577280	Did you guys hear that the warden threw a party
577280	578320	in the county jail?
578320	580600	Warden threw a party in the county jail.
580600	583920	And the prison's band was there and they began to wail.
584120	586560	Let's rock, guys.
586560	588000	Let's jailhouse rock.
588000	589600	Yeah, let's jailhouse rock.
589600	590800	Let's dive in.
590800	592480	You guys are at the jail.
592480	597480	We see Cal Colorado on these big concrete steps,
597680	601120	hands out as if they're in cuffs,
601120	606120	and he is giving a hell of an intro to Beck Wilder
607160	608580	who is filming.
608580	610200	Standing behind, we have Julius Summers.
610200	612880	Some people call it a prison industrial complex.
612920	614680	Some people call it justice.
614680	618080	We're going behind bars tonight to find out the truth.
619240	621200	Stevie walks up and is like,
621200	624920	wow, you really nailed it, and hands you a towel.
624920	629600	It is midday, probably afternoon at this point here,
629600	633480	on Thursday, July 7th, 2022.
635360	637980	Brought to you by Insert Sparkling Water.
640560	641440	Belvie.
641440	642760	Not unless they pay us.
644160	645200	Belvie.
645200	646200	Oh, wow.
646200	647040	That's my favorite part of that.
647040	649000	They said it was painful at the end.
649000	650960	It wasn't, it felt good.
650960	653960	It felt good, it hurt real good.
653960	655300	What is the date?
655300	657400	I was waiting to open this until you stopped talking
657400	658760	and I didn't pay attention.
660800	663080	It's Thursday, July 7th.
663080	666000	It's mid-afternoon, which is when the sun is beating down
666000	668680	at its hottest stand.
668680	672680	The four of you are outside of the city jail.
672680	674320	Is it a jail or a prison?
674320	676680	It is a jail, it is the city jail.
676680	681680	It is where folks are kept for short stints
681680	686080	or just before their trial if they're not out on bond.
686080	689000	That reminds me, did we figure out definitively
689000	691880	if she is just awaiting trial or has she been sentenced?
691880	694440	That is correct, she is awaiting trial.
694440	696120	Well, let's go in.
696120	697560	What do we wanna ask her?
697560	701040	I figured we would just make it up as we went along.
701040	703480	I say we get a feel for her immediately,
703480	706920	see if she's lost it or if she's with us.
706920	709320	We wanna know more specifically about
709320	712320	like why her roommate tried to get inside her
712320	714040	because we think that might be connected.
714040	717100	And I think, you know, reviewing the footage,
717100	718800	maybe ask about the beer itself.
718800	721040	It seemed that she was the one making it
721040	723260	and that is what set her friend off.
723260	724100	Yeah.
724100	726820	Do we need a quick overview for the listeners?
726820	729340	I mean the viewers, the Kaylee situation.
729340	733420	Well, she was drinking a beer, talking to her friend
733420	737100	and then her friend attacked her and then she killed her.
737100	739660	Specifically saying things like, I gotta get inside you,
739660	741300	I'm gonna rip you apart, I want in.
741300	743260	Yeah, diving for her stomach.
743260	745140	And then she called City Action News
745140	746080	to get to the bottom of it.
746080	747420	She trusted you, Cal.
747420	749540	And here we are, we're here to help.
749540	750380	Let's go.
750380	753300	Okay, yeah, cause Dr. Murray said something about
753300	756020	people trying to get inside or even like
756020	758980	getting inside other people at the zeitgeist.
758980	760340	Right, it's all connected.
760340	761540	Okay, wow.
761540	762420	Potentially.
762420	764540	Haven't you been watching the news?
766700	771700	You walk into the city jail and it is a large
772540	777480	en, en, en, en, enchants, foyer?
777480	779020	There's a large foyer.
779020	782140	Wow, that's a great foyer in this jail.
783140	786460	Big columns, big concrete columns.
786460	789140	I like that you tried to French up entrance.
793140	794780	Cause we were just listening to that episode
794780	797700	where we talked about the city's cage inheritance.
797700	800140	Oh, and then you walk into the entrance.
800140	800980	Now what?
802620	805900	And yeah, it's like the,
805900	808180	I think it might've been a bank in the matrix
808180	809780	where there's a big shootout in,
810060	812220	big columns lining either side.
812220	815100	And then at the far end, away from you,
815100	819380	you see that there is a man in uniform.
819380	820540	Ooh, la la.
820540	821980	Zach, what do you think jail is?
821980	823040	What, so far?
826380	827580	So far it's pretty cool.
831580	835020	I know that the architecture should be sad and oppressive,
835020	837740	which is what I'm going for with the concrete
837740	840460	and the big blocks and-
840460	843100	We passed by the arcade, but it says closed.
845580	846900	So saddest thing I've ever seen.
846900	848460	Beck, get a shot of that.
848460	851300	Zoom in on the out of order sign on all the machines.
852640	857640	At the end of this foyer, there is a wall
858140	862660	and part of the wall is this thick glass
862660	866140	and behind is this man in uniform, ooh, la la.
866140	871020	And he just looks up at you, his face is like red.
871020	873340	We're here to see Kaylee Silver.
873340	876220	Beck just holds up his lanyard that has the press.
876220	877340	Yeah. Lanyard on it.
877340	881940	Oh yeah, you guys recalled earlier, yeah.
881940	883060	Oh yeah, I remember you.
883060	885340	Yeah, you see it's Officer Peeler.
885340	890340	Name's Stu, and you guys are coming in for a story or?
890380	892340	Could you just go get him, yeah.
892340	896180	Oh, I have to wait until it's rung in.
896180	899340	I figured we could just chat.
899340	901300	Zach is making a truly horrible face
901300	903740	to voice this character.
903740	905700	It's good, feels fine.
905700	907900	Yeah, we're just here to do a story.
907900	909220	We're doing some investigating.
909220	912260	Cool, I love the news.
912260	916060	You guys are, you guys do the truth,
916060	917900	telling the people what we've been up to.
917900	921740	It's like makes them know how real it really is, you know?
921980	923980	Do you have any bad stories about this place?
923980	926460	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
926460	927300	Like what?
927300	930260	I ordered a sandwich from lunch today,
930260	933100	and it didn't have pickles on it.
933100	933940	Oh.
936180	938060	And who makes the sandwiches?
938060	939020	Jimmy John's.
941300	943220	Well, you know, freaky fast.
943220	945500	Sometimes pickles get lost in the mix.
945500	948100	Yeah, we gotta see things from other people.
948100	948980	Oh, they're ready.
948980	950300	As we file past,
952020	956860	Cal like discreetly places a tube of like hemorrhoid cream
956860	959460	on his counter and gives him the finger guns and winks.
959460	961340	And he's like, this should help.
961340	963100	I thought it was gonna be pickles.
964460	966340	Just in case my pocket pickles.
966340	968660	You can't just give your pocket pickles to any fucking-
968660	970900	Yeah, I would never give this man my pocket pickles.
970900	973060	Random stew on the street.
973060	975540	He buzzes you in through the door.
975540	978220	The first one's ready for you.
978220	980780	And as you head in,
980780	983780	you see that there is a metal detector.
983780	986500	Does anyone have anything
986500	989100	that they need to take out of their pockets?
989100	990500	Beck probably does,
990500	992500	as far as just having a lot of shit in his pockets,
992500	993340	but he's not gonna.
993340	995740	He just is carrying his equipment through there.
995740	997660	It's gonna buzz.
997660	998780	Everybody knows it.
999460	1000300	God.
1010500	1012820	Yeah, I guess Cal takes off a watch
1012820	1016020	and he puts it like in Beck's like,
1016020	1018100	do you have a vest with like a bunch of pockets?
1018100	1020020	Yeah, I put it in one of those pockets
1020020	1022020	and maybe my smartphone.
1022020	1024140	And I'm like, actually you can just keep holding
1024140	1024980	onto this Beck.
1024980	1026060	Yeah, for sure.
1026980	1030740	Officer Peeler comes out the back kind of side door
1030740	1032020	to this room and he's like,
1032020	1035380	you're gonna have to give me the old wand
1035380	1037580	down on all this, okay?
1037580	1040220	And then takes a wand and starts beeping.
1040220	1042340	As he's doing this,
1042340	1044500	Julius just walks through the metal detector
1044500	1047860	and tries to like act nonchalant.
1047860	1049220	Does it crazy go off?
1049220	1050180	It goes off.
1050180	1052860	Yeah, roll stuff I guess.
1052860	1053820	We already established
1053820	1055540	that we're just sending Beck through.
1055940	1057060	And making him deal with it.
1057060	1058540	You could have given him your guns.
1058540	1060580	I got a seven, it's a pass.
1060580	1061940	Oh, I was thinking D and D rolls.
1061940	1064300	I've been listening to too many other podcasts.
1065300	1067220	Julius makes a seven.
1067220	1068060	You idiot.
1072940	1076060	Julius just kind of makes this high pitched screeching sound
1076060	1076980	as he does it.
1076980	1077980	Amazing.
1077980	1080180	Oh yeah, he always just makes that sound.
1081060	1083340	Sorry, when I get excited, I make that sound
1083340	1086340	and I'm excited, we're about to do a good interview.
1086340	1089340	So what did we sneak through here?
1089340	1090620	I have my guns on me.
1090620	1092940	Yeah, I thought those might've just gotten through.
1092940	1096700	And Julius went ahead and did a little shovel action
1096700	1098540	just down the side of his pants.
1098540	1100540	And it's like sticking up into his armpit.
1100540	1103020	Shovel action meaning you shove the shovel down your pants?
1103020	1104780	You have the shovel like on your hip
1104780	1107500	going up your side into your armpit?
1107500	1111460	Down to like my ankle, under my pants
1111460	1114020	and going up in and the handle is like
1114020	1115700	kind of up in his armpit.
1115700	1117580	You should do it the other way around.
1117580	1122580	Yeah, I think if you have the shovel under your armpit
1122580	1123940	against your body.
1123940	1126580	You turn around on the other side of the medical detector
1126580	1129260	and you're just like shuffling with something.
1129260	1130100	He's fixing it.
1130100	1131500	Taking your pants half off.
1131500	1136220	So he's got both his guns and Dr. Brock Hargrave's shovel.
1136220	1139660	Okay, well, you did pass that check.
1139660	1142100	So you slide on through and...
1142100	1144420	Beck doesn't have anything that's actually
1144420	1145260	like guns or anything,
1145260	1146940	but he does probably have a pocket knife
1146940	1148940	and he's got pliers and scissors
1148940	1150940	and just equipment that you would have
1150940	1153180	to set up a shot somewhere.
1153180	1156900	Beck has six Leathermans on him at any given moment.
1156900	1160380	Okay, well, Officer Peeler didn't do a very good job
1160380	1161220	checking you.
1161220	1164100	So he's just beeping the wand around.
1164100	1164940	It keeps beeping.
1164940	1168100	He's like, equipment, equipment, equipment.
1170620	1172060	Yeah, he's gonna beep, like you said.
1172060	1174540	Mr. Colorado, come on through.
1174540	1176340	Would you like to wand a celebrity?
1178700	1179700	Come on in here.
1179700	1180540	Okay.
1180540	1182940	And when you walk through, does it go off?
1182940	1183780	No.
1183780	1185860	Okay, so he goes up with a wand
1185860	1187860	and then as he's about to, he's like,
1188940	1191140	there's no need, I guess.
1191140	1192460	Beck, can I have my watch back?
1192460	1194220	Yeah, of course.
1194220	1195060	Thank you.
1195060	1197220	It was a spy watch, die, Officer Peeler.
1200620	1202100	So it was this room?
1202100	1204740	Yeah, if you go in there and you'll just wait
1204740	1208060	and then you'll see the line, they'll take you to it.
1208060	1210500	And as he opens the door for you,
1210500	1212740	you see a line of tape on the ground
1212740	1214660	that kind of leads you.
1214660	1216140	I thought there was a bunch of people here to see.
1216140	1216980	I was like, fuck.
1218580	1220420	Kaylee's quite popular.
1221940	1223700	Julius was following the line of tape?
1223700	1224780	Follow the line of tape.
1224780	1229380	You go through a room, out the other side, down a hallway.
1229980	1232340	Beck's getting footage of this walk.
1232340	1233260	Interesting, yeah.
1233260	1237860	It's just the boring inside of the city jail.
1237860	1241140	Nothing juicy, nothing too interesting.
1241140	1246140	All just the same sort of oppressive, bland design
1246940	1248020	and architecture.
1248020	1251780	You see a painting on a wall in a hallway
1251780	1255140	and even though it is this oasis
1255140	1258900	in a desert of horrible vibes,
1259340	1263380	something about the painting is still just manufactured.
1263380	1264220	Run of the mill.
1264220	1265260	It makes it worse almost.
1265260	1266100	Hotel art.
1266100	1267820	Yeah, exactly.
1267820	1269020	That's a nice painting.
1271220	1272340	Now Cal has taste.
1274300	1275260	For a jail.
1278060	1281660	The line eventually leads you to a room.
1281660	1286660	One wall is made up of little cubicle type spaces
1287140	1288900	with glass.
1288900	1293900	So there's six different spots that you can sit at
1293980	1296580	where an inmate would come from the other side,
1296580	1300780	sit at a chair, grab the phone that is right next to it,
1300780	1304100	pick it up and talk to you on the other side.
1304100	1309060	On this side, there is an old school speakerphone
1309060	1311620	sitting just in the middle of each table
1311620	1314900	and so no phone on your side because there's more of you
1314900	1317980	and it's a role playing game that makes it easier.
1317980	1320940	And as you walk into this room,
1320940	1325580	Kaylee Silver is being walked down a long hallway
1325580	1329060	on the other side and she looks rough.
1329060	1332780	Her sandy blonde hair is darker than it was
1332780	1335740	the last time you saw her a few weeks ago.
1335740	1339020	Space buns are actually still up,
1339020	1340660	still rocking the same dew
1340660	1344100	but it's messy buns on the other side,
1344180	1347140	flyaways and just like stray hairs.
1347140	1349100	They let her have hair ties in prison.
1349100	1351940	No, it's actually tied in itself.
1351940	1353980	It's like a self-tied knot.
1353980	1356940	I think I asked this the first time, are space buns Leia?
1356940	1358180	Yes, similar, yeah.
1358180	1361180	It's just a little buns on top of your head.
1361180	1363540	Now that they're like wrapped into themselves,
1363540	1368420	it's more like she just has two like dark dirty blonde knots
1368420	1372140	tied on top of her head that are flopping about.
1372140	1374580	Oh, have you had the dirty blonde knots at Big Slice?
1374580	1377460	They are garlicky.
1379660	1384660	And there is a distance in her eyes
1385020	1387620	as she walks up and sits down.
1387620	1389220	Everybody roll alertness.
1393400	1394240	Pass.
1394240	1395060	Fail.
1395060	1395900	Fail.
1395900	1400900	Luke, Julius notices that Kaylee's nostrils are flaring.
1401380	1403500	Kaylee, do you remember us?
1403500	1407700	Her eyes get really big and she picks up the phone.
1407700	1408540	We're here to help.
1408540	1410420	I just want to let you know, we're here to help.
1410420	1413900	Mr. Colorado, Mr. Colorado, Mr. Colorado is here.
1413900	1416100	Oh, okay, that's who it is.
1416100	1417940	Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
1417940	1419820	Okay, okay, everything's gonna be fine
1419820	1421420	because Mr. Colorado's here.
1421420	1422620	Everything's gonna be fine, Kaylee,
1422620	1425140	because Mr. Colorado's here and everybody's here
1425140	1426620	and everything's gonna be fine
1426620	1428820	because I can smell it again.
1428820	1430060	Oh, I can smell it again.
1430100	1432900	And she starts rubbing her face
1432900	1436900	and she looks at you, just really, really massive eyes.
1436900	1437740	Kaylee, Kaylee.
1437740	1438580	Mr. Colorado.
1438580	1440700	That's right, you're here live with Mr. Colorado.
1440700	1442440	Mr. Colorado is here, you're gonna help me,
1442440	1443660	you're gonna help me, you're gonna help me.
1443660	1444500	What do you smell?
1444500	1445340	It's only gotten worse.
1445340	1446540	Kaylee, Kaylee, I want the smell.
1446540	1450420	And she slams her face kind of up against the glass
1450420	1453260	and then rubs it along the side
1453260	1455060	until she makes it to the edge.
1455060	1458020	And even though there's cock along the edge,
1458020	1460220	she's just like trying to get her nostrils
1460220	1462460	as close to that corner as possible
1462460	1467460	and just ripping inhales through her nasal cavity.
1467660	1470700	And she's like, it smells, it smells like it.
1470700	1471900	It smells like the view.
1471900	1472740	Smells like when she,
1472740	1474900	it just smells like when she tried to get into me.
1474900	1475740	Excuse us.
1475740	1476560	It smells like when she was in me.
1476560	1477400	Excuse us for just a moment.
1477400	1479020	It smells like when she was in me.
1479020	1481020	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
1481020	1483060	It smells like when she was in me.
1483060	1483900	Ah, ah.
1483900	1488900	We're gonna step away for just a moment, Ms. Silver.
1490180	1491380	We'll be right back with you.
1491380	1495620	You can hear just repeating herself over and over.
1495620	1497620	Can we film this?
1497620	1498460	I already have been.
1498460	1499420	You're looking at Beck.
1499420	1501700	Beck's just holding the camera.
1501700	1503740	I've got a microphone that's like set up
1503740	1505180	in front of that little speaker
1505180	1507100	and the tripod's already out.
1507100	1508820	He wasn't asking like, should we?
1508820	1509660	He's asking.
1509660	1510880	Did Stevie come in with us?
1510880	1511720	Yeah.
1511720	1513740	Okay, who has the back?
1514460	1517860	Stevie slowly opens the bag and like immediately-
1517860	1518940	What the, Stevie.
1518940	1521900	Kaylee's feet hop up onto the counter,
1521900	1523640	like where the other side is.
1523640	1527000	And then her CO comes over and just like grabs her
1527000	1528820	and you just hear them kind of arguing
1528820	1530380	over the phone a little bit.
1530380	1532840	Stevie, why don't you, fuck.
1532840	1536340	Stevie, give us a moment.
1536340	1538820	And we step in for a little bit further.
1538820	1539660	Yeah.
1540820	1543580	We can't send Stevie out of here with the bag.
1544260	1545340	The last time we let them out of our sight,
1545340	1546180	they took off with their brother.
1546180	1547060	That's right.
1547060	1547900	I love Stevie.
1547900	1549980	They're the best damn intern Cairns had in years,
1549980	1551980	but they've still got to prove themselves.
1551980	1553300	I don't trust Stevie yet.
1553300	1555180	Not where their brother is concerned.
1555180	1557820	But this bag, we can't have this bag in the same room
1557820	1559580	as Kaylee and get anything out of her.
1559580	1560660	That's pretty clear.
1560660	1561920	I don't know, we haven't even tried.
1561920	1562760	We just tried.
1562760	1564100	Nobody asked her anything.
1564100	1565500	Nobody's even spoken to her yet.
1565500	1567280	Yes, I tried to speak to her.
1567280	1568780	She went insane.
1568780	1569620	What are you-
1569620	1571860	What are you talking about?
1575740	1576580	Pearl grip.
1576580	1577980	I didn't even give her a chance.
1581980	1584740	That's how everybody is when you start a conversation.
1584740	1588060	I think we should ask her if she knows what this is.
1588060	1590580	Stevie opened it from over here
1590580	1593020	and she went, Eepy, over there.
1593020	1594380	Stevie had it in their pocket.
1594380	1597220	Hey, Kaylee, what are you smelling?
1597220	1598980	She's screaming and being constrained.
1599580	1601740	Yeah, she's still like going ham.
1601740	1603340	Julius asks anyway.
1603340	1604960	He asks it again.
1604960	1606060	Hey, let her go.
1606060	1607420	What are you smelling here?
1608900	1609740	They can't hear you.
1609740	1610820	They just let her go.
1612500	1614660	Like the phone is how you communicate with them
1614660	1618820	and the phone is currently like hanging from the cord.
1618820	1620380	Julius knocks on the glass.
1622500	1625340	Kaylee like has a hand of against the glass
1625340	1628580	where you're knocking and is all smiles
1629020	1630660	and so she grabs the phone and holds it up.
1630660	1633000	What are you smelling there?
1636420	1641220	You brought it, you brought it, can I have it?
1641220	1642660	What did we bring?
1642660	1643500	What is it you want?
1643500	1644460	Have you seen it before?
1644460	1647060	It smells like when she was inside me.
1647060	1649820	Julius goes to grab the Ziploc bag.
1649820	1651260	Whoa, okay.
1651260	1652140	And pulls it out.
1652140	1655100	As you grab it, Kaylee is like once again
1655100	1657400	just losing their mind.
1659580	1662420	But they keep it under control
1662420	1666060	and sit down and start to breathe really strongly.
1666060	1670940	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
1670940	1673200	Julius is just looking at Beck and Cal.
1674460	1676700	Somebody asked her, was this an ingredient she used?
1676700	1678500	That smells like forever.
1678500	1679660	It smells like it.
1679660	1682620	Did you use this in the beer that you brewed?
1684860	1687060	It tastes, yeah, yeah.
1687060	1687900	Where did you find it?
1688060	1688900	Where'd you get it?
1688900	1690060	Yeah, where'd you get it, Kaylee?
1690060	1690900	The what?
1690900	1691720	The what?
1691720	1692560	The ingredient.
1692560	1693400	This.
1693400	1696580	Oh, it was America's American Nail Dry Yeast.
1696580	1698320	America's American Nail Dry Yeast.
1698320	1701020	America's American Nail Dry Yeast.
1701020	1702300	Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1702300	1703400	Yeah, is that what you have?
1703400	1704240	Is that what you have?
1704240	1705060	Did you make beer?
1705060	1705900	Did you make some beer?
1705900	1706740	Did you make some beer?
1706740	1707560	Can you bring it?
1707560	1709200	And they turned to their CEO.
1709200	1710040	Can I drink beer?
1710040	1710860	Can I have it?
1710860	1711700	Can I have it?
1711700	1712700	If they give me some, can I have it?
1712940	1713780	Oh.
1715580	1718620	You guys, she wasn't like this when we last talked to her.
1718620	1721700	Do you think she could have been re-exposed or something?
1721700	1724160	Or maybe she's like, fiending for it.
1724160	1725220	Oh, right.
1725220	1728060	She's been having like a steady supply and it got cut off.
1728060	1730540	Or you just have to even have it once
1730540	1732440	and then this is you now.
1732440	1734980	Kaylee, which one of those things we just said?
1739060	1740460	Haven't had it.
1740460	1742060	Haven't had it, want it.
1742420	1744020	How many times did you have it?
1746340	1748460	Last time I had it, she got in me and I got her out
1748460	1752380	and then I had to kill her.
1752380	1753540	I had to kill her.
1753540	1755060	She got in you?
1755060	1755900	She got in me.
1755900	1758460	Yeah, she got in me, she got in me, she got in me.
1758460	1759300	I've been thinking about it.
1759300	1761380	I've been thinking about it so much.
1761380	1764260	I don't think that I thought about it when it was happening
1764260	1766340	but she was in me, she was in me.
1766340	1767500	What do you mean by in you?
1767500	1769180	It was crazy, she was like, have we in me?
1769180	1771180	It was crazy, I have to pull her out completely.
1771180	1773220	She was gonna be in me and then I had to pull her out
1773220	1775180	and then she was out and then I had to kill her
1775180	1776780	because she was gonna go back in.
1776780	1778620	She was gonna go back in, she was trying to get back in.
1778620	1779740	She wasn't her, it wasn't her.
1779740	1780980	I saw it in her eyes, it wasn't her.
1780980	1784260	Yeah, we saw that video and it was self-defense, you're okay.
1784260	1788420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
1788420	1789820	But you're saying that maybe there was a little more?
1789820	1791420	Can I have that, can I have that?
1791420	1793340	Can I have it, can I have it?
1793340	1794340	Do you want to get inside?
1794340	1795580	Do you want to get inside me?
1795580	1797900	Oh, this is not that kind of show.
1799580	1800740	Not what I meant, not what I meant.
1800740	1802220	Just, you know.
1802220	1804580	Was that the first batch that you'd brewed
1804580	1808540	with that America's American Ale dry yeast?
1808540	1810220	Yeah, yeah, didn't even get to try it.
1810220	1812480	What made you decide to go with that brand?
1812480	1814100	New brand, new brand.
1814100	1815300	New brand from where?
1815300	1816700	New brand, just got online.
1817580	1818460	Where online?
1818460	1822180	Julius Googles immediately, America's American whatever,
1822180	1824620	what is it, America's American all dry yeast.
1824620	1826740	America's American Ale dry yeast.
1826740	1828900	America's American Ale dry yeast.
1828940	1830980	America's American Ale dry yeasts.
1830980	1832020	Where did you get it, Kaylee?
1832020	1832860	Where online?
1837860	1839360	I don't remember.
1844740	1845860	Julius Googles it.
1845860	1846900	If you must.
1846900	1848980	When you Google it, guess who sells it.
1848980	1849820	Godel.
1849820	1850660	Play-Doh.
1851580	1852420	So Godel?
1852420	1854300	Yeah, the Godel company.
1854300	1856460	I didn't guess very good, I'm sorry.
1857140	1860300	Oh my, look, guys, look at this.
1860300	1861140	Fucking Godel.
1861140	1864020	Holy shit, it is connected.
1864020	1864860	Oh yeah.
1864860	1867140	Stevie, do you know anything about it?
1867140	1869940	Stevie, they're putting forever in the yeast.
1869940	1870780	What?
1870780	1873340	We need to find out how many people ordered this yeast.
1873340	1874660	Maybe it was an accident.
1874660	1875940	Maybe it's like at the factory,
1875940	1878820	whatever this stuff is got mixed in with the yeast.
1878820	1880420	Joe, can you roll a grip for me?
1885260	1886100	Fail.
1886740	1887580	Number one grip.
1887580	1889420	How many letters are in Americas?
1889420	1890260	Oh my God.
1891700	1892540	Damn it.
1894340	1895180	Eight.
1895180	1896420	How many letters are in American?
1896420	1897260	Eight.
1897260	1898440	How many in Ale?
1898440	1899280	Three.
1899280	1900100	Dry?
1900100	1900940	Three.
1900940	1901780	And six.
1901780	1902600	Yeasts.
1902600	1903440	Eight, eight, three, three, six?
1903440	1904340	Oh, that's kind of weird.
1904340	1905180	I mean, maybe not even.
1905180	1908580	I'm sorry, it's yeast's plural?
1908580	1909700	It is.
1909700	1910860	Well, I don't think,
1910860	1913620	I think the plural of yeast is yeast.
1913620	1914820	Yeast die.
1914940	1916180	That's even weirder.
1916180	1917020	We've got-
1917020	1918180	It's an apostrophe S.
1919060	1919880	Okay.
1919880	1920720	Cal-roll-crip.
1925100	1927180	In this shot for the audience,
1927180	1928860	this conversation's going along
1928860	1930940	and Beck is counting on his fingers
1931980	1934140	and then looking up at the sky
1935180	1937420	and he goes back to his fingers
1937420	1939900	and then he just starts staring dead ahead.
1939900	1943360	It's the fucking numbers, guys.
1945260	1946360	They're here again.
1947540	1949800	Time for another visit from the numbers.
1950800	1952900	Oh, God damn it.
1952900	1953940	Beck's got the numbers in him.
1953940	1955100	Beck, Beck, calm down.
1955100	1956740	America's eight.
1956740	1958740	American, eight.
1958740	1960700	Ale, three.
1960700	1962100	Dry, three.
1962100	1963660	And yeast is six.
1964700	1965900	That's what I'm telling you.
1965900	1966740	Why would it be yeast?
1966740	1967900	It should be yeast.
1967900	1968740	Five.
1968740	1971140	They must've made it so it would be six.
1971140	1972720	Oh my God.
1972720	1974620	That's just lazy, Julius.
1975260	1977140	Julius is Googling-
1977140	1978260	Come up with a different word.
1978260	1982820	America's American ale dry yeasts Reddit
1982820	1985980	and looking on the brewing, home brewing subreddit
1985980	1987420	to see if anybody's mentioned it.
1987420	1989300	Beck is, during his diatribe,
1989300	1992540	gonna look at Kaylee, grab the phone
1992540	1994780	and say, eight, three, six, eight, three, six.
1994780	1996620	You're just picking up the speakerphone
1996620	1998860	and like yelling into it.
1998860	2001460	Computer, eight, three, six, eight, three, six.
2002380	2003540	Oh yeah, Kaylee.
2003540	2005980	You lived in apartment, eight, three, six.
2005980	2008740	Why are you saying my apartment number?
2008740	2011620	What led you to choose that particular apartment?
2011620	2012460	I don't know.
2012460	2014040	It was just a sign to me?
2014040	2014940	I guess-
2014940	2016400	Assigned to you.
2016400	2033680	Assigned to you, whatever do you mean?
2033680	2038120	I guess it was just like the landlord put me there.
2038120	2040240	Oh, well that makes sense.
2040240	2042840	When's your birthday?
2042840	2044640	August 36th.
2044640	2047480	Whoa!
2047480	2056040	Beck starts to slam his head in the glass from this side.
2056040	2058880	What's your birthday?
2058880	2060800	I mean, I don't know what else to ask her.
2060800	2062240	I think we need to track this down.
2062240	2063080	Who is your landlord?
2063080	2064080	Yeah, who owns your building?
2064080	2065000	Is it the Godel Corp?
2065000	2067000	Julius, use your devil box to look that up.
2067000	2071640	He Googles Godel Corp apartments.
2071640	2074360	City County Assessors.
2074360	2076920	Did you mean the Godel Company?
2076920	2080840	I look up the Godel Company, what do they own?
2080840	2082240	Land.
2082240	2085920	Have you Googled anything before?
2085920	2087600	That's just as quick as he can type.
2087600	2090920	He's just keywords, keywords.
2090920	2095840	Role of computer science or accounting?
2095840	2096680	Fail.
2096680	2097640	OK.
2097640	2100600	Surprisingly, that doesn't come up
2100600	2101960	with any helpful information.
2101960	2102920	No, I don't know.
2102920	2106280	Try the City Assessor's Office.
2106280	2109920	Here it is.
2109920	2114600	The Godels have bought just like wild amounts of land
2114600	2116640	just under the name the Godel Company.
2116640	2120160	And you can imagine that they must own even more.
2120160	2121160	Shells within shells.
2121160	2124800	It's turtle mares all the way down.
2124800	2127320	Whoa.
2127320	2131960	And the building Kaylee Silver lived in
2131960	2134440	is owned by the Godel Company.
2134440	2135680	Son of a bitch.
2135680	2137960	I'm talking not to the speaker now.
2137960	2139720	And in fact, trying to maybe get away
2139720	2141080	from the speaker a little bit
2141080	2143360	and just talk to the guys and Stevie.
2143360	2146040	You guys think maybe the Godel Corporation.
2146040	2146880	Company?
2146880	2149320	The Godel Company was conducting
2149320	2152200	like a specific experiment on her
2152200	2154400	and maybe this American yeast or whatever
2154400	2155960	was delivered only to her.
2155960	2159440	Yeah, what if they implanted an ad on her social media?
2159440	2161320	I wouldn't put that above the Godel Corp.
2161320	2163320	Company, yeah, I wouldn't either.
2163320	2164880	We all hate the Godel Corp.
2164880	2166520	Yeah, we all hate the Godel Company.
2166520	2167560	Godel Co.
2167560	2169400	What happens if I try to,
2169400	2172760	if I try to go order.
2172760	2174480	Paration.
2174480	2177760	If I try to order some of the yeast,
2177760	2180480	does it, is it sold out or does it let me get it?
2180480	2181720	Yeah, you can order some.
2181720	2182720	Where'd you order it to?
2182720	2185000	Your home or the jail?
2185000	2186440	The can offices.
2186440	2189000	Okay, speedy delivery.
2190720	2192280	Yeast for you, sir.
2192280	2193120	Yeasts.
2195560	2196760	Guys, I went ahead and got some.
2196760	2199640	I'm not sure that we like want to test it, but.
2199640	2200960	That's worth a shot.
2200960	2202440	I mean, we, yeah.
2202440	2206160	We know that now that she was assigned this apartment
2206160	2207560	by the Godel Corp.
2207560	2209600	It's Godel Corp branded yeast.
2209600	2210920	Yeah, Godel Company for sure.
2210920	2212920	And we know that this horrific event took place
2212920	2214400	after using it.
2214760	2217160	We haven't really heard about that happening elsewhere.
2217160	2218000	Right?
2218000	2223000	Stevie, does Godel make the products like in the gorge?
2223000	2224880	Yeah, they do now.
2224880	2226160	Fuck.
2226160	2227720	I think we got to go back.
2227720	2230080	Well, eventually for like a climactic conclusion,
2230080	2232880	but not before we get an army of rat boys from your dad.
2234560	2236760	I mean, is there anything else we want to ask her?
2236760	2238480	836.
2238480	2239320	What?
2239320	2240160	No, no, no.
2244440	2247600	Kaylee, were you a home brewer before this?
2247600	2249640	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2249640	2250680	Pretty, pretty avid, huh?
2250680	2251520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2251520	2253000	Had you bought from the Godel Corp?
2253000	2253840	No.
2253840	2256240	No, what led you to buy from them?
2256240	2257080	There's an ad.
2257080	2257920	An ad on?
2257920	2258760	Instagram.
2258760	2259600	On Instagram.
2259600	2261120	Oh, those can be persuasive.
2261120	2264600	You know, Kaylee, I recently went digitally clean.
2264600	2265440	Bragged.
2266620	2268680	Well, yes, it is a brag because I'm living
2268680	2270160	a happier, healthier lifestyle
2270160	2271440	and everybody should emulate this.
2271440	2274040	But, but no, before that, I.
2274040	2275760	Are you gonna help me?
2275760	2277080	Yes, Kaylee.
2277080	2278520	You know, I bet they don't give you a phone in here.
2278520	2280040	That's half the battle already,
2280040	2282040	but we are gonna get to the bottom of this
2282040	2283440	and we're gonna make sure what happened to you
2283440	2285200	doesn't happen to anybody else again.
2285200	2286840	Okay, but are you gonna help me?
2287760	2289960	I'm gonna die in here.
2289960	2291880	The evidence that you have, I think,
2291880	2294360	once you go to trial will exonerate you.
2294360	2295960	Yeah, when is your trial date?
2295960	2299200	I pushed it back, said a roll went wrong or something,
2299200	2302400	but it's in two weeks.
2302400	2303840	Can you make it in here for two weeks?
2304680	2309680	We're gonna see if you could, is there any way, hey,
2311240	2314640	is there any way that you can send some of that in
2314640	2318240	even if it's just a little bit like the residue on a letter
2318240	2321760	and maybe just like rub it on the letter
2321760	2326120	and then send the letter in just so I can spell it again?
2327200	2329600	No, Kaylee, we're not allowed to make the news.
2329600	2330680	We can only investigate.
2330680	2332640	We can't really interfere.
2332640	2335920	I can't materially support the suspect of a murder
2335920	2339960	even though I believe her to be innocent, do you understand?
2339960	2342080	Otherwise it would question my impartiality.
2342080	2343840	But in two weeks you'll get exonerated,
2343840	2344680	you'll get out of here
2344680	2347600	and you're gonna have all of it that you want.
2347600	2349280	No one's gonna believe them when I tell them
2349280	2350560	Kaylee Silver's innocent
2350560	2353840	if I've also been sending Kaylee Silver gift packages.
2355560	2360560	She slams her hand against her thigh.
2361000	2362360	Ah, shucks.
2364200	2366480	Oh, shucks, okay.
2367840	2370880	And you can tell that with everything in her body
2370880	2374600	she wanted to release, she wanted to scream,
2374600	2377040	she wanted to slam her head repeatedly
2377040	2379080	into that glass right in your face.
2379080	2382600	She wanted to lose control but she held on,
2382600	2385360	she held it together and she smiles.
2386320	2389280	Thank you, please help me.
2389280	2390520	We'll do what we can, Kaylee.
2390520	2391360	Stay safe in here,
2391360	2394000	you don't have much longer to have to put up with it.
2395120	2396680	Do you know Burl Summers?
2396680	2399680	Julius kind of waves, Julius like waves over
2399680	2402000	at the correctional officer.
2402000	2404160	The CEO comes over, grabs the phone.
2404160	2405000	You done?
2405000	2406400	Yeah, I believe we're done with Kaylee
2406400	2410560	and I think we had a private room to meet with Burl.
2410560	2412480	That's right, follow the green line.
2412480	2413600	Green line?
2413600	2418120	So you follow the green tape heading down the corridor,
2418160	2421920	similar corridors, this one's a much closer trek.
2421920	2423880	Julius is walking very stiffly,
2423880	2426160	like one side of his body at a time
2426160	2431160	because he's got the shovel stuck up his pants and shirt.
2431200	2433840	Julius, have you thought about like what you're gonna,
2433840	2435800	you know, say?
2435800	2439360	Well, I brought this and he like points at the imprint
2439360	2442120	of a shovel in his clothes.
2442120	2443120	Yeah, I was wondering why.
2443120	2443960	Yeah, well.
2443960	2445000	You didn't want to kill your dad.
2445000	2447600	No, he's a smart guy and I think
2447920	2450880	if I give him a tool, he'll figure out what to do.
2450880	2451720	Oh, he could dig out.
2451720	2452560	You're not gonna beat him to death with no.
2452560	2453720	No, I'm trying to get him out of here.
2453720	2454640	Gotcha.
2454640	2456800	Anyway, I'm gonna say hi,
2456800	2459680	tell him what I've been up to since I saw him last
2459680	2464680	and then tell him I might not ever see you again.
2464960	2467640	I give him the shovel and say, you can get out of here
2467640	2470480	but you gotta tell us about the rat man first.
2470480	2472000	That's right, thank you.
2472000	2473200	Do you mind if I film?
2473200	2474600	100% go for it.
2474600	2476160	He loves cameras.
2476200	2478480	Before I even met him, I knew he loved camera and shit.
2478480	2480240	I actually wanted to talk to you about that.
2480240	2481080	Do you think?
2481080	2481920	I don't know.
2481920	2484160	It just seems like he has an eye for photojournalism.
2484160	2486760	I mean, if we can find a way to get him out of here,
2486760	2488360	I guarantee it.
2488360	2491600	He'd be the second best camera man Ken's ever seen.
2491600	2493140	Close one.
2493140	2495520	But I mean, we gotta get him out of here first.
2495520	2496880	I don't even know if we can.
2496880	2499520	And here is the room that you're now in,
2499520	2501400	this private room.
2501400	2503320	There is a...
2503320	2504400	Shrimp cocktail.
2507160	2508480	One of those city things.
2508480	2509720	It says out of order.
2509720	2511560	Cow's nibbling on it.
2511560	2512400	Wait, what?
2512400	2514360	It says out of order on the shrimp cocktail?
2514360	2515200	Right, it's like the arcade.
2515200	2517100	It's a joke, it's a joke.
2517100	2519800	It's like they have nice things but they can't use them.
2521640	2522480	Cow's eating it.
2522480	2523520	Also, it's broken.
2523520	2525200	Yeah, it's rotten.
2526800	2527640	It's not.
2527640	2529040	It says out of order but this is really good.
2529040	2530660	Roll a constitution.
2533240	2534280	A 60 and a 60.
2534320	2535160	Wow.
2536600	2538220	Cow like stops for a second.
2540880	2541720	It's good.
2543920	2546440	The camera Fast and Furious style,
2546440	2550000	like through Cow's body as if it's the inside
2550000	2551280	of a car engine.
2551280	2553920	We see different pistons firing
2553920	2557480	and the nitrous is about to take off
2557480	2562480	and explode into a blue and orange flame of ignition.
2563240	2567080	And then we see that the stomach acids come in
2567080	2571440	and put out the flames of this intense reaction
2571440	2573840	that was about to happen inside of Cow's body.
2573840	2575680	And there's like a little beach with umbrellas
2575680	2577720	and the shrimp are like partying on it.
2579900	2583280	But two of them are swimming
2583280	2585840	without any sort of flotation device,
2585840	2590360	which in the lifeguard's opinion is totally out of order.
2590360	2592400	They're shrimp, they're from the water.
2593240	2594400	The lifeguard would live in his stomach
2594400	2596400	and so therefore it would want the shrimp
2596400	2598120	to drown in his stomach.
2598120	2598960	None of this matters.
2598960	2602240	They got drowned by the stomach acid and dissolved.
2602240	2604080	Cow yells to the voices in his head.
2605860	2606700	What?
2606700	2607520	What?
2607520	2608360	No, I said that.
2608360	2609180	You shouldn't eat those.
2609180	2610020	Probably not.
2610020	2610860	I think it's giving me weird ideas.
2610860	2615240	The door opens and a tall stringy man walks in
2615240	2620240	with stringy hair and he has handcuffs on
2620760	2623680	and I mean immediately the CEO is like.
2623680	2625200	No touching. No touching, yeah.
2625200	2627940	He's like, do this like hugs for a little bit
2627940	2628880	and then backs off.
2628880	2631840	Hey, let me just hook him up real quick to the table
2631840	2635640	and you see that he's gonna lock him in his handcuffs
2635640	2640280	to a spot on the table and Burl Summers sits down.
2640280	2645280	He's got stringy hair and you see three long singular
2646280	2650480	strands of hair coming down from his chin.
2650480	2653440	Oh, look, it's even better than the last time I saw ya.
2653440	2656720	It's way longer and it's only been like a month.
2656720	2658480	Thank you, Julius.
2658480	2659800	Are you doing okay in here?
2659800	2660640	Doing all right.
2660640	2662200	I didn't expect to see you.
2662200	2664860	Well, I didn't expect to see you either really
2664860	2668800	but since I've seen ya, I got reassigned
2668800	2672660	and I'm on the news now or I work with the news
2672700	2677580	and we're investigating some pretty mild shit for you
2677580	2679540	but it's pretty wild to me.
2679540	2680400	Reassigned?
2680400	2683380	Yeah, I'm with Diggory now.
2683380	2684380	Agent Diggory?
2684380	2686780	This is like my first thing.
2686780	2688340	They didn't give me a break at all.
2688340	2692260	Have you followed up with anybody else?
2692260	2694260	I think I'm the only one that got out.
2695980	2699400	Is Diggory keeping the path?
2699400	2700980	For now.
2700980	2705980	And both of you make eyes a little narrowed
2706220	2708480	at each other like Luke and I just did.
2710740	2715740	But, I mean, if I'm honest, I'm kind of with these guys now.
2715820	2718260	Beck waves from behind the camera.
2718260	2720180	Cal Colorado sticks a microphone in his face
2720180	2722820	and he's like, Cal Colorado, City Action News.
2722820	2724220	How do you like jail?
2724220	2726820	It's not the best or worst place I've ever been.
2726820	2727960	Remember the fog?
2728200	2732880	Yeah, this is way better.
2732880	2736720	Your son has an emotional goodbye to say to you.
2736720	2739020	I mean, I guess we better make it quick.
2740440	2744680	Officer, and he just like holds up his press pass.
2744680	2746160	Could you give us a minute?
2746160	2748520	Rolled bureaucracy or law?
2749680	2751760	That's a 57 on a 60.
2754440	2755800	Which one do you have 60 in?
2755800	2756640	Bureaucracy.
2756640	2757920	Nice.
2757920	2760480	For being in the firm for you so, you know.
2762600	2763720	Why would I do that?
2763720	2766740	Cal, tell him.
2766740	2767880	The news?
2767880	2770160	And Beck is holding up his press pass as well.
2770160	2771600	Yeah, so is Cal.
2771600	2774960	The CEO just kind of has this look
2774960	2777480	of befuddlement on his face.
2777480	2778480	So does Cal.
2778480	2783480	But with, you know, three confident Stevie holds up
2784440	2788080	their pass behind you, four confident adults,
2788080	2790200	telling them how things work.
2790200	2792800	He's like, I need to read the fucking rules again.
2793960	2796920	Oh, oh, oh, oh, and Stevie's his lawyer.
2796920	2797760	Nice.
2797760	2798600	That'll do it.
2798600	2801320	And he nods his head, dips out of the room.
2801320	2802160	Cal, that was great.
2802160	2804400	I just wanted you to say the news.
2804400	2806200	But that last thing was even better.
2808440	2809400	Give him the shovel quick.
2809400	2810640	I don't think this will work long.
2810640	2813240	Here, I got a shovel in case you want to like dig yourself
2813840	2814680	out or something.
2814680	2815520	I don't know.
2815520	2816340	And then here's a gun.
2816340	2817400	You can have that too.
2817400	2820280	And then, so basically we found.
2820280	2821120	Keep one of the guns for us.
2821120	2821960	Oh yeah, I got two.
2821960	2823360	I'm keeping one, sorry.
2823360	2827760	We found out Godel company is really bad.
2827760	2829600	Like our level bad.
2829600	2831200	Like really bad, dude.
2831200	2834560	Like maybe shit we haven't ever seen before bad.
2834560	2836720	Except maybe shit you've seen before maybe.
2836720	2839400	Yeah, but like this is crazier in a different way
2839400	2841240	instead of like, you got to kill it.
2841240	2844400	This is a, you know, big thing.
2844400	2845680	It's true, sir.
2845680	2846520	They're bad.
2846520	2849480	Okay, well, if it goes all the way to the top.
2849480	2850300	All the way.
2850300	2851400	Well, you got to get me out of here.
2851400	2853720	Can you do anything about these handcuffs?
2853720	2856220	Julius like looks over where the officer went.
2856220	2858600	And if he's not looking, he just takes a shovel
2858600	2860480	and slams it onto the chains.
2860480	2862740	Julius, when you grab this shovel and slam it
2862740	2867000	just a single time on the chain of this restraint,
2867000	2870800	sparks fly off either side.
2870800	2873720	And suddenly Burl Sommers is loosed.
2873720	2876120	He grabs the gun on the table and immediately.
2876120	2877280	Beck holds up his hands.
2878280	2879500	Cal catches the camera.
2880560	2882840	He drops the clip out the bottom of it,
2882840	2885740	flicks one of the bullets up in the air off it,
2885740	2888240	grabs it, slams in the bottom of the clip
2888240	2890720	and then slams the clip back in the bottom of the gun
2890720	2893400	and Beck I got that.
2893400	2894240	Julius looks.
2894240	2895080	That was so cool.
2895080	2896160	Julius looks at the restraint.
2896160	2898240	He thought this was going to be multiple batches
2898240	2900580	to even possibly work.
2900580	2903520	And he looks down at the concrete
2903520	2906640	and looks at Cal and Beck and looks at his dad
2906640	2910100	and just shoves the shovel down into the ground.
2910100	2912260	When you shovel the shovel,
2915300	2917920	when you shove the shovel into the ground,
2917920	2922160	it moves through the sealed concrete
2922160	2924960	like the most fertile land
2924960	2927920	and you just shovel out part of the flooring.
2927920	2929840	Holy shit.
2929840	2931020	Everybody roll grip.
2933720	2935560	55, critical failure.
2937160	2942160	96, which I think is real bad.
2942160	2944240	50, but a fail.
2944240	2945680	So did you both crit fail?
2945680	2946720	I crit fail you.
2946720	2948440	Is a 96 a crit fail?
2949480	2951800	Oh yeah, holy shit.
2955920	2958160	I mean, this isn't the wildest thing
2958160	2959880	after having seen what you've seen,
2959880	2960720	heard what you've heard.
2960720	2962160	It's also a shovel digging.
2962160	2963200	It is a shovel digging,
2963200	2966760	but it is a shovel digging at a wild.
2966760	2969120	Through concrete like sand.
2969120	2969960	Yeah.
2969960	2972720	So Beck is going to lose one grip.
2972720	2976160	Julius and Cal, you're both going to lose two grip.
2976160	2979480	Julius pulls the shovel up and kind of like fake lunges
2979480	2983240	at Beck and laughs and then starts digging again.
2984960	2989120	Julius, my dude, that wasn't cool.
2989120	2990200	It was a joke.
2992040	2993240	All right, you got me.
2994160	2998160	Julius, everyone is laughing after a joke.
3001760	3003560	Julius looks at his dad,
3003560	3005800	like, what did he think of that?
3006840	3009320	Your dad is not in the room.
3009320	3012440	The door is open and you see a slumped body
3012440	3015800	of the CEO in the doorway.
3015800	3018520	What is, what the hell is wrong with us?
3020800	3023520	Are you fucking, I mean, yeah, come on.
3023520	3027280	Okay, Julius offers a gun to Beck
3027280	3028960	or offers him the shovel.
3028960	3030680	Oh, I'll take the shovel, dude.
3030680	3033600	Julius has the gun and is going to run after his dad.
3033600	3034680	Whoa.
3034680	3037760	Okay, Cal's going to motion for Beck to stay back a second.
3037760	3039400	All right, Luke, leave the room.
3039880	3043200	Oh my God, what the fuck.
3043200	3046080	Beck is holding the shovel like American Gothic
3046080	3048520	and the camera's under, cradling under an arm.
3048520	3049560	What the fuck, dude?
3049560	3051200	Are we accessories to this?
3051200	3052800	All right, that's all on them, right?
3052800	3055000	We didn't, did we abet this?
3055000	3057080	No, and it's, no, I mean.
3057080	3058560	We're just documenting the news.
3058560	3060560	We just filmed what happened.
3060560	3061880	We didn't happen it.
3061880	3064960	We're bringing a human experience, a jailbreak,
3064960	3068320	to, oh God, he gave him the gun.
3068320	3071040	He gave him the gun back, then he killed that guy.
3071040	3074880	Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus.
3074880	3077480	And Beck wants to throw the shovel to the ground.
3077480	3079920	Does it do anything when he hits the ground?
3079920	3080760	It burrows.
3080760	3083720	Keeps burrowing, zooms out the other side of the earth.
3083720	3085680	It doesn't keep burrowing, but it does just like,
3085680	3087960	if you throw it into the ground, it's like.
3087960	3090480	It sticks like a knife in the table.
3090480	3092960	Exactly, like both of those things.
3092960	3095320	Oh, what happened to the shovel?
3095320	3096560	I mean, this is a whole fucking new thing.
3096560	3097840	We didn't even have time to address it.
3098400	3099240	The shovel's a fucking magic shovel.
3099240	3101120	He always had this fucking shovel, you know.
3101120	3102360	Like, I've seen the shovel.
3102360	3103760	It didn't used to do this.
3103760	3106720	Oh shit, I don't fucking.
3106720	3107760	Wait, is that true?
3107760	3110000	I ad-libbed that, but does that need to not be true?
3110000	3110840	No, it's fine.
3110840	3112520	I mean, even if it did do that,
3112520	3114600	maybe he didn't show you that it did that.
3114600	3117360	I'm imagining him like banging his shovel
3117360	3120920	on shit at dinner parties, like New Year's Eve.
3122200	3125000	Oh, well, I mean, yeah, he could turn it on and off.
3125000	3130000	Okay, I'm gonna get in front of the camera
3131760	3135040	and I'm gonna state that we don't condone these actions,
3135040	3138240	but we're here to document this unique.
3138240	3140480	We're silent observers and we cannot interfere.
3140480	3141320	Exactly.
3141320	3143280	I'd pull up the camera and get it on you
3143280	3145120	and the shovel is laying on the ground
3145120	3146840	in the background of the shot.
3146840	3148080	This is Cal, Colorado.
3148080	3150320	Explosive development here at the city jail.
3150320	3155320	Our, a can, oh, how do I say this?
3155320	3156680	Stevie, you're the lawyer.
3158680	3161680	Stevie rolls their eyes bigger than eyes have been rolled.
3163360	3164200	How do I phrase this thing?
3164200	3166760	But you can't see because the hair is covering it.
3169160	3172160	We've just witnessed something extraordinary here.
3173440	3175480	Something, something possibly,
3175480	3177840	oh God, I can't call it extraordinary.
3177840	3182840	It could be like extraordinarily a thing that happened.
3183320	3185320	Yeah, like a miracle.
3185320	3187160	No, that's, that's what we don't want to apply.
3187160	3188160	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3188160	3190680	Don't want to give it a good connotation exactly.
3190680	3194800	He's, cause that, Stevie, could you go check on that guard?
3203280	3205960	Stevie's just making these noises as they go over.
3206920	3209520	Slowly check on the guard.
3209520	3211160	First they, they did a check.
3211160	3216160	They were not sure whether the body was breathing
3216280	3219560	and then they did successfully do first aid on it.
3219560	3223760	So if, if, if they're alive, they're stable.
3223760	3224600	Oh, thank God.
3224600	3227240	Okay, so he didn't kill anybody.
3227240	3228080	Yeah.
3228080	3228900	We would have heard the gunshot.
3228900	3231400	Maybe, well yeah, they didn't get shot.
3231400	3232840	He hasn't killed anybody yet.
3232840	3235400	Okay, this is Cal, Colorado.
3235400	3238760	Full disclosure, a CAN associate who will at this time
3238760	3241200	remain anonymous has, has gone rogue
3241200	3242640	in the middle of an assignment
3242640	3244720	and broken their father out of jail
3244720	3248260	or is actively attempting to flee prison jail
3248260	3249580	with their father.
3249580	3251360	We don't condone these actions,
3251360	3255380	but we will document them for you, the people of the city.
3255380	3256320	Let's go back.
3256320	3259000	Camera goes down and Beck wants to go back
3259000	3261280	and carefully pick up the shovel.
3261280	3263040	I think, I don't think we should leave this behind.
3263040	3264880	No, we, that's, we need the shovel, yeah.
3265280	3266120	I'll take it.
3266120	3266940	Sure.
3266940	3267780	Okay.
3267780	3268600	That's kind of your thing, you carry things.
3268600	3269440	Yeah.
3269440	3274200	And with everything else, Stevie pack mules the shovel
3274200	3278040	under an arm, you know, with plenty of bag, a toe.
3278040	3279720	Careful with the end of that thing, man.
3279720	3281440	I don't really understand, like.
3281440	3285360	And as you say that, there's a glint on the end
3285360	3288320	of the shovel that you've seen a few times at this point.
3288320	3290020	Stevie, be careful with that end.
3290020	3291640	Well, yeah, obviously.
3292200	3294840	And they turn it like sticks into a wall.
3295720	3298920	No, it's not that, I mean, you threw it, you know,
3298920	3301200	with a little bit of force in the ground earlier.
3301200	3302020	That's why it stuck.
3302020	3303700	But you've like carried it around.
3303700	3305180	You've set it down on stuff.
3305180	3306720	You do think back to all the times.
3306720	3307880	Beck, you juggled it.
3309180	3310020	You almost.
3310020	3311000	I balanced it on the end of my nose.
3311000	3312480	With the back of the stuff.
3312480	3313320	No.
3320560	3324560	Is this all gonna be part of the story?
3324560	3326400	That's the great thing about journalism, Stevie.
3326400	3327240	Editing.
3330000	3330840	Yeah.
3330840	3334000	Well, editing and we don't know what the story is yet.
3334000	3334920	It's still happening.
3334920	3337200	Choosing what the story is after the fact.
3337200	3338240	I mean, sorta, yeah.
3338240	3339600	Like this could be a hero moment
3339600	3341240	if it all shakes out the way we want it to.
3341240	3342080	Sure.
3342080	3342900	Do you wanna do another take?
3342900	3345480	Like maybe Julius is the hero?
3345480	3347640	If that's like maybe a possibility.
3351920	3354120	I don't expect that would be a possibility.
3356840	3359840	Didn't he say a second ago that like the Godels were bad
3359840	3362160	and then he looked at his dad and he said,
3362160	3365560	like just as bad as the stuff we used to do.
3365560	3367520	Did he say that?
3367520	3368800	No, no, I thought he meant like.
3368800	3370400	I took that into meaning like the stuff
3370400	3371440	that they investigated.
3371440	3372560	Yes, exactly.
3372560	3376880	Meeting the criteria for their organization addressing it.
3376880	3377920	Remember their X-Files.
3377920	3378760	Yeah, that's right.
3378760	3379740	That's a much better read.
3379740	3380580	I like that.
3380580	3381680	I'll go with that.
3381680	3383000	Okay, let's get out of here.
3383000	3384040	Yeah, let's go.
3384040	3388880	I guess we just follow the trail of bodies.
3388880	3391880	Well, we've only found, we just have a body so far.
3391880	3393080	No, yeah, for sure.
3393080	3394000	There's just one body.
3394000	3394840	I'm just worried there's gonna be more.
3394840	3396240	And he's stable.
3396240	3397080	He's stable.
3397080	3398160	No, for sure.
3398160	3400040	And we could even call an ambulance for him
3400560	3401400	once we get out of here.
3401400	3402400	Well, we can, we should call an ambulance.
3402400	3404280	Stevie, call an ambulance for him right now.
3404280	3408480	I wanna say that like alarms start going off,
3408480	3410480	but I don't know that's true.
3411920	3414080	Right, maybe they've killed everyone in the prison
3414080	3416680	by the time they're killed.
3416680	3419940	Or maybe they just patiently waited around the corner.
3419940	3420780	What?
3420780	3421600	They're just sitting there.
3421600	3422440	They're just sitting there.
3422440	3423280	They're taking him so long.
3423280	3424100	They're listening to us.
3424100	3428520	They're like giggling to each other about it.
3430040	3434960	Okay, you want us to get Luke?
3434960	3435800	Yeah.
3435800	3437160	All right.
3437160	3438560	But we are, we are leaving.
3438560	3440720	We are following where they were going.
3440720	3441560	Yeah.
3441560	3442400	Yeah, yeah, cool.
3442400	3443560	You guys leave the room.
3445200	3446840	Now leave the room.
3446840	3447920	This is LARPing.
3448840	3450840	Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak.
3450840	3454080	I didn't know that there was gonna be a jailbreak.
3458080	3458920	So.
3458920	3463920	So Luke, this is fucking awesome and wild.
3463920	3465300	Julius runs out of the room.
3465300	3466140	You run out of the room.
3466140	3468480	You run past this body and you see.
3468480	3470800	Is the body shot or?
3470800	3471640	Not shot.
3471640	3472480	You didn't hear it.
3472480	3473320	Incapacitated.
3473320	3474520	Currently incapacitated on the ground.
3474520	3476140	Julius thinks about how cool that is
3476140	3478120	and tries to really think about the training
3478120	3479040	his dad gave him.
3481520	3485320	And you see that dad,
3485320	3488420	Pearl Summers, stringy man,
3488420	3491520	stringy hair blowing behind him
3491520	3495640	as he is dipping down this hallway.
3495640	3497760	Makes it almost to a door
3497760	3502160	and then you see him crouch down at the last second.
3502160	3506860	The door opens and he flings his stringy body
3506860	3508760	up into the air,
3508760	3513760	wraps one of his legs around the security officer's neck
3514720	3519080	and then spins this officer down to the ground.
3519080	3520920	The officer is not moving
3520920	3525140	and Pearl looks back down the hallway and sees you
3525140	3528520	and turns and runs through the open door.
3528520	3531680	Julius does like a little jump kick like kick ass
3531680	3535020	and then runs to try to catch up with his dad.
3535020	3537860	Just vaults the dead body.
3537860	3538960	Roll athletics.
3539840	3541240	Your dad succeeds.
3541240	3543060	I succeed 20 on a 70.
3543060	3545360	You're both hoofing it, hoofing it.
3545360	3546200	Is this the way out?
3546200	3547220	Do you know how to get out of here?
3547220	3548580	Yeah, I've been planning this.
3548580	3549400	Let's go.
3549400	3550240	Fuck yes.
3550240	3551260	Wait, pause.
3551260	3553860	He holds you back against a corner
3554860	3559860	and you see officers walk just around the opposite corner
3562200	3564340	and then away from you down the hallway
3564340	3566860	and then they turn right and go out a door.
3566860	3569900	They were five feet away from you.
3569900	3572380	You see that happening in your brain
3572380	3575540	as you hear these officers approaching
3575540	3577600	but you're gonna have to pass a stealth roll
3577600	3579380	in order to make it a reality.
3581700	3583340	34 on a 40.
3583340	3584180	Woo!
3589900	3590860	You still got it.
3590860	3591960	That was incredible.
3591960	3592800	Which way do we go?
3592800	3593620	Where's the shovel?
3593620	3594540	I gave it to Beck.
3595480	3597000	And he looks behind him like,
3597000	3598860	I thought they were gonna be right behind me.
3598860	3602380	Hey, how would your dad react in this moment?
3602380	3605220	I'm trying to build your dad's sort of-
3605220	3607420	To us escaping?
3607420	3611140	To you not bringing the shovel mid-escape.
3611140	3614080	If he was planning on using it, he's probably not stoked.
3617820	3621300	You see the pain in his eyes and he goes, that's okay.
3621300	3622380	Yeah, no, that's okay.
3622380	3623600	Did we need it?
3623600	3624440	I figured you were-
3624440	3625260	No, it'll be fine.
3625260	3626100	It'll be fine.
3626100	3627260	We can go back and get it.
3627260	3628100	Nope.
3628220	3629140	Probably fine.
3629140	3630460	I mean, whatever you think is best,
3630460	3632540	we've just got to get you out of here.
3632540	3633380	Okay.
3633380	3634220	Alive.
3634220	3637120	I mean, I planned this whole thing without it, so go.
3637120	3638940	And then he dips around the corner.
3638940	3640740	Julius falls right after him.
3640740	3643180	You make it to another hallway
3643180	3646160	where there's an intersection of hallways.
3646160	3648380	An intersection of hallways.
3648380	3651140	People could be coming from either side.
3651140	3652620	Do you know how to get out of here?
3652620	3653460	Yeah.
3653460	3655460	And he points to the left.
3655460	3659140	Is the left even close to semi the direction
3659140	3661280	that Julius thinks he came in from?
3663940	3665240	Roll intelligence.
3668300	3669300	Crit pass.
3669300	3670120	Yeah.
3670120	3670960	That's definitely the way you can-
3670960	3673260	Okay, if you trust him, hundo P.
3673260	3674420	He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's this way,
3674420	3675740	but we have to wait here.
3675740	3677620	He starts counting.
3677620	3680500	One, two, three, four-
3680500	3683460	Julius holds up his watch in front of his dad.
3683460	3684500	Nice.
3684500	3689500	Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-
3694660	3697300	Julius is wondering if he's going to count to 836.
3701740	3706740	When it gets to 400, you continue that thought.
3707580	3712180	When it gets to 800, you're like, oh shit.
3712180	3713780	Is this really happening?
3714700	3719700	829, 830, 831, 832, 833, 834, 835, 836.
3724060	3725820	And he grabs you.
3725820	3726660	What does it mean?
3726660	3730340	And starts dipping down the hallway and runs.
3730340	3731180	Roll grip.
3733420	3734260	Crit fail.
3736460	3738460	What does it mean?
3738460	3740220	Shut the fuck up.
3740220	3743100	And immediately alarms go off.
3743140	3743980	Fuck.
3746300	3750180	You see doors in the corridor on either side of you
3750180	3752500	with windows that are interior
3752500	3754300	and all their blinds were drawn.
3754300	3758260	And when you scream blinds on either side of you,
3758260	3760460	just open.
3760460	3762660	I'm going to cut back to them.
3762660	3763500	Okay.
3766500	3768500	Smells like weed in here.
3771140	3772740	The alarms start going off.
3772740	3773580	We were right.
3776420	3777380	Okay. Yeah.
3777380	3778580	Probably bodies then.
3778580	3779500	Okay. Fuck.
3779500	3781500	We got to get out of here.
3781500	3782820	We can't be here.
3782820	3785220	We didn't even fucking ask him about the rat men.
3785220	3786060	Fuck.
3789380	3790220	Let's go.
3790220	3791140	Yeah, let's go.
3791140	3793100	I guess we'll follow their trail
3793100	3795060	unless we see an obvious way out.
3795060	3797460	This is from the camera's point of view,
3797460	3799580	like the horror movie running.
3799580	3800660	Oh wait, shouldn't we just-
3800660	3801820	Oh, do you want to go back the other way?
3801820	3804260	Yeah, why don't we just go out the front door?
3806660	3807500	Yeah, we could do that.
3807500	3808780	I mean, yeah.
3808780	3810980	We'd learn less, but it's a lot safer.
3810980	3815220	It's also the way that there might be people to stop us,
3815220	3817220	whereas they might've cleared the way ahead of them.
3817220	3818300	That's also true.
3818300	3820660	They might not just believe that we're not with them.
3820660	3821580	We could also be-
3821580	3823780	Because we are with them.
3823780	3825500	But we could also be like not with them
3825500	3826660	and be like, help, help.
3826660	3828340	Something crazy's happening down the hall.
3828340	3829540	Do you think they're going to believe that
3829540	3831780	from Cal, Colorado?
3831780	3833740	Yeah, maybe, maybe.
3835020	3836140	Can you sell it?
3837540	3838380	You're right, dammit.
3838380	3839220	I could sell it.
3840860	3842100	That's right, Cal.
3842100	3843340	You could sell anything.
3843340	3845540	Okay, what do we think?
3845540	3847340	That's right, you could sell anything.
3847340	3848860	Julius, or?
3848860	3849700	What?
3849700	3852060	Oh, that was a lazy shoe horn.
3854940	3856820	This is a panic moment, Zach.
3856820	3858180	That's right, shit, what?
3858180	3859580	I was not selling you anything
3859580	3861540	when I told you to believe in yourself, Stevie.
3862180	3863020	That's nice.
3864260	3866900	Now, which way do we go, dammit?
3868500	3870340	When you walk out of this room,
3870340	3872740	you see the green tape on the ground
3872740	3876620	that leads past the body that is slumped over
3876620	3878740	just outside of this room.
3878740	3881180	Do either one of you have a very high first aid?
3881180	3883900	No, just the 10 baseline.
3883900	3885500	Okay, not a clue.
3885500	3890100	And then when you look down the end of this corridor,
3890140	3893860	you see that there is another body slumped by that door,
3893860	3898100	and it is face down and its head is to one side.
3898100	3900540	Oh, it doesn't hit to one side like broken neck
3900540	3901380	or just like laying on it?
3901380	3903660	It could be laying on its stomach
3903660	3905220	with its head to one side,
3905220	3907740	could be broken neck with its head like that.
3907740	3909300	Not sure from here.
3909300	3911380	Pretty far down there, maybe 20 yards.
3911380	3912460	But you do know you need to walk
3912460	3914220	at least like halfway down this hallway
3914220	3917420	and then go left before you get all the way down
3917420	3920580	to that next door to go back the way you came at least.
3920580	3922940	I mean, you know, it's not a bad idea
3922940	3925500	to link up with like the two guys
3925500	3927380	who know how to deal with crazy shit.
3927380	3931300	We gotta go most of the way towards where they're going.
3931300	3932500	Yeah, let's get to the juncture and-
3932500	3933580	Let's get to the juncture and then we'll-
3933580	3935260	Junction and figure it out there.
3935260	3937020	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3937020	3938340	Okay, guys, come on.
3938340	3939180	To the junction.
3940260	3942500	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
3942500	3944140	Signs are still going off
3944140	3948180	and you see there are alarms on the walls
3948180	3951900	every 10 feet or so with lights that are just blinking
3951900	3954820	and in the distance you do hear
3954820	3958500	the kind of movement of officers
3958500	3962140	and as you make it down to the end of this corridor
3962140	3964540	you see the body on the ground.
3964540	3967380	If you don't want anyone to roll first aid
3967380	3969460	as you walk by, go for it.
3969460	3971340	Wait, Stevie, you were pretty good at this.
3971340	3972180	Yeah.
3972180	3973060	Why don't you take a look at them?
3973060	3974700	They're dead.
3974700	3977100	Oh, I rolled a 10 on a 10.
3977100	3977940	Oh, shit.
3980940	3982100	What do you think, Beck?
3982100	3983300	Hey, they're dead.
3985380	3986900	It's not good, my dude.
3986900	3988020	It's really not good.
3988020	3989660	That's two deads then.
3989660	3991180	Yeah, at least one dead for sure,
3991180	3993500	but yeah, probably two maybe.
3993500	3997300	I mean, maybe a criminal did it, a different one.
3997300	3998140	Right.
3998140	3999380	Yeah, yeah.
3999380	4000860	Have we heard any gunshots?
4000860	4001700	No.
4001700	4002520	With that first aid roll,
4002840	4003680	how did this guy die?
4003680	4005440	Did he get knocked in the head or?
4005440	4006480	His neck was snapped.
4006480	4007320	Gotcha.
4007320	4008920	Yeah, you were right about the neck snap thing.
4008920	4010120	That's an awful way to go.
4010120	4010960	Is it?
4010960	4011800	I mean, it might be quick.
4011800	4013520	I don't really know.
4013520	4015280	Maybe we should take his clothes?
4015280	4017860	That's the end of the episode.
4045280	4050280	You can't just give your pocket pickles to any-
4052480	4054720	Yeah, I would never give this man my pocket pickles.
4054720	4056640	Random stew on the street.
4056640	4058360	I'm saving those for my daughter.
4060120	4061600	Hi ho, silver away.
4061600	4063680	Everyone loves daddy's pocket pickles.
4063680	4064520	Oh, okay.
4067840	4068680	Everyone feel good?
4068680	4070160	That one made me feel real good.
4070160	4071240	Not since childhood.
4075280	4078120	And it's all my fault.
