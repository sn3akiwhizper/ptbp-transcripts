1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Introductions and greetings, my little furballs.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,520
It's your best friend and worst enemy, Wolf the Dog,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,840
here to gas you up, then make targeted insults that make you wonder if we were ever friends in the first place.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,400
Nah, I'm just kidding.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,120
Or am I?

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:26,720
I am the DJ of the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,440
I only demand one thing from you, my loyal, royal listeners.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,320
Your unending love and admiration at all times, regardless of convenience.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,800
Speaking of, this howlin' with Wolf is from Spencer Furnace in Akron, Ohio.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,040
Wow, I hope the trip from Akron was worth it.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,640
Spencer tagged at Pretending Pod on the internet, and for that I am eternally grateful.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:03,480
Not eternally, just feelin' that gratitude ticklin' my intestinals for a finite period of time.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
Spencer Furnace, right?

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,480
Well, hey there, Sir Wolf. Fancy seein' you round these parts.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,280
I'd love to give a shout-out with all of my love to Tom and Steph, Joe and Rachel,

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,760
for givin' me a place to stay and a positive perspective to get through some of the hardest times.

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,400
And the boys at PTBP for givin' me an auditory hug

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,080
when I needed the sound of people who care for each other and my ear holes.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,120
I'll leave y'all with a joke.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,520
What do you call a hundred million year old pig?

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,120
Jurassic pork, baby, get you some.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,960
Thank y'all for all you do.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Damn, I do love a good joke, Spencer from Ohio.

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,240
I'd love to hear one sometime.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,680
See, two of us can do jokes, Spencer from Ohio.

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,800
But thanks for writin' in and sayin' those nice things about the show.

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,960
If you wanna write up somethin' for your fur-zaddy wolf to howl, tag us on the internet.

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,360
Yeah, yeah, we're still on the internet.

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,240
I know, I heard they're makin' everyone still on the internet.

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,600
Go to a classic Catholic confessional booth

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,360
and rattle off the sins to a lifelike blow-up doll

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,200
that kinda looks like Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,800
But not enough that it was actually modeled after him.

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,040
What was I sayin'?

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,640
The links are in the show notes.

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,400
Oh shit, another word for what's next is succession.

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
And I just realized that's the same guy.

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,240
Whoa, speaking of, it is time for the news.

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,800
Last time here at 694.2 PTBP,

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,920
the Cannes crew finished up the tense exchange with Ruth,

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,120
who is deathly thin, smokin' meth, doin' Adderall,

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,160
and looks every bit the part.

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,280
Julie has fed her another pill

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,680
with a thick GPS tracking device attached,

45
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,160
which is just awful.

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,160
And then, on the way to the city jail,

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,680
the city action news team learned a wild amount

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,760
about Julius's father,

49
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,040
takin' us now to the concrete steps of the city jail,

50
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,240
where Beck is filmin' Cal,

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,560
takin' concrete steps to get to the top.

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,320
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great

53
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,120
and It's All My Fault.

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,200
And it's all my fault

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,120
Cause my life is great

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
And it's all mine

57
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,480
Cause my life is great

58
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
And it's all my fault

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,280
We went around the neighborhood when I was in, like, fourth grade.

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,680
My brother was in, like, eighth grade with a video camera

61
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,680
and asked people to, like, for interviews for a school project,

62
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,000
and then we would just ask them random questions.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,720
But the first question that we asked this one guy

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,160
was his thoughts on capital punishment.

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,760
And he talked to us about his views on capital punishment

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,040
for, like, 15 minutes, probably,

67
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,280
and we recorded the whole thing and then left,

68
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,720
and we're just like, I guess that was a prank.

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,040
Yeah, you thought you were fuckin' esoteric,

70
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,600
Longmont Potion Castle?

71
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,400
Find the humor in this, bitch.

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,760
We conducted interviews.

73
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,360
No, the whole time you were tellin' that story,

74
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,880
I couldn't stop thinking of burp.

75
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,000
Dude, at work the other day, I was, like, doing something with my boss,

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,200
and he's like, hold on, I'm getting a phone call.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,480
And he, like, answers it. He's like, hello? What?

78
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,080
Uh, yes. Okay, bye.

79
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,160
And I was like, what was that?

80
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
And he's like, it was, like, a very young child asking me

81
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,400
if my refrigerator was running.

82
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,760
And I was like, did you know the number?

83
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,320
And he's like, I did not know the number.

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,440
He's like, I heard the mom in the background,

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,600
loud whispering, what to ask me.

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,680
Oh, wow.

87
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,800
Well, that's so weird.

88
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,480
It was, like, 1 p.m. on, like, a Tuesday.

89
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,920
I love the idea that the mom wanted to prank somebody,

90
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,840
but didn't have the balls to do it herself.

91
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,680
Isn't Maddie, like, nannying a kid or something?

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,200
Or is she just looking after a house?

93
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,080
Looking after a house.

94
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,040
Okay. Plants.

95
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,080
She got the house to call?

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,520
If it was, then yeah, the house called.

97
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
It was a haunted mansion.

98
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,320
My God.

99
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Okay, this is not much spoilers.

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,400
This is not spoilers for The Sopranos.

101
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,760
But, Luke, you know at the very end

102
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,880
when Tony and the other guy are really feuding

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,480
and they try to go to his house to talk to him

104
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,560
and he's just, like, yelling at them from.

105
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,400
Yes.

106
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Okay, so there's a joke on the subreddit

107
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,240
that he's just become a house.

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
And it's really fucking funny.

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,080
If you've seen The Sopranos, make sure to reach out and.

110
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,920
Are we recording?

111
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,760
Yeah.

112
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,160
That's good.

113
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,240
Let's get 30 seconds of silence.

114
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,960
Those bugs are loud as shit.

115
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah, we should actually, like,

116
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,040
maybe take a mic outside and get some of that.

117
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,120
Ooh, yeah.

118
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,360
Open the window up and get some background cicadas.

119
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,920
Get let some bugs in here.

120
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,800
They went in so bad.

121
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
Are those, like, a Midwestern thing

122
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
or are those everywhere?

123
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
They're everywhere.

124
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,120
I think they're Southern.

125
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,600
I don't know if they have them Northern.

126
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,880
I feel like there's some part of our country

127
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,720
that doesn't have them in there.

128
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Are you trying to say this is the South?

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,840
But I think a lot of the East Coast has them.

130
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,560
You know, they go in cycles.

131
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,680
But there's pretty much, like, always a cycle running.

132
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
Have you guys always called them cicadas?

133
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,520
Some people call them June bugs.

135
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
June bugs are different.

136
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,200
Those are different things.

137
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,520
Those are totally different things.

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,760
June bugs are, we got June bugs, buddy.

139
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
I thought people called the chirping cicadas

140
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
June bugs sometimes.

141
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,800
I've never heard that.

142
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
I haven't either.

143
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,320
But there is another name for cicadas.

144
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,640
Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong word.

145
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,600
This is a cicada.

146
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,920
Sleeping beauties.

147
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,200
Yeah, no, I know what a cicada is.

148
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,160
But a June bug is the brown one.

149
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,000
The green and brown thing.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,600
The brown beetles that just fly dumbly

151
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
into you. Just straight into you.

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,640
Yeah.

153
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,320
Starting around late May.

154
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,440
Really picking up in June.

155
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,800
A cicada and a locust are different things, right?

156
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,000
Locust is what I was thinking of.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,760
But yeah, I think they are slightly different.

158
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Well, locusts are like grasshopper kind of things.

159
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,680
Yeah, June bug is like, that's what I think of

160
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,840
when I think of a June bug.

161
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,280
No, that's like a scarab.

162
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Why is it so green?

163
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,280
They turn green.

164
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,760
They get like shiny.

165
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,120
They're like that and then they're green too.

166
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,000
You used to tie a little string around their leg

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
and let them fly around like a kite.

168
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
Katie did.

169
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,480
Katie did.

170
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
Katie did.

171
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,160
Katie did.

172
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,440
It does say that people do call cicadas locusts also.

173
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,240
Anyway, they're loud at night.

174
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,400
They're loud at night.

175
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,240
Tell you what.

176
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,080
Tell you what.

177
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,440
I went outside, I said, ooh, my ears are hurting.

178
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,480
Oh, I swear to God.

179
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,740
Oh my God, these bugs are gonna be the death of me.

180
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,580
The death of you?

181
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,320
The death of me.

182
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,160
Oh, okay.

183
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,000
They're so damn loud.

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,960
Katie did's are different.

185
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,560
Yeah, Katie did's are like grasshoppers.

186
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,400
Yeah.

187
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,240
Guys, bugs, you know.

188
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,080
Bush crickets.

189
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,720
Do they have bugs everywhere?

190
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,320
Do you guys, send in what bug you think of

191
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,120
when you think of where you live?

192
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
I would say cicadas.

193
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,060
I am sick of this.

194
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,160
We have plenty of role-playing to get into

195
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,800
and I refuse to not play this story for any longer.

196
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,040
Hell yeah, let's do it.

197
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
Okay.

198
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
Sorry to break it to you, Zach,

199
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
but we're on podcast strike.

200
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
Oh, no.

201
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
Actually, we don't write any of it,

202
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,520
so you should be on strike.

203
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,920
The writers, the directors, they folded.

204
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,680
The actors, we're the actors.

205
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,500
We're actors.

206
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,560
Well, I didn't write anything for this,

207
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,520
so we'll see what happens.

208
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,880
Yeah, but we're not gonna play it.

209
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,400
Give us something.

210
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,920
What do you want?

211
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Like, get us new La Croixs.

212
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,080
Rejected!

213
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,160
Oh, no, I can do that.

214
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
We got them, boys.

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
They folded so fast.

216
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,280
Did you guys hear that the warden threw a party

217
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,320
in the county jail?

218
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,600
Warden threw a party in the county jail.

219
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,920
And the prison's band was there and they began to wail.

220
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,560
Let's rock, guys.

221
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's jailhouse rock.

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
Yeah, let's jailhouse rock.

223
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,800
Let's dive in.

224
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
You guys are at the jail.

225
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,480
We see Cal Colorado on these big concrete steps,

226
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,120
hands out as if they're in cuffs,

227
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,120
and he is giving a hell of an intro to Beck Wilder

228
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,580
who is filming.

229
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,200
Standing behind, we have Julius Summers.

230
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,880
Some people call it a prison industrial complex.

231
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,680
Some people call it justice.

232
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,080
We're going behind bars tonight to find out the truth.

233
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Stevie walks up and is like,

234
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,920
wow, you really nailed it, and hands you a towel.

235
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,600
It is midday, probably afternoon at this point here,

236
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,480
on Thursday, July 7th, 2022.

237
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,980
Brought to you by Insert Sparkling Water.

238
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,440
Belvie.

239
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,760
Not unless they pay us.

240
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,200
Belvie.

241
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Oh, wow.

242
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,040
That's my favorite part of that.

243
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,000
They said it was painful at the end.

244
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,960
It wasn't, it felt good.

245
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,960
It felt good, it hurt real good.

246
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,300
What is the date?

247
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,400
I was waiting to open this until you stopped talking

248
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,760
and I didn't pay attention.

249
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,080
It's Thursday, July 7th.

250
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,000
It's mid-afternoon, which is when the sun is beating down

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,680
at its hottest stand.

252
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,680
The four of you are outside of the city jail.

253
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,320
Is it a jail or a prison?

254
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,680
It is a jail, it is the city jail.

255
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,680
It is where folks are kept for short stints

256
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,080
or just before their trial if they're not out on bond.

257
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,000
That reminds me, did we figure out definitively

258
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,880
if she is just awaiting trial or has she been sentenced?

259
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,440
That is correct, she is awaiting trial.

260
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,120
Well, let's go in.

261
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,560
What do we wanna ask her?

262
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,040
I figured we would just make it up as we went along.

263
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,480
I say we get a feel for her immediately,

264
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,920
see if she's lost it or if she's with us.

265
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,320
We wanna know more specifically about

266
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,320
like why her roommate tried to get inside her

267
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,040
because we think that might be connected.

268
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,100
And I think, you know, reviewing the footage,

269
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,800
maybe ask about the beer itself.

270
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
It seemed that she was the one making it

271
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,260
and that is what set her friend off.

272
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,100
Yeah.

273
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,820
Do we need a quick overview for the listeners?

274
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,340
I mean the viewers, the Kaylee situation.

275
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,420
Well, she was drinking a beer, talking to her friend

276
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,100
and then her friend attacked her and then she killed her.

277
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,660
Specifically saying things like, I gotta get inside you,

278
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,300
I'm gonna rip you apart, I want in.

279
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,260
Yeah, diving for her stomach.

280
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,140
And then she called City Action News

281
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,080
to get to the bottom of it.

282
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,420
She trusted you, Cal.

283
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,540
And here we are, we're here to help.

284
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,380
Let's go.

285
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,300
Okay, yeah, cause Dr. Murray said something about

286
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,020
people trying to get inside or even like

287
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,980
getting inside other people at the zeitgeist.

288
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,340
Right, it's all connected.

289
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,540
Okay, wow.

290
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,420
Potentially.

291
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,540
Haven't you been watching the news?

292
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,700
You walk into the city jail and it is a large

293
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,480
en, en, en, en, enchants, foyer?

294
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,020
There's a large foyer.

295
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,140
Wow, that's a great foyer in this jail.

296
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,460
Big columns, big concrete columns.

297
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,140
I like that you tried to French up entrance.

298
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,780
Cause we were just listening to that episode

299
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,700
where we talked about the city's cage inheritance.

300
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,140
Oh, and then you walk into the entrance.

301
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,980
Now what?

302
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,900
And yeah, it's like the,

303
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,180
I think it might've been a bank in the matrix

304
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,780
where there's a big shootout in,

305
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,220
big columns lining either side.

306
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,100
And then at the far end, away from you,

307
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,380
you see that there is a man in uniform.

308
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,540
Ooh, la la.

309
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,980
Zach, what do you think jail is?

310
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,040
What, so far?

311
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,580
So far it's pretty cool.

312
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,020
I know that the architecture should be sad and oppressive,

313
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,740
which is what I'm going for with the concrete

314
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,460
and the big blocks and-

315
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,100
We passed by the arcade, but it says closed.

316
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,900
So saddest thing I've ever seen.

317
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,460
Beck, get a shot of that.

318
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,300
Zoom in on the out of order sign on all the machines.

319
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,640
At the end of this foyer, there is a wall

320
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,660
and part of the wall is this thick glass

321
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,140
and behind is this man in uniform, ooh, la la.

322
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,020
And he just looks up at you, his face is like red.

323
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,340
We're here to see Kaylee Silver.

324
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,220
Beck just holds up his lanyard that has the press.

325
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,340
Yeah. Lanyard on it.

326
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,940
Oh yeah, you guys recalled earlier, yeah.

327
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,060
Oh yeah, I remember you.

328
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,340
Yeah, you see it's Officer Peeler.

329
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,340
Name's Stu, and you guys are coming in for a story or?

330
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,340
Could you just go get him, yeah.

331
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,180
Oh, I have to wait until it's rung in.

332
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,340
I figured we could just chat.

333
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,300
Zach is making a truly horrible face

334
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,740
to voice this character.

335
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,700
It's good, feels fine.

336
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,900
Yeah, we're just here to do a story.

337
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,220
We're doing some investigating.

338
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,260
Cool, I love the news.

339
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,060
You guys are, you guys do the truth,

340
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,900
telling the people what we've been up to.

341
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,740
It's like makes them know how real it really is, you know?

342
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,980
Do you have any bad stories about this place?

343
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,460
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

344
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,300
Like what?

345
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,260
I ordered a sandwich from lunch today,

346
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,100
and it didn't have pickles on it.

347
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,940
Oh.

348
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,060
And who makes the sandwiches?

349
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,020
Jimmy John's.

350
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,220
Well, you know, freaky fast.

351
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,500
Sometimes pickles get lost in the mix.

352
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,100
Yeah, we gotta see things from other people.

353
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,980
Oh, they're ready.

354
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,300
As we file past,

355
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,860
Cal like discreetly places a tube of like hemorrhoid cream

356
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,460
on his counter and gives him the finger guns and winks.

357
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,340
And he's like, this should help.

358
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,100
I thought it was gonna be pickles.

359
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,340
Just in case my pocket pickles.

360
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,660
You can't just give your pocket pickles to any fucking-

361
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,900
Yeah, I would never give this man my pocket pickles.

362
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,060
Random stew on the street.

363
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,540
He buzzes you in through the door.

364
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,220
The first one's ready for you.

365
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,780
And as you head in,

366
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,780
you see that there is a metal detector.

367
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,500
Does anyone have anything

368
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,100
that they need to take out of their pockets?

369
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,500
Beck probably does,

370
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
as far as just having a lot of shit in his pockets,

371
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,340
but he's not gonna.

372
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,740
He just is carrying his equipment through there.

373
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,660
It's gonna buzz.

374
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,780
Everybody knows it.

375
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,300
God.

376
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,820
Yeah, I guess Cal takes off a watch

377
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,020
and he puts it like in Beck's like,

378
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,100
do you have a vest with like a bunch of pockets?

379
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,020
Yeah, I put it in one of those pockets

380
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
and maybe my smartphone.

381
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,140
And I'm like, actually you can just keep holding

382
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,980
onto this Beck.

383
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,060
Yeah, for sure.

384
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,740
Officer Peeler comes out the back kind of side door

385
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,020
to this room and he's like,

386
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,380
you're gonna have to give me the old wand

387
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,580
down on all this, okay?

388
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,220
And then takes a wand and starts beeping.

389
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,340
As he's doing this,

390
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,500
Julius just walks through the metal detector

391
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,860
and tries to like act nonchalant.

392
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,220
Does it crazy go off?

393
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,180
It goes off.

394
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,860
Yeah, roll stuff I guess.

395
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,820
We already established

396
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,540
that we're just sending Beck through.

397
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,060
And making him deal with it.

398
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,540
You could have given him your guns.

399
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,580
I got a seven, it's a pass.

400
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,940
Oh, I was thinking D and D rolls.

401
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,300
I've been listening to too many other podcasts.

402
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,220
Julius makes a seven.

403
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,060
You idiot.

404
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,060
Julius just kind of makes this high pitched screeching sound

405
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,980
as he does it.

406
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
Amazing.

407
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,180
Oh yeah, he always just makes that sound.

408
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,340
Sorry, when I get excited, I make that sound

409
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,340
and I'm excited, we're about to do a good interview.

410
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,340
So what did we sneak through here?

411
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,620
I have my guns on me.

412
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,940
Yeah, I thought those might've just gotten through.

413
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,700
And Julius went ahead and did a little shovel action

414
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,540
just down the side of his pants.

415
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,540
And it's like sticking up into his armpit.

416
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,020
Shovel action meaning you shove the shovel down your pants?

417
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,780
You have the shovel like on your hip

418
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,500
going up your side into your armpit?

419
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,460
Down to like my ankle, under my pants

420
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,020
and going up in and the handle is like

421
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,700
kind of up in his armpit.

422
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,580
You should do it the other way around.

423
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,580
Yeah, I think if you have the shovel under your armpit

424
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,940
against your body.

425
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,580
You turn around on the other side of the medical detector

426
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,260
and you're just like shuffling with something.

427
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,100
He's fixing it.

428
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,500
Taking your pants half off.

429
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,220
So he's got both his guns and Dr. Brock Hargrave's shovel.

430
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,660
Okay, well, you did pass that check.

431
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,100
So you slide on through and...

432
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,420
Beck doesn't have anything that's actually

433
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,260
like guns or anything,

434
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,940
but he does probably have a pocket knife

435
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
and he's got pliers and scissors

436
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
and just equipment that you would have

437
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,180
to set up a shot somewhere.

438
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,900
Beck has six Leathermans on him at any given moment.

439
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,380
Okay, well, Officer Peeler didn't do a very good job

440
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,220
checking you.

441
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,100
So he's just beeping the wand around.

442
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,940
It keeps beeping.

443
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,100
He's like, equipment, equipment, equipment.

444
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,060
Yeah, he's gonna beep, like you said.

445
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,540
Mr. Colorado, come on through.

446
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,340
Would you like to wand a celebrity?

447
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Come on in here.

448
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,540
Okay.

449
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,940
And when you walk through, does it go off?

450
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,780
No.

451
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,860
Okay, so he goes up with a wand

452
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,860
and then as he's about to, he's like,

453
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,140
there's no need, I guess.

454
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,460
Beck, can I have my watch back?

455
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,220
Yeah, of course.

456
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,060
Thank you.

457
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,220
It was a spy watch, die, Officer Peeler.

458
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,100
So it was this room?

459
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,740
Yeah, if you go in there and you'll just wait

460
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,060
and then you'll see the line, they'll take you to it.

461
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,500
And as he opens the door for you,

462
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,740
you see a line of tape on the ground

463
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,660
that kind of leads you.

464
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,140
I thought there was a bunch of people here to see.

465
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,980
I was like, fuck.

466
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,420
Kaylee's quite popular.

467
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,700
Julius was following the line of tape?

468
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,780
Follow the line of tape.

469
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,380
You go through a room, out the other side, down a hallway.

470
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,340
Beck's getting footage of this walk.

471
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,260
Interesting, yeah.

472
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,860
It's just the boring inside of the city jail.

473
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,140
Nothing juicy, nothing too interesting.

474
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,140
All just the same sort of oppressive, bland design

475
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,020
and architecture.

476
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,780
You see a painting on a wall in a hallway

477
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,140
and even though it is this oasis

478
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,900
in a desert of horrible vibes,

479
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,380
something about the painting is still just manufactured.

480
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,220
Run of the mill.

481
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,260
It makes it worse almost.

482
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,100
Hotel art.

483
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,820
Yeah, exactly.

484
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,020
That's a nice painting.

485
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,340
Now Cal has taste.

486
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,260
For a jail.

487
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,660
The line eventually leads you to a room.

488
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,660
One wall is made up of little cubicle type spaces

489
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,900
with glass.

490
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,900
So there's six different spots that you can sit at

491
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,580
where an inmate would come from the other side,

492
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,780
sit at a chair, grab the phone that is right next to it,

493
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,100
pick it up and talk to you on the other side.

494
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,060
On this side, there is an old school speakerphone

495
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,620
sitting just in the middle of each table

496
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,900
and so no phone on your side because there's more of you

497
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,980
and it's a role playing game that makes it easier.

498
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,940
And as you walk into this room,

499
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,580
Kaylee Silver is being walked down a long hallway

500
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,060
on the other side and she looks rough.

501
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,780
Her sandy blonde hair is darker than it was

502
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,740
the last time you saw her a few weeks ago.

503
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,020
Space buns are actually still up,

504
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,660
still rocking the same dew

505
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,100
but it's messy buns on the other side,

506
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,140
flyaways and just like stray hairs.

507
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,100
They let her have hair ties in prison.

508
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,940
No, it's actually tied in itself.

509
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,980
It's like a self-tied knot.

510
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,940
I think I asked this the first time, are space buns Leia?

511
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,180
Yes, similar, yeah.

512
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,180
It's just a little buns on top of your head.

513
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,540
Now that they're like wrapped into themselves,

514
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,420
it's more like she just has two like dark dirty blonde knots

515
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,140
tied on top of her head that are flopping about.

516
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,580
Oh, have you had the dirty blonde knots at Big Slice?

517
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,460
They are garlicky.

518
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,660
And there is a distance in her eyes

519
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,620
as she walks up and sits down.

520
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,220
Everybody roll alertness.

521
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,240
Pass.

522
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,060
Fail.

523
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,900
Fail.

524
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,900
Luke, Julius notices that Kaylee's nostrils are flaring.

525
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,500
Kaylee, do you remember us?

526
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,700
Her eyes get really big and she picks up the phone.

527
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,540
We're here to help.

528
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,420
I just want to let you know, we're here to help.

529
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,900
Mr. Colorado, Mr. Colorado, Mr. Colorado is here.

530
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,100
Oh, okay, that's who it is.

531
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,940
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

532
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,820
Okay, okay, everything's gonna be fine

533
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,420
because Mr. Colorado's here.

534
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,620
Everything's gonna be fine, Kaylee,

535
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,140
because Mr. Colorado's here and everybody's here

536
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,620
and everything's gonna be fine

537
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,820
because I can smell it again.

538
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,060
Oh, I can smell it again.

539
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,900
And she starts rubbing her face

540
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,900
and she looks at you, just really, really massive eyes.

541
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,740
Kaylee, Kaylee.

542
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,580
Mr. Colorado.

543
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,700
That's right, you're here live with Mr. Colorado.

544
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,440
Mr. Colorado is here, you're gonna help me,

545
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,660
you're gonna help me, you're gonna help me.

546
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,500
What do you smell?

547
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,340
It's only gotten worse.

548
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,540
Kaylee, Kaylee, I want the smell.

549
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,420
And she slams her face kind of up against the glass

550
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,260
and then rubs it along the side

551
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,060
until she makes it to the edge.

552
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,020
And even though there's cock along the edge,

553
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,220
she's just like trying to get her nostrils

554
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,460
as close to that corner as possible

555
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,460
and just ripping inhales through her nasal cavity.

556
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,700
And she's like, it smells, it smells like it.

557
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,900
It smells like the view.

558
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,740
Smells like when she,

559
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,900
it just smells like when she tried to get into me.

560
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,740
Excuse us.

561
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,560
It smells like when she was in me.

562
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,400
Excuse us for just a moment.

563
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,020
It smells like when she was in me.

564
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

565
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,060
It smells like when she was in me.

566
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,900
Ah, ah.

567
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,900
We're gonna step away for just a moment, Ms. Silver.

568
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,380
We'll be right back with you.

569
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,620
You can hear just repeating herself over and over.

570
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
Can we film this?

571
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,460
I already have been.

572
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,420
You're looking at Beck.

573
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,700
Beck's just holding the camera.

574
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,740
I've got a microphone that's like set up

575
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,180
in front of that little speaker

576
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,100
and the tripod's already out.

577
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,820
He wasn't asking like, should we?

578
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,660
He's asking.

579
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,880
Did Stevie come in with us?

580
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,720
Yeah.

581
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,740
Okay, who has the back?

582
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,860
Stevie slowly opens the bag and like immediately-

583
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,940
What the, Stevie.

584
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,900
Kaylee's feet hop up onto the counter,

585
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,640
like where the other side is.

586
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,000
And then her CO comes over and just like grabs her

587
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,820
and you just hear them kind of arguing

588
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,380
over the phone a little bit.

589
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,840
Stevie, why don't you, fuck.

590
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,340
Stevie, give us a moment.

591
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,820
And we step in for a little bit further.

592
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,660
Yeah.

593
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,580
We can't send Stevie out of here with the bag.

594
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,340
The last time we let them out of our sight,

595
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,180
they took off with their brother.

596
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,060
That's right.

597
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,900
I love Stevie.

598
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,980
They're the best damn intern Cairns had in years,

599
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,980
but they've still got to prove themselves.

600
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,300
I don't trust Stevie yet.

601
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,180
Not where their brother is concerned.

602
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,820
But this bag, we can't have this bag in the same room

603
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,580
as Kaylee and get anything out of her.

604
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,660
That's pretty clear.

605
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,920
I don't know, we haven't even tried.

606
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,760
We just tried.

607
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,100
Nobody asked her anything.

608
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,500
Nobody's even spoken to her yet.

609
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,280
Yes, I tried to speak to her.

610
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,780
She went insane.

611
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,620
What are you-

612
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,860
What are you talking about?

613
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,580
Pearl grip.

614
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,980
I didn't even give her a chance.

615
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,740
That's how everybody is when you start a conversation.

616
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,060
I think we should ask her if she knows what this is.

617
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,580
Stevie opened it from over here

618
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,020
and she went, Eepy, over there.

619
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,380
Stevie had it in their pocket.

620
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,220
Hey, Kaylee, what are you smelling?

621
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,980
She's screaming and being constrained.

622
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,740
Yeah, she's still like going ham.

623
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,340
Julius asks anyway.

624
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,960
He asks it again.

625
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,060
Hey, let her go.

626
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,420
What are you smelling here?

627
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,740
They can't hear you.

628
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,820
They just let her go.

629
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,660
Like the phone is how you communicate with them

630
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,820
and the phone is currently like hanging from the cord.

631
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,380
Julius knocks on the glass.

632
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,340
Kaylee like has a hand of against the glass

633
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,580
where you're knocking and is all smiles

634
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,660
and so she grabs the phone and holds it up.

635
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,000
What are you smelling there?

636
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,220
You brought it, you brought it, can I have it?

637
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,660
What did we bring?

638
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,500
What is it you want?

639
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,460
Have you seen it before?

640
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,060
It smells like when she was inside me.

641
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,820
Julius goes to grab the Ziploc bag.

642
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,260
Whoa, okay.

643
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,140
And pulls it out.

644
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,100
As you grab it, Kaylee is like once again

645
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,400
just losing their mind.

646
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,420
But they keep it under control

647
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,060
and sit down and start to breathe really strongly.

648
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,940
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

649
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,200
Julius is just looking at Beck and Cal.

650
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,700
Somebody asked her, was this an ingredient she used?

651
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,500
That smells like forever.

652
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,660
It smells like it.

653
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,620
Did you use this in the beer that you brewed?

654
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,060
It tastes, yeah, yeah.

655
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,900
Where did you find it?

656
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,900
Where'd you get it?

657
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,060
Yeah, where'd you get it, Kaylee?

658
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,900
The what?

659
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,720
The what?

660
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,560
The ingredient.

661
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,400
This.

662
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,580
Oh, it was America's American Nail Dry Yeast.

663
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,320
America's American Nail Dry Yeast.

664
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,020
America's American Nail Dry Yeast.

665
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,300
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,400
Yeah, is that what you have?

667
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,240
Is that what you have?

668
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,060
Did you make beer?

669
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,900
Did you make some beer?

670
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,740
Did you make some beer?

671
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,560
Can you bring it?

672
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,200
And they turned to their CEO.

673
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,040
Can I drink beer?

674
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,860
Can I have it?

675
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,700
Can I have it?

676
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
If they give me some, can I have it?

677
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,780
Oh.

678
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,620
You guys, she wasn't like this when we last talked to her.

679
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,700
Do you think she could have been re-exposed or something?

680
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,160
Or maybe she's like, fiending for it.

681
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,220
Oh, right.

682
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,060
She's been having like a steady supply and it got cut off.

683
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,540
Or you just have to even have it once

684
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,440
and then this is you now.

685
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,980
Kaylee, which one of those things we just said?

686
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,460
Haven't had it.

687
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,060
Haven't had it, want it.

688
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,020
How many times did you have it?

689
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,460
Last time I had it, she got in me and I got her out

690
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,380
and then I had to kill her.

691
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,540
I had to kill her.

692
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,060
She got in you?

693
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,900
She got in me.

694
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,460
Yeah, she got in me, she got in me, she got in me.

695
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,300
I've been thinking about it.

696
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,380
I've been thinking about it so much.

697
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,260
I don't think that I thought about it when it was happening

698
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,340
but she was in me, she was in me.

699
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,500
What do you mean by in you?

700
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,180
It was crazy, she was like, have we in me?

701
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
It was crazy, I have to pull her out completely.

702
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,220
She was gonna be in me and then I had to pull her out

703
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,180
and then she was out and then I had to kill her

704
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,780
because she was gonna go back in.

705
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,620
She was gonna go back in, she was trying to get back in.

706
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,740
She wasn't her, it wasn't her.

707
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,980
I saw it in her eyes, it wasn't her.

708
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,260
Yeah, we saw that video and it was self-defense, you're okay.

709
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

710
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,820
But you're saying that maybe there was a little more?

711
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,420
Can I have that, can I have that?

712
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,340
Can I have it, can I have it?

713
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
Do you want to get inside?

714
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,580
Do you want to get inside me?

715
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,900
Oh, this is not that kind of show.

716
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,740
Not what I meant, not what I meant.

717
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,220
Just, you know.

718
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,580
Was that the first batch that you'd brewed

719
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,540
with that America's American Ale dry yeast?

720
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,220
Yeah, yeah, didn't even get to try it.

721
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,480
What made you decide to go with that brand?

722
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,100
New brand, new brand.

723
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,300
New brand from where?

724
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,700
New brand, just got online.

725
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,460
Where online?

726
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,180
Julius Googles immediately, America's American whatever,

727
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,620
what is it, America's American all dry yeast.

728
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,740
America's American Ale dry yeast.

729
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,900
America's American Ale dry yeast.

730
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,980
America's American Ale dry yeasts.

731
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,020
Where did you get it, Kaylee?

732
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,860
Where online?

733
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,360
I don't remember.

734
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,860
Julius Googles it.

735
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,900
If you must.

736
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,980
When you Google it, guess who sells it.

737
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,820
Godel.

738
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,660
Play-Doh.

739
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,420
So Godel?

740
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,300
Yeah, the Godel company.

741
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,460
I didn't guess very good, I'm sorry.

742
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,300
Oh my, look, guys, look at this.

743
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,140
Fucking Godel.

744
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,020
Holy shit, it is connected.

745
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,860
Oh yeah.

746
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,140
Stevie, do you know anything about it?

747
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,940
Stevie, they're putting forever in the yeast.

748
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,780
What?

749
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,340
We need to find out how many people ordered this yeast.

750
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,660
Maybe it was an accident.

751
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,940
Maybe it's like at the factory,

752
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,820
whatever this stuff is got mixed in with the yeast.

753
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,420
Joe, can you roll a grip for me?

754
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,100
Fail.

755
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,580
Number one grip.

756
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,420
How many letters are in Americas?

757
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,260
Oh my God.

758
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,540
Damn it.

759
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,180
Eight.

760
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,420
How many letters are in American?

761
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,260
Eight.

762
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,440
How many in Ale?

763
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,280
Three.

764
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,100
Dry?

765
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,940
Three.

766
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,780
And six.

767
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,600
Yeasts.

768
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,440
Eight, eight, three, three, six?

769
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,340
Oh, that's kind of weird.

770
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,180
I mean, maybe not even.

771
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,580
I'm sorry, it's yeast's plural?

772
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,700
It is.

773
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,860
Well, I don't think,

774
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,620
I think the plural of yeast is yeast.

775
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,820
Yeast die.

776
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,180
That's even weirder.

777
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,020
We've got-

778
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,180
It's an apostrophe S.

779
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,880
Okay.

780
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,720
Cal-roll-crip.

781
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,180
In this shot for the audience,

782
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,860
this conversation's going along

783
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,940
and Beck is counting on his fingers

784
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,140
and then looking up at the sky

785
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,420
and he goes back to his fingers

786
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,900
and then he just starts staring dead ahead.

787
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,360
It's the fucking numbers, guys.

788
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,360
They're here again.

789
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,800
Time for another visit from the numbers.

790
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,900
Oh, God damn it.

791
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,940
Beck's got the numbers in him.

792
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,100
Beck, Beck, calm down.

793
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,740
America's eight.

794
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,740
American, eight.

795
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,700
Ale, three.

796
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,100
Dry, three.

797
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,660
And yeast is six.

798
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,900
That's what I'm telling you.

799
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,740
Why would it be yeast?

800
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,900
It should be yeast.

801
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,740
Five.

802
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,140
They must've made it so it would be six.

803
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,720
Oh my God.

804
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,620
That's just lazy, Julius.

805
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,140
Julius is Googling-

806
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,260
Come up with a different word.

807
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,820
America's American ale dry yeasts Reddit

808
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,980
and looking on the brewing, home brewing subreddit

809
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,420
to see if anybody's mentioned it.

810
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,300
Beck is, during his diatribe,

811
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,540
gonna look at Kaylee, grab the phone

812
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,780
and say, eight, three, six, eight, three, six.

813
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,620
You're just picking up the speakerphone

814
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,860
and like yelling into it.

815
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,460
Computer, eight, three, six, eight, three, six.

816
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,540
Oh yeah, Kaylee.

817
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,980
You lived in apartment, eight, three, six.

818
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,740
Why are you saying my apartment number?

819
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,620
What led you to choose that particular apartment?

820
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,460
I don't know.

821
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,040
It was just a sign to me?

822
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,940
I guess-

823
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,400
Assigned to you.

824
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:53,680
Assigned to you, whatever do you mean?

825
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,120
I guess it was just like the landlord put me there.

826
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,240
Oh, well that makes sense.

827
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,840
When's your birthday?

828
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,640
August 36th.

829
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,480
Whoa!

830
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:16,040
Beck starts to slam his head in the glass from this side.

831
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,880
What's your birthday?

832
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,800
I mean, I don't know what else to ask her.

833
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,240
I think we need to track this down.

834
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,080
Who is your landlord?

835
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
Yeah, who owns your building?

836
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,000
Is it the Godel Corp?

837
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Julius, use your devil box to look that up.

838
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,640
He Googles Godel Corp apartments.

839
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,360
City County Assessors.

840
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,920
Did you mean the Godel Company?

841
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,840
I look up the Godel Company, what do they own?

842
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,240
Land.

843
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,920
Have you Googled anything before?

844
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,600
That's just as quick as he can type.

845
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,920
He's just keywords, keywords.

846
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,840
Role of computer science or accounting?

847
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,680
Fail.

848
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,640
OK.

849
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,600
Surprisingly, that doesn't come up

850
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,960
with any helpful information.

851
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,920
No, I don't know.

852
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,280
Try the City Assessor's Office.

853
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,920
Here it is.

854
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,600
The Godels have bought just like wild amounts of land

855
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,640
just under the name the Godel Company.

856
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,160
And you can imagine that they must own even more.

857
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Shells within shells.

858
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,800
It's turtle mares all the way down.

859
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,320
Whoa.

860
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,960
And the building Kaylee Silver lived in

861
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,440
is owned by the Godel Company.

862
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,680
Son of a bitch.

863
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,960
I'm talking not to the speaker now.

864
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,720
And in fact, trying to maybe get away

865
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,080
from the speaker a little bit

866
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,360
and just talk to the guys and Stevie.

867
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,040
You guys think maybe the Godel Corporation.

868
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,880
Company?

869
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,320
The Godel Company was conducting

870
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,200
like a specific experiment on her

871
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,400
and maybe this American yeast or whatever

872
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,960
was delivered only to her.

873
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,440
Yeah, what if they implanted an ad on her social media?

874
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,320
I wouldn't put that above the Godel Corp.

875
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
Company, yeah, I wouldn't either.

876
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,880
We all hate the Godel Corp.

877
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,520
Yeah, we all hate the Godel Company.

878
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,560
Godel Co.

879
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,400
What happens if I try to,

880
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,760
if I try to go order.

881
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,480
Paration.

882
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,760
If I try to order some of the yeast,

883
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,480
does it, is it sold out or does it let me get it?

884
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,720
Yeah, you can order some.

885
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Where'd you order it to?

886
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,000
Your home or the jail?

887
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,440
The can offices.

888
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,000
Okay, speedy delivery.

889
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,280
Yeast for you, sir.

890
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,120
Yeasts.

891
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,760
Guys, I went ahead and got some.

892
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,640
I'm not sure that we like want to test it, but.

893
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,960
That's worth a shot.

894
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,440
I mean, we, yeah.

895
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,160
We know that now that she was assigned this apartment

896
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,560
by the Godel Corp.

897
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,600
It's Godel Corp branded yeast.

898
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,920
Yeah, Godel Company for sure.

899
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
And we know that this horrific event took place

900
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,400
after using it.

901
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,160
We haven't really heard about that happening elsewhere.

902
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,000
Right?

903
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Stevie, does Godel make the products like in the gorge?

904
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,880
Yeah, they do now.

905
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,160
Fuck.

906
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,720
I think we got to go back.

907
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,080
Well, eventually for like a climactic conclusion,

908
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,880
but not before we get an army of rat boys from your dad.

909
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,760
I mean, is there anything else we want to ask her?

910
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,480
836.

911
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,320
What?

912
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,160
No, no, no.

913
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,600
Kaylee, were you a home brewer before this?

914
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

915
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,680
Pretty, pretty avid, huh?

916
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

917
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,000
Had you bought from the Godel Corp?

918
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,840
No.

919
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,240
No, what led you to buy from them?

920
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,080
There's an ad.

921
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,920
An ad on?

922
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,760
Instagram.

923
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,600
On Instagram.

924
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,120
Oh, those can be persuasive.

925
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,600
You know, Kaylee, I recently went digitally clean.

926
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,440
Bragged.

927
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,680
Well, yes, it is a brag because I'm living

928
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,160
a happier, healthier lifestyle

929
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,440
and everybody should emulate this.

930
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,040
But, but no, before that, I.

931
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,760
Are you gonna help me?

932
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,080
Yes, Kaylee.

933
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,520
You know, I bet they don't give you a phone in here.

934
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,040
That's half the battle already,

935
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
but we are gonna get to the bottom of this

936
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,440
and we're gonna make sure what happened to you

937
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,200
doesn't happen to anybody else again.

938
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,840
Okay, but are you gonna help me?

939
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm gonna die in here.

940
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,880
The evidence that you have, I think,

941
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,360
once you go to trial will exonerate you.

942
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,960
Yeah, when is your trial date?

943
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,200
I pushed it back, said a roll went wrong or something,

944
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,400
but it's in two weeks.

945
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,840
Can you make it in here for two weeks?

946
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,680
We're gonna see if you could, is there any way, hey,

947
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,640
is there any way that you can send some of that in

948
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,240
even if it's just a little bit like the residue on a letter

949
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,760
and maybe just like rub it on the letter

950
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,120
and then send the letter in just so I can spell it again?

951
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,600
No, Kaylee, we're not allowed to make the news.

952
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,680
We can only investigate.

953
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,640
We can't really interfere.

954
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,920
I can't materially support the suspect of a murder

955
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,960
even though I believe her to be innocent, do you understand?

956
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,080
Otherwise it would question my impartiality.

957
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,840
But in two weeks you'll get exonerated,

958
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,680
you'll get out of here

959
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,600
and you're gonna have all of it that you want.

960
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,280
No one's gonna believe them when I tell them

961
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,560
Kaylee Silver's innocent

962
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,840
if I've also been sending Kaylee Silver gift packages.

963
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,560
She slams her hand against her thigh.

964
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,360
Ah, shucks.

965
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,480
Oh, shucks, okay.

966
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,880
And you can tell that with everything in her body

967
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,600
she wanted to release, she wanted to scream,

968
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,040
she wanted to slam her head repeatedly

969
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,080
into that glass right in your face.

970
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,600
She wanted to lose control but she held on,

971
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,360
she held it together and she smiles.

972
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,280
Thank you, please help me.

973
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,520
We'll do what we can, Kaylee.

974
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,360
Stay safe in here,

975
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,000
you don't have much longer to have to put up with it.

976
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,680
Do you know Burl Summers?

977
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,680
Julius kind of waves, Julius like waves over

978
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,000
at the correctional officer.

979
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,160
The CEO comes over, grabs the phone.

980
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,000
You done?

981
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
Yeah, I believe we're done with Kaylee

982
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,560
and I think we had a private room to meet with Burl.

983
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,480
That's right, follow the green line.

984
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,600
Green line?

985
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,120
So you follow the green tape heading down the corridor,

986
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,920
similar corridors, this one's a much closer trek.

987
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,880
Julius is walking very stiffly,

988
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,160
like one side of his body at a time

989
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,160
because he's got the shovel stuck up his pants and shirt.

990
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,840
Julius, have you thought about like what you're gonna,

991
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,800
you know, say?

992
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,360
Well, I brought this and he like points at the imprint

993
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,120
of a shovel in his clothes.

994
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Yeah, I was wondering why.

995
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,960
Yeah, well.

996
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,000
You didn't want to kill your dad.

997
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,600
No, he's a smart guy and I think

998
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,880
if I give him a tool, he'll figure out what to do.

999
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,720
Oh, he could dig out.

1000
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,560
You're not gonna beat him to death with no.

1001
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,720
No, I'm trying to get him out of here.

1002
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,640
Gotcha.

1003
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,800
Anyway, I'm gonna say hi,

1004
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,680
tell him what I've been up to since I saw him last

1005
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,680
and then tell him I might not ever see you again.

1006
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,640
I give him the shovel and say, you can get out of here

1007
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,480
but you gotta tell us about the rat man first.

1008
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,000
That's right, thank you.

1009
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,200
Do you mind if I film?

1010
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,600
100% go for it.

1011
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,160
He loves cameras.

1012
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,480
Before I even met him, I knew he loved camera and shit.

1013
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,240
I actually wanted to talk to you about that.

1014
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,080
Do you think?

1015
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,920
I don't know.

1016
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,160
It just seems like he has an eye for photojournalism.

1017
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,760
I mean, if we can find a way to get him out of here,

1018
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,360
I guarantee it.

1019
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,600
He'd be the second best camera man Ken's ever seen.

1020
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,140
Close one.

1021
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,520
But I mean, we gotta get him out of here first.

1022
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,880
I don't even know if we can.

1023
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,520
And here is the room that you're now in,

1024
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,400
this private room.

1025
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,320
There is a...

1026
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,400
Shrimp cocktail.

1027
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,480
One of those city things.

1028
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,720
It says out of order.

1029
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,560
Cow's nibbling on it.

1030
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,400
Wait, what?

1031
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,360
It says out of order on the shrimp cocktail?

1032
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,200
Right, it's like the arcade.

1033
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,100
It's a joke, it's a joke.

1034
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,800
It's like they have nice things but they can't use them.

1035
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,480
Cow's eating it.

1036
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,520
Also, it's broken.

1037
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,200
Yeah, it's rotten.

1038
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,640
It's not.

1039
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,040
It says out of order but this is really good.

1040
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,660
Roll a constitution.

1041
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,280
A 60 and a 60.

1042
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,160
Wow.

1043
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,220
Cow like stops for a second.

1044
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,720
It's good.

1045
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,440
The camera Fast and Furious style,

1046
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,000
like through Cow's body as if it's the inside

1047
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,280
of a car engine.

1048
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,920
We see different pistons firing

1049
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,480
and the nitrous is about to take off

1050
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,480
and explode into a blue and orange flame of ignition.

1051
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,080
And then we see that the stomach acids come in

1052
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,440
and put out the flames of this intense reaction

1053
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,840
that was about to happen inside of Cow's body.

1054
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,680
And there's like a little beach with umbrellas

1055
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,720
and the shrimp are like partying on it.

1056
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,280
But two of them are swimming

1057
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,840
without any sort of flotation device,

1058
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,360
which in the lifeguard's opinion is totally out of order.

1059
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,400
They're shrimp, they're from the water.

1060
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,400
The lifeguard would live in his stomach

1061
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
and so therefore it would want the shrimp

1062
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,120
to drown in his stomach.

1063
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,960
None of this matters.

1064
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,240
They got drowned by the stomach acid and dissolved.

1065
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,080
Cow yells to the voices in his head.

1066
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,700
What?

1067
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,520
What?

1068
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,360
No, I said that.

1069
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,180
You shouldn't eat those.

1070
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,020
Probably not.

1071
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,860
I think it's giving me weird ideas.

1072
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,240
The door opens and a tall stringy man walks in

1073
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,240
with stringy hair and he has handcuffs on

1074
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,680
and I mean immediately the CEO is like.

1075
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,200
No touching. No touching, yeah.

1076
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,940
He's like, do this like hugs for a little bit

1077
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:48,880
and then backs off.

1078
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,840
Hey, let me just hook him up real quick to the table

1079
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,640
and you see that he's gonna lock him in his handcuffs

1080
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,280
to a spot on the table and Burl Summers sits down.

1081
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,280
He's got stringy hair and you see three long singular

1082
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,480
strands of hair coming down from his chin.

1083
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,440
Oh, look, it's even better than the last time I saw ya.

1084
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,720
It's way longer and it's only been like a month.

1085
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
Thank you, Julius.

1086
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,800
Are you doing okay in here?

1087
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,640
Doing all right.

1088
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,200
I didn't expect to see you.

1089
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,860
Well, I didn't expect to see you either really

1090
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,800
but since I've seen ya, I got reassigned

1091
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,660
and I'm on the news now or I work with the news

1092
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,580
and we're investigating some pretty mild shit for you

1093
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,540
but it's pretty wild to me.

1094
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,400
Reassigned?

1095
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,380
Yeah, I'm with Diggory now.

1096
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,380
Agent Diggory?

1097
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,780
This is like my first thing.

1098
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,340
They didn't give me a break at all.

1099
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:52,260
Have you followed up with anybody else?

1100
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,260
I think I'm the only one that got out.

1101
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,400
Is Diggory keeping the path?

1102
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,980
For now.

1103
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,980
And both of you make eyes a little narrowed

1104
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,480
at each other like Luke and I just did.

1105
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,740
But, I mean, if I'm honest, I'm kind of with these guys now.

1106
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,260
Beck waves from behind the camera.

1107
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,180
Cal Colorado sticks a microphone in his face

1108
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,820
and he's like, Cal Colorado, City Action News.

1109
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,220
How do you like jail?

1110
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,820
It's not the best or worst place I've ever been.

1111
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,960
Remember the fog?

1112
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,880
Yeah, this is way better.

1113
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,720
Your son has an emotional goodbye to say to you.

1114
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,020
I mean, I guess we better make it quick.

1115
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,680
Officer, and he just like holds up his press pass.

1116
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,160
Could you give us a minute?

1117
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,520
Rolled bureaucracy or law?

1118
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,760
That's a 57 on a 60.

1119
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,800
Which one do you have 60 in?

1120
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,640
Bureaucracy.

1121
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,920
Nice.

1122
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,480
For being in the firm for you so, you know.

1123
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,720
Why would I do that?

1124
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,740
Cal, tell him.

1125
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,880
The news?

1126
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,160
And Beck is holding up his press pass as well.

1127
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,600
Yeah, so is Cal.

1128
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,960
The CEO just kind of has this look

1129
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,480
of befuddlement on his face.

1130
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,480
So does Cal.

1131
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,480
But with, you know, three confident Stevie holds up

1132
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,080
their pass behind you, four confident adults,

1133
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,200
telling them how things work.

1134
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,800
He's like, I need to read the fucking rules again.

1135
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, and Stevie's his lawyer.

1136
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,760
Nice.

1137
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,600
That'll do it.

1138
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,320
And he nods his head, dips out of the room.

1139
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,160
Cal, that was great.

1140
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,400
I just wanted you to say the news.

1141
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,200
But that last thing was even better.

1142
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,400
Give him the shovel quick.

1143
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,640
I don't think this will work long.

1144
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,240
Here, I got a shovel in case you want to like dig yourself

1145
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,680
out or something.

1146
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,520
I don't know.

1147
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,340
And then here's a gun.

1148
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,400
You can have that too.

1149
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,280
And then, so basically we found.

1150
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,120
Keep one of the guns for us.

1151
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:01,960
Oh yeah, I got two.

1152
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,360
I'm keeping one, sorry.

1153
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,760
We found out Godel company is really bad.

1154
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,600
Like our level bad.

1155
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,200
Like really bad, dude.

1156
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,560
Like maybe shit we haven't ever seen before bad.

1157
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,720
Except maybe shit you've seen before maybe.

1158
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,400
Yeah, but like this is crazier in a different way

1159
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,240
instead of like, you got to kill it.

1160
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,400
This is a, you know, big thing.

1161
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,680
It's true, sir.

1162
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,520
They're bad.

1163
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,480
Okay, well, if it goes all the way to the top.

1164
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,300
All the way.

1165
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,400
Well, you got to get me out of here.

1166
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,720
Can you do anything about these handcuffs?

1167
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,220
Julius like looks over where the officer went.

1168
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,600
And if he's not looking, he just takes a shovel

1169
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,480
and slams it onto the chains.

1170
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,740
Julius, when you grab this shovel and slam it

1171
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,000
just a single time on the chain of this restraint,

1172
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,800
sparks fly off either side.

1173
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,720
And suddenly Burl Sommers is loosed.

1174
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,120
He grabs the gun on the table and immediately.

1175
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,280
Beck holds up his hands.

1176
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,500
Cal catches the camera.

1177
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,840
He drops the clip out the bottom of it,

1178
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,740
flicks one of the bullets up in the air off it,

1179
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,240
grabs it, slams in the bottom of the clip

1180
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,720
and then slams the clip back in the bottom of the gun

1181
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,400
and Beck I got that.

1182
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,240
Julius looks.

1183
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,080
That was so cool.

1184
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,160
Julius looks at the restraint.

1185
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,240
He thought this was going to be multiple batches

1186
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,580
to even possibly work.

1187
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,520
And he looks down at the concrete

1188
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,640
and looks at Cal and Beck and looks at his dad

1189
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,100
and just shoves the shovel down into the ground.

1190
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,260
When you shovel the shovel,

1191
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,920
when you shove the shovel into the ground,

1192
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,160
it moves through the sealed concrete

1193
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,960
like the most fertile land

1194
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,920
and you just shovel out part of the flooring.

1195
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,840
Holy shit.

1196
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,020
Everybody roll grip.

1197
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,560
55, critical failure.

1198
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:02,160
96, which I think is real bad.

1199
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,240
50, but a fail.

1200
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,680
So did you both crit fail?

1201
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,720
I crit fail you.

1202
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,440
Is a 96 a crit fail?

1203
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,800
Oh yeah, holy shit.

1204
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,160
I mean, this isn't the wildest thing

1205
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,880
after having seen what you've seen,

1206
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,720
heard what you've heard.

1207
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,160
It's also a shovel digging.

1208
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,200
It is a shovel digging,

1209
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,760
but it is a shovel digging at a wild.

1210
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,120
Through concrete like sand.

1211
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,960
Yeah.

1212
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,720
So Beck is going to lose one grip.

1213
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,160
Julius and Cal, you're both going to lose two grip.

1214
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,480
Julius pulls the shovel up and kind of like fake lunges

1215
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,240
at Beck and laughs and then starts digging again.

1216
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,120
Julius, my dude, that wasn't cool.

1217
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,200
It was a joke.

1218
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,240
All right, you got me.

1219
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,160
Julius, everyone is laughing after a joke.

1220
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,560
Julius looks at his dad,

1221
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,800
like, what did he think of that?

1222
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,320
Your dad is not in the room.

1223
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,440
The door is open and you see a slumped body

1224
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,800
of the CEO in the doorway.

1225
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,520
What is, what the hell is wrong with us?

1226
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,520
Are you fucking, I mean, yeah, come on.

1227
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,280
Okay, Julius offers a gun to Beck

1228
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,960
or offers him the shovel.

1229
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,680
Oh, I'll take the shovel, dude.

1230
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,600
Julius has the gun and is going to run after his dad.

1231
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,680
Whoa.

1232
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,760
Okay, Cal's going to motion for Beck to stay back a second.

1233
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,400
All right, Luke, leave the room.

1234
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,200
Oh my God, what the fuck.

1235
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,080
Beck is holding the shovel like American Gothic

1236
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,520
and the camera's under, cradling under an arm.

1237
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,560
What the fuck, dude?

1238
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,200
Are we accessories to this?

1239
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,800
All right, that's all on them, right?

1240
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,000
We didn't, did we abet this?

1241
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,080
No, and it's, no, I mean.

1242
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,560
We're just documenting the news.

1243
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,560
We just filmed what happened.

1244
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,880
We didn't happen it.

1245
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,960
We're bringing a human experience, a jailbreak,

1246
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,320
to, oh God, he gave him the gun.

1247
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,040
He gave him the gun back, then he killed that guy.

1248
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,880
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus.

1249
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,480
And Beck wants to throw the shovel to the ground.

1250
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,920
Does it do anything when he hits the ground?

1251
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,760
It burrows.

1252
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,720
Keeps burrowing, zooms out the other side of the earth.

1253
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,680
It doesn't keep burrowing, but it does just like,

1254
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,960
if you throw it into the ground, it's like.

1255
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,480
It sticks like a knife in the table.

1256
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,960
Exactly, like both of those things.

1257
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,320
Oh, what happened to the shovel?

1258
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,560
I mean, this is a whole fucking new thing.

1259
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,840
We didn't even have time to address it.

1260
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,240
The shovel's a fucking magic shovel.

1261
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,120
He always had this fucking shovel, you know.

1262
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,360
Like, I've seen the shovel.

1263
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,760
It didn't used to do this.

1264
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,720
Oh shit, I don't fucking.

1265
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,760
Wait, is that true?

1266
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,000
I ad-libbed that, but does that need to not be true?

1267
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,840
No, it's fine.

1268
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,520
I mean, even if it did do that,

1269
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,600
maybe he didn't show you that it did that.

1270
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,360
I'm imagining him like banging his shovel

1271
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,920
on shit at dinner parties, like New Year's Eve.

1272
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,000
Oh, well, I mean, yeah, he could turn it on and off.

1273
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Okay, I'm gonna get in front of the camera

1274
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,040
and I'm gonna state that we don't condone these actions,

1275
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,240
but we're here to document this unique.

1276
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,480
We're silent observers and we cannot interfere.

1277
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,320
Exactly.

1278
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,280
I'd pull up the camera and get it on you

1279
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,120
and the shovel is laying on the ground

1280
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,840
in the background of the shot.

1281
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,080
This is Cal, Colorado.

1282
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,320
Explosive development here at the city jail.

1283
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,320
Our, a can, oh, how do I say this?

1284
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,680
Stevie, you're the lawyer.

1285
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,680
Stevie rolls their eyes bigger than eyes have been rolled.

1286
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,200
How do I phrase this thing?

1287
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,760
But you can't see because the hair is covering it.

1288
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,160
We've just witnessed something extraordinary here.

1289
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,480
Something, something possibly,

1290
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,840
oh God, I can't call it extraordinary.

1291
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,840
It could be like extraordinarily a thing that happened.

1292
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,320
Yeah, like a miracle.

1293
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,160
No, that's, that's what we don't want to apply.

1294
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1295
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,680
Don't want to give it a good connotation exactly.

1296
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,800
He's, cause that, Stevie, could you go check on that guard?

1297
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,960
Stevie's just making these noises as they go over.

1298
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,520
Slowly check on the guard.

1299
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,160
First they, they did a check.

1300
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:36,160
They were not sure whether the body was breathing

1301
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,560
and then they did successfully do first aid on it.

1302
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,760
So if, if, if they're alive, they're stable.

1303
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,600
Oh, thank God.

1304
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,240
Okay, so he didn't kill anybody.

1305
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,080
Yeah.

1306
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,900
We would have heard the gunshot.

1307
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,400
Maybe, well yeah, they didn't get shot.

1308
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,840
He hasn't killed anybody yet.

1309
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,400
Okay, this is Cal, Colorado.

1310
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,760
Full disclosure, a CAN associate who will at this time

1311
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,200
remain anonymous has, has gone rogue

1312
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,640
in the middle of an assignment

1313
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,720
and broken their father out of jail

1314
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,260
or is actively attempting to flee prison jail

1315
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,580
with their father.

1316
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,360
We don't condone these actions,

1317
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,380
but we will document them for you, the people of the city.

1318
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,320
Let's go back.

1319
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,000
Camera goes down and Beck wants to go back

1320
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,280
and carefully pick up the shovel.

1321
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,040
I think, I don't think we should leave this behind.

1322
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,880
No, we, that's, we need the shovel, yeah.

1323
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,120
I'll take it.

1324
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,940
Sure.

1325
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,780
Okay.

1326
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,600
That's kind of your thing, you carry things.

1327
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,440
Yeah.

1328
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,200
And with everything else, Stevie pack mules the shovel

1329
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,040
under an arm, you know, with plenty of bag, a toe.

1330
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,720
Careful with the end of that thing, man.

1331
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,440
I don't really understand, like.

1332
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,360
And as you say that, there's a glint on the end

1333
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,320
of the shovel that you've seen a few times at this point.

1334
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,020
Stevie, be careful with that end.

1335
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,640
Well, yeah, obviously.

1336
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,840
And they turn it like sticks into a wall.

1337
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,920
No, it's not that, I mean, you threw it, you know,

1338
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,200
with a little bit of force in the ground earlier.

1339
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,020
That's why it stuck.

1340
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,700
But you've like carried it around.

1341
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,180
You've set it down on stuff.

1342
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,720
You do think back to all the times.

1343
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,880
Beck, you juggled it.

1344
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,020
You almost.

1345
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,000
I balanced it on the end of my nose.

1346
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,480
With the back of the stuff.

1347
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,320
No.

1348
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,560
Is this all gonna be part of the story?

1349
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,400
That's the great thing about journalism, Stevie.

1350
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,240
Editing.

1351
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,840
Yeah.

1352
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,000
Well, editing and we don't know what the story is yet.

1353
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,920
It's still happening.

1354
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,200
Choosing what the story is after the fact.

1355
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,240
I mean, sorta, yeah.

1356
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,600
Like this could be a hero moment

1357
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,240
if it all shakes out the way we want it to.

1358
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,080
Sure.

1359
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:42,900
Do you wanna do another take?

1360
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,480
Like maybe Julius is the hero?

1361
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,640
If that's like maybe a possibility.

1362
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,120
I don't expect that would be a possibility.

1363
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Didn't he say a second ago that like the Godels were bad

1364
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,160
and then he looked at his dad and he said,

1365
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,560
like just as bad as the stuff we used to do.

1366
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,520
Did he say that?

1367
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,800
No, no, I thought he meant like.

1368
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,400
I took that into meaning like the stuff

1369
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,440
that they investigated.

1370
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,560
Yes, exactly.

1371
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,880
Meeting the criteria for their organization addressing it.

1372
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,920
Remember their X-Files.

1373
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,760
Yeah, that's right.

1374
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,740
That's a much better read.

1375
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,580
I like that.

1376
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,680
I'll go with that.

1377
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,000
Okay, let's get out of here.

1378
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,040
Yeah, let's go.

1379
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,880
I guess we just follow the trail of bodies.

1380
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,880
Well, we've only found, we just have a body so far.

1381
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,080
No, yeah, for sure.

1382
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,000
There's just one body.

1383
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,840
I'm just worried there's gonna be more.

1384
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,240
And he's stable.

1385
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,080
He's stable.

1386
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,160
No, for sure.

1387
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,040
And we could even call an ambulance for him

1388
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,400
once we get out of here.

1389
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,400
Well, we can, we should call an ambulance.

1390
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,280
Stevie, call an ambulance for him right now.

1391
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,480
I wanna say that like alarms start going off,

1392
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,480
but I don't know that's true.

1393
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,080
Right, maybe they've killed everyone in the prison

1394
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,680
by the time they're killed.

1395
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,940
Or maybe they just patiently waited around the corner.

1396
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,780
What?

1397
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,600
They're just sitting there.

1398
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,440
They're just sitting there.

1399
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,280
They're taking him so long.

1400
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,100
They're listening to us.

1401
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:08,520
They're like giggling to each other about it.

1402
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,960
Okay, you want us to get Luke?

1403
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,800
Yeah.

1404
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,160
All right.

1405
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,560
But we are, we are leaving.

1406
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,720
We are following where they were going.

1407
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,560
Yeah.

1408
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,400
Yeah, yeah, cool.

1409
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,560
You guys leave the room.

1410
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,840
Now leave the room.

1411
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,920
This is LARPing.

1412
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,840
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak.

1413
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,080
I didn't know that there was gonna be a jailbreak.

1414
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:38,920
So.

1415
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,920
So Luke, this is fucking awesome and wild.

1416
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,300
Julius runs out of the room.

1417
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,140
You run out of the room.

1418
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,480
You run past this body and you see.

1419
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,800
Is the body shot or?

1420
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,640
Not shot.

1421
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,480
You didn't hear it.

1422
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,320
Incapacitated.

1423
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,520
Currently incapacitated on the ground.

1424
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,140
Julius thinks about how cool that is

1425
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,120
and tries to really think about the training

1426
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,040
his dad gave him.

1427
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,320
And you see that dad,

1428
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,420
Pearl Summers, stringy man,

1429
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,520
stringy hair blowing behind him

1430
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,640
as he is dipping down this hallway.

1431
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,760
Makes it almost to a door

1432
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,160
and then you see him crouch down at the last second.

1433
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,860
The door opens and he flings his stringy body

1434
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,760
up into the air,

1435
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,760
wraps one of his legs around the security officer's neck

1436
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,080
and then spins this officer down to the ground.

1437
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,920
The officer is not moving

1438
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,140
and Pearl looks back down the hallway and sees you

1439
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,520
and turns and runs through the open door.

1440
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,680
Julius does like a little jump kick like kick ass

1441
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,020
and then runs to try to catch up with his dad.

1442
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,860
Just vaults the dead body.

1443
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,960
Roll athletics.

1444
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,240
Your dad succeeds.

1445
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,060
I succeed 20 on a 70.

1446
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,360
You're both hoofing it, hoofing it.

1447
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,200
Is this the way out?

1448
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,220
Do you know how to get out of here?

1449
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,580
Yeah, I've been planning this.

1450
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,400
Let's go.

1451
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,240
Fuck yes.

1452
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,260
Wait, pause.

1453
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,860
He holds you back against a corner

1454
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:19,860
and you see officers walk just around the opposite corner

1455
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,340
and then away from you down the hallway

1456
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,860
and then they turn right and go out a door.

1457
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,900
They were five feet away from you.

1458
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,380
You see that happening in your brain

1459
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,540
as you hear these officers approaching

1460
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,600
but you're gonna have to pass a stealth roll

1461
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,380
in order to make it a reality.

1462
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,340
34 on a 40.

1463
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,180
Woo!

1464
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,860
You still got it.

1465
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,960
That was incredible.

1466
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,800
Which way do we go?

1467
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,620
Where's the shovel?

1468
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,540
I gave it to Beck.

1469
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,000
And he looks behind him like,

1470
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,860
I thought they were gonna be right behind me.

1471
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:02,380
Hey, how would your dad react in this moment?

1472
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:05,220
I'm trying to build your dad's sort of-

1473
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,420
To us escaping?

1474
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:11,140
To you not bringing the shovel mid-escape.

1475
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,080
If he was planning on using it, he's probably not stoked.

1476
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:21,300
You see the pain in his eyes and he goes, that's okay.

1477
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,380
Yeah, no, that's okay.

1478
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,600
Did we need it?

1479
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,440
I figured you were-

1480
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,260
No, it'll be fine.

1481
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,100
It'll be fine.

1482
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,260
We can go back and get it.

1483
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,100
Nope.

1484
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,140
Probably fine.

1485
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,460
I mean, whatever you think is best,

1486
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,540
we've just got to get you out of here.

1487
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,380
Okay.

1488
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,220
Alive.

1489
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,120
I mean, I planned this whole thing without it, so go.

1490
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,940
And then he dips around the corner.

1491
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,740
Julius falls right after him.

1492
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,180
You make it to another hallway

1493
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:46,160
where there's an intersection of hallways.

1494
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,380
An intersection of hallways.

1495
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,140
People could be coming from either side.

1496
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,620
Do you know how to get out of here?

1497
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,460
Yeah.

1498
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,460
And he points to the left.

1499
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:59,140
Is the left even close to semi the direction

1500
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,280
that Julius thinks he came in from?

1501
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,240
Roll intelligence.

1502
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,300
Crit pass.

1503
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,120
Yeah.

1504
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:10,960
That's definitely the way you can-

1505
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,260
Okay, if you trust him, hundo P.

1506
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,420
He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's this way,

1507
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,740
but we have to wait here.

1508
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,620
He starts counting.

1509
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,500
One, two, three, four-

1510
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,460
Julius holds up his watch in front of his dad.

1511
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,500
Nice.

1512
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:29,500
Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-

1513
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:37,300
Julius is wondering if he's going to count to 836.

1514
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:46,740
When it gets to 400, you continue that thought.

1515
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:52,180
When it gets to 800, you're like, oh shit.

1516
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,780
Is this really happening?

1517
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:59,700
829, 830, 831, 832, 833, 834, 835, 836.

1518
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,820
And he grabs you.

1519
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,660
What does it mean?

1520
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:10,340
And starts dipping down the hallway and runs.

1521
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,180
Roll grip.

1522
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:14,260
Crit fail.

1523
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,460
What does it mean?

1524
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,220
Shut the fuck up.

1525
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,100
And immediately alarms go off.

1526
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:23,980
Fuck.

1527
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:30,180
You see doors in the corridor on either side of you

1528
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,500
with windows that are interior

1529
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,300
and all their blinds were drawn.

1530
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,260
And when you scream blinds on either side of you,

1531
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,460
just open.

1532
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,660
I'm going to cut back to them.

1533
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,500
Okay.

1534
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,500
Smells like weed in here.

1535
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,740
The alarms start going off.

1536
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,580
We were right.

1537
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,380
Okay. Yeah.

1538
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,580
Probably bodies then.

1539
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,500
Okay. Fuck.

1540
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
We got to get out of here.

1541
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,820
We can't be here.

1542
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,220
We didn't even fucking ask him about the rat men.

1543
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,060
Fuck.

1544
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,220
Let's go.

1545
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,140
Yeah, let's go.

1546
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,100
I guess we'll follow their trail

1547
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,060
unless we see an obvious way out.

1548
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,460
This is from the camera's point of view,

1549
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,580
like the horror movie running.

1550
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,660
Oh wait, shouldn't we just-

1551
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:21,820
Oh, do you want to go back the other way?

1552
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,260
Yeah, why don't we just go out the front door?

1553
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,500
Yeah, we could do that.

1554
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,780
I mean, yeah.

1555
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,980
We'd learn less, but it's a lot safer.

1556
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:35,220
It's also the way that there might be people to stop us,

1557
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,220
whereas they might've cleared the way ahead of them.

1558
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,300
That's also true.

1559
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,660
They might not just believe that we're not with them.

1560
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,580
We could also be-

1561
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,780
Because we are with them.

1562
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:45,500
But we could also be like not with them

1563
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,660
and be like, help, help.

1564
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,340
Something crazy's happening down the hall.

1565
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:49,540
Do you think they're going to believe that

1566
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,780
from Cal, Colorado?

1567
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,740
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1568
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,140
Can you sell it?

1569
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,380
You're right, dammit.

1570
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,220
I could sell it.

1571
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,100
That's right, Cal.

1572
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,340
You could sell anything.

1573
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,540
Okay, what do we think?

1574
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,340
That's right, you could sell anything.

1575
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,860
Julius, or?

1576
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:09,700
What?

1577
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,060
Oh, that was a lazy shoe horn.

1578
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,820
This is a panic moment, Zach.

1579
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,180
That's right, shit, what?

1580
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:19,580
I was not selling you anything

1581
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,540
when I told you to believe in yourself, Stevie.

1582
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,020
That's nice.

1583
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,900
Now, which way do we go, dammit?

1584
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,340
When you walk out of this room,

1585
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,740
you see the green tape on the ground

1586
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:36,620
that leads past the body that is slumped over

1587
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,740
just outside of this room.

1588
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,180
Do either one of you have a very high first aid?

1589
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,900
No, just the 10 baseline.

1590
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,500
Okay, not a clue.

1591
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:50,100
And then when you look down the end of this corridor,

1592
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,860
you see that there is another body slumped by that door,

1593
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:58,100
and it is face down and its head is to one side.

1594
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,540
Oh, it doesn't hit to one side like broken neck

1595
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,380
or just like laying on it?

1596
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,660
It could be laying on its stomach

1597
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,220
with its head to one side,

1598
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,740
could be broken neck with its head like that.

1599
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,300
Not sure from here.

1600
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,380
Pretty far down there, maybe 20 yards.

1601
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,460
But you do know you need to walk

1602
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,220
at least like halfway down this hallway

1603
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:17,420
and then go left before you get all the way down

1604
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,580
to that next door to go back the way you came at least.

1605
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,940
I mean, you know, it's not a bad idea

1606
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,500
to link up with like the two guys

1607
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,380
who know how to deal with crazy shit.

1608
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:31,300
We gotta go most of the way towards where they're going.

1609
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,500
Yeah, let's get to the juncture and-

1610
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,580
Let's get to the juncture and then we'll-

1611
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,260
Junction and figure it out there.

1612
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1613
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,340
Okay, guys, come on.

1614
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,180
To the junction.

1615
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,500
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1616
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,140
Signs are still going off

1617
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:48,180
and you see there are alarms on the walls

1618
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:51,900
every 10 feet or so with lights that are just blinking

1619
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,820
and in the distance you do hear

1620
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,500
the kind of movement of officers

1621
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,140
and as you make it down to the end of this corridor

1622
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:04,540
you see the body on the ground.

1623
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:07,380
If you don't want anyone to roll first aid

1624
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,460
as you walk by, go for it.

1625
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,340
Wait, Stevie, you were pretty good at this.

1626
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,180
Yeah.

1627
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,060
Why don't you take a look at them?

1628
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,700
They're dead.

1629
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,100
Oh, I rolled a 10 on a 10.

1630
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:17,940
Oh, shit.

1631
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,100
What do you think, Beck?

1632
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,300
Hey, they're dead.

1633
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,900
It's not good, my dude.

1634
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,020
It's really not good.

1635
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,660
That's two deads then.

1636
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,180
Yeah, at least one dead for sure,

1637
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,500
but yeah, probably two maybe.

1638
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:37,300
I mean, maybe a criminal did it, a different one.

1639
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,140
Right.

1640
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,380
Yeah, yeah.

1641
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,860
Have we heard any gunshots?

1642
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:41,700
No.

1643
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:42,520
With that first aid roll,

1644
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,680
how did this guy die?

1645
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,440
Did he get knocked in the head or?

1646
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,480
His neck was snapped.

1647
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,320
Gotcha.

1648
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,920
Yeah, you were right about the neck snap thing.

1649
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,120
That's an awful way to go.

1650
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:50,960
Is it?

1651
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,800
I mean, it might be quick.

1652
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,520
I don't really know.

1653
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,280
Maybe we should take his clothes?

1654
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,860
That's the end of the episode.

1655
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,280
You can't just give your pocket pickles to any-

1656
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,720
Yeah, I would never give this man my pocket pickles.

1657
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,640
Random stew on the street.

1658
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,360
I'm saving those for my daughter.

1659
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,600
Hi ho, silver away.

1660
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,680
Everyone loves daddy's pocket pickles.

1661
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,520
Oh, okay.

1662
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,680
Everyone feel good?

1663
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,160
That one made me feel real good.

1664
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,240
Not since childhood.

1665
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,120
And it's all my fault.
