00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Introductions and greetings, my little furballs.

00:04.800 --> 00:08.520
It's your best friend and worst enemy, Wolf the Dog,

00:08.520 --> 00:15.840
here to gas you up, then make targeted insults that make you wonder if we were ever friends in the first place.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.400
Nah, I'm just kidding.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.120
Or am I?

00:20.120 --> 00:26.720
I am the DJ of the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP.

00:26.720 --> 00:32.440
I only demand one thing from you, my loyal, royal listeners.

00:32.440 --> 00:38.320
Your unending love and admiration at all times, regardless of convenience.

00:38.320 --> 00:44.800
Speaking of, this howlin' with Wolf is from Spencer Furnace in Akron, Ohio.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.040
Wow, I hope the trip from Akron was worth it.

00:48.040 --> 00:54.640
Spencer tagged at Pretending Pod on the internet, and for that I am eternally grateful.

00:54.640 --> 01:03.480
Not eternally, just feelin' that gratitude ticklin' my intestinals for a finite period of time.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.400
Spencer Furnace, right?

01:05.400 --> 01:10.480
Well, hey there, Sir Wolf. Fancy seein' you round these parts.

01:10.480 --> 01:16.280
I'd love to give a shout-out with all of my love to Tom and Steph, Joe and Rachel,

01:16.280 --> 01:22.760
for givin' me a place to stay and a positive perspective to get through some of the hardest times.

01:22.760 --> 01:27.400
And the boys at PTBP for givin' me an auditory hug

01:27.400 --> 01:32.080
when I needed the sound of people who care for each other and my ear holes.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.120
I'll leave y'all with a joke.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.520
What do you call a hundred million year old pig?

01:38.520 --> 01:42.120
Jurassic pork, baby, get you some.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.960
Thank y'all for all you do.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.960
Damn, I do love a good joke, Spencer from Ohio.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.240
I'd love to hear one sometime.

01:53.240 --> 01:58.680
See, two of us can do jokes, Spencer from Ohio.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.800
But thanks for writin' in and sayin' those nice things about the show.

02:02.800 --> 02:08.960
If you wanna write up somethin' for your fur-zaddy wolf to howl, tag us on the internet.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.360
Yeah, yeah, we're still on the internet.

02:11.360 --> 02:15.240
I know, I heard they're makin' everyone still on the internet.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.600
Go to a classic Catholic confessional booth

02:18.600 --> 02:22.360
and rattle off the sins to a lifelike blow-up doll

02:22.360 --> 02:27.200
that kinda looks like Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.800
But not enough that it was actually modeled after him.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.040
What was I sayin'?

02:32.040 --> 02:34.640
The links are in the show notes.

02:34.640 --> 02:39.400
Oh shit, another word for what's next is succession.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.400
And I just realized that's the same guy.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.240
Whoa, speaking of, it is time for the news.

02:46.240 --> 02:50.800
Last time here at 694.2 PTBP,

02:50.800 --> 02:54.920
the Cannes crew finished up the tense exchange with Ruth,

02:54.920 --> 02:59.120
who is deathly thin, smokin' meth, doin' Adderall,

02:59.120 --> 03:01.160
and looks every bit the part.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.280
Julie has fed her another pill

03:03.280 --> 03:06.680
with a thick GPS tracking device attached,

03:06.680 --> 03:09.160
which is just awful.

03:09.160 --> 03:12.160
And then, on the way to the city jail,

03:12.160 --> 03:15.680
the city action news team learned a wild amount

03:15.680 --> 03:17.760
about Julius's father,

03:17.760 --> 03:22.040
takin' us now to the concrete steps of the city jail,

03:22.040 --> 03:24.240
where Beck is filmin' Cal,

03:24.240 --> 03:27.560
takin' concrete steps to get to the top.

03:27.560 --> 03:31.320
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great

03:31.320 --> 03:34.120
and It's All My Fault.

03:34.120 --> 03:38.200
And it's all my fault

03:38.200 --> 03:43.120
Cause my life is great

03:43.120 --> 03:45.120
And it's all mine

03:52.600 --> 03:57.480
Cause my life is great

03:57.480 --> 04:00.480
And it's all my fault

04:08.200 --> 04:13.280
We went around the neighborhood when I was in, like, fourth grade.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.680
My brother was in, like, eighth grade with a video camera

04:16.680 --> 04:21.680
and asked people to, like, for interviews for a school project,

04:21.680 --> 04:25.000
and then we would just ask them random questions.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.720
But the first question that we asked this one guy

04:28.720 --> 04:32.160
was his thoughts on capital punishment.

04:32.160 --> 04:36.760
And he talked to us about his views on capital punishment

04:36.800 --> 04:40.040
for, like, 15 minutes, probably,

04:40.040 --> 04:42.280
and we recorded the whole thing and then left,

04:42.280 --> 04:44.720
and we're just like, I guess that was a prank.

04:44.720 --> 04:50.040
Yeah, you thought you were fuckin' esoteric,

04:50.040 --> 04:51.600
Longmont Potion Castle?

04:54.240 --> 04:55.400
Find the humor in this, bitch.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.760
We conducted interviews.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.360
No, the whole time you were tellin' that story,

05:00.360 --> 05:02.880
I couldn't stop thinking of burp.

05:02.880 --> 05:09.000
Dude, at work the other day, I was, like, doing something with my boss,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.200
and he's like, hold on, I'm getting a phone call.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.480
And he, like, answers it. He's like, hello? What?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.080
Uh, yes. Okay, bye.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.160
And I was like, what was that?

05:18.160 --> 05:21.360
And he's like, it was, like, a very young child asking me

05:21.360 --> 05:24.400
if my refrigerator was running.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.760
And I was like, did you know the number?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.320
And he's like, I did not know the number.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.440
He's like, I heard the mom in the background,

05:30.480 --> 05:33.600
loud whispering, what to ask me.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.680
Oh, wow.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.800
Well, that's so weird.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.480
It was, like, 1 p.m. on, like, a Tuesday.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.920
I love the idea that the mom wanted to prank somebody,

05:44.920 --> 05:46.840
but didn't have the balls to do it herself.

05:46.840 --> 05:50.680
Isn't Maddie, like, nannying a kid or something?

05:50.680 --> 05:52.200
Or is she just looking after a house?

05:52.200 --> 05:53.080
Looking after a house.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.040
Okay. Plants.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.080
She got the house to call?

05:55.080 --> 05:57.520
If it was, then yeah, the house called.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.360
It was a haunted mansion.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.320
My God.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.320
Okay, this is not much spoilers.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.400
This is not spoilers for The Sopranos.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.760
But, Luke, you know at the very end

06:07.760 --> 06:10.880
when Tony and the other guy are really feuding

06:10.880 --> 06:13.480
and they try to go to his house to talk to him

06:13.480 --> 06:15.560
and he's just, like, yelling at them from.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.400
Yes.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.040
Okay, so there's a joke on the subreddit

06:18.040 --> 06:20.240
that he's just become a house.

06:20.240 --> 06:24.240
And it's really fucking funny.

06:25.080 --> 06:30.080
If you've seen The Sopranos, make sure to reach out and.

06:32.080 --> 06:32.920
Are we recording?

06:32.920 --> 06:33.760
Yeah.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.160
That's good.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.240
Let's get 30 seconds of silence.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.960
Those bugs are loud as shit.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.600
Yeah, we should actually, like,

06:49.600 --> 06:52.040
maybe take a mic outside and get some of that.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.120
Ooh, yeah.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.360
Open the window up and get some background cicadas.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.920
Get let some bugs in here.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.800
They went in so bad.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.720
Are those, like, a Midwestern thing

07:02.720 --> 07:03.720
or are those everywhere?

07:03.720 --> 07:04.560
They're everywhere.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.120
I think they're Southern.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.600
I don't know if they have them Northern.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.880
I feel like there's some part of our country

07:08.880 --> 07:09.720
that doesn't have them in there.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.720
Are you trying to say this is the South?

07:11.720 --> 07:13.840
But I think a lot of the East Coast has them.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.560
You know, they go in cycles.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.680
But there's pretty much, like, always a cycle running.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.440
Have you guys always called them cicadas?

07:19.440 --> 07:20.800
Yeah. Yeah.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.520
Some people call them June bugs.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.360
June bugs are different.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.200
Those are different things.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.520
Those are totally different things.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.760
June bugs are, we got June bugs, buddy.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.760
I thought people called the chirping cicadas

07:30.760 --> 07:31.760
June bugs sometimes.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.800
I've never heard that.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.640
I haven't either.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.320
But there is another name for cicadas.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.640
Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong word.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.600
This is a cicada.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.920
Sleeping beauties.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.200
Yeah, no, I know what a cicada is.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.160
But a June bug is the brown one.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.000
The green and brown thing.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.600
The brown beetles that just fly dumbly

07:45.600 --> 07:46.800
into you. Just straight into you.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.640
Yeah.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.320
Starting around late May.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.440
Really picking up in June.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.800
A cicada and a locust are different things, right?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.000
Locust is what I was thinking of.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.760
But yeah, I think they are slightly different.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.600
Well, locusts are like grasshopper kind of things.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.680
Yeah, June bug is like, that's what I think of

08:01.680 --> 08:02.840
when I think of a June bug.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.280
No, that's like a scarab.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.280
Why is it so green?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.280
They turn green.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.760
They get like shiny.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.120
They're like that and then they're green too.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.000
You used to tie a little string around their leg

08:15.000 --> 08:16.800
and let them fly around like a kite.

08:16.800 --> 08:17.640
Katie did.

08:17.640 --> 08:18.480
Katie did.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.320
Katie did.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.160
Katie did.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.440
It does say that people do call cicadas locusts also.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.240
Anyway, they're loud at night.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.400
They're loud at night.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.240
Tell you what.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.080
Tell you what.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.440
I went outside, I said, ooh, my ears are hurting.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.480
Oh, I swear to God.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.740
Oh my God, these bugs are gonna be the death of me.

08:34.740 --> 08:35.580
The death of you?

08:35.580 --> 08:37.320
The death of me.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.160
Oh, okay.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.000
They're so damn loud.

08:39.000 --> 08:39.960
Katie did's are different.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.560
Yeah, Katie did's are like grasshoppers.

08:41.560 --> 08:42.400
Yeah.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.240
Guys, bugs, you know.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.080
Bush crickets.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.720
Do they have bugs everywhere?

08:45.720 --> 08:48.320
Do you guys, send in what bug you think of

08:48.360 --> 08:50.120
when you think of where you live?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.680
I would say cicadas.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.060
I am sick of this.

08:54.060 --> 08:57.160
We have plenty of role-playing to get into

08:57.160 --> 09:00.800
and I refuse to not play this story for any longer.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.040
Hell yeah, let's do it.

09:02.040 --> 09:02.880
Okay.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.240
Sorry to break it to you, Zach,

09:04.240 --> 09:05.600
but we're on podcast strike.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.440
Oh, no.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.680
Actually, we don't write any of it,

09:09.680 --> 09:10.520
so you should be on strike.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.920
The writers, the directors, they folded.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.680
The actors, we're the actors.

09:14.680 --> 09:15.500
We're actors.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.560
Well, I didn't write anything for this,

09:16.600 --> 09:18.520
so we'll see what happens.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.880
Yeah, but we're not gonna play it.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.400
Give us something.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.920
What do you want?

09:22.920 --> 09:27.920
Like, get us new La Croixs.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.080
Rejected!

09:29.080 --> 09:30.160
Oh, no, I can do that.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.000
We got them, boys.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.400
They folded so fast.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.280
Did you guys hear that the warden threw a party

09:37.280 --> 09:38.320
in the county jail?

09:38.320 --> 09:40.600
Warden threw a party in the county jail.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.920
And the prison's band was there and they began to wail.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.560
Let's rock, guys.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.000
Let's jailhouse rock.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.600
Yeah, let's jailhouse rock.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.800
Let's dive in.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.480
You guys are at the jail.

09:52.480 --> 09:57.480
We see Cal Colorado on these big concrete steps,

09:57.680 --> 10:01.120
hands out as if they're in cuffs,

10:01.120 --> 10:06.120
and he is giving a hell of an intro to Beck Wilder

10:07.160 --> 10:08.580
who is filming.

10:08.580 --> 10:10.200
Standing behind, we have Julius Summers.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.880
Some people call it a prison industrial complex.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.680
Some people call it justice.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.080
We're going behind bars tonight to find out the truth.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.200
Stevie walks up and is like,

10:21.200 --> 10:24.920
wow, you really nailed it, and hands you a towel.

10:24.920 --> 10:29.600
It is midday, probably afternoon at this point here,

10:29.600 --> 10:33.480
on Thursday, July 7th, 2022.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.980
Brought to you by Insert Sparkling Water.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.440
Belvie.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.760
Not unless they pay us.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.200
Belvie.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.200
Oh, wow.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.040
That's my favorite part of that.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.000
They said it was painful at the end.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.960
It wasn't, it felt good.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.960
It felt good, it hurt real good.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.300
What is the date?

10:55.300 --> 10:57.400
I was waiting to open this until you stopped talking

10:57.400 --> 10:58.760
and I didn't pay attention.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.080
It's Thursday, July 7th.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.000
It's mid-afternoon, which is when the sun is beating down

11:06.000 --> 11:08.680
at its hottest stand.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.680
The four of you are outside of the city jail.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.320
Is it a jail or a prison?

11:14.320 --> 11:16.680
It is a jail, it is the city jail.

11:16.680 --> 11:21.680
It is where folks are kept for short stints

11:21.680 --> 11:26.080
or just before their trial if they're not out on bond.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.000
That reminds me, did we figure out definitively

11:29.000 --> 11:31.880
if she is just awaiting trial or has she been sentenced?

11:31.880 --> 11:34.440
That is correct, she is awaiting trial.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.120
Well, let's go in.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.560
What do we wanna ask her?

11:37.560 --> 11:41.040
I figured we would just make it up as we went along.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.480
I say we get a feel for her immediately,

11:43.480 --> 11:46.920
see if she's lost it or if she's with us.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.320
We wanna know more specifically about

11:49.320 --> 11:52.320
like why her roommate tried to get inside her

11:52.320 --> 11:54.040
because we think that might be connected.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.100
And I think, you know, reviewing the footage,

11:57.100 --> 11:58.800
maybe ask about the beer itself.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.040
It seemed that she was the one making it

12:01.040 --> 12:03.260
and that is what set her friend off.

12:03.260 --> 12:04.100
Yeah.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.820
Do we need a quick overview for the listeners?

12:06.820 --> 12:09.340
I mean the viewers, the Kaylee situation.

12:09.340 --> 12:13.420
Well, she was drinking a beer, talking to her friend

12:13.420 --> 12:17.100
and then her friend attacked her and then she killed her.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.660
Specifically saying things like, I gotta get inside you,

12:19.660 --> 12:21.300
I'm gonna rip you apart, I want in.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.260
Yeah, diving for her stomach.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.140
And then she called City Action News

12:25.140 --> 12:26.080
to get to the bottom of it.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.420
She trusted you, Cal.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.540
And here we are, we're here to help.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.380
Let's go.

12:30.380 --> 12:33.300
Okay, yeah, cause Dr. Murray said something about

12:33.300 --> 12:36.020
people trying to get inside or even like

12:36.020 --> 12:38.980
getting inside other people at the zeitgeist.

12:38.980 --> 12:40.340
Right, it's all connected.

12:40.340 --> 12:41.540
Okay, wow.

12:41.540 --> 12:42.420
Potentially.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.540
Haven't you been watching the news?

12:46.700 --> 12:51.700
You walk into the city jail and it is a large

12:52.540 --> 12:57.480
en, en, en, en, enchants, foyer?

12:57.480 --> 12:59.020
There's a large foyer.

12:59.020 --> 13:02.140
Wow, that's a great foyer in this jail.

13:03.140 --> 13:06.460
Big columns, big concrete columns.

13:06.460 --> 13:09.140
I like that you tried to French up entrance.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.780
Cause we were just listening to that episode

13:14.780 --> 13:17.700
where we talked about the city's cage inheritance.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.140
Oh, and then you walk into the entrance.

13:20.140 --> 13:20.980
Now what?

13:22.620 --> 13:25.900
And yeah, it's like the,

13:25.900 --> 13:28.180
I think it might've been a bank in the matrix

13:28.180 --> 13:29.780
where there's a big shootout in,

13:30.060 --> 13:32.220
big columns lining either side.

13:32.220 --> 13:35.100
And then at the far end, away from you,

13:35.100 --> 13:39.380
you see that there is a man in uniform.

13:39.380 --> 13:40.540
Ooh, la la.

13:40.540 --> 13:41.980
Zach, what do you think jail is?

13:41.980 --> 13:43.040
What, so far?

13:46.380 --> 13:47.580
So far it's pretty cool.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.020
I know that the architecture should be sad and oppressive,

13:55.020 --> 13:57.740
which is what I'm going for with the concrete

13:57.740 --> 14:00.460
and the big blocks and-

14:00.460 --> 14:03.100
We passed by the arcade, but it says closed.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.900
So saddest thing I've ever seen.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.460
Beck, get a shot of that.

14:08.460 --> 14:11.300
Zoom in on the out of order sign on all the machines.

14:12.640 --> 14:17.640
At the end of this foyer, there is a wall

14:18.140 --> 14:22.660
and part of the wall is this thick glass

14:22.660 --> 14:26.140
and behind is this man in uniform, ooh, la la.

14:26.140 --> 14:31.020
And he just looks up at you, his face is like red.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.340
We're here to see Kaylee Silver.

14:33.340 --> 14:36.220
Beck just holds up his lanyard that has the press.

14:36.220 --> 14:37.340
Yeah. Lanyard on it.

14:37.340 --> 14:41.940
Oh yeah, you guys recalled earlier, yeah.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.060
Oh yeah, I remember you.

14:43.060 --> 14:45.340
Yeah, you see it's Officer Peeler.

14:45.340 --> 14:50.340
Name's Stu, and you guys are coming in for a story or?

14:50.380 --> 14:52.340
Could you just go get him, yeah.

14:52.340 --> 14:56.180
Oh, I have to wait until it's rung in.

14:56.180 --> 14:59.340
I figured we could just chat.

14:59.340 --> 15:01.300
Zach is making a truly horrible face

15:01.300 --> 15:03.740
to voice this character.

15:03.740 --> 15:05.700
It's good, feels fine.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.900
Yeah, we're just here to do a story.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.220
We're doing some investigating.

15:09.220 --> 15:12.260
Cool, I love the news.

15:12.260 --> 15:16.060
You guys are, you guys do the truth,

15:16.060 --> 15:17.900
telling the people what we've been up to.

15:17.900 --> 15:21.740
It's like makes them know how real it really is, you know?

15:21.980 --> 15:23.980
Do you have any bad stories about this place?

15:23.980 --> 15:26.460
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

15:26.460 --> 15:27.300
Like what?

15:27.300 --> 15:30.260
I ordered a sandwich from lunch today,

15:30.260 --> 15:33.100
and it didn't have pickles on it.

15:33.100 --> 15:33.940
Oh.

15:36.180 --> 15:38.060
And who makes the sandwiches?

15:38.060 --> 15:39.020
Jimmy John's.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.220
Well, you know, freaky fast.

15:43.220 --> 15:45.500
Sometimes pickles get lost in the mix.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.100
Yeah, we gotta see things from other people.

15:48.100 --> 15:48.980
Oh, they're ready.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.300
As we file past,

15:52.020 --> 15:56.860
Cal like discreetly places a tube of like hemorrhoid cream

15:56.860 --> 15:59.460
on his counter and gives him the finger guns and winks.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.340
And he's like, this should help.

16:01.340 --> 16:03.100
I thought it was gonna be pickles.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.340
Just in case my pocket pickles.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.660
You can't just give your pocket pickles to any fucking-

16:08.660 --> 16:10.900
Yeah, I would never give this man my pocket pickles.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.060
Random stew on the street.

16:13.060 --> 16:15.540
He buzzes you in through the door.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.220
The first one's ready for you.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.780
And as you head in,

16:20.780 --> 16:23.780
you see that there is a metal detector.

16:23.780 --> 16:26.500
Does anyone have anything

16:26.500 --> 16:29.100
that they need to take out of their pockets?

16:29.100 --> 16:30.500
Beck probably does,

16:30.500 --> 16:32.500
as far as just having a lot of shit in his pockets,

16:32.500 --> 16:33.340
but he's not gonna.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.740
He just is carrying his equipment through there.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.660
It's gonna buzz.

16:37.660 --> 16:38.780
Everybody knows it.

16:39.460 --> 16:40.300
God.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.820
Yeah, I guess Cal takes off a watch

16:52.820 --> 16:56.020
and he puts it like in Beck's like,

16:56.020 --> 16:58.100
do you have a vest with like a bunch of pockets?

16:58.100 --> 17:00.020
Yeah, I put it in one of those pockets

17:00.020 --> 17:02.020
and maybe my smartphone.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.140
And I'm like, actually you can just keep holding

17:04.140 --> 17:04.980
onto this Beck.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.060
Yeah, for sure.

17:06.980 --> 17:10.740
Officer Peeler comes out the back kind of side door

17:10.740 --> 17:12.020
to this room and he's like,

17:12.020 --> 17:15.380
you're gonna have to give me the old wand

17:15.380 --> 17:17.580
down on all this, okay?

17:17.580 --> 17:20.220
And then takes a wand and starts beeping.

17:20.220 --> 17:22.340
As he's doing this,

17:22.340 --> 17:24.500
Julius just walks through the metal detector

17:24.500 --> 17:27.860
and tries to like act nonchalant.

17:27.860 --> 17:29.220
Does it crazy go off?

17:29.220 --> 17:30.180
It goes off.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.860
Yeah, roll stuff I guess.

17:32.860 --> 17:33.820
We already established

17:33.820 --> 17:35.540
that we're just sending Beck through.

17:35.940 --> 17:37.060
And making him deal with it.

17:37.060 --> 17:38.540
You could have given him your guns.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.580
I got a seven, it's a pass.

17:40.580 --> 17:41.940
Oh, I was thinking D and D rolls.

17:41.940 --> 17:44.300
I've been listening to too many other podcasts.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.220
Julius makes a seven.

17:47.220 --> 17:48.060
You idiot.

17:52.940 --> 17:56.060
Julius just kind of makes this high pitched screeching sound

17:56.060 --> 17:56.980
as he does it.

17:56.980 --> 17:57.980
Amazing.

17:57.980 --> 18:00.180
Oh yeah, he always just makes that sound.

18:01.060 --> 18:03.340
Sorry, when I get excited, I make that sound

18:03.340 --> 18:06.340
and I'm excited, we're about to do a good interview.

18:06.340 --> 18:09.340
So what did we sneak through here?

18:09.340 --> 18:10.620
I have my guns on me.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.940
Yeah, I thought those might've just gotten through.

18:12.940 --> 18:16.700
And Julius went ahead and did a little shovel action

18:16.700 --> 18:18.540
just down the side of his pants.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.540
And it's like sticking up into his armpit.

18:20.540 --> 18:23.020
Shovel action meaning you shove the shovel down your pants?

18:23.020 --> 18:24.780
You have the shovel like on your hip

18:24.780 --> 18:27.500
going up your side into your armpit?

18:27.500 --> 18:31.460
Down to like my ankle, under my pants

18:31.460 --> 18:34.020
and going up in and the handle is like

18:34.020 --> 18:35.700
kind of up in his armpit.

18:35.700 --> 18:37.580
You should do it the other way around.

18:37.580 --> 18:42.580
Yeah, I think if you have the shovel under your armpit

18:42.580 --> 18:43.940
against your body.

18:43.940 --> 18:46.580
You turn around on the other side of the medical detector

18:46.580 --> 18:49.260
and you're just like shuffling with something.

18:49.260 --> 18:50.100
He's fixing it.

18:50.100 --> 18:51.500
Taking your pants half off.

18:51.500 --> 18:56.220
So he's got both his guns and Dr. Brock Hargrave's shovel.

18:56.220 --> 18:59.660
Okay, well, you did pass that check.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.100
So you slide on through and...

19:02.100 --> 19:04.420
Beck doesn't have anything that's actually

19:04.420 --> 19:05.260
like guns or anything,

19:05.260 --> 19:06.940
but he does probably have a pocket knife

19:06.940 --> 19:08.940
and he's got pliers and scissors

19:08.940 --> 19:10.940
and just equipment that you would have

19:10.940 --> 19:13.180
to set up a shot somewhere.

19:13.180 --> 19:16.900
Beck has six Leathermans on him at any given moment.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.380
Okay, well, Officer Peeler didn't do a very good job

19:20.380 --> 19:21.220
checking you.

19:21.220 --> 19:24.100
So he's just beeping the wand around.

19:24.100 --> 19:24.940
It keeps beeping.

19:24.940 --> 19:28.100
He's like, equipment, equipment, equipment.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.060
Yeah, he's gonna beep, like you said.

19:32.060 --> 19:34.540
Mr. Colorado, come on through.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.340
Would you like to wand a celebrity?

19:38.700 --> 19:39.700
Come on in here.

19:39.700 --> 19:40.540
Okay.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.940
And when you walk through, does it go off?

19:42.940 --> 19:43.780
No.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.860
Okay, so he goes up with a wand

19:45.860 --> 19:47.860
and then as he's about to, he's like,

19:48.940 --> 19:51.140
there's no need, I guess.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.460
Beck, can I have my watch back?

19:52.460 --> 19:54.220
Yeah, of course.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.060
Thank you.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.220
It was a spy watch, die, Officer Peeler.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.100
So it was this room?

20:02.100 --> 20:04.740
Yeah, if you go in there and you'll just wait

20:04.740 --> 20:08.060
and then you'll see the line, they'll take you to it.

20:08.060 --> 20:10.500
And as he opens the door for you,

20:10.500 --> 20:12.740
you see a line of tape on the ground

20:12.740 --> 20:14.660
that kind of leads you.

20:14.660 --> 20:16.140
I thought there was a bunch of people here to see.

20:16.140 --> 20:16.980
I was like, fuck.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.420
Kaylee's quite popular.

20:21.940 --> 20:23.700
Julius was following the line of tape?

20:23.700 --> 20:24.780
Follow the line of tape.

20:24.780 --> 20:29.380
You go through a room, out the other side, down a hallway.

20:29.980 --> 20:32.340
Beck's getting footage of this walk.

20:32.340 --> 20:33.260
Interesting, yeah.

20:33.260 --> 20:37.860
It's just the boring inside of the city jail.

20:37.860 --> 20:41.140
Nothing juicy, nothing too interesting.

20:41.140 --> 20:46.140
All just the same sort of oppressive, bland design

20:46.940 --> 20:48.020
and architecture.

20:48.020 --> 20:51.780
You see a painting on a wall in a hallway

20:51.780 --> 20:55.140
and even though it is this oasis

20:55.140 --> 20:58.900
in a desert of horrible vibes,

20:59.340 --> 21:03.380
something about the painting is still just manufactured.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.220
Run of the mill.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.260
It makes it worse almost.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.100
Hotel art.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.820
Yeah, exactly.

21:07.820 --> 21:09.020
That's a nice painting.

21:11.220 --> 21:12.340
Now Cal has taste.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.260
For a jail.

21:18.060 --> 21:21.660
The line eventually leads you to a room.

21:21.660 --> 21:26.660
One wall is made up of little cubicle type spaces

21:27.140 --> 21:28.900
with glass.

21:28.900 --> 21:33.900
So there's six different spots that you can sit at

21:33.980 --> 21:36.580
where an inmate would come from the other side,

21:36.580 --> 21:40.780
sit at a chair, grab the phone that is right next to it,

21:40.780 --> 21:44.100
pick it up and talk to you on the other side.

21:44.100 --> 21:49.060
On this side, there is an old school speakerphone

21:49.060 --> 21:51.620
sitting just in the middle of each table

21:51.620 --> 21:54.900
and so no phone on your side because there's more of you

21:54.900 --> 21:57.980
and it's a role playing game that makes it easier.

21:57.980 --> 22:00.940
And as you walk into this room,

22:00.940 --> 22:05.580
Kaylee Silver is being walked down a long hallway

22:05.580 --> 22:09.060
on the other side and she looks rough.

22:09.060 --> 22:12.780
Her sandy blonde hair is darker than it was

22:12.780 --> 22:15.740
the last time you saw her a few weeks ago.

22:15.740 --> 22:19.020
Space buns are actually still up,

22:19.020 --> 22:20.660
still rocking the same dew

22:20.660 --> 22:24.100
but it's messy buns on the other side,

22:24.180 --> 22:27.140
flyaways and just like stray hairs.

22:27.140 --> 22:29.100
They let her have hair ties in prison.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.940
No, it's actually tied in itself.

22:31.940 --> 22:33.980
It's like a self-tied knot.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.940
I think I asked this the first time, are space buns Leia?

22:36.940 --> 22:38.180
Yes, similar, yeah.

22:38.180 --> 22:41.180
It's just a little buns on top of your head.

22:41.180 --> 22:43.540
Now that they're like wrapped into themselves,

22:43.540 --> 22:48.420
it's more like she just has two like dark dirty blonde knots

22:48.420 --> 22:52.140
tied on top of her head that are flopping about.

22:52.140 --> 22:54.580
Oh, have you had the dirty blonde knots at Big Slice?

22:54.580 --> 22:57.460
They are garlicky.

22:59.660 --> 23:04.660
And there is a distance in her eyes

23:05.020 --> 23:07.620
as she walks up and sits down.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.220
Everybody roll alertness.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.240
Pass.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.060
Fail.

23:15.060 --> 23:15.900
Fail.

23:15.900 --> 23:20.900
Luke, Julius notices that Kaylee's nostrils are flaring.

23:21.380 --> 23:23.500
Kaylee, do you remember us?

23:23.500 --> 23:27.700
Her eyes get really big and she picks up the phone.

23:27.700 --> 23:28.540
We're here to help.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.420
I just want to let you know, we're here to help.

23:30.420 --> 23:33.900
Mr. Colorado, Mr. Colorado, Mr. Colorado is here.

23:33.900 --> 23:36.100
Oh, okay, that's who it is.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.940
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

23:37.940 --> 23:39.820
Okay, okay, everything's gonna be fine

23:39.820 --> 23:41.420
because Mr. Colorado's here.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.620
Everything's gonna be fine, Kaylee,

23:42.620 --> 23:45.140
because Mr. Colorado's here and everybody's here

23:45.140 --> 23:46.620
and everything's gonna be fine

23:46.620 --> 23:48.820
because I can smell it again.

23:48.820 --> 23:50.060
Oh, I can smell it again.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.900
And she starts rubbing her face

23:52.900 --> 23:56.900
and she looks at you, just really, really massive eyes.

23:56.900 --> 23:57.740
Kaylee, Kaylee.

23:57.740 --> 23:58.580
Mr. Colorado.

23:58.580 --> 24:00.700
That's right, you're here live with Mr. Colorado.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.440
Mr. Colorado is here, you're gonna help me,

24:02.440 --> 24:03.660
you're gonna help me, you're gonna help me.

24:03.660 --> 24:04.500
What do you smell?

24:04.500 --> 24:05.340
It's only gotten worse.

24:05.340 --> 24:06.540
Kaylee, Kaylee, I want the smell.

24:06.540 --> 24:10.420
And she slams her face kind of up against the glass

24:10.420 --> 24:13.260
and then rubs it along the side

24:13.260 --> 24:15.060
until she makes it to the edge.

24:15.060 --> 24:18.020
And even though there's cock along the edge,

24:18.020 --> 24:20.220
she's just like trying to get her nostrils

24:20.220 --> 24:22.460
as close to that corner as possible

24:22.460 --> 24:27.460
and just ripping inhales through her nasal cavity.

24:27.660 --> 24:30.700
And she's like, it smells, it smells like it.

24:30.700 --> 24:31.900
It smells like the view.

24:31.900 --> 24:32.740
Smells like when she,

24:32.740 --> 24:34.900
it just smells like when she tried to get into me.

24:34.900 --> 24:35.740
Excuse us.

24:35.740 --> 24:36.560
It smells like when she was in me.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.400
Excuse us for just a moment.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.020
It smells like when she was in me.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.020
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

24:41.020 --> 24:43.060
It smells like when she was in me.

24:43.060 --> 24:43.900
Ah, ah.

24:43.900 --> 24:48.900
We're gonna step away for just a moment, Ms. Silver.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.380
We'll be right back with you.

24:51.380 --> 24:55.620
You can hear just repeating herself over and over.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.620
Can we film this?

24:57.620 --> 24:58.460
I already have been.

24:58.460 --> 24:59.420
You're looking at Beck.

24:59.420 --> 25:01.700
Beck's just holding the camera.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.740
I've got a microphone that's like set up

25:03.740 --> 25:05.180
in front of that little speaker

25:05.180 --> 25:07.100
and the tripod's already out.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.820
He wasn't asking like, should we?

25:08.820 --> 25:09.660
He's asking.

25:09.660 --> 25:10.880
Did Stevie come in with us?

25:10.880 --> 25:11.720
Yeah.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.740
Okay, who has the back?

25:14.460 --> 25:17.860
Stevie slowly opens the bag and like immediately-

25:17.860 --> 25:18.940
What the, Stevie.

25:18.940 --> 25:21.900
Kaylee's feet hop up onto the counter,

25:21.900 --> 25:23.640
like where the other side is.

25:23.640 --> 25:27.000
And then her CO comes over and just like grabs her

25:27.000 --> 25:28.820
and you just hear them kind of arguing

25:28.820 --> 25:30.380
over the phone a little bit.

25:30.380 --> 25:32.840
Stevie, why don't you, fuck.

25:32.840 --> 25:36.340
Stevie, give us a moment.

25:36.340 --> 25:38.820
And we step in for a little bit further.

25:38.820 --> 25:39.660
Yeah.

25:40.820 --> 25:43.580
We can't send Stevie out of here with the bag.

25:44.260 --> 25:45.340
The last time we let them out of our sight,

25:45.340 --> 25:46.180
they took off with their brother.

25:46.180 --> 25:47.060
That's right.

25:47.060 --> 25:47.900
I love Stevie.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.980
They're the best damn intern Cairns had in years,

25:49.980 --> 25:51.980
but they've still got to prove themselves.

25:51.980 --> 25:53.300
I don't trust Stevie yet.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.180
Not where their brother is concerned.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.820
But this bag, we can't have this bag in the same room

25:57.820 --> 25:59.580
as Kaylee and get anything out of her.

25:59.580 --> 26:00.660
That's pretty clear.

26:00.660 --> 26:01.920
I don't know, we haven't even tried.

26:01.920 --> 26:02.760
We just tried.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.100
Nobody asked her anything.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.500
Nobody's even spoken to her yet.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.280
Yes, I tried to speak to her.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.780
She went insane.

26:08.780 --> 26:09.620
What are you-

26:09.620 --> 26:11.860
What are you talking about?

26:15.740 --> 26:16.580
Pearl grip.

26:16.580 --> 26:17.980
I didn't even give her a chance.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.740
That's how everybody is when you start a conversation.

26:24.740 --> 26:28.060
I think we should ask her if she knows what this is.

26:28.060 --> 26:30.580
Stevie opened it from over here

26:30.580 --> 26:33.020
and she went, Eepy, over there.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.380
Stevie had it in their pocket.

26:34.380 --> 26:37.220
Hey, Kaylee, what are you smelling?

26:37.220 --> 26:38.980
She's screaming and being constrained.

26:39.580 --> 26:41.740
Yeah, she's still like going ham.

26:41.740 --> 26:43.340
Julius asks anyway.

26:43.340 --> 26:44.960
He asks it again.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.060
Hey, let her go.

26:46.060 --> 26:47.420
What are you smelling here?

26:48.900 --> 26:49.740
They can't hear you.

26:49.740 --> 26:50.820
They just let her go.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.660
Like the phone is how you communicate with them

26:54.660 --> 26:58.820
and the phone is currently like hanging from the cord.

26:58.820 --> 27:00.380
Julius knocks on the glass.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.340
Kaylee like has a hand of against the glass

27:05.340 --> 27:08.580
where you're knocking and is all smiles

27:09.020 --> 27:10.660
and so she grabs the phone and holds it up.

27:10.660 --> 27:13.000
What are you smelling there?

27:16.420 --> 27:21.220
You brought it, you brought it, can I have it?

27:21.220 --> 27:22.660
What did we bring?

27:22.660 --> 27:23.500
What is it you want?

27:23.500 --> 27:24.460
Have you seen it before?

27:24.460 --> 27:27.060
It smells like when she was inside me.

27:27.060 --> 27:29.820
Julius goes to grab the Ziploc bag.

27:29.820 --> 27:31.260
Whoa, okay.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.140
And pulls it out.

27:32.140 --> 27:35.100
As you grab it, Kaylee is like once again

27:35.100 --> 27:37.400
just losing their mind.

27:39.580 --> 27:42.420
But they keep it under control

27:42.420 --> 27:46.060
and sit down and start to breathe really strongly.

27:46.060 --> 27:50.940
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

27:50.940 --> 27:53.200
Julius is just looking at Beck and Cal.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.700
Somebody asked her, was this an ingredient she used?

27:56.700 --> 27:58.500
That smells like forever.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.660
It smells like it.

27:59.660 --> 28:02.620
Did you use this in the beer that you brewed?

28:04.860 --> 28:07.060
It tastes, yeah, yeah.

28:07.060 --> 28:07.900
Where did you find it?

28:08.060 --> 28:08.900
Where'd you get it?

28:08.900 --> 28:10.060
Yeah, where'd you get it, Kaylee?

28:10.060 --> 28:10.900
The what?

28:10.900 --> 28:11.720
The what?

28:11.720 --> 28:12.560
The ingredient.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.400
This.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.580
Oh, it was America's American Nail Dry Yeast.

28:16.580 --> 28:18.320
America's American Nail Dry Yeast.

28:18.320 --> 28:21.020
America's American Nail Dry Yeast.

28:21.020 --> 28:22.300
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:22.300 --> 28:23.400
Yeah, is that what you have?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.240
Is that what you have?

28:24.240 --> 28:25.060
Did you make beer?

28:25.060 --> 28:25.900
Did you make some beer?

28:25.900 --> 28:26.740
Did you make some beer?

28:26.740 --> 28:27.560
Can you bring it?

28:27.560 --> 28:29.200
And they turned to their CEO.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.040
Can I drink beer?

28:30.040 --> 28:30.860
Can I have it?

28:30.860 --> 28:31.700
Can I have it?

28:31.700 --> 28:32.700
If they give me some, can I have it?

28:32.940 --> 28:33.780
Oh.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.620
You guys, she wasn't like this when we last talked to her.

28:38.620 --> 28:41.700
Do you think she could have been re-exposed or something?

28:41.700 --> 28:44.160
Or maybe she's like, fiending for it.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.220
Oh, right.

28:45.220 --> 28:48.060
She's been having like a steady supply and it got cut off.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.540
Or you just have to even have it once

28:50.540 --> 28:52.440
and then this is you now.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.980
Kaylee, which one of those things we just said?

28:59.060 --> 29:00.460
Haven't had it.

29:00.460 --> 29:02.060
Haven't had it, want it.

29:02.420 --> 29:04.020
How many times did you have it?

29:06.340 --> 29:08.460
Last time I had it, she got in me and I got her out

29:08.460 --> 29:12.380
and then I had to kill her.

29:12.380 --> 29:13.540
I had to kill her.

29:13.540 --> 29:15.060
She got in you?

29:15.060 --> 29:15.900
She got in me.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.460
Yeah, she got in me, she got in me, she got in me.

29:18.460 --> 29:19.300
I've been thinking about it.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.380
I've been thinking about it so much.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.260
I don't think that I thought about it when it was happening

29:24.260 --> 29:26.340
but she was in me, she was in me.

29:26.340 --> 29:27.500
What do you mean by in you?

29:27.500 --> 29:29.180
It was crazy, she was like, have we in me?

29:29.180 --> 29:31.180
It was crazy, I have to pull her out completely.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.220
She was gonna be in me and then I had to pull her out

29:33.220 --> 29:35.180
and then she was out and then I had to kill her

29:35.180 --> 29:36.780
because she was gonna go back in.

29:36.780 --> 29:38.620
She was gonna go back in, she was trying to get back in.

29:38.620 --> 29:39.740
She wasn't her, it wasn't her.

29:39.740 --> 29:40.980
I saw it in her eyes, it wasn't her.

29:40.980 --> 29:44.260
Yeah, we saw that video and it was self-defense, you're okay.

29:44.260 --> 29:48.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.820
But you're saying that maybe there was a little more?

29:49.820 --> 29:51.420
Can I have that, can I have that?

29:51.420 --> 29:53.340
Can I have it, can I have it?

29:53.340 --> 29:54.340
Do you want to get inside?

29:54.340 --> 29:55.580
Do you want to get inside me?

29:55.580 --> 29:57.900
Oh, this is not that kind of show.

29:59.580 --> 30:00.740
Not what I meant, not what I meant.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.220
Just, you know.

30:02.220 --> 30:04.580
Was that the first batch that you'd brewed

30:04.580 --> 30:08.540
with that America's American Ale dry yeast?

30:08.540 --> 30:10.220
Yeah, yeah, didn't even get to try it.

30:10.220 --> 30:12.480
What made you decide to go with that brand?

30:12.480 --> 30:14.100
New brand, new brand.

30:14.100 --> 30:15.300
New brand from where?

30:15.300 --> 30:16.700
New brand, just got online.

30:17.580 --> 30:18.460
Where online?

30:18.460 --> 30:22.180
Julius Googles immediately, America's American whatever,

30:22.180 --> 30:24.620
what is it, America's American all dry yeast.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.740
America's American Ale dry yeast.

30:26.740 --> 30:28.900
America's American Ale dry yeast.

30:28.940 --> 30:30.980
America's American Ale dry yeasts.

30:30.980 --> 30:32.020
Where did you get it, Kaylee?

30:32.020 --> 30:32.860
Where online?

30:37.860 --> 30:39.360
I don't remember.

30:44.740 --> 30:45.860
Julius Googles it.

30:45.860 --> 30:46.900
If you must.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.980
When you Google it, guess who sells it.

30:48.980 --> 30:49.820
Godel.

30:49.820 --> 30:50.660
Play-Doh.

30:51.580 --> 30:52.420
So Godel?

30:52.420 --> 30:54.300
Yeah, the Godel company.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.460
I didn't guess very good, I'm sorry.

30:57.140 --> 31:00.300
Oh my, look, guys, look at this.

31:00.300 --> 31:01.140
Fucking Godel.

31:01.140 --> 31:04.020
Holy shit, it is connected.

31:04.020 --> 31:04.860
Oh yeah.

31:04.860 --> 31:07.140
Stevie, do you know anything about it?

31:07.140 --> 31:09.940
Stevie, they're putting forever in the yeast.

31:09.940 --> 31:10.780
What?

31:10.780 --> 31:13.340
We need to find out how many people ordered this yeast.

31:13.340 --> 31:14.660
Maybe it was an accident.

31:14.660 --> 31:15.940
Maybe it's like at the factory,

31:15.940 --> 31:18.820
whatever this stuff is got mixed in with the yeast.

31:18.820 --> 31:20.420
Joe, can you roll a grip for me?

31:25.260 --> 31:26.100
Fail.

31:26.740 --> 31:27.580
Number one grip.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.420
How many letters are in Americas?

31:29.420 --> 31:30.260
Oh my God.

31:31.700 --> 31:32.540
Damn it.

31:34.340 --> 31:35.180
Eight.

31:35.180 --> 31:36.420
How many letters are in American?

31:36.420 --> 31:37.260
Eight.

31:37.260 --> 31:38.440
How many in Ale?

31:38.440 --> 31:39.280
Three.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.100
Dry?

31:40.100 --> 31:40.940
Three.

31:40.940 --> 31:41.780
And six.

31:41.780 --> 31:42.600
Yeasts.

31:42.600 --> 31:43.440
Eight, eight, three, three, six?

31:43.440 --> 31:44.340
Oh, that's kind of weird.

31:44.340 --> 31:45.180
I mean, maybe not even.

31:45.180 --> 31:48.580
I'm sorry, it's yeast's plural?

31:48.580 --> 31:49.700
It is.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.860
Well, I don't think,

31:50.860 --> 31:53.620
I think the plural of yeast is yeast.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.820
Yeast die.

31:54.940 --> 31:56.180
That's even weirder.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.020
We've got-

31:57.020 --> 31:58.180
It's an apostrophe S.

31:59.060 --> 31:59.880
Okay.

31:59.880 --> 32:00.720
Cal-roll-crip.

32:05.100 --> 32:07.180
In this shot for the audience,

32:07.180 --> 32:08.860
this conversation's going along

32:08.860 --> 32:10.940
and Beck is counting on his fingers

32:11.980 --> 32:14.140
and then looking up at the sky

32:15.180 --> 32:17.420
and he goes back to his fingers

32:17.420 --> 32:19.900
and then he just starts staring dead ahead.

32:19.900 --> 32:23.360
It's the fucking numbers, guys.

32:25.260 --> 32:26.360
They're here again.

32:27.540 --> 32:29.800
Time for another visit from the numbers.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.900
Oh, God damn it.

32:32.900 --> 32:33.940
Beck's got the numbers in him.

32:33.940 --> 32:35.100
Beck, Beck, calm down.

32:35.100 --> 32:36.740
America's eight.

32:36.740 --> 32:38.740
American, eight.

32:38.740 --> 32:40.700
Ale, three.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.100
Dry, three.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.660
And yeast is six.

32:44.700 --> 32:45.900
That's what I'm telling you.

32:45.900 --> 32:46.740
Why would it be yeast?

32:46.740 --> 32:47.900
It should be yeast.

32:47.900 --> 32:48.740
Five.

32:48.740 --> 32:51.140
They must've made it so it would be six.

32:51.140 --> 32:52.720
Oh my God.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.620
That's just lazy, Julius.

32:55.260 --> 32:57.140
Julius is Googling-

32:57.140 --> 32:58.260
Come up with a different word.

32:58.260 --> 33:02.820
America's American ale dry yeasts Reddit

33:02.820 --> 33:05.980
and looking on the brewing, home brewing subreddit

33:05.980 --> 33:07.420
to see if anybody's mentioned it.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.300
Beck is, during his diatribe,

33:09.300 --> 33:12.540
gonna look at Kaylee, grab the phone

33:12.540 --> 33:14.780
and say, eight, three, six, eight, three, six.

33:14.780 --> 33:16.620
You're just picking up the speakerphone

33:16.620 --> 33:18.860
and like yelling into it.

33:18.860 --> 33:21.460
Computer, eight, three, six, eight, three, six.

33:22.380 --> 33:23.540
Oh yeah, Kaylee.

33:23.540 --> 33:25.980
You lived in apartment, eight, three, six.

33:25.980 --> 33:28.740
Why are you saying my apartment number?

33:28.740 --> 33:31.620
What led you to choose that particular apartment?

33:31.620 --> 33:32.460
I don't know.

33:32.460 --> 33:34.040
It was just a sign to me?

33:34.040 --> 33:34.940
I guess-

33:34.940 --> 33:36.400
Assigned to you.

33:36.400 --> 33:53.680
Assigned to you, whatever do you mean?

33:53.680 --> 33:58.120
I guess it was just like the landlord put me there.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.240
Oh, well that makes sense.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.840
When's your birthday?

34:02.840 --> 34:04.640
August 36th.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.480
Whoa!

34:07.480 --> 34:16.040
Beck starts to slam his head in the glass from this side.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.880
What's your birthday?

34:18.880 --> 34:20.800
I mean, I don't know what else to ask her.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.240
I think we need to track this down.

34:22.240 --> 34:23.080
Who is your landlord?

34:23.080 --> 34:24.080
Yeah, who owns your building?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.000
Is it the Godel Corp?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Julius, use your devil box to look that up.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.640
He Googles Godel Corp apartments.

34:31.640 --> 34:34.360
City County Assessors.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.920
Did you mean the Godel Company?

34:36.920 --> 34:40.840
I look up the Godel Company, what do they own?

34:40.840 --> 34:42.240
Land.

34:42.240 --> 34:45.920
Have you Googled anything before?

34:45.920 --> 34:47.600
That's just as quick as he can type.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.920
He's just keywords, keywords.

34:50.920 --> 34:55.840
Role of computer science or accounting?

34:55.840 --> 34:56.680
Fail.

34:56.680 --> 34:57.640
OK.

34:57.640 --> 35:00.600
Surprisingly, that doesn't come up

35:00.600 --> 35:01.960
with any helpful information.

35:01.960 --> 35:02.920
No, I don't know.

35:02.920 --> 35:06.280
Try the City Assessor's Office.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.920
Here it is.

35:09.920 --> 35:14.600
The Godels have bought just like wild amounts of land

35:14.600 --> 35:16.640
just under the name the Godel Company.

35:16.640 --> 35:20.160
And you can imagine that they must own even more.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.160
Shells within shells.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.800
It's turtle mares all the way down.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.320
Whoa.

35:27.320 --> 35:31.960
And the building Kaylee Silver lived in

35:31.960 --> 35:34.440
is owned by the Godel Company.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.680
Son of a bitch.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.960
I'm talking not to the speaker now.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.720
And in fact, trying to maybe get away

35:39.720 --> 35:41.080
from the speaker a little bit

35:41.080 --> 35:43.360
and just talk to the guys and Stevie.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.040
You guys think maybe the Godel Corporation.

35:46.040 --> 35:46.880
Company?

35:46.880 --> 35:49.320
The Godel Company was conducting

35:49.320 --> 35:52.200
like a specific experiment on her

35:52.200 --> 35:54.400
and maybe this American yeast or whatever

35:54.400 --> 35:55.960
was delivered only to her.

35:55.960 --> 35:59.440
Yeah, what if they implanted an ad on her social media?

35:59.440 --> 36:01.320
I wouldn't put that above the Godel Corp.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.320
Company, yeah, I wouldn't either.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.880
We all hate the Godel Corp.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.520
Yeah, we all hate the Godel Company.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.560
Godel Co.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.400
What happens if I try to,

36:09.400 --> 36:12.760
if I try to go order.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.480
Paration.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.760
If I try to order some of the yeast,

36:17.760 --> 36:20.480
does it, is it sold out or does it let me get it?

36:20.480 --> 36:21.720
Yeah, you can order some.

36:21.720 --> 36:22.720
Where'd you order it to?

36:22.720 --> 36:25.000
Your home or the jail?

36:25.000 --> 36:26.440
The can offices.

36:26.440 --> 36:29.000
Okay, speedy delivery.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.280
Yeast for you, sir.

36:32.280 --> 36:33.120
Yeasts.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.760
Guys, I went ahead and got some.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.640
I'm not sure that we like want to test it, but.

36:39.640 --> 36:40.960
That's worth a shot.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.440
I mean, we, yeah.

36:42.440 --> 36:46.160
We know that now that she was assigned this apartment

36:46.160 --> 36:47.560
by the Godel Corp.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.600
It's Godel Corp branded yeast.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.920
Yeah, Godel Company for sure.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.920
And we know that this horrific event took place

36:52.920 --> 36:54.400
after using it.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.160
We haven't really heard about that happening elsewhere.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.000
Right?

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
Stevie, does Godel make the products like in the gorge?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.880
Yeah, they do now.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.160
Fuck.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.720
I think we got to go back.

37:07.720 --> 37:10.080
Well, eventually for like a climactic conclusion,

37:10.080 --> 37:12.880
but not before we get an army of rat boys from your dad.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.760
I mean, is there anything else we want to ask her?

37:16.760 --> 37:18.480
836.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.320
What?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.160
No, no, no.

37:24.440 --> 37:27.600
Kaylee, were you a home brewer before this?

37:27.600 --> 37:29.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:29.640 --> 37:30.680
Pretty, pretty avid, huh?

37:30.680 --> 37:31.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.000
Had you bought from the Godel Corp?

37:33.000 --> 37:33.840
No.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.240
No, what led you to buy from them?

37:36.240 --> 37:37.080
There's an ad.

37:37.080 --> 37:37.920
An ad on?

37:37.920 --> 37:38.760
Instagram.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.600
On Instagram.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.120
Oh, those can be persuasive.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.600
You know, Kaylee, I recently went digitally clean.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.440
Bragged.

37:46.620 --> 37:48.680
Well, yes, it is a brag because I'm living

37:48.680 --> 37:50.160
a happier, healthier lifestyle

37:50.160 --> 37:51.440
and everybody should emulate this.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.040
But, but no, before that, I.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.760
Are you gonna help me?

37:55.760 --> 37:57.080
Yes, Kaylee.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.520
You know, I bet they don't give you a phone in here.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.040
That's half the battle already,

38:00.040 --> 38:02.040
but we are gonna get to the bottom of this

38:02.040 --> 38:03.440
and we're gonna make sure what happened to you

38:03.440 --> 38:05.200
doesn't happen to anybody else again.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.840
Okay, but are you gonna help me?

38:07.760 --> 38:09.960
I'm gonna die in here.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.880
The evidence that you have, I think,

38:11.880 --> 38:14.360
once you go to trial will exonerate you.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.960
Yeah, when is your trial date?

38:15.960 --> 38:19.200
I pushed it back, said a roll went wrong or something,

38:19.200 --> 38:22.400
but it's in two weeks.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.840
Can you make it in here for two weeks?

38:24.680 --> 38:29.680
We're gonna see if you could, is there any way, hey,

38:31.240 --> 38:34.640
is there any way that you can send some of that in

38:34.640 --> 38:38.240
even if it's just a little bit like the residue on a letter

38:38.240 --> 38:41.760
and maybe just like rub it on the letter

38:41.760 --> 38:46.120
and then send the letter in just so I can spell it again?

38:47.200 --> 38:49.600
No, Kaylee, we're not allowed to make the news.

38:49.600 --> 38:50.680
We can only investigate.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.640
We can't really interfere.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.920
I can't materially support the suspect of a murder

38:55.920 --> 38:59.960
even though I believe her to be innocent, do you understand?

38:59.960 --> 39:02.080
Otherwise it would question my impartiality.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.840
But in two weeks you'll get exonerated,

39:03.840 --> 39:04.680
you'll get out of here

39:04.680 --> 39:07.600
and you're gonna have all of it that you want.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.280
No one's gonna believe them when I tell them

39:09.280 --> 39:10.560
Kaylee Silver's innocent

39:10.560 --> 39:13.840
if I've also been sending Kaylee Silver gift packages.

39:15.560 --> 39:20.560
She slams her hand against her thigh.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.360
Ah, shucks.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.480
Oh, shucks, okay.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.880
And you can tell that with everything in her body

39:30.880 --> 39:34.600
she wanted to release, she wanted to scream,

39:34.600 --> 39:37.040
she wanted to slam her head repeatedly

39:37.040 --> 39:39.080
into that glass right in your face.

39:39.080 --> 39:42.600
She wanted to lose control but she held on,

39:42.600 --> 39:45.360
she held it together and she smiles.

39:46.320 --> 39:49.280
Thank you, please help me.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.520
We'll do what we can, Kaylee.

39:50.520 --> 39:51.360
Stay safe in here,

39:51.360 --> 39:54.000
you don't have much longer to have to put up with it.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.680
Do you know Burl Summers?

39:56.680 --> 39:59.680
Julius kind of waves, Julius like waves over

39:59.680 --> 40:02.000
at the correctional officer.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.160
The CEO comes over, grabs the phone.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.000
You done?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.400
Yeah, I believe we're done with Kaylee

40:06.400 --> 40:10.560
and I think we had a private room to meet with Burl.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.480
That's right, follow the green line.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.600
Green line?

40:13.600 --> 40:18.120
So you follow the green tape heading down the corridor,

40:18.160 --> 40:21.920
similar corridors, this one's a much closer trek.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.880
Julius is walking very stiffly,

40:23.880 --> 40:26.160
like one side of his body at a time

40:26.160 --> 40:31.160
because he's got the shovel stuck up his pants and shirt.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.840
Julius, have you thought about like what you're gonna,

40:33.840 --> 40:35.800
you know, say?

40:35.800 --> 40:39.360
Well, I brought this and he like points at the imprint

40:39.360 --> 40:42.120
of a shovel in his clothes.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.120
Yeah, I was wondering why.

40:43.120 --> 40:43.960
Yeah, well.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.000
You didn't want to kill your dad.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.600
No, he's a smart guy and I think

40:47.920 --> 40:50.880
if I give him a tool, he'll figure out what to do.

40:50.880 --> 40:51.720
Oh, he could dig out.

40:51.720 --> 40:52.560
You're not gonna beat him to death with no.

40:52.560 --> 40:53.720
No, I'm trying to get him out of here.

40:53.720 --> 40:54.640
Gotcha.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.800
Anyway, I'm gonna say hi,

40:56.800 --> 40:59.680
tell him what I've been up to since I saw him last

40:59.680 --> 41:04.680
and then tell him I might not ever see you again.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.640
I give him the shovel and say, you can get out of here

41:07.640 --> 41:10.480
but you gotta tell us about the rat man first.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.000
That's right, thank you.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.200
Do you mind if I film?

41:13.200 --> 41:14.600
100% go for it.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.160
He loves cameras.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.480
Before I even met him, I knew he loved camera and shit.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.240
I actually wanted to talk to you about that.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.080
Do you think?

41:21.080 --> 41:21.920
I don't know.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.160
It just seems like he has an eye for photojournalism.

41:24.160 --> 41:26.760
I mean, if we can find a way to get him out of here,

41:26.760 --> 41:28.360
I guarantee it.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.600
He'd be the second best camera man Ken's ever seen.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.140
Close one.

41:33.140 --> 41:35.520
But I mean, we gotta get him out of here first.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.880
I don't even know if we can.

41:36.880 --> 41:39.520
And here is the room that you're now in,

41:39.520 --> 41:41.400
this private room.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.320
There is a...

41:43.320 --> 41:44.400
Shrimp cocktail.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.480
One of those city things.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.720
It says out of order.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.560
Cow's nibbling on it.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.400
Wait, what?

41:52.400 --> 41:54.360
It says out of order on the shrimp cocktail?

41:54.360 --> 41:55.200
Right, it's like the arcade.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.100
It's a joke, it's a joke.

41:57.100 --> 41:59.800
It's like they have nice things but they can't use them.

42:01.640 --> 42:02.480
Cow's eating it.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.520
Also, it's broken.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.200
Yeah, it's rotten.

42:06.800 --> 42:07.640
It's not.

42:07.640 --> 42:09.040
It says out of order but this is really good.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.660
Roll a constitution.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.280
A 60 and a 60.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.160
Wow.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.220
Cow like stops for a second.

42:20.880 --> 42:21.720
It's good.

42:23.920 --> 42:26.440
The camera Fast and Furious style,

42:26.440 --> 42:30.000
like through Cow's body as if it's the inside

42:30.000 --> 42:31.280
of a car engine.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.920
We see different pistons firing

42:33.920 --> 42:37.480
and the nitrous is about to take off

42:37.480 --> 42:42.480
and explode into a blue and orange flame of ignition.

42:43.240 --> 42:47.080
And then we see that the stomach acids come in

42:47.080 --> 42:51.440
and put out the flames of this intense reaction

42:51.440 --> 42:53.840
that was about to happen inside of Cow's body.

42:53.840 --> 42:55.680
And there's like a little beach with umbrellas

42:55.680 --> 42:57.720
and the shrimp are like partying on it.

42:59.900 --> 43:03.280
But two of them are swimming

43:03.280 --> 43:05.840
without any sort of flotation device,

43:05.840 --> 43:10.360
which in the lifeguard's opinion is totally out of order.

43:10.360 --> 43:12.400
They're shrimp, they're from the water.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.400
The lifeguard would live in his stomach

43:14.400 --> 43:16.400
and so therefore it would want the shrimp

43:16.400 --> 43:18.120
to drown in his stomach.

43:18.120 --> 43:18.960
None of this matters.

43:18.960 --> 43:22.240
They got drowned by the stomach acid and dissolved.

43:22.240 --> 43:24.080
Cow yells to the voices in his head.

43:25.860 --> 43:26.700
What?

43:26.700 --> 43:27.520
What?

43:27.520 --> 43:28.360
No, I said that.

43:28.360 --> 43:29.180
You shouldn't eat those.

43:29.180 --> 43:30.020
Probably not.

43:30.020 --> 43:30.860
I think it's giving me weird ideas.

43:30.860 --> 43:35.240
The door opens and a tall stringy man walks in

43:35.240 --> 43:40.240
with stringy hair and he has handcuffs on

43:40.760 --> 43:43.680
and I mean immediately the CEO is like.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.200
No touching. No touching, yeah.

43:45.200 --> 43:47.940
He's like, do this like hugs for a little bit

43:47.940 --> 43:48.880
and then backs off.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.840
Hey, let me just hook him up real quick to the table

43:51.840 --> 43:55.640
and you see that he's gonna lock him in his handcuffs

43:55.640 --> 44:00.280
to a spot on the table and Burl Summers sits down.

44:00.280 --> 44:05.280
He's got stringy hair and you see three long singular

44:06.280 --> 44:10.480
strands of hair coming down from his chin.

44:10.480 --> 44:13.440
Oh, look, it's even better than the last time I saw ya.

44:13.440 --> 44:16.720
It's way longer and it's only been like a month.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.480
Thank you, Julius.

44:18.480 --> 44:19.800
Are you doing okay in here?

44:19.800 --> 44:20.640
Doing all right.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.200
I didn't expect to see you.

44:22.200 --> 44:24.860
Well, I didn't expect to see you either really

44:24.860 --> 44:28.800
but since I've seen ya, I got reassigned

44:28.800 --> 44:32.660
and I'm on the news now or I work with the news

44:32.700 --> 44:37.580
and we're investigating some pretty mild shit for you

44:37.580 --> 44:39.540
but it's pretty wild to me.

44:39.540 --> 44:40.400
Reassigned?

44:40.400 --> 44:43.380
Yeah, I'm with Diggory now.

44:43.380 --> 44:44.380
Agent Diggory?

44:44.380 --> 44:46.780
This is like my first thing.

44:46.780 --> 44:48.340
They didn't give me a break at all.

44:48.340 --> 44:52.260
Have you followed up with anybody else?

44:52.260 --> 44:54.260
I think I'm the only one that got out.

44:55.980 --> 44:59.400
Is Diggory keeping the path?

44:59.400 --> 45:00.980
For now.

45:00.980 --> 45:05.980
And both of you make eyes a little narrowed

45:06.220 --> 45:08.480
at each other like Luke and I just did.

45:10.740 --> 45:15.740
But, I mean, if I'm honest, I'm kind of with these guys now.

45:15.820 --> 45:18.260
Beck waves from behind the camera.

45:18.260 --> 45:20.180
Cal Colorado sticks a microphone in his face

45:20.180 --> 45:22.820
and he's like, Cal Colorado, City Action News.

45:22.820 --> 45:24.220
How do you like jail?

45:24.220 --> 45:26.820
It's not the best or worst place I've ever been.

45:26.820 --> 45:27.960
Remember the fog?

45:28.200 --> 45:32.880
Yeah, this is way better.

45:32.880 --> 45:36.720
Your son has an emotional goodbye to say to you.

45:36.720 --> 45:39.020
I mean, I guess we better make it quick.

45:40.440 --> 45:44.680
Officer, and he just like holds up his press pass.

45:44.680 --> 45:46.160
Could you give us a minute?

45:46.160 --> 45:48.520
Rolled bureaucracy or law?

45:49.680 --> 45:51.760
That's a 57 on a 60.

45:54.440 --> 45:55.800
Which one do you have 60 in?

45:55.800 --> 45:56.640
Bureaucracy.

45:56.640 --> 45:57.920
Nice.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.480
For being in the firm for you so, you know.

46:02.600 --> 46:03.720
Why would I do that?

46:03.720 --> 46:06.740
Cal, tell him.

46:06.740 --> 46:07.880
The news?

46:07.880 --> 46:10.160
And Beck is holding up his press pass as well.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.600
Yeah, so is Cal.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.960
The CEO just kind of has this look

46:14.960 --> 46:17.480
of befuddlement on his face.

46:17.480 --> 46:18.480
So does Cal.

46:18.480 --> 46:23.480
But with, you know, three confident Stevie holds up

46:24.440 --> 46:28.080
their pass behind you, four confident adults,

46:28.080 --> 46:30.200
telling them how things work.

46:30.200 --> 46:32.800
He's like, I need to read the fucking rules again.

46:33.960 --> 46:36.920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, and Stevie's his lawyer.

46:36.920 --> 46:37.760
Nice.

46:37.760 --> 46:38.600
That'll do it.

46:38.600 --> 46:41.320
And he nods his head, dips out of the room.

46:41.320 --> 46:42.160
Cal, that was great.

46:42.160 --> 46:44.400
I just wanted you to say the news.

46:44.400 --> 46:46.200
But that last thing was even better.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.400
Give him the shovel quick.

46:49.400 --> 46:50.640
I don't think this will work long.

46:50.640 --> 46:53.240
Here, I got a shovel in case you want to like dig yourself

46:53.840 --> 46:54.680
out or something.

46:54.680 --> 46:55.520
I don't know.

46:55.520 --> 46:56.340
And then here's a gun.

46:56.340 --> 46:57.400
You can have that too.

46:57.400 --> 47:00.280
And then, so basically we found.

47:00.280 --> 47:01.120
Keep one of the guns for us.

47:01.120 --> 47:01.960
Oh yeah, I got two.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.360
I'm keeping one, sorry.

47:03.360 --> 47:07.760
We found out Godel company is really bad.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.600
Like our level bad.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.200
Like really bad, dude.

47:11.200 --> 47:14.560
Like maybe shit we haven't ever seen before bad.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.720
Except maybe shit you've seen before maybe.

47:16.720 --> 47:19.400
Yeah, but like this is crazier in a different way

47:19.400 --> 47:21.240
instead of like, you got to kill it.

47:21.240 --> 47:24.400
This is a, you know, big thing.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.680
It's true, sir.

47:25.680 --> 47:26.520
They're bad.

47:26.520 --> 47:29.480
Okay, well, if it goes all the way to the top.

47:29.480 --> 47:30.300
All the way.

47:30.300 --> 47:31.400
Well, you got to get me out of here.

47:31.400 --> 47:33.720
Can you do anything about these handcuffs?

47:33.720 --> 47:36.220
Julius like looks over where the officer went.

47:36.220 --> 47:38.600
And if he's not looking, he just takes a shovel

47:38.600 --> 47:40.480
and slams it onto the chains.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.740
Julius, when you grab this shovel and slam it

47:42.740 --> 47:47.000
just a single time on the chain of this restraint,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.800
sparks fly off either side.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.720
And suddenly Burl Sommers is loosed.

47:53.720 --> 47:56.120
He grabs the gun on the table and immediately.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.280
Beck holds up his hands.

47:58.280 --> 47:59.500
Cal catches the camera.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.840
He drops the clip out the bottom of it,

48:02.840 --> 48:05.740
flicks one of the bullets up in the air off it,

48:05.740 --> 48:08.240
grabs it, slams in the bottom of the clip

48:08.240 --> 48:10.720
and then slams the clip back in the bottom of the gun

48:10.720 --> 48:13.400
and Beck I got that.

48:13.400 --> 48:14.240
Julius looks.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.080
That was so cool.

48:15.080 --> 48:16.160
Julius looks at the restraint.

48:16.160 --> 48:18.240
He thought this was going to be multiple batches

48:18.240 --> 48:20.580
to even possibly work.

48:20.580 --> 48:23.520
And he looks down at the concrete

48:23.520 --> 48:26.640
and looks at Cal and Beck and looks at his dad

48:26.640 --> 48:30.100
and just shoves the shovel down into the ground.

48:30.100 --> 48:32.260
When you shovel the shovel,

48:35.300 --> 48:37.920
when you shove the shovel into the ground,

48:37.920 --> 48:42.160
it moves through the sealed concrete

48:42.160 --> 48:44.960
like the most fertile land

48:44.960 --> 48:47.920
and you just shovel out part of the flooring.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.840
Holy shit.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.020
Everybody roll grip.

48:53.720 --> 48:55.560
55, critical failure.

48:57.160 --> 49:02.160
96, which I think is real bad.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.240
50, but a fail.

49:04.240 --> 49:05.680
So did you both crit fail?

49:05.680 --> 49:06.720
I crit fail you.

49:06.720 --> 49:08.440
Is a 96 a crit fail?

49:09.480 --> 49:11.800
Oh yeah, holy shit.

49:15.920 --> 49:18.160
I mean, this isn't the wildest thing

49:18.160 --> 49:19.880
after having seen what you've seen,

49:19.880 --> 49:20.720
heard what you've heard.

49:20.720 --> 49:22.160
It's also a shovel digging.

49:22.160 --> 49:23.200
It is a shovel digging,

49:23.200 --> 49:26.760
but it is a shovel digging at a wild.

49:26.760 --> 49:29.120
Through concrete like sand.

49:29.120 --> 49:29.960
Yeah.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.720
So Beck is going to lose one grip.

49:32.720 --> 49:36.160
Julius and Cal, you're both going to lose two grip.

49:36.160 --> 49:39.480
Julius pulls the shovel up and kind of like fake lunges

49:39.480 --> 49:43.240
at Beck and laughs and then starts digging again.

49:44.960 --> 49:49.120
Julius, my dude, that wasn't cool.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.200
It was a joke.

49:52.040 --> 49:53.240
All right, you got me.

49:54.160 --> 49:58.160
Julius, everyone is laughing after a joke.

50:01.760 --> 50:03.560
Julius looks at his dad,

50:03.560 --> 50:05.800
like, what did he think of that?

50:06.840 --> 50:09.320
Your dad is not in the room.

50:09.320 --> 50:12.440
The door is open and you see a slumped body

50:12.440 --> 50:15.800
of the CEO in the doorway.

50:15.800 --> 50:18.520
What is, what the hell is wrong with us?

50:20.800 --> 50:23.520
Are you fucking, I mean, yeah, come on.

50:23.520 --> 50:27.280
Okay, Julius offers a gun to Beck

50:27.280 --> 50:28.960
or offers him the shovel.

50:28.960 --> 50:30.680
Oh, I'll take the shovel, dude.

50:30.680 --> 50:33.600
Julius has the gun and is going to run after his dad.

50:33.600 --> 50:34.680
Whoa.

50:34.680 --> 50:37.760
Okay, Cal's going to motion for Beck to stay back a second.

50:37.760 --> 50:39.400
All right, Luke, leave the room.

50:39.880 --> 50:43.200
Oh my God, what the fuck.

50:43.200 --> 50:46.080
Beck is holding the shovel like American Gothic

50:46.080 --> 50:48.520
and the camera's under, cradling under an arm.

50:48.520 --> 50:49.560
What the fuck, dude?

50:49.560 --> 50:51.200
Are we accessories to this?

50:51.200 --> 50:52.800
All right, that's all on them, right?

50:52.800 --> 50:55.000
We didn't, did we abet this?

50:55.000 --> 50:57.080
No, and it's, no, I mean.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.560
We're just documenting the news.

50:58.560 --> 51:00.560
We just filmed what happened.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.880
We didn't happen it.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.960
We're bringing a human experience, a jailbreak,

51:04.960 --> 51:08.320
to, oh God, he gave him the gun.

51:08.320 --> 51:11.040
He gave him the gun back, then he killed that guy.

51:11.040 --> 51:14.880
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus.

51:14.880 --> 51:17.480
And Beck wants to throw the shovel to the ground.

51:17.480 --> 51:19.920
Does it do anything when he hits the ground?

51:19.920 --> 51:20.760
It burrows.

51:20.760 --> 51:23.720
Keeps burrowing, zooms out the other side of the earth.

51:23.720 --> 51:25.680
It doesn't keep burrowing, but it does just like,

51:25.680 --> 51:27.960
if you throw it into the ground, it's like.

51:27.960 --> 51:30.480
It sticks like a knife in the table.

51:30.480 --> 51:32.960
Exactly, like both of those things.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.320
Oh, what happened to the shovel?

51:35.320 --> 51:36.560
I mean, this is a whole fucking new thing.

51:36.560 --> 51:37.840
We didn't even have time to address it.

51:38.400 --> 51:39.240
The shovel's a fucking magic shovel.

51:39.240 --> 51:41.120
He always had this fucking shovel, you know.

51:41.120 --> 51:42.360
Like, I've seen the shovel.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.760
It didn't used to do this.

51:43.760 --> 51:46.720
Oh shit, I don't fucking.

51:46.720 --> 51:47.760
Wait, is that true?

51:47.760 --> 51:50.000
I ad-libbed that, but does that need to not be true?

51:50.000 --> 51:50.840
No, it's fine.

51:50.840 --> 51:52.520
I mean, even if it did do that,

51:52.520 --> 51:54.600
maybe he didn't show you that it did that.

51:54.600 --> 51:57.360
I'm imagining him like banging his shovel

51:57.360 --> 52:00.920
on shit at dinner parties, like New Year's Eve.

52:02.200 --> 52:05.000
Oh, well, I mean, yeah, he could turn it on and off.

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
Okay, I'm gonna get in front of the camera

52:11.760 --> 52:15.040
and I'm gonna state that we don't condone these actions,

52:15.040 --> 52:18.240
but we're here to document this unique.

52:18.240 --> 52:20.480
We're silent observers and we cannot interfere.

52:20.480 --> 52:21.320
Exactly.

52:21.320 --> 52:23.280
I'd pull up the camera and get it on you

52:23.280 --> 52:25.120
and the shovel is laying on the ground

52:25.120 --> 52:26.840
in the background of the shot.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.080
This is Cal, Colorado.

52:28.080 --> 52:30.320
Explosive development here at the city jail.

52:30.320 --> 52:35.320
Our, a can, oh, how do I say this?

52:35.320 --> 52:36.680
Stevie, you're the lawyer.

52:38.680 --> 52:41.680
Stevie rolls their eyes bigger than eyes have been rolled.

52:43.360 --> 52:44.200
How do I phrase this thing?

52:44.200 --> 52:46.760
But you can't see because the hair is covering it.

52:49.160 --> 52:52.160
We've just witnessed something extraordinary here.

52:53.440 --> 52:55.480
Something, something possibly,

52:55.480 --> 52:57.840
oh God, I can't call it extraordinary.

52:57.840 --> 53:02.840
It could be like extraordinarily a thing that happened.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.320
Yeah, like a miracle.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.160
No, that's, that's what we don't want to apply.

53:07.160 --> 53:08.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.680
Don't want to give it a good connotation exactly.

53:10.680 --> 53:14.800
He's, cause that, Stevie, could you go check on that guard?

53:23.280 --> 53:25.960
Stevie's just making these noises as they go over.

53:26.920 --> 53:29.520
Slowly check on the guard.

53:29.520 --> 53:31.160
First they, they did a check.

53:31.160 --> 53:36.160
They were not sure whether the body was breathing

53:36.280 --> 53:39.560
and then they did successfully do first aid on it.

53:39.560 --> 53:43.760
So if, if, if they're alive, they're stable.

53:43.760 --> 53:44.600
Oh, thank God.

53:44.600 --> 53:47.240
Okay, so he didn't kill anybody.

53:47.240 --> 53:48.080
Yeah.

53:48.080 --> 53:48.900
We would have heard the gunshot.

53:48.900 --> 53:51.400
Maybe, well yeah, they didn't get shot.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.840
He hasn't killed anybody yet.

53:52.840 --> 53:55.400
Okay, this is Cal, Colorado.

53:55.400 --> 53:58.760
Full disclosure, a CAN associate who will at this time

53:58.760 --> 54:01.200
remain anonymous has, has gone rogue

54:01.200 --> 54:02.640
in the middle of an assignment

54:02.640 --> 54:04.720
and broken their father out of jail

54:04.720 --> 54:08.260
or is actively attempting to flee prison jail

54:08.260 --> 54:09.580
with their father.

54:09.580 --> 54:11.360
We don't condone these actions,

54:11.360 --> 54:15.380
but we will document them for you, the people of the city.

54:15.380 --> 54:16.320
Let's go back.

54:16.320 --> 54:19.000
Camera goes down and Beck wants to go back

54:19.000 --> 54:21.280
and carefully pick up the shovel.

54:21.280 --> 54:23.040
I think, I don't think we should leave this behind.

54:23.040 --> 54:24.880
No, we, that's, we need the shovel, yeah.

54:25.280 --> 54:26.120
I'll take it.

54:26.120 --> 54:26.940
Sure.

54:26.940 --> 54:27.780
Okay.

54:27.780 --> 54:28.600
That's kind of your thing, you carry things.

54:28.600 --> 54:29.440
Yeah.

54:29.440 --> 54:34.200
And with everything else, Stevie pack mules the shovel

54:34.200 --> 54:38.040
under an arm, you know, with plenty of bag, a toe.

54:38.040 --> 54:39.720
Careful with the end of that thing, man.

54:39.720 --> 54:41.440
I don't really understand, like.

54:41.440 --> 54:45.360
And as you say that, there's a glint on the end

54:45.360 --> 54:48.320
of the shovel that you've seen a few times at this point.

54:48.320 --> 54:50.020
Stevie, be careful with that end.

54:50.020 --> 54:51.640
Well, yeah, obviously.

54:52.200 --> 54:54.840
And they turn it like sticks into a wall.

54:55.720 --> 54:58.920
No, it's not that, I mean, you threw it, you know,

54:58.920 --> 55:01.200
with a little bit of force in the ground earlier.

55:01.200 --> 55:02.020
That's why it stuck.

55:02.020 --> 55:03.700
But you've like carried it around.

55:03.700 --> 55:05.180
You've set it down on stuff.

55:05.180 --> 55:06.720
You do think back to all the times.

55:06.720 --> 55:07.880
Beck, you juggled it.

55:09.180 --> 55:10.020
You almost.

55:10.020 --> 55:11.000
I balanced it on the end of my nose.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.480
With the back of the stuff.

55:12.480 --> 55:13.320
No.

55:20.560 --> 55:24.560
Is this all gonna be part of the story?

55:24.560 --> 55:26.400
That's the great thing about journalism, Stevie.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.240
Editing.

55:30.000 --> 55:30.840
Yeah.

55:30.840 --> 55:34.000
Well, editing and we don't know what the story is yet.

55:34.000 --> 55:34.920
It's still happening.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.200
Choosing what the story is after the fact.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.240
I mean, sorta, yeah.

55:38.240 --> 55:39.600
Like this could be a hero moment

55:39.600 --> 55:41.240
if it all shakes out the way we want it to.

55:41.240 --> 55:42.080
Sure.

55:42.080 --> 55:42.900
Do you wanna do another take?

55:42.900 --> 55:45.480
Like maybe Julius is the hero?

55:45.480 --> 55:47.640
If that's like maybe a possibility.

55:51.920 --> 55:54.120
I don't expect that would be a possibility.

55:56.840 --> 55:59.840
Didn't he say a second ago that like the Godels were bad

55:59.840 --> 56:02.160
and then he looked at his dad and he said,

56:02.160 --> 56:05.560
like just as bad as the stuff we used to do.

56:05.560 --> 56:07.520
Did he say that?

56:07.520 --> 56:08.800
No, no, I thought he meant like.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.400
I took that into meaning like the stuff

56:10.400 --> 56:11.440
that they investigated.

56:11.440 --> 56:12.560
Yes, exactly.

56:12.560 --> 56:16.880
Meeting the criteria for their organization addressing it.

56:16.880 --> 56:17.920
Remember their X-Files.

56:17.920 --> 56:18.760
Yeah, that's right.

56:18.760 --> 56:19.740
That's a much better read.

56:19.740 --> 56:20.580
I like that.

56:20.580 --> 56:21.680
I'll go with that.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.000
Okay, let's get out of here.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.040
Yeah, let's go.

56:24.040 --> 56:28.880
I guess we just follow the trail of bodies.

56:28.880 --> 56:31.880
Well, we've only found, we just have a body so far.

56:31.880 --> 56:33.080
No, yeah, for sure.

56:33.080 --> 56:34.000
There's just one body.

56:34.000 --> 56:34.840
I'm just worried there's gonna be more.

56:34.840 --> 56:36.240
And he's stable.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.080
He's stable.

56:37.080 --> 56:38.160
No, for sure.

56:38.160 --> 56:40.040
And we could even call an ambulance for him

56:40.560 --> 56:41.400
once we get out of here.

56:41.400 --> 56:42.400
Well, we can, we should call an ambulance.

56:42.400 --> 56:44.280
Stevie, call an ambulance for him right now.

56:44.280 --> 56:48.480
I wanna say that like alarms start going off,

56:48.480 --> 56:50.480
but I don't know that's true.

56:51.920 --> 56:54.080
Right, maybe they've killed everyone in the prison

56:54.080 --> 56:56.680
by the time they're killed.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.940
Or maybe they just patiently waited around the corner.

56:59.940 --> 57:00.780
What?

57:00.780 --> 57:01.600
They're just sitting there.

57:01.600 --> 57:02.440
They're just sitting there.

57:02.440 --> 57:03.280
They're taking him so long.

57:03.280 --> 57:04.100
They're listening to us.

57:04.100 --> 57:08.520
They're like giggling to each other about it.

57:10.040 --> 57:14.960
Okay, you want us to get Luke?

57:14.960 --> 57:15.800
Yeah.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.160
All right.

57:17.160 --> 57:18.560
But we are, we are leaving.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.720
We are following where they were going.

57:20.720 --> 57:21.560
Yeah.

57:21.560 --> 57:22.400
Yeah, yeah, cool.

57:22.400 --> 57:23.560
You guys leave the room.

57:25.200 --> 57:26.840
Now leave the room.

57:26.840 --> 57:27.920
This is LARPing.

57:28.840 --> 57:30.840
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak.

57:30.840 --> 57:34.080
I didn't know that there was gonna be a jailbreak.

57:38.080 --> 57:38.920
So.

57:38.920 --> 57:43.920
So Luke, this is fucking awesome and wild.

57:43.920 --> 57:45.300
Julius runs out of the room.

57:45.300 --> 57:46.140
You run out of the room.

57:46.140 --> 57:48.480
You run past this body and you see.

57:48.480 --> 57:50.800
Is the body shot or?

57:50.800 --> 57:51.640
Not shot.

57:51.640 --> 57:52.480
You didn't hear it.

57:52.480 --> 57:53.320
Incapacitated.

57:53.320 --> 57:54.520
Currently incapacitated on the ground.

57:54.520 --> 57:56.140
Julius thinks about how cool that is

57:56.140 --> 57:58.120
and tries to really think about the training

57:58.120 --> 57:59.040
his dad gave him.

58:01.520 --> 58:05.320
And you see that dad,

58:05.320 --> 58:08.420
Pearl Summers, stringy man,

58:08.420 --> 58:11.520
stringy hair blowing behind him

58:11.520 --> 58:15.640
as he is dipping down this hallway.

58:15.640 --> 58:17.760
Makes it almost to a door

58:17.760 --> 58:22.160
and then you see him crouch down at the last second.

58:22.160 --> 58:26.860
The door opens and he flings his stringy body

58:26.860 --> 58:28.760
up into the air,

58:28.760 --> 58:33.760
wraps one of his legs around the security officer's neck

58:34.720 --> 58:39.080
and then spins this officer down to the ground.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.920
The officer is not moving

58:40.920 --> 58:45.140
and Pearl looks back down the hallway and sees you

58:45.140 --> 58:48.520
and turns and runs through the open door.

58:48.520 --> 58:51.680
Julius does like a little jump kick like kick ass

58:51.680 --> 58:55.020
and then runs to try to catch up with his dad.

58:55.020 --> 58:57.860
Just vaults the dead body.

58:57.860 --> 58:58.960
Roll athletics.

58:59.840 --> 59:01.240
Your dad succeeds.

59:01.240 --> 59:03.060
I succeed 20 on a 70.

59:03.060 --> 59:05.360
You're both hoofing it, hoofing it.

59:05.360 --> 59:06.200
Is this the way out?

59:06.200 --> 59:07.220
Do you know how to get out of here?

59:07.220 --> 59:08.580
Yeah, I've been planning this.

59:08.580 --> 59:09.400
Let's go.

59:09.400 --> 59:10.240
Fuck yes.

59:10.240 --> 59:11.260
Wait, pause.

59:11.260 --> 59:13.860
He holds you back against a corner

59:14.860 --> 59:19.860
and you see officers walk just around the opposite corner

59:22.200 --> 59:24.340
and then away from you down the hallway

59:24.340 --> 59:26.860
and then they turn right and go out a door.

59:26.860 --> 59:29.900
They were five feet away from you.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.380
You see that happening in your brain

59:32.380 --> 59:35.540
as you hear these officers approaching

59:35.540 --> 59:37.600
but you're gonna have to pass a stealth roll

59:37.600 --> 59:39.380
in order to make it a reality.

59:41.700 --> 59:43.340
34 on a 40.

59:43.340 --> 59:44.180
Woo!

59:49.900 --> 59:50.860
You still got it.

59:50.860 --> 59:51.960
That was incredible.

59:51.960 --> 59:52.800
Which way do we go?

59:52.800 --> 59:53.620
Where's the shovel?

59:53.620 --> 59:54.540
I gave it to Beck.

59:55.480 --> 59:57.000
And he looks behind him like,

59:57.000 --> 59:58.860
I thought they were gonna be right behind me.

59:58.860 --> 01:00:02.380
Hey, how would your dad react in this moment?

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.220
I'm trying to build your dad's sort of-

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.420
To us escaping?

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:11.140
To you not bringing the shovel mid-escape.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.080
If he was planning on using it, he's probably not stoked.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:21.300
You see the pain in his eyes and he goes, that's okay.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.380
Yeah, no, that's okay.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.600
Did we need it?

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.440
I figured you were-

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.260
No, it'll be fine.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.100
It'll be fine.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.260
We can go back and get it.

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.100
Nope.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.140
Probably fine.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.460
I mean, whatever you think is best,

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.540
we've just got to get you out of here.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.380
Okay.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.220
Alive.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.120
I mean, I planned this whole thing without it, so go.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.940
And then he dips around the corner.

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.740
Julius falls right after him.

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.180
You make it to another hallway

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:46.160
where there's an intersection of hallways.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.380
An intersection of hallways.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.140
People could be coming from either side.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.620
Do you know how to get out of here?

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.460
Yeah.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.460
And he points to the left.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.140
Is the left even close to semi the direction

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.280
that Julius thinks he came in from?

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.240
Roll intelligence.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.300
Crit pass.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.120
Yeah.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:10.960
That's definitely the way you can-

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.260
Okay, if you trust him, hundo P.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.420
He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's this way,

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.740
but we have to wait here.

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.620
He starts counting.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.500
One, two, three, four-

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.460
Julius holds up his watch in front of his dad.

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.500
Nice.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.500
Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.300
Julius is wondering if he's going to count to 836.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:46.740
When it gets to 400, you continue that thought.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:52.180
When it gets to 800, you're like, oh shit.

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.780
Is this really happening?

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:59.700
829, 830, 831, 832, 833, 834, 835, 836.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.820
And he grabs you.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.660
What does it mean?

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:10.340
And starts dipping down the hallway and runs.

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.180
Roll grip.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.260
Crit fail.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.460
What does it mean?

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.220
Shut the fuck up.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.100
And immediately alarms go off.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:23.980
Fuck.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:30.180
You see doors in the corridor on either side of you

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.500
with windows that are interior

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.300
and all their blinds were drawn.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:38.260
And when you scream blinds on either side of you,

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.460
just open.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.660
I'm going to cut back to them.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.500
Okay.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.500
Smells like weed in here.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.740
The alarms start going off.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.580
We were right.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.380
Okay. Yeah.

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.580
Probably bodies then.

01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.500
Okay. Fuck.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.500
We got to get out of here.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.820
We can't be here.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.220
We didn't even fucking ask him about the rat men.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.060
Fuck.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.220
Let's go.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.140
Yeah, let's go.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.100
I guess we'll follow their trail

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.060
unless we see an obvious way out.

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.460
This is from the camera's point of view,

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.580
like the horror movie running.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:20.660
Oh wait, shouldn't we just-

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:21.820
Oh, do you want to go back the other way?

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.260
Yeah, why don't we just go out the front door?

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.500
Yeah, we could do that.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.780
I mean, yeah.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.980
We'd learn less, but it's a lot safer.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.220
It's also the way that there might be people to stop us,

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.220
whereas they might've cleared the way ahead of them.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.300
That's also true.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.660
They might not just believe that we're not with them.

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:41.580
We could also be-

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.780
Because we are with them.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.500
But we could also be like not with them

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.660
and be like, help, help.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.340
Something crazy's happening down the hall.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.540
Do you think they're going to believe that

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.780
from Cal, Colorado?

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.740
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.140
Can you sell it?

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.380
You're right, dammit.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.220
I could sell it.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.100
That's right, Cal.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.340
You could sell anything.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.540
Okay, what do we think?

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:07.340
That's right, you could sell anything.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.860
Julius, or?

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:09.700
What?

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.060
Oh, that was a lazy shoe horn.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.820
This is a panic moment, Zach.

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.180
That's right, shit, what?

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.580
I was not selling you anything

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.540
when I told you to believe in yourself, Stevie.

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.020
That's nice.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.900
Now, which way do we go, dammit?

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.340
When you walk out of this room,

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.740
you see the green tape on the ground

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.620
that leads past the body that is slumped over

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.740
just outside of this room.

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.180
Do either one of you have a very high first aid?

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.900
No, just the 10 baseline.

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.500
Okay, not a clue.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:50.100
And then when you look down the end of this corridor,

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:53.860
you see that there is another body slumped by that door,

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:58.100
and it is face down and its head is to one side.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:00.540
Oh, it doesn't hit to one side like broken neck

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.380
or just like laying on it?

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.660
It could be laying on its stomach

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.220
with its head to one side,

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.740
could be broken neck with its head like that.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.300
Not sure from here.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.380
Pretty far down there, maybe 20 yards.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.460
But you do know you need to walk

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.220
at least like halfway down this hallway

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.420
and then go left before you get all the way down

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:20.580
to that next door to go back the way you came at least.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.940
I mean, you know, it's not a bad idea

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:25.500
to link up with like the two guys

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.380
who know how to deal with crazy shit.

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:31.300
We gotta go most of the way towards where they're going.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.500
Yeah, let's get to the juncture and-

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.580
Let's get to the juncture and then we'll-

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.260
Junction and figure it out there.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.340
Okay, guys, come on.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.180
To the junction.

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.500
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.140
Signs are still going off

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:48.180
and you see there are alarms on the walls

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:51.900
every 10 feet or so with lights that are just blinking

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.820
and in the distance you do hear

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.500
the kind of movement of officers

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:02.140
and as you make it down to the end of this corridor

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.540
you see the body on the ground.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.380
If you don't want anyone to roll first aid

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.460
as you walk by, go for it.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.340
Wait, Stevie, you were pretty good at this.

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.180
Yeah.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.060
Why don't you take a look at them?

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:14.700
They're dead.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.100
Oh, I rolled a 10 on a 10.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:17.940
Oh, shit.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.100
What do you think, Beck?

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.300
Hey, they're dead.

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.900
It's not good, my dude.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.020
It's really not good.

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.660
That's two deads then.

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:31.180
Yeah, at least one dead for sure,

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:33.500
but yeah, probably two maybe.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:37.300
I mean, maybe a criminal did it, a different one.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.140
Right.

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.380
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.860
Have we heard any gunshots?

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:41.700
No.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.520
With that first aid roll,

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:43.680
how did this guy die?

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.440
Did he get knocked in the head or?

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.480
His neck was snapped.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.320
Gotcha.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.920
Yeah, you were right about the neck snap thing.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.120
That's an awful way to go.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:50.960
Is it?

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.800
I mean, it might be quick.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.520
I don't really know.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.280
Maybe we should take his clothes?

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.860
That's the end of the episode.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.280
You can't just give your pocket pickles to any-

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.720
Yeah, I would never give this man my pocket pickles.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.640
Random stew on the street.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.360
I'm saving those for my daughter.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.600
Hi ho, silver away.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.680
Everyone loves daddy's pocket pickles.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.520
Oh, okay.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.680
Everyone feel good?

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.160
That one made me feel real good.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.240
Not since childhood.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.120
And it's all my fault.
