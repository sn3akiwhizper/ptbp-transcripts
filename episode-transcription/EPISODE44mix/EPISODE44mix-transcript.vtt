00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
What is up my dumpster dwelling hot dogs, it's your new home wolf the dog and I am here

00:06.720 --> 00:13.520
to slather y'all in various sauces while giving you the pleasure to hear my soothing voice

00:13.520 --> 00:17.980
before being digested into the endless void that is wolf's tummy.

00:17.980 --> 00:26.420
Oh and also we are hitting your eardrums live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:26.420 --> 00:32.120
This week's howlin with wolf comes from Mr. Sean Bailey who tagged at pretending pod on

00:32.120 --> 00:33.120
twitter.

00:33.120 --> 00:37.500
You should do that too my hot dogs, they write.

00:37.500 --> 00:44.100
Greetings and salutations wolf, long time listener, first time shout out her.

00:44.100 --> 00:50.580
I need to give props to my former ninja partner Carol R. Without her I would not have blessed

00:50.580 --> 00:57.300
my ears with the sweet sounds of 694.2 and the boys of the contention PD.

00:57.300 --> 01:01.700
So thanks for that, anywho keep on howlin my dog.

01:01.700 --> 01:09.100
Well Mr. Sean I'm happy to hear you've been enjoying the show but please wolf is no person's

01:09.100 --> 01:15.420
dog and I don't howl on command for any person who just tells me to.

01:15.420 --> 01:19.700
Not unless there's a dumpster full of sweet meat in it for me baby.

01:19.700 --> 01:24.040
Remember if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod

01:24.040 --> 01:29.280
on instagram or twitter, tag pretending to be people on facebook, or write a 5 star review

01:29.280 --> 01:33.340
and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

01:33.340 --> 01:39.120
Those iTunes reviews are apparently an absurdly effective way to get our nasty noises into

01:39.120 --> 01:41.960
more strange ear canals.

01:41.960 --> 01:48.700
Also the contest happening over on the subreddit ends at 11.59 PM central time on September

01:49.700 --> 01:50.700
23rd.

01:50.700 --> 01:55.380
All entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5th edition starter set and the winner will receive

01:55.380 --> 02:00.220
a hardback slip case set of delta green the role playing game.

02:00.220 --> 02:06.260
Check out all the hideously delightful entries on the thread at the subreddit r slash pretending

02:06.260 --> 02:08.260
to be people.

02:08.260 --> 02:12.860
Speaking of the subreddit, a few people there seem to have been paying close attention to

02:12.860 --> 02:15.040
the news.

02:15.040 --> 02:20.960
Last time, Clark unexpectedly shattered the aquarium in an attempt to save John Lee Pettymore

02:20.960 --> 02:26.040
who was trapped underwater by the unnatural forces of Marvin Glass.

02:26.040 --> 02:30.880
The two opened the door to Glass' office, unleashing a relentless surge of water that

02:30.880 --> 02:36.400
caught Keith up in its current before he was lifted out of the drink by Marvin Glass.

02:36.400 --> 02:41.660
The two of them, Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna, stood face to face with the head of the Glass

02:41.660 --> 02:47.300
crime family and he showed them a polaroid picture from the odd camera that depicts the

02:47.300 --> 02:54.140
two of them with Kevin in a world where everything is made out of darkness except the ground

02:54.140 --> 02:56.180
which is made of light.

02:56.180 --> 02:58.620
This is spinning out of control, y'all.

02:58.620 --> 03:05.620
The only thing keeping me steady is the repetition, baby, it is kudzu with no backbone.

03:11.660 --> 03:24.660
I don't want to talk too much up top on this episode.

03:24.660 --> 03:26.500
Yeah, I want to get right into it.

03:26.500 --> 03:30.140
But Thomas isn't here so I figured I'd share something he just said when we were in the

03:30.140 --> 03:31.140
kitchen.

03:31.140 --> 03:32.140
Okay.

03:32.140 --> 03:37.500
We were talking about Ed Kemper and Luke said, how tall was he?

03:37.500 --> 03:38.500
Six foot nine.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.500
And he had an IQ?

03:39.500 --> 03:40.500
Of 145.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.460
And then you said that'd make him a really...

03:43.460 --> 03:47.860
He could have been a really good basketball player and probably taught at MIT.

03:47.860 --> 03:53.180
Yeah, and then Thomas said instead he became the world's greatest skull fucker.

03:53.180 --> 03:56.020
Oh, goodness.

03:56.020 --> 04:00.100
Which is monstrous.

04:00.100 --> 04:04.740
And unfortunately factual.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.860
He should have just sacked up and kill fucked his mom earlier.

04:07.860 --> 04:08.860
Jesus Christ.

04:08.860 --> 04:12.140
That would have saved the lives of a lot of people.

04:12.140 --> 04:20.180
So let's dive into, dive into is an interesting word, is you're all standing on water.

04:20.180 --> 04:28.020
Luke, I don't think I described it to you, but your feet are standing on solid ground.

04:28.020 --> 04:29.640
So you're standing on water.

04:29.640 --> 04:36.420
So that description, I thought maybe there was just like a tiny puddle or no?

04:36.420 --> 04:41.140
No, you were standing on what you think you, what you started trying to swim through when

04:41.140 --> 04:43.420
all that water rushed into the hallway.

04:43.420 --> 04:44.420
Yeah.

04:44.420 --> 04:51.820
You probably got dragged by Marvin Glass, like physically, like up, up, like 40 meters

04:51.820 --> 04:58.420
up on top of the water and now you're standing there and he's just asked you what you know

04:58.420 --> 05:02.740
about this picture.

05:02.740 --> 05:09.260
After I would say a solid 10 to 20 seconds of just complete silence from Keith mouth

05:09.260 --> 05:10.260
agape.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.260
Okay.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.540
Actually, hold up.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.140
Some stuff happened before this.

05:14.140 --> 05:20.300
So Clark, Marvin pulled you down like the way that you moved last time.

05:20.300 --> 05:27.500
As soon as you made it to your final destination there, whip snapping into position, he immediately

05:27.500 --> 05:33.340
snapped and you just went unconscious and during that time when your eyes are open,

05:33.340 --> 05:39.140
you're just standing there, but nothing, nothing is seen from your end from behind your eyes

05:39.140 --> 05:47.220
and Marvin and Rosemary continued to discuss this picture and he's holding it up and he's

05:47.220 --> 05:55.740
looking at it and I just look at him.

05:55.740 --> 06:01.140
It's not, there's something I, you got to send me over there.

06:01.140 --> 06:09.020
You got to send me, I, I don't know how, but we got to figure out something, something

06:09.020 --> 06:15.100
we got to, they continue having this discussion that you're not quite privy to the information

06:15.100 --> 06:24.220
of all of a sudden Marvin perks up something in his lack of facial emotions, still twitches

06:24.220 --> 06:30.140
and he turns and looks up into the corner of the room up to where the elevator in the

06:30.140 --> 06:39.020
room next to his office, far above and far beyond the scale of this room, he sees the

06:39.020 --> 06:48.220
elevator door moving and he immediately holds out his hand and there's a, there's a confused

06:48.220 --> 06:56.740
look on his face when this creature arrives in his palm, his long fingers wrapping around

06:56.740 --> 07:03.420
a softball sized fish head with a human body attached to it that is the size of like a

07:03.420 --> 07:04.420
Barbie doll.

07:04.420 --> 07:05.420
Oh my God.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.420
And it was like, Hey, Hey there, sir.

07:07.420 --> 07:08.420
Hey.

07:08.420 --> 07:09.420
Oh gosh.

07:09.420 --> 07:10.420
I'm just so sorry.

07:10.420 --> 07:15.780
I don't know what happened last time that made, made you sure want to do that, but I,

07:15.780 --> 07:20.700
you know, it was a real interesting place that you sent me to there and, uh, I, I've

07:20.700 --> 07:25.540
never seen anything like it of this short and there was some, uh, feelings inside.

07:25.540 --> 07:36.420
I will say that you survive in that environment this whole time.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.180
And yes, yes, yes, of course.

07:38.180 --> 07:43.420
Well, you know, I, I just, you know, going to go on and go on and find whatever's next,

07:43.420 --> 07:48.220
you know, the next great adventure for old me, you know, now that I'm, uh, finally out

07:48.220 --> 07:54.300
there, you know, you know, got friends now and I've, I've, here I am talking to like

07:54.300 --> 08:01.700
the, I mean, I can't even imagine, you know, it feels like to be, to be me right now.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.220
It's just very nice.

08:03.220 --> 08:11.660
And um, as this conversation is happening, you see, uh, Rosemary just staring down, bearing

08:11.660 --> 08:22.460
down on this strange little fish fella and Harvin says, you know, I, I am looking.

08:22.460 --> 08:28.620
And he kind of looks over at Rosemary and looks back at Peter and he says, I am in need

08:28.620 --> 08:31.420
of a new number two.

08:31.420 --> 08:35.860
And Peter's like, Oh my gosh, a number two.

08:35.860 --> 08:40.740
Is that like, I can't even imagine doing anything of that short of nature.

08:40.740 --> 08:42.300
It's absolutely incredible.

08:42.300 --> 08:44.100
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

08:44.100 --> 08:51.540
I mean, and he looks over at Rosemary, who's just arms crossed, but Marvin's face once

08:51.540 --> 08:57.580
again takes a different shape and it's like he smells or feels some sort of sensation

08:57.580 --> 09:07.340
and immediately his hands move and out from the water come Keith Vigna and this scientist

09:07.340 --> 09:14.940
lady with the, uh, the white, you know, soaking wet lab coat and the, the hair maniacally

09:14.940 --> 09:18.620
going on on top of her head and the goggles.

09:18.620 --> 09:24.700
And as soon as she sees Peter Dieter, she's extremely, extremely happy to see him.

09:24.700 --> 09:30.260
And Keith, you looking around this room, you're not standing on this water, like I said, and

09:30.260 --> 09:32.460
you see these odd people.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.780
I mean, the situation is very strange.

09:34.780 --> 09:36.540
You've got Rosemary in this room.

09:36.540 --> 09:40.020
You've got Marvin Glass next to her behind his desk.

09:40.020 --> 09:46.220
You're next to Clark Bishop who is just now seeing you and opening like his eyes to the

09:46.220 --> 09:48.260
world.

09:48.260 --> 09:54.300
And you also see in like Marvin Glass's hand or maybe on the desk now is Peter Dieter sitting

09:54.300 --> 09:55.300
down there.

09:55.300 --> 09:58.380
And I said, Peter, I'm glad you're all right.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.620
I am glad that you're all right too.

10:01.620 --> 10:07.100
After the last time in our meeting, I thought, oh gosh, there's absolutely no way that he's

10:07.100 --> 10:09.420
going to make it much more than one episode.

10:09.420 --> 10:15.740
Like no doubt about it, what's your language?

10:15.740 --> 10:20.540
And Marvin reaches out and shuts down Peter Dieter.

10:20.540 --> 10:27.340
Peter Dieter just stares these wide eyes, these wide fish eyes and this tight lipped

10:27.340 --> 10:28.660
human mouth.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.940
And I need the both of you to roll a power check for me.

10:31.940 --> 10:32.940
Hmm.

10:32.940 --> 10:37.020
A fail, 60 on a 50.

10:37.020 --> 10:42.420
I also fail a 79 on a 60.

10:42.420 --> 10:49.100
I rolled a 42, which is a success against you and therefore when Marvin Glass asks you

10:49.100 --> 10:57.900
a second time what you know about this picture, you have to tell him like a compulsion inside

10:57.900 --> 10:58.900
of you.

10:58.900 --> 11:04.940
You must tell him, okay, Joe doesn't quite remember to tell me what I would know about

11:04.940 --> 11:05.940
it.

11:05.940 --> 11:10.340
I mean, it's, it reminds me of the place that I was with Maggie, correct?

11:10.340 --> 11:11.340
Totally.

11:11.340 --> 11:12.340
Okay.

11:12.340 --> 11:13.340
Other than that, I don't know.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.860
It also reminds you of the other picture, right?

11:14.860 --> 11:15.860
Right.

11:15.860 --> 11:16.860
That's what I was going to say.

11:16.860 --> 11:17.860
Oh sure.

11:17.860 --> 11:18.860
That we know where these come from.

11:18.860 --> 11:19.860
Yeah.

11:19.860 --> 11:20.860
Gotcha.

11:20.860 --> 11:21.860
Okay.

11:21.860 --> 11:22.860
Yeah.

11:22.860 --> 11:23.860
I'll tell him, Oh, they're there.

11:23.860 --> 11:24.860
Um, it's that camera there.

11:24.860 --> 11:26.700
And I point at it cause it's sitting on the desk.

11:27.100 --> 11:30.220
You take a photo and it shows you things that aren't there.

11:30.220 --> 11:32.580
And uh, I don't, I don't know.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.040
I don't know anymore.

11:34.040 --> 11:39.860
We thought they were maybe from a different dimension or from the past or something.

11:39.860 --> 11:43.100
How many pictures did you take?

11:43.100 --> 11:48.500
I turned to Keith, two or three.

11:48.500 --> 11:54.680
There was one with all the people with the torches and the old timey, uh, clothing in

11:54.680 --> 11:57.360
front of blackness, like a black building.

11:57.360 --> 12:07.200
And then there was another one of, uh, like a cowboy, like with his hand up to the camera

12:07.200 --> 12:10.520
and a guy with tribal tattoos kneeling in front of him or something like that.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.120
Say that again.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.360
A man with tribal tattoos?

12:14.360 --> 12:17.320
I believe I recollect that.

12:17.320 --> 12:24.480
And a man dressed as a cowboy or with a cowboy hat looking almost as if he's trying to block

12:24.920 --> 12:26.600
his face from the camera.

12:26.600 --> 12:30.360
You also said the name John Peters.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.720
We saw there was one with him in stocks, wasn't there?

12:32.720 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, that was, I think that was the first one, one of the first ones we took.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.960
And did, did he have fool branded on his forehead?

12:40.960 --> 12:41.960
I think it was in that picture.

12:41.960 --> 12:42.960
Yeah.

12:42.960 --> 12:48.200
And in all of them, that's, it's just like a black inky background.

12:48.200 --> 12:53.440
As you guys are having this conversation there, when, when you guys say that one of them has

12:53.440 --> 13:02.600
tribal tattoos, Rosemary perks up and you notice, and as you're finishing this conversation,

13:02.600 --> 13:08.080
you see she is eyeing the gun so hard.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.120
The tube gun on the desk?

13:10.120 --> 13:11.120
On the desk.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.560
And I like handouts a lot.

13:13.560 --> 13:19.040
I think I've given you guys a lot of handouts over, uh, over the years that we've been playing,

13:19.040 --> 13:23.240
but this is an audio format and handouts don't always work.

13:23.240 --> 13:28.880
And the way I typically use handouts is I hold them until you guys do something that

13:28.880 --> 13:31.240
would unlock the handout, right?

13:31.240 --> 13:34.480
In this instance, you have unlocked a cut scene.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.480
Okay.

13:35.480 --> 13:36.480
Whoa.

13:36.480 --> 13:41.080
I don't play video games, but this is a, uh, I didn't mean to sound so assholeish when

13:41.080 --> 13:42.480
I said that.

13:42.480 --> 13:47.960
I don't play video games, I live them.

13:47.960 --> 13:56.220
I don't waste time on frivolity, like desperately wish I had time for video games, but I work

13:56.220 --> 13:59.020
and go to school and produce this podcast.

13:59.020 --> 14:01.140
Fuck me.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.680
One day I'll play video games, but anyway, this is an audio cut scene of what happens

14:04.680 --> 14:05.680
next.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.680
Ooh, nice.

14:06.680 --> 14:16.120
Rosemary dives for the gun and as she grabs it, Marvin reaches down and flings the sphere

14:16.120 --> 14:19.360
off of the desk at her.

14:19.360 --> 14:24.880
Multiple shiny limbs extend from this small metal sphere and slam into the desk and the

14:24.880 --> 14:32.440
water below, giving it the leverage it needs to fling its silver round frame at its target,

14:32.440 --> 14:34.240
Rosemary.

14:34.240 --> 14:40.320
One of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of Rosemary's neck.

14:40.320 --> 14:46.520
Mother snaps her head forward and you hear the fracture as a third metal tendril reaches

14:46.520 --> 14:54.520
in gripping the top of Rosemary's spine where it meets her head and it rips her entire spinal

14:54.520 --> 15:02.560
cord out of her body in one swift motion, promptly forcing itself into the now vacant

15:02.560 --> 15:06.120
spinal column of this human being.

15:06.120 --> 15:13.540
The new Rosemary standing before you has a crazed look in her eyes as she blows her

15:13.540 --> 15:21.560
nose into her hand, slams the mucus into the empty chamber of this weird gun, and squeezes

15:21.560 --> 15:25.080
the trigger on the odd looking revolver.

15:25.080 --> 15:30.440
There is an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision

15:30.440 --> 15:38.000
and then, as if she had never been, the body of Rosemary is gone.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.480
I need you both to roll sanity for me.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.560
What the absolute fuck, Zach?

15:44.560 --> 15:45.560
I don't want to play anymore.

15:45.560 --> 15:46.560
I don't want to play anymore.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.560
I quit.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.560
I'm going home.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.560
Oh no.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.560
Oh no.

15:50.560 --> 15:55.560
I was stoked and then I wasn't.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.560
I rolled a hundred.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.560
Yes!

15:58.560 --> 16:01.800
I rolled all the zeros.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.120
I rolled an eighty-two.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.120
What was this on?

16:04.120 --> 16:05.120
A sanity check?

16:05.120 --> 16:06.120
A sanity check.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.120
I rolled over my power with an eighty-two.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.240
All right.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.720
This is very fun, guys.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.160
This is very fun indeed.

16:12.160 --> 16:16.000
So basically, I have this set up in scenarios that you write.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Oh yeah, hit me with it.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Real fast.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
She shot the gun.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.720
Was she aiming at anything?

16:20.720 --> 16:21.720
Nope.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.000
So like where was the muzzle pointed when it went off?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.840
As soon as she grabbed it.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.840
So it just like...

16:26.840 --> 16:27.840
Just pulled the trigger.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.800
Yeah, it was just like aiming at the back of the room or whatever.

16:31.800 --> 16:37.040
So when you write a scenario for Delta Green you write in these things that can happen

16:37.040 --> 16:43.000
and when the PCs come across them or see them you write like roll sanity and then you write

16:43.000 --> 16:47.980
how many sanity you take and a lot of them are zero slash one which means if you pass

16:47.980 --> 16:51.800
you take zero sanity damage, if you fail you take one sanity damage, right?

16:51.800 --> 16:56.100
But then other ones are like one slash one d6 or you know whatever.

16:56.100 --> 17:00.500
This one is one d3 slash one d3 plus four.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.500
Oh my god.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.500
Oh no.

17:02.500 --> 17:10.740
So, Joe, you're gonna roll a d6 and halve it and then add four to it instead of just

17:10.740 --> 17:11.740
a d3.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.740
Do you have a d3?

17:12.740 --> 17:13.740
No, you're right.

17:13.740 --> 17:14.740
I was about to roll a d4.

17:14.740 --> 17:15.740
Oh wait, yeah.

17:15.740 --> 17:16.740
I was thinking a d4, yeah.

17:16.740 --> 17:17.740
You can roll a d4 if you want.

17:17.740 --> 17:18.740
It's like triangle, three.

17:18.740 --> 17:20.540
You can roll a d4.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.540
So I rolled a four.

17:21.540 --> 17:25.340
Okay, so that's two plus four is six so you lose six sanity.

17:25.780 --> 17:27.420
What am I gonna do?

17:27.420 --> 17:31.400
You automatically take the highest amount of sanity damage so you're gonna take seven

17:31.400 --> 17:32.400
sanity loss.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.740
Okay, that puts me at negative one.

17:35.740 --> 17:41.820
Okay, Joe, where's that put Clark?

17:41.820 --> 17:44.260
That puts Clark at sanity seven.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.540
He still has a breaking point at six.

17:46.540 --> 17:47.540
Oh shit.

17:47.540 --> 17:53.580
So I'm fine, I'm just crazier.

17:53.580 --> 17:54.860
Oh my god.

17:55.380 --> 18:01.300
So, Luke, at negative one sanity, you really can't go negative, it's just zero.

18:01.300 --> 18:05.860
So typically in Delta Green you would lose complete control of your character, however

18:05.860 --> 18:12.360
I trust in you to be able to play a fully insane PC that I'm gonna let you hold onto

18:12.360 --> 18:20.460
that character and do whatever you want with him as he completely loses his fucking mind.

18:20.460 --> 18:26.040
Because we're in the endgame here, there's no point in having you bring in a new character

18:26.040 --> 18:28.940
when we can just make this one fucking nuts.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.760
Okay, I can do that.

18:31.760 --> 18:36.660
So you're going to always be in your most negative state.

18:36.660 --> 18:43.080
So you're gonna roll a negative 20 on everything and you are going to automatically fail sanity

18:43.080 --> 18:49.860
checks and you are going to always- Or automatically succeed them all.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.900
Yeah, basically, because everything is real, everything is good to you, whatever.

18:53.900 --> 18:59.460
And you also have that thing that happens when you roll sanity over your power.

18:59.460 --> 19:00.460
Yeah.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.340
You're gonna be that all the time.

19:02.340 --> 19:03.340
Okay.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.340
Yeah.

19:04.340 --> 19:05.340
So here we are in this room.

19:05.340 --> 19:06.340
Give me one moment.

19:06.340 --> 19:07.340
Sure.

19:07.340 --> 19:08.340
I gotta look up what that is again.

19:08.340 --> 19:12.980
Joe, just take off your headphones real quick and plug them ears.

19:12.980 --> 19:16.380
So it's that you get extremely paranoid.

19:16.380 --> 19:17.700
Okay, yeah.

19:17.700 --> 19:18.700
Yeah.

19:19.020 --> 19:24.660
Do you also want me to constantly be thinking, well, because I already think that I'm possessed

19:24.660 --> 19:25.660
by a demon.

19:25.660 --> 19:26.660
Oh, yeah.

19:26.660 --> 19:27.660
You're going to constantly.

19:27.660 --> 19:28.940
That's going to be a big part of it.

19:28.940 --> 19:29.940
Yeah.

19:29.940 --> 19:30.940
So that and be super paranoid?

19:30.940 --> 19:31.940
Uh-huh.

19:31.940 --> 19:32.940
Yeah.

19:32.940 --> 19:33.940
Sweet.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.940
Okay, Joe.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.640
So here we are.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.300
As soon as that happens, the light flashes and you-

19:41.300 --> 19:44.040
Oh, fuck.

19:44.080 --> 19:52.280
His Marvin Glass loses his fucking mind and then he reaches out and he holds on to everyone.

19:52.280 --> 19:57.600
He is straining himself to do this and he is just holding you all.

19:57.600 --> 20:05.920
You cannot move a muscle and then you feel as he kind of waggles his lack of eyebrows,

20:05.920 --> 20:13.000
you feel your jaws begin to unclench and your tongues begin to become loose and he rolls

20:13.000 --> 20:22.280
over his power check from earlier and says, tell me what just happened.

20:25.640 --> 20:34.480
I saw that gun one time before and it did the flash thing.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.480
I don't know.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.480
I don't know.

20:36.480 --> 20:41.720
You both failed your sanity checks and so you see the ground above the water where Rose

20:41.720 --> 20:48.840
Mary or the body of Rose Mary just stood, all this black shiny viscous sludge that's

20:48.840 --> 20:55.840
down there and seemingly inside all this muck is the placid body of Rose Mary.

20:55.840 --> 21:02.680
She is lying peacefully as her limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with

21:02.680 --> 21:11.340
the sentient mass of goop that is now sliding across the water and Marvin Glass reaches

21:11.340 --> 21:18.660
out at one of his hands and grabs it and flings it downward into the water below and

21:18.660 --> 21:24.120
you hear this noise that you have yet to hear.

21:24.120 --> 21:30.460
It's basically like, you know, like there's a certain kind of kitchen top, like a stove

21:30.460 --> 21:35.140
top kind of thing that when you turn it on, if it's like kind of broken, the noise that

21:35.140 --> 21:37.520
it makes gets inside of your head.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.560
You can feel it a little bit in your throat and like inside of your body.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.940
Do you guys have that ever?

21:42.940 --> 21:46.520
I've only had gas burners, so I'm not sure.

21:46.520 --> 21:50.920
I know that I was thinking you were like that, right, right, right, right.

21:50.920 --> 21:51.920
We used to have this.

21:51.920 --> 21:58.440
We used to have this broken one in the kitchen I worked in and when it came on, it made my

21:58.440 --> 22:01.880
throat tingle and it was just like a super high pitched noise.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.840
It was just this frequency that would break me as a person.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.360
You also do have the weird styrofoam thing.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.360
Oh, fucking don't say it.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.020
So it could be that, but I know kind of what you mean.

22:17.020 --> 22:18.520
I can imagine that.

22:18.520 --> 22:23.960
So that is the noise that you feel as he flings this into the water below.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.800
I used to get that with tube TVs.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.800
Is that what you're talking about?

22:26.800 --> 22:27.800
Yes, absolutely.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.800
Yeah, I feel you.

22:28.800 --> 22:33.320
It's that old fucked up electronic system kind of thing.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.320
You can kind of feel.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.080
I can feel it in my throat right now as we're talking.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.080
Makes me sick.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.840
It sounds like it affected you a little more than it affected him.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.880
Yeah, it makes me sick, I say.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.400
So he threw her body down?

22:46.400 --> 22:48.800
No, he threw the tube.

22:48.800 --> 22:55.280
After it had already kind of become one and turned into just this massive goop, this sentient

22:55.280 --> 22:58.560
mass that was no longer her, you know.

22:58.560 --> 22:59.560
All right.

22:59.560 --> 23:04.160
As that happens, he looks back up at you.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
What about that?

23:06.000 --> 23:10.160
Have you seen that before?

23:10.160 --> 23:23.840
Keith, with just wide eyes, I've only seen that goo one time before at the water park

23:23.840 --> 23:28.280
when it decimated two people.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.960
I saw it once before.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.520
It was seeping out of a picture one time.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.000
One that came out of the camera.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
One of the Polaroids.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
I saw it once then.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.080
I saw it then as well.

23:42.080 --> 23:47.200
But at the water park, I think I was the only one of us that was able to see it.

23:47.200 --> 23:50.080
Did you see it any other times?

23:50.080 --> 23:53.120
Did it take people when you saw it?

23:53.120 --> 24:01.320
Do you know how to contain it or is it running rampant through your city?

24:01.320 --> 24:04.800
To answer your questions, yeah.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.480
We know that it takes people.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.840
I don't know that I've exactly seen it firsthand.

24:09.840 --> 24:10.840
Maybe I have.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.320
I don't remember exactly.

24:13.320 --> 24:19.360
There was one time that me and John ran into it and there was a guy who was using a vacuum

24:19.360 --> 24:24.120
on it and that seemed to be working until the bag of the vacuum exploded.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.160
Who was this man?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.160
James.

24:27.160 --> 24:30.320
James who?

24:30.320 --> 24:31.320
Just James.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.880
He worked at the mill.

24:32.880 --> 24:38.800
The orifice beneath the two slits that make up his nose kind of gapes.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.200
So it's the mill.

24:41.200 --> 24:45.360
What do you know about the mill?

24:45.360 --> 24:49.040
Am I still under the influence of power?

24:49.040 --> 24:53.440
Go ahead and roll.

24:53.440 --> 24:57.360
Ooh, okay.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.200
He succeeds with a 97.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.080
Well, I crit succeed.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.080
It's a one.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.080
A zero zero.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.080
Oh!

25:05.080 --> 25:06.080
No!

25:06.080 --> 25:08.080
Is that good?

25:08.080 --> 25:16.080
No!

25:16.080 --> 25:22.120
You can tell him whatever you want and he is very, very convinced that you are telling

25:22.120 --> 25:23.120
him the truth.

25:23.120 --> 25:27.000
We don't know anything about the mill.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.360
We never got out there.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.360
Okay.

25:29.360 --> 25:35.000
Now tell me, what do you know about these spheres?

25:35.000 --> 25:40.600
All I know is what I just saw and what I saw in those videotapes.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.600
Go ahead and roll.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.600
Oh, actually, just kidding.

25:42.600 --> 25:43.600
You just tell him.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.600
You're so fucked up right now.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.840
Yeah, you just immediately tell him.

25:46.840 --> 25:51.440
He says, the videotapes and what else?

25:51.440 --> 25:52.440
I turn to Keith.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.440
Yeah, what videotape?

25:55.440 --> 26:01.600
With the researcher, the professor, whoever she is, I found...

26:01.600 --> 26:08.040
Yeah, I just showed him those tapes.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.840
He had never seen it.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.080
There's a room.

26:11.080 --> 26:14.280
There's a room in this building.

26:14.960 --> 26:22.320
Anytime somebody touches one of those metal balls, it does what it just did to her and

26:22.320 --> 26:27.240
they've got a room covered in blood and there were lots of videotapes.

26:27.240 --> 26:31.080
I just saw one of them, but I assume that's what happens every time.

26:31.080 --> 26:41.200
That's what she told me every time and I told her, I told her what we did with the silver

26:41.200 --> 26:43.280
ball that we had.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.880
Which is what?

26:44.880 --> 26:46.820
We had a bag.

26:46.820 --> 26:50.200
When we put it in the bag, it disappears.

26:50.200 --> 26:54.000
What do you mean it disappeared?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.160
It was gone.

26:55.160 --> 27:01.400
You drop it in the bag and when you reach around in the bag, there's nothing there.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.400
There's nothing?

27:02.400 --> 27:04.360
Just like out of nowhere?

27:04.360 --> 27:06.400
It was just nothing?

27:06.400 --> 27:09.200
The little fish fella says from the desk.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.200
Yeah, Peter.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.080
Whoa, that's amazing.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.560
That's so cool.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.800
You could just make anything disappear out of nowhere.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.800
Well, we didn't.

27:17.800 --> 27:21.960
I don't know if we tried it with anything else, but those metal balls disappeared.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.260
Balls?

27:23.260 --> 27:24.260
How many?

27:24.260 --> 27:26.540
I think we just did the one.

27:26.540 --> 27:29.320
You've seen more than one?

27:29.320 --> 27:30.440
Yeah.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.280
How many have you seen?

27:32.280 --> 27:39.200
I just think, and I look over at Clark, I just think we had two of them.

27:39.200 --> 27:48.600
One was in that woman's head, that disgusting body's head that I think maybe, I think maybe

27:48.600 --> 27:51.320
John Lee had that one.

27:51.320 --> 28:02.080
He said earlier that they took one of them spears out of this lady's head and that one

28:02.080 --> 28:04.840
of them held it in his hands.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.480
And Marvin Glass looks up.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.880
Is that true?

28:07.880 --> 28:12.240
Did your fellow officer hold this spear?

28:12.240 --> 28:13.240
Clark nods.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.240
Yes.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.240
Yes.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.240
I saw it.

28:16.240 --> 28:17.240
He held it.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.240
Where is he now?

28:18.240 --> 28:19.240
You don't know?

28:19.240 --> 28:20.920
The last time I saw him.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.100
Oh, that's right.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.740
He died.

28:24.740 --> 28:28.740
He was gunned down and ripped apart.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.240
Did you know that?

28:30.240 --> 28:31.240
Kinda.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.240
No.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.240
Kinda.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.240
Kinda.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.240
Not exactly.

28:36.080 --> 28:41.880
Now tell me, why was Kevin in this picture with you?

28:41.880 --> 28:44.920
You don't, you don't know?

28:44.920 --> 28:57.040
John Lee Pettymore, the man who held the spear, he was in Kevin's body.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.220
Marvin's eyes widen.

28:59.220 --> 29:01.000
So does Clark's.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.220
I thought, I thought you, I thought you had something to do with that.

29:05.220 --> 29:17.300
You're saying that your coworker on the contention police force is inside of Kevin's body and

29:17.300 --> 29:21.420
that he grabbed the metal sphere.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.580
That's what you're telling me.

29:23.580 --> 29:28.620
Clark, Clark nods again, but while he's nodding, can I look around this room and maybe down

29:28.620 --> 29:32.540
in the water beneath us, do I see Kevin's body anywhere?

29:32.540 --> 29:39.300
Well you do because Marvin just reaches out a hand and pulls the body of Kevin.

29:39.300 --> 29:47.540
And all of a sudden out of nowhere, the wet dead body of Kevin is in his hand in front

29:47.540 --> 29:48.580
of you.

29:48.580 --> 29:58.820
And with his other hand, he grabs onto the skull of Kevin and twists it open.

29:58.820 --> 30:03.460
In a smooth motion, like a perfect avocado.

30:03.460 --> 30:14.020
And as he pulls the head of John Lee Kevin Moore apart, sitting inside like the pit in

30:14.020 --> 30:22.940
a perfect avocado, you see a small metal sphere.

30:22.940 --> 30:29.900
Holy shit, says Joe, says Joe and Clark.

30:29.900 --> 30:32.260
Is there viscera or is it, oh yeah.

30:32.260 --> 30:33.700
Is his brain in there?

30:33.700 --> 30:34.780
His brain was in there.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.980
It was like split in half as well.

30:36.980 --> 30:37.980
Yeah.

30:37.980 --> 30:38.980
And the sphere was like embedded.

30:38.980 --> 30:39.980
Embedded in it.

30:39.980 --> 30:40.980
Was there a spine?

30:40.980 --> 30:46.420
Marvin Glass turns it over to one side so that he can hold the ball like steady with

30:46.420 --> 30:54.000
half the skull and then he peels down and just rips the body in half completely dropping

30:54.000 --> 31:00.580
the other half into the water and you see where a spinal cord should be, there is nothing

31:00.580 --> 31:01.580
there.

31:01.580 --> 31:02.580
What?

31:02.580 --> 31:05.260
Zach, if you don't fucking stop, I'm quitting.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.340
What the fuck?

31:07.340 --> 31:08.340
What does that mean?

31:08.340 --> 31:13.700
Keith is racking his brain since the cage fight.

31:13.700 --> 31:21.300
All the interactions I'd had with Kevin, trying to think of any, I lose no sanity because

31:21.300 --> 31:24.300
I don't have any.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.420
I don't know.

31:26.420 --> 31:27.420
Okay.

31:27.420 --> 31:33.620
Well, with this new information, I have a plan for the future.

31:33.620 --> 31:43.580
The two of you are on your way to give some heavy entertainment.

31:43.580 --> 31:55.900
So if I could answer any questions you may have on your way below ground, meaning death,

31:55.900 --> 31:59.620
you can ask them and I will answer.

31:59.620 --> 32:00.620
What are those?

32:00.620 --> 32:01.740
What are those balls?

32:01.740 --> 32:02.740
What are they?

32:02.740 --> 32:03.740
What, what are they?

32:03.740 --> 32:13.140
Well, as you know, I've been doing research and I have come to very few conclusions, but

32:13.180 --> 32:24.420
they are not of this realm and we are working to secure their destruction.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.260
Where do you find these?

32:26.260 --> 32:35.140
One was brought to me a long time ago by two men that I was seeking out that along with

32:35.140 --> 32:43.660
one other person stole something from me, but I got them.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.660
I got them all right.

32:46.660 --> 32:57.180
And one of them stuck around as my loyal bodyguard for many years, but he brought me my first

32:57.180 --> 33:01.060
sphere.

33:01.060 --> 33:04.980
And I have been doing research ever since.

33:04.980 --> 33:08.660
Was that, that was Kevin.

33:08.660 --> 33:10.420
That was Kevin.

33:10.420 --> 33:14.420
And he looks at the half body in front of him.

33:14.420 --> 33:20.220
But it seems Kevin was compromised.

33:20.220 --> 33:21.340
Who was the other man?

33:21.340 --> 33:23.220
I do not know.

33:23.220 --> 33:24.940
What happened to him?

33:25.940 --> 33:31.980
He perished in my need to gain knowledge.

33:31.980 --> 33:40.860
You see, when you break a man, oftentimes one of the easiest ways is to break down his

33:40.860 --> 33:44.180
ability to communicate.

33:44.180 --> 33:53.900
And when someone murders someone that they work with, they often recede into themselves

33:53.900 --> 33:57.700
and become malleable.

33:57.700 --> 34:04.140
If I forced his hand, I was getting what I needed to get.

34:04.140 --> 34:08.140
We're running out of time.

34:08.140 --> 34:11.500
You slung that silver sphere at Rosemary when she went for the gun.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.780
So you knew it did a thing.

34:13.780 --> 34:18.060
It tends to enter the person that it touches.

34:18.060 --> 34:19.820
But then she still shot the gun.

34:19.820 --> 34:21.060
It didn't work.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.060
Is that what you're saying?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.460
It didn't do what you thought it was gonna?

34:23.460 --> 34:33.140
Well, I maybe did not suspect that the entity inside would do anything other than try to

34:33.140 --> 34:36.740
kill itself as it normally does.

34:36.740 --> 34:44.180
Do you know anyone with tribal tattoos?

34:44.180 --> 34:47.380
That is one of my sons.

34:47.380 --> 34:51.220
That is Jermaine Glass.

34:51.220 --> 34:53.220
Cool.

34:53.220 --> 34:59.020
I had a feeling.

34:59.020 --> 35:07.940
He seems to be wherever it is that this camera and perhaps this gun are connected to.

35:07.940 --> 35:16.380
Have you any more information about this place, this other world?

35:16.380 --> 35:18.420
I have a little power for me.

35:18.420 --> 35:23.420
You son of a bitch.

35:23.420 --> 35:25.700
I pass 34 on 50.

35:25.700 --> 35:29.180
I pass a 45 on a 60.

35:29.180 --> 35:37.380
I pass a 72 on a 120.

35:37.380 --> 35:40.580
So the only way to beat Marvin is with a crit?

35:40.580 --> 35:43.940
Yeah, or you can roll over him and still succeed.

35:43.940 --> 35:49.780
If he rolled low enough earlier, I was like, how do you roll over 120?

35:49.780 --> 35:52.100
So I need you to answer that question.

35:52.100 --> 35:55.420
What do you know about the world that these take place in?

35:55.420 --> 35:58.960
What do you know about this other place?

35:58.960 --> 35:59.960
We don't know much.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.380
There's two other things like those.

36:02.380 --> 36:05.800
There's a radio and there's a helmet.

36:05.800 --> 36:09.420
The world of those photos though, it's perplexed us as well.

36:09.420 --> 36:14.820
The inky darkness around every figure we've seen reminded us of the goo, but we didn't

36:14.820 --> 36:17.300
know what that meant.

36:17.300 --> 36:21.100
We had somebody take a look at that one that had a bunch of people in front of a thing

36:21.100 --> 36:28.460
and apparently all the clothing was kind of mismatched as far as time periods go.

36:28.460 --> 36:29.460
We don't know.

36:29.460 --> 36:30.460
We don't know what that meant.

36:30.460 --> 36:39.420
You've never seen another place that has the dark sky and the ground that is made of light

36:39.420 --> 36:41.620
like in this photo?

36:41.620 --> 36:44.620
Uh, yeah.

36:44.620 --> 36:47.140
The old photos, we didn't see the ground of light, did we?

36:47.140 --> 36:49.360
I think maybe no.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.360
I think maybe no.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.360
Yeah.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.360
I think you've just seen it once.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.100
It was just in this particular picture of us.

36:54.100 --> 36:57.180
This picture and then Clark Bishop has seen it.

36:57.180 --> 36:59.700
Right, right, right.

37:00.140 --> 37:02.260
I've seen that place.

37:02.260 --> 37:03.260
I've seen where we stand.

37:03.260 --> 37:04.260
But I didn't...

37:04.260 --> 37:05.260
Go on, boy.

37:05.260 --> 37:06.260
Talk.

37:06.260 --> 37:07.760
I didn't...

37:07.760 --> 37:11.180
We weren't all there and I don't even know if I was there myself.

37:11.180 --> 37:14.180
It just was.

37:14.180 --> 37:15.980
I saw it.

37:15.980 --> 37:18.580
I've seen a place that looks like that before, yes.

37:18.580 --> 37:25.440
What were you doing when you were there?

37:25.440 --> 37:28.700
I saw something in it.

37:28.700 --> 37:34.020
There was a creature in that world there and there were people who were trying to keep

37:34.020 --> 37:40.900
it at bay and it scared me so bad that I...

37:40.900 --> 37:41.900
That's all I know.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.980
I don't know what that place was or what I saw.

37:44.980 --> 37:48.540
Do you have any last questions?

37:48.540 --> 37:50.540
Why do you want to destroy these?

37:50.540 --> 37:55.140
I thought for the longest time maybe you were trying to use them.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.500
Use, destroy.

37:57.500 --> 38:02.700
When it's competition you can do either one.

38:02.700 --> 38:05.620
Who's your competition?

38:05.620 --> 38:16.740
Power is my competition and greed is the contest and I will not stop until I have attained

38:16.740 --> 38:23.940
control over this domain.

38:23.940 --> 38:24.940
Last one.

38:24.940 --> 38:26.940
That's good.

38:26.940 --> 38:28.940
What are you?

38:28.940 --> 38:33.460
Ding, ding, ding.

38:33.460 --> 38:40.140
Clark Bishop, I am not from here.

38:40.140 --> 38:48.140
I am not one of you, but rather one of many.

38:48.140 --> 38:54.420
We are in control and we run things.

38:54.420 --> 39:00.180
However, from the bureaucratic standpoint, I was getting bored and ready to go out on

39:00.180 --> 39:02.020
my own.

39:02.020 --> 39:11.340
The government has so many rules, many of which are easy to be broken, however, I do

39:11.340 --> 39:21.740
not take orders kindly and I left them a while ago.

39:21.740 --> 39:28.460
And I have been battling Myriad ever since.

39:28.460 --> 39:30.900
Myriad?

39:30.900 --> 39:38.260
Marvin Glass snaps his fingers and the two of you go unconscious.

39:38.260 --> 39:42.620
Oh my God.

39:42.620 --> 39:46.340
Oh my God, Zach.

39:46.340 --> 39:48.300
Holy shit.

39:48.300 --> 39:52.740
You guys wake up in a small, cubic room, an armory.

39:52.740 --> 39:59.620
The metal walls on either side of you are covered in every type of weapon, armor, gadget

39:59.620 --> 40:01.880
and contraption imaginable.

40:01.880 --> 40:07.400
The wall in front of you has a doorway with a set of steps leading up.

40:07.400 --> 40:15.060
The wall behind you has a square window with absolute darkness on the other side.

40:15.060 --> 40:16.920
What?

40:17.440 --> 40:22.680
That's all just guns, stairs, and a window to nothing.

40:22.680 --> 40:23.680
And each other?

40:23.680 --> 40:24.680
Are we both there?

40:24.680 --> 40:25.680
And each other.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.680
I check my pockets.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.800
Do I still have my gun on me?

40:29.800 --> 40:33.080
Well.

40:33.080 --> 40:40.440
Here's the thing is that you are reaching for it and Clark Bishop sees this.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.440
Do I?

40:41.440 --> 40:42.440
I search myself.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.440
You have it.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.440
Okay.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.760
Are you looking for this?

40:47.760 --> 40:49.360
And I hold up the tiny powerful gun?

40:49.360 --> 40:57.700
I want to knock that out of his hand and head for the closest gun on the wall next to me.

40:57.700 --> 41:04.600
You do that and a cage appears in the square window and it's a cage that you would recognize.

41:04.600 --> 41:12.160
It's the cage that you've been in before and inside this cage is a man so massive that

41:12.160 --> 41:18.080
he barely fits and his muscles bulge and press against the inside of his cage and Oz

41:18.080 --> 41:22.400
Mayhem Wolf squeezes himself out and into this room.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.400
Hello.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.960
I see that we are.

41:24.960 --> 41:25.960
Oh fuck.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.960
I was just in Marvin.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.920
I was inside him.

41:29.920 --> 41:30.920
Hello everyone.

41:30.920 --> 41:31.920
Yes.

41:31.920 --> 41:32.920
Here's where I am.

41:32.920 --> 41:41.820
I am Oz Mayhem Wolf Oz Mayhem Wolf and I am here to I guess we are all fighting together.

41:41.820 --> 41:47.260
He runs excitedly to go grab his stuff and he grabs a pair of boots and some shoulder

41:47.260 --> 41:54.260
pads a football helmet and a pair of gloves and he he's all jazzed up and he's putting

41:54.260 --> 41:58.140
on all this stuff and he heads over to the stairwell excitedly.

41:58.140 --> 42:03.180
I call after him what what do you mean are we fighting each other or are we fighting

42:03.180 --> 42:04.180
something else together?

42:04.180 --> 42:05.180
I don't what's going on?

42:05.180 --> 42:10.780
I think we are going to fight as a group but you guys better prepare because time is running

42:10.780 --> 42:13.260
out and a timer begins counting down.

42:13.260 --> 42:15.260
What are we what are we gonna fight though?

42:15.260 --> 42:22.860
As the timer starts counting down water begins filling up this room from your feet up and

42:22.860 --> 42:24.940
you need to start grabbing stuff.

42:24.940 --> 42:26.140
I start grabbing stuff.

42:26.140 --> 42:31.060
I want you to come up with whatever you grab in between now and our next session.

42:31.060 --> 42:35.740
I'm going to give you a full week to decide what you're bringing with you.

42:35.740 --> 42:36.740
Wow.

42:36.740 --> 42:37.740
Okay.

42:37.740 --> 42:40.700
You can have pretty much fucking anything.

42:40.700 --> 42:45.860
You can have any sort of armor any sort of gadget any sort of weapon anything like that.

42:45.860 --> 42:49.460
Is there any chance that Oz looks back and says what we're going to be fighting?

42:49.460 --> 42:56.020
No of course not because that would be no fun whatsoever but I will say that a circle

42:56.020 --> 43:00.980
opens up in the ceiling above you at the top of the stairs as you guys all grab everything

43:00.980 --> 43:06.540
that you brought with you and head up the stairs and a disorienting amount of light

43:06.540 --> 43:12.620
and sound pours in and you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd.

43:12.620 --> 43:23.580
Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Jugga

43:23.580 --> 43:31.540
Oh my goodness I cannot wait to be brainstorming oh my god I've been waiting a year for this

43:31.540 --> 43:36.460
holy shit dude what the fuck I'm like so stoked wait so we

43:36.460 --> 43:40.980
when we woke up in this room did we feel anything in what way if we lost consciousness

43:40.980 --> 43:45.740
did we wake up like it's weird you've actually been healed up to full health for some reason

43:45.740 --> 43:50.020
well that's not what I meant but that's fucking awesome I kind of meant that I like like did

43:50.020 --> 43:55.540
we feel like we had been like knocked out or whatever yeah like some sort of some sort

43:55.540 --> 44:02.140
of immediate sleep like you just became in this other place you just came all over it

44:02.340 --> 44:06.540
did we did we really get all the hit points back yes you're fully healed and ready to go

44:06.540 --> 44:14.180
as Keith hears this the screams from the crowd I look at Clark and say planet juggernaut I

44:14.180 --> 44:22.540
barely knew her not we got to pull the comedy tag off this

44:32.860 --> 44:43.300
so we've been playing a closed game which means that we leave the room when the PC is not there

44:43.300 --> 44:48.940
that way you can keep secrets from each other and stuff however the next episode is going to be

44:48.940 --> 44:56.420
this is gonna be kind of apparent so I figured I'd let you guys be in the room for this scene

44:56.420 --> 45:09.300
with John Lee Pettymore as we lead out of this episode so John Lee Pettymore in a dark room lit

45:09.300 --> 45:18.180
by various electronics and machines we see a massive shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with

45:18.180 --> 45:25.180
silvery arms extending from either side a tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below

45:25.300 --> 45:32.580
the machine begins whirring and we see a small metal sphere roughly one inch in diameter begin

45:32.580 --> 45:41.700
moving up through the tubing into the larger armed version of itself as this happens you

45:41.700 --> 45:50.780
John Lee Pettymore feel alive again you feel your consciousness extend itself throughout your new

45:50.780 --> 45:58.540
body this colossal monument to destruction a vast circle opens up in the ceiling above you

45:58.540 --> 46:05.700
and it's disorienting amount of light and sound pours into this dark room revealing text painted

46:05.700 --> 46:11.860
on the back wall that says the same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd

46:20.780 --> 46:45.060
I give my new hands a tentative like punch together kind of dig in what the fuck sorry

46:45.060 --> 47:03.620
boys but looks like y'all about to get juggernaut I can't I can't wait to kill

47:15.060 --> 47:25.180
try

47:45.060 --> 47:55.260
you
