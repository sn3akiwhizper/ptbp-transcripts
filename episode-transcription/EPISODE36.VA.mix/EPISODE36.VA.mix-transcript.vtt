00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello, my babies, and hello to my babies' babies.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.680
Heck, even hello to those babies' babies.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.080
Let's just get wild, y'all.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.760
It's your local radio DJ

00:13.760 --> 00:18.580
that you actually wanna listen to, Wolf the Dog.

00:18.580 --> 00:22.400
This week, I have a message here from my producer.

00:22.400 --> 00:26.160
It says, Zach and Taylor are on vacation.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.480
He's real torn up about it,

00:28.520 --> 00:31.000
but there just wasn't enough free time this week

00:31.000 --> 00:33.700
to release an episode that is up to snuff.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.500
For this, he feels shame, regret,

00:36.500 --> 00:39.320
and just a tinge of arousal.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.300
He wants each and every one of you

00:41.300 --> 00:43.300
to know how special you are,

00:43.300 --> 00:46.040
but quality time with the incomparable,

00:46.040 --> 00:49.600
and formidable love of his life is paramount.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.960
Thank you deeply for understanding.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.320
You know, back in the day, old Wolfie Boy

00:56.320 --> 00:58.760
used to have a little old Wolfie partner

00:58.760 --> 01:01.040
that he would have missed the show for.

01:01.040 --> 01:03.840
I still dream of her sometimes,

01:03.840 --> 01:06.880
wondering what she's up to back in contention.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.160
How many dumpsters has she dove in without me?

01:10.160 --> 01:13.220
What if they're with some other new dog that ain't wolf?

01:13.220 --> 01:15.920
So go on, Zach, whoever the hell that is.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.440
Enjoy your life.

01:17.440 --> 01:21.580
Eat all the trash you can, baby.

01:21.580 --> 01:24.800
Next week is going to be a wild ride, y'all,

01:24.800 --> 01:26.760
but for now, hold on tight

01:26.760 --> 01:29.640
and keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.320
Playing us in and immediately out

01:32.320 --> 01:36.240
is Kudzu with No Backbone.

01:36.240 --> 01:52.240
["How Am I the Only One Trying to Pull Over?" by Kudzu playing in the background.]

01:52.240 --> 01:59.960
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

01:59.960 --> 02:10.760
How can you have enough drowning out all the noise?

02:10.760 --> 02:22.960
There's nobody home, no one home, no one home.

02:22.960 --> 02:29.960
Fight to fight, street me down, takes me back to where you're from.

02:29.960 --> 02:40.960
When you don't stop a dying love, don't push on to only one.

02:41.960 --> 03:00.960
There's nobody home, no one home, no one home, no one home.

03:00.960 --> 03:26.960
["How Am I the Only One Trying to Pull Over?" by Kudzu playing in the background.]

03:27.240 --> 03:30.960
Tell me it hurts.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.960
Tell me it hurts.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.460
Tell me it hurts.

03:38.460 --> 03:42.960
Tell me it hurts.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.560
Tell me it hurts.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.960
Tell me it hurts.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.940
Tell me it hurts.

03:53.940 --> 03:56.940
Tell me it hurts.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.420
Tell me it hurts.

04:02.420 --> 04:05.920
Tell me it hurts.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.920
Tell me it hurts.

04:09.920 --> 04:14.920
Tell me it hurts.

04:26.940 --> 04:31.940
Tell me it hurts.
