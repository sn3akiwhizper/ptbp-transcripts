Yeah So we are here with a very specific purpose and we're gonna jump right into it because I am itching Oh All over my body to play this game like I'm Ray Charles. So let's begin Right now It's the first week of January in the year of your choosing 2020 wait you choose 2020 I choose 2020 I'm gonna do 78 does that mean as federal agents were fully aware of the looming? coronavirus threat as Federal agents you would be but just know that the civilians on the ground have no idea what's coming So you need to get your like financials in line now that way You can do better than the people who don't have knowledge an apocalyptic ice storm struck LaFontaine, Missouri on January 2nd an Extreme cold front from the Northeast caused a 30 degree drop in ground temperature over a matter of hours simultaneously humidity reached a hundred percent and a thunderstorm Blanketed the region the rain already barely above freezing coated everything in layer upon layer of ice Roofs collapsed under four inch sheets trees exploded as SAP flash froze in the trunks transformers shorted out and fell flaming from their posts Cars not crushed by falling debris skidded off impassable roads or froze up Flights in and out of the area were canceled the governor declared the city a disaster area But the ice and continuing winter weather prevented dispatch of services inside LaFontaine a mothballed green box a Storage facility rented by the conspiracy in the old days sent a silent alarm to Delta Green on the night of the storm the contents of the box were never inventoried after the organizational restructuring in 2001 and Friendly caretaker on site is not responding Delta Green doesn't know what caused the breach or what potential threats might now be in the field and they need eyes on the ground your eyes the nearest available operatives the players agents your Characters each get a call from a known Delta Green case officer the afternoon of January 5th The call comes in the unusual way in the usual unusual way From one of the half dozen numbers arranged ahead of time But which frequently change the caller did his best or her best to sound like they were Confirming an ordinary dinner or business meeting. They gave a time and place a private TSA conference room at Lambert Airport, st. Louis, Missouri 1145 p.m. That night it was up to each agent to make personal arrangements and get a last-minute flight to Lambert now I'm gonna get an introduction from each one of you and because we're playing a closed game I'm gonna have everyone else take off their headphones while we're recording each person's Introduction because there might be some stuff in the introduction that you don't want the other players to know and that's completely fine as your Delta Green agents, you won't know each other's identities because we're playing along the the actual rules is written Delta Green strategy So if you actually do learn information about each other I will probably have it come back to bite you at the end of the scenario because that's what happens with knowledge you get burnt okay, so Let's start. Let's go alphabetical order. So that begins with Joe already everybody else take your headphones off and we'll do how about I you can also deafen the chat or Defen the call. Okay, whatever works as long as you're not listening and And when you are Wanted back Justin's not like oh, he's listening to his character voice. He's trying to get in character. I love it so, uh, whenever we want you back, we'll we'll do the the the classic bomb banana Making a birds with your hands a bird single bird not multiple birds two birds follow. How will you know which oh I guess it's just your duty to know out the alphabet, which is cool with me Yep, duties and alphabets, baby. Everybody stop listening now, and it'll just be me and Joe Hello Joe hi Zach What's up, baby? What's cracking? You ready to do this? I am I'll just start. Yeah. Yes, please. I'm playing agent Wentworth Some of you might remember that I've played this character before You might not have gleaned from that last time though that he is a hitman he's a straight-up hitman He he goes he jet-sets around killing folks For the government for whoever because It's he just responds to his handler miss Turner who he's been with forever for as long as he can remember and He just drops everything at the at the drop of a hat to do whatever she asks. I Specifically asked Joe to play this character or at least like persuasively suggested it Yeah, for sure. You liked it and I was like, I loved it It was like one of he was one of my favorite characters we've had on the show. Sorry to interrupt carry on So he got the call from miss Turner and That said that he needed to report to Lambert Airport in st. Louis by 1145 she went ahead and arranged for the tickets and left me a credit card and $500 in cash and we also since this is kind of our thing. She has these custom-made carry-ons that hold Two pistols for him and she left all that at a dead drop for me and I just went on straight to the airport but before I left I Told the landlord of my apartment building that I needed him to look after the cat for me And he asked why and I said I was gonna go and assess the situation in La Fontaine, Missouri Because I had deduced that that would be the only reason they would send me to st Louis, Missouri during one of their Worst natural disasters ever and I've always felt like a little bit of the truth helps to sell a lie That seems like a big part of the truth There's they're sending me there to assess something that's all I said And let's see what else was there the oh Yeah, as I was walking out the door, I remember that they're in the middle of an ice storm So I grabbed a really nice thick black pea coat and a wool stocking cap because I thought things might get chilly And indeed it's gonna start really fucking cold Middle of an ice storm. So that makes sense. Shall we bird? Shall we make our bird hands together? Oh Yes They're not watching. You can see it and they love it They all love it so much Justin's Justin's on it. He's on it. He's got you can all tell what's happening. Well, thankfully Justin Exactly. All right, I'm out. Bye Joe And hello Justin Hey, what's up? How is it going, man? It's gone pretty damn good here in the Ozarks You're playing my character is not Okay, interesting. So I don't know why I was doing that fun time voice, but you know My character's name is William T Wiggins he is a coroner in a small town in Illinois, so someone close to The East border with st. Louis. I'm gonna assume not too far He's a short and pale Lad with black hair like like jet black hair I Almost like to imagine like a middle part but like a handsome middle part like it looks better than the the normal one very sleepy Very sleepy looking thousands middle part. Yeah, like very sleepy with bags under his eyes Seems to always have his mouth covered by a scarf or a mask or shirt collar, etc He is always wearing a really nice suit even when he's doing his coroner duties and black leather gloves when he's not habits when he doesn't have the The medical gloves on he's very strange, but also quite good at his job All right, and what did you bring with you here on this this trip to st. Louis? So I had a handful of things I was gonna bring and let you Veto some of them if you want to hit me with him also, what's your last name again real quick Wiggins William T Wiggins, how could I forgot Billy Wiggins? Is that a person did I fuck up and make him a person? Oh, you're just making fun of his name. He doesn't like when people call him Willie, by the way, so I Won't let him know that you did that cuz you're an omnipresent God in this world That's really cool of you But just know that you're gonna somewhere deep down inside of your character and know that God I So I wanted to have like surgical masks and gloves Leather gloves a scarf magnifying glass First aid supplies of some kind I didn't know if those are allowed Do you think a scalpel would technically be allowed on a plane? If you were like, I'm a coroner it's a tool for me or is it too knife like Hmm I bet you're not allowed to Unless it's in your but you you could probably put it in your like checked luggage I don't know. Let's say I did that because I'm a coroner So I figured I'd have some kind of cutting instruments like a lighter and some cigarettes like a little zippo lighter and also A necklace where like if he dies It brings him back to life and also there's a big gun that he can grab from another dimension and It does all it does to deep 30s of damage But I'm glad you let me have the necklace I Does he have a necklace no, he's just for sentimental value do is he a corner with a chain? Like a sick chain Parted parted hair. How old is this? I said 42 early 40s Yep, I mean, I love the idea of him with like a cheap sterling silver chain around his neck just listening to nu metal Hell yeah, that's up to you That's if you want that Also, he's he's a five foot seven. He's a shorter shorter than the average human bear All right, and did you say goodbye to anybody? Did you have to cover? Yes, I did Whenever I got the call William was in the morgue doing his work slicing up bodies and whatnot When he got the call, I'm assuming it was probably in the middle of the night he dropped something into a cadaver and Looked over to his assistant and said well, well Thaddeus I shall be leaving now There's a personal familial emergency. I must see to Please take care of this any points inside of the corpse Mishap I'm sure you shall be rewarded Handsomely also, I don't know why we're cutting into this corpse Clearly he has been shot in the head multiple times and then he walks away from Thaddeus his only friend Thaddeus has seen this happen before or Thaddeus knows I'm just like super weird and I Do kind of whatever I'm very like on a whim. I'll just leave on a whim. I'll just leave And so Thaddeus is used to me being kind of like wishy-washy and just kind of like I'm having a bad day I I must retire and we've been working together for I'm gonna say like at least a year now and so he He's used to me. Just kind of like getting getting weird about stuff and leaving but I'm good at my job. So he's like It's like a TV character when it's like oh, he's a detective who's super weird, but he's so damn good. We can't help it We have to keep hiring him like monk Classic example But yeah, so yeah Thaddeus is the shilube Thaddeus always has Williams back because William is quite nice to him even though he's super weird and and He's kind of like a treats him like kind of like a son in a weird way Okay, fantastic Anything else that we should know before we jump in Oh also Interesting side fact that I came up with before this while I was creating the character He is a I decided he is a in his off time. He likes to do fencing Naturally So you got to put points in melee weapons. He's like weirdly athletic for a a Guy who is a coroner it but it's the only like sport. He likes his fencing He thinks like everything else is stupid and not for smart people because he sucks Yeah, it seems like a super cool dude who I would beat super into hanging out with. Yeah Perfect Or are you trying to make fun of my character no No, no, I would never shall we shall we fly the birds? Shall we fly the bird for Luke? look boy Okay boy To join us to chew Is he here is it here can I leave now Justin get the ball Oh Luke tell me about your character Turn your microphone on Mmm, I was on mute.

Yeah, I use the the excellent That there's a resource online you can find it on the subreddit or just Google Delta green character generator or pre generated characters that had they just have 900 whole That's incredible. So I Wanted to be a federal agent There were literally dozens of those filled out So I just found the one with kind of the high stats I wanted and went with that beautiful. So yeah, I'm I'm an agent Jason McNear If it's not your real name. Yeah, that's that's my real name code name lighthouse And I'm sorry if you already have any uptight by the book agent characters I haven't been able to hear what other people were yet, but that's pretty much what my guy is, but he can uptight FBI Oh, yeah special agent Jason McNear. Are you that? Yeah, you know what? I spent a lot of time Googling realistic firearms for an FBI agent to have and I didn't I didn't spend any time looking up What is realistic position in the hierarchy might be? Why don't why don't I check that out and I'll get back to you I'm going a little too Irish now Yes, so you're gonna be playing a fee a FEMA oversight personnel like a suit so Are you going with mr. Lighthouse? Oh I've gone totally Irish now and I can't go don't you know, you just go up north in there over there like that They're over. Yeah Fargo. Okay No, I'm I'm uh, that's just my Delta green Codename and okay, I think I'll go with With mr. Smith Oh, mr. Smith. Oh Yep, hey Irish, okay, so mr. Smith needed to make his way to st. Louis by 11 45 p.m That night who did he have to make excuses to on the way there mrs. Smith, you know She's kind of I I am a federal agent she's used to it Irish she's you don't call it out. You know do it incredibly. I'm going okay. Hold on It just has to be just a little bit more upper Midwest. So Then I then my normal voice so So he excused himself to her and Years ago. She thought he was maybe like having an affair On one of these like he would he had to bust out every night at like 10 p.m She ended up following him and she saw him sitting with like she staked out him and his partner staking out Just a boring like Financial crimes like stakeout and she saw him like sadly eating junk food and she knows he hated Like he hated his partner at that time Bummer that like big not like they couldn't work out but like they they solved this. They got the job done man, but like Sitting in a car all night with him was not his cup of tea so she he what she watched him do that a few times and A few times. Well, yeah, she's got it. She's got an investigative personality just like him. Oh Yeah, they're they're detectives in both paranoid Well, I wouldn't go that far, you know, I mean sorry codependent. Yeah, I mean That's what that's what you need, right? someone you Do people who can depend on each other? Yeah, it's a nice thing. Yeah, I don't see what's wrong with that So, what did you bring with you on the trip to St. Louis well Even though he's a very mid-ranged Shootist if you had to quantify, you know, but he has he has taken up skeet shooting recently Oh cool, and he's as an FBI agent. He's already TSA pre-checked and all that shit But he is like he's got his Hold on. I pulled up the regulations He's got his unloaded shotguns and a locked hard-sided container as checked and declared luggage Wow Well done The container is completely secure The firearm cannot be accessed because obviously locked cases that can be easily opened are not permitted. Sure. So he's got two Two skeet shooting Shotguns. Oh, yeah in a hard case Damn, that's intense. And you I assume you have just your regular federal agent service. Yes. He has a nine millimeter Glock Okay Do you know what that means? Yeah, they The trend in law enforcement apparently has been to go Towards a lighter more high-capacity automatic pistols Here's a here's a chilling sentence While some law enforcement agencies have transitioned to larger calibers from the nine millimeter in recent years they do so that the expense of reduced magazine capacity more felt recoil and given adequate Projectile selection no discernible increase in terminal performance No, thank you. That just means Higher caliber weapons are harder to fire because they kick on you So the stopping power that like might make you feel psychologically good with them Isn't really as good as having a pistol you can shoot rapidly and accurately in terms of disabling someone Wow or terminal performance as they sure Turn it Wow, that's fun. So of course, he's got his nine millimeter Glock All right anything else That'll do that'll do just guns. A lot of people brought just guns. Oh Well, yeah, he's got I mean anything he knows what he's meant He's got He's got a parka He's got a good I'll let you explain. Well, all right, I mean having heard my accent, you know, he's prepared for Oh for the cold weather For sure old weather. Are you ready to give him the the birdie? Yes How do we get Luke's attention he's asleep Luke asleep No, I think he's just asleep Oh here he comes I'm really self-conscious that you guys talked for way longer than I did Baby baby was asleep in there. He's back home Stop practicing your character voice. It's horrifying I'm from Illinois Oh Dude did you keep going weird with your accent to I Was trying to do an upper Midwest and I kept going wicked Irish. Oh, yeah. No mine. I already forgot Well, mine was so I'm gonna have to remember When I talk next TSA agents at Lambert, which is the airport in st Louis allow the agents into the conference room inside is a balding man in his early 50s with a heavy pond And deep circles under his eyes. He does not offer his name here But the agents know him as DHS Special Agent Patrick Hill. They have met him before He's a Delta Green case officer and he arranges missions He's the go-between and cutout between the agents on the ground and the rest of Delta Green and the mission is the agents job The agents are his job. Ooh, what a cool thing to say Let's get this out of the way Back before 9-11 people did our group's work out in the cold We got activated reactivated anyway during see during the transition decisions were made. I didn't make those decisions I don't know the people who did but they were made and now we're here. So I don't know more. I can't no more We're all only here because we were Closest or available and I'm not going with you because I've been up for two days trying to find you a ride into the goddamn Missionary got it. Okay, so around sometime 2002 some team or another was tasked with repurposing assets from the old group into the new program you guys know with all them the government switch over there and at least one of the ones we knew about and to my Understanding it was it's like a cost risk analysis based on the needs of the moment and the current budget you know how this shit goes so They tended to report that moving things out of unsecure private storage to secure Official locations just wasn't worth it in the end I don't know if it was because the contents were too volatile or Someone couldn't be bothered to find a truck or they didn't trust the transition. I don't know Okay, I mean it's the you know who these people are I wasn't there but one of those storage sites that they used was in La Fontaine Yeah, that La Fontaine the one from the news I'm sure you guys if I am well aware right right the ice storm Yeah ice storm so they installed an alarm on the door right of the security place and they got some friendly from the utility company one He looks down at his papers skip Mills To keep an eye on the place gave him some bullshit about maintaining a secret counterterrorism storage site or something Do it for God in country the typical patriotic make your life special bullshit I don't know. He was just strictly observing report didn't even have a key as far as I can tell But the idea was to come back to the Fox Got I got to find the Fox first, but then he's gonna come back to the box I suppose in a few months when when things that eventually settled down Well It's been a few months a Few because I was talking about 2002 right now and it's 2020 Yeah, so here we go see that's 18 18 years a month He just stares at you which is more than a month of Sundays The Storage unit is at knurls rent a space unit zero one seven one. Yeah, I know upset clusterfuck, but Obsec clusterfuck you're preaching to the choir Obsec operational security clusterfuck for those of you who you know might do math out loud to people. They just met You're preaching to the choir Anyway, the site is designated GB to to for you know, like Yeah fucking green box to 24 ice storm hits the city hard on the night of the second and the parrot box that Security system sent a silent alarm to someplace way above my pay grade right and it reports a breach Shit is so far buried in the shuffle the nobody and signals pucks up on the damn thing until two days later That's when they dragged my ass out of bed. So we have nothing on the ground I don't know if this Mills was on the silent alarms call list or not All I know is that I can't get a hold of him, but then I can't get a hold of anyone Phone lines are down across the entire city. Most of the cell towers are dead Something like 70% of buildings are without power still Yeah, all the cell towers are dead. So I guess they're gonna miss out on anyway We're Blind down there. All we know is that the door to GB to to for has been opened for going on a week And we don't know what was inside. We don't know if this Mills guys on the level. We just don't know And you have to find out who tried to say something I'm sorry. I said, oh dear Like oh god, I got you a ride on a National Guard disaster relief convoy It leaves in a few minutes you're on an oversight group working for FEMA Don't abuse the cover. You're just suits. Okay, just watching you're making sure everything's going All right, and this legend is paper thin I can't for the life of me think of why anyone would put you all in the same room together. I mean Fucking lucky you is the best I can do on short notice Paperwork is on the table. I got you some office space squared away at the city utilities company Which is where that skip Mills guy was fuck knows. I spent enough time on the radio trying to find their boss From there find out where this Mills guy is and what he knows Head out to GB to 24 and inventory the content see if you can tell if anything's missing Okay, right because if you go there it's a green box the stuff in there Should be kept away from people and if it's missing Then other people are seeing it Nod your heads. Can I get nods? Good job, everyone. Fuck me. Okay. Now if something's out there You got to do it needs to be done text me if you need anything, but keep those messages Clean-and-coated I'll do what I can from here, but There's a hundred miles of solid fucking ice around you in every direction and more alphabet soup Agencies and media in the theater than you can shake a dick at so don't expect miracles hell Don't expect anything You're on your own So do you guys? Understand what your mission is. This isn't sorry. I wasn't the tired guy anymore Right Yeah, the container is open we have to go find the friendly figure out why the container is open whether or not anything dangerous escaped and Neutralize whatever that might be and we have to talk to skip Mills and see what they are. That's the friendly That's the friendly They're friendly or are they can I can I ask this guy a question or is he out of the room? Mr. Out of sleep, mr.

We'll play Mario Kart against each other so I'm gonna go pee and We will jump into La Fontaine, Missouri Okay, you guys are gonna be riding in the back of a Navistar defense 7,000 MV troop transport Which is gonna be very cold. It's one of those like trucks military trucks with the covered wagon shit on the back and So you're gonna be in there packed with soldiers like National Guard like National Guard people members as well as like Blankets and food and clothing and shit just all packed in there so if you guys want to like do a quick think about how you might want to have a Conversation during this time so that we can get to know your characters and so that your characters can get to know each other Then that might be a good way to jump into the scenario So I'm gonna leave. All right, bye wait for me, please we promise we won't play without you When he gets back, let's just tell him we're done we think we figured it out the DMS gone So we solved the it's an open game now, but it was a bunch of angry raccoons that slid into the storage thing But one of us did die and up in the battle I'm gonna pee too, I guess yeah, I was gonna say I should take advantage of this I'm just gonna sit here and stare into space earlier when they left me alone I sang a song so you're up. Okay Sorry, Zach. I'm gonna readjust myself I'm gonna do some stretches if you've been sitting at your computer for a long time. You should do some stretches too We could do them together Hell, I'm gonna stand up Is this dream terrible I did a stretch and people said that they were stretching too. I am a health guru Did you do a stretch that changed because every time I moved my arms I saw my pit stains were getting they got out to the point to where my entire sleeve was covered at the bottom and It was so wet. I couldn't take it. I should unbutton my pants, but I think YouTube will ban us if I do that. Oh I don't think so. They can hear the unbuttoned and they're like shut it down. I have my cool Kanye pants on They're very comfy with the with the pocket. Yeah, I'll show the people nice Hoodie-pocket hoodie-pocket. What are you doing you? Oh It's like a it's like a baby kangaroo or a tiny loop once I clone myself That's where he'll live And he'll live in my afro so I can cook good French food to Raduluki got it. Nice Ha I'm drinking one of these Dude Truly pretty good. That's That's exactly what's in here. Nice the mango I got the orange and I added a little stevia to it just to give it a little more sweetness Oh shake it up. These things are too sweet for me. I Really? Sorry not to be that not to be that guy. Oh you add sweetener to it My drinks dries a biscuit that was poorly made Does that mean with whipped or with frothy coffee? Well, yeah, dude frothy milk, I mean Just a little barista Somebody ordered a cappuccino dry for me when like when I first started at the coffee shop and I was like They went all the juice in it That's dirty Best bartender in Springfield right here, baby Let's Dive back in The briefing said LaFontaine was ill-prepared for winter weather The city had sold most of its salt trucks and plows to keep from declaring bankruptcy during the reception But nothing the reception heard you for this the reception they threw a massive reception And They could they had they had they sacrificed a bunch of kids But like the ice storm still came and it was a sick party So no regrets ease and honestly fuck those salt trucks and plows that party was dope Yep, nothing prepared you for this level of destruction Nearly every road is blocked with felled trees phone and power lines dangle everywhere the few Emergency responders you see are still chiseling vehicles out of the ice like sculptures and most who succeed seem to have impotently skidded off the road The majority of homes remain damaged and without power their residents are left to freeze in winter temperatures Getting to the few operational shelters requires trekking on foot across the eerily beautiful city of ice Upon arrival They're crammed into crowded shelters filled with cots and hastily packed Suitcases and even the lucky ones with vehicles rugged enough to escape often have to find a path ahead through the felled trees and the roar of chainsaws is Constant even after five days relief teams have made scant headway a few major roadways are cleared and salted The commercial and university districts to the south have power restored Honestly, that doesn't sound like scant headway to me. It sounds like they got the the major Commercial and university districts restored very little relief though has come to the north side the poor side of town the convoy inches through The north of LaFontaine is the oldest part of the city cut off from the rest by a moat of abandoned warehouses Railyards Factories and other remnants of the city's industrial past the massive old growth trees dotting its residential Neighborhoods caused more damage here than anywhere else The only lifeline south the Zora Neale Hurston bridge remains a clogged icy mess It will be difficult to tell who needs help in northern LaFontaine Only the locals can distinguish which homes were abandoned to the storm and which were left vacant by the real estate crash still Progress is being made Operating out of the headquarters for city utilities workers are slowly getting LaFontaine livable again It appears that while the storm will certainly be expensive. None of the relief workers will be haunted by any lost lives So that's good everybody who's like seemingly got trapped in their houses and shit made their way to a shelter It's uncomfortable But patrols and emergency shelters are so far keeping those without power fed and warm And as you guys are rolling through the camera kind of like zooms up to the back of this Transport and then through we see soldiers in the very back and then like kind of a muffled wall and all throughout the middle aisle Just like clothes and food and blankets and supplies and then in the next part The four of you sit two on one side two on the other facing each other So hey there fella. I don't think you told us your name. I say to to Joe it's character It's Barry Frederickson, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you picked a good one for sure. I They just get they gave me Terrence fast fast night. I think fast night. That's a that's kind of a cool name. It's practically fast bender You know, it's it's not as cool as my real. Oh, yeah. I mean it is my real name right now, but it's and Terrence looks down and stops immediately talking. So we're alone in this compartment. Yeah, let's go ahead and say that way there We don't have like prying ears Immediate Opsec breaches exactly like I just to like get an introduction to you guys are You look over and you see two young National Guard recruits eyes wide You just have time to draw your firearms So Yeah, mr. Mr. Fast Knight there so you're saying in real life you have a Cooler name than your code name. Yeah, we're not I don't think we're supposed to say though As far as I know I'm I'm still new to all this. I I I don't know. I know I'm needed and so I came well I just want to say, you know, I'm sorry Cuz this there's a lot of it this job can be stressful in a lot of different ways and I think not being able to go by a pretty cool name is It's up there one that people it's just one people don't typically think about so I just want to say like I'm glad someone Understands my great duress. I am under and I'm sorry about that. My guy is looking the kind of puzzle between you two. I Am unaware of how the coolness of a name factors in to our mission You know, that's a fair point we should be playing this by the book and But anyway, yeah, you got a friend in me buddy. Why thank you and Terrence Fast Knight slips his little Like surgical mask up over his thing because he's uncomfortable being in a crowded dirty truck Well, I don't think we came here to make friends do you guys have any ideas for what we get there well Yeah, we just find We find skip Mills and We figure out what the heck is going on down at that green box were you all Able to read the briefing. Oh, yeah There is a chance this skip Mills Sought shelter, perhaps we can get records of Intake at these shelters didn't Patrick Hill who we all knew beforehand, but I forget what he told us. His name was Didn't he didn't he give us his his address where he's known to be now he did but as the briefing said most homes have been left abandoned and Shelters are at capacity. Oh, that was his okay I thought he just told us directly where he was that would have been a lot handier. He certainly did I'm suggesting that he might not be home. I suppose we could look at a map of some kind and if there's a shelter near his home that he'd probably go to the nearest one or The closest one to these storage I'll call around as some shelters and I get my phone out and Google LaFontaine, I believe that your cell reception will be not so good here Based Off What they said that all the towers were all jacked and such we're heading to city utilities Which I don't think I made this clear. They're up and running their skills. It's where skit Mills worked Okay, so you're being dropped off at CU City Utilities, which is where skit Mills worked I thought he works at a story, you know, he's yeah And it was the attendant thing just a side job of his he was a friendly. He didn't work at the storage place Okay, so he was just told he's just the guy when they were packing the green box that he was like Right next door at his own storage unit and they're like Yeah Yeah Like five innocent witnesses today because they play like us and they were just Like damn it skip. We just can't have any more blood on our hands So you guys are dropped off in front of the city utilities building before the truck joins the rest of the vehicles in the motor Pool parking lot around back so basically the HQ of this whole operation is gonna be in the parking lot behind city utilities in a big motor pool where everybody's got generators cars are all back there and these trailers are popped up back there and as you guys go into the city utilities building you see It is clogged with activity complaining customers entering their second week without electricity pack the lobby like cattle Overworked receptionists do their best to calm the crowd Exhausted linemen trudge in and out returning for more equipment or just trying to catch a few minutes sleep in the locker room and as you guys walk in you see a woman who is short squat has big glasses and she's wearing a car heart pulled all the way down and She comes up and she's like, hey, hello. Hello. Are you the FEMA oversight group? Hey there Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. This is me. I'm Tanya Cambria It's nice to meet each one of you. Thank you so much and she goes to shake your hands My guy does yeah, I should yeah and Enthusiastically I shake her Terrence holds his hand out like Like he's waiting for someone to kiss it Very Very gingerly, hey, okay cool And she like puts her elbow out and kind of like hits your hand a little bit He like kind of if you want to do one of those that's fine. He gives a little slap with his fingy tips. Ah All right. It's a pleasure to meet you Mark. Mark Smith gets like a Little physically uncomfortable and anxious scene that like breach of normal social decorum It's like, oh, you know, it takes all types But where I come from, you know, you shake a hand if someone's trying to shake your hand. Yeah No, well, I'm much more on your side of the equation here, but that's where we're at these days and no I didn't fully didn't say it out loud. That's just what happened in my gut Well, I just heard it and so I responded role-playing I found it. I found what came out of the unit Miss Cambria, what is it? You do here? Oh, I'm just a I'm just trying to put all this keep it all together Let's see You know, I knew there's gonna be a response team about but Oh office manager You can call me whatever you want But basically if you're talking to just me and you I run the place Obviously these people they don't know what they're doing and I got some office space for you, right? Look at that's what I told you take did you were you told that I had office space for you because look at me Of course, I've got office space for you. Come on down. Okay My voice is this now and yes, you're starting to I'll do what I want and you were just starting to sound like some kind of Star Wars merchant like I've got office space Roy. You went British and then I went you said office space All right, so yeah, no I was going for a more of a Mike Wazowski so Yeah, if you come out through here God, yeah, the temporary office that I've set up for you is a prefab trailer. It's in the parking lot Okay, and she walks you through the back of the building and like moving through come on down move out of my way as she's passing through this sea of tired and stressed out Civilians and so you guys make your way through the back Mills hasn't been here in a couple days few days now And so you can just use his office. This is what he was using before miss Cambria You know, we can't thank you enough we all as FEMA agents were responding to Springfield back in all seven. So So we know what it's like to go through this kind of major Meteorological event there. Well, it's good to have people like you. Yeah. Thank you very much miss Cambria. Yeah, we all know that snow when too much is Is bad you always talk like this. Oh, I'm very sad now Sorry cut out in the middle of what you're saying like nothing came out of your mouth So I didn't hear you sound like a crazy person if you could repeat yourself, maybe I'll react more accordingly Yeah, I thought I might have just been me there. But it totally cut out. It wasn't even like a drop of discord. Oh, I Talk slowly also Snow When when too much is bad Yes, I get it. All right, so and you pop out through the back door and you said Hit me with it before we leave miss Mills. Okay, it's Cambria miss Cambria miss Cambria Yeah, we need to speak with mr. Mills, do you know where we might find him I wish oh my gosh If you could tell me where he is, that would make me a happy lady. But here I am. Look at my face Am I happy lady to you It looks like you're doing the best you can under the circumstances. Oh, that's real sweet of you to say I'm really glad that you Professionals are here to really keep an eye on things and she like points around as you guys are about to open the door And she's like brace yourselves cuz it's a fuck ton of idiots and cold weather out there and she busts open the door And you see that the parking lot has been cleared of its thick coat of ice and large Command tents and the diesel generators heating them take up the space nearest the building and otherwise the cold keeps the parking lot Mostly empty save when trucks drive in to be resupplied or repaired in and out as they go but as you guys move past those tents, you see there is a trailer that is a makeshift office It's the relief effort HQ and it's where you guys have been sent because you are the suits in charge How's that feel? It's just a disaster It feels bad, well, you know, I don't think anybody will particularly think it's out of the ordinary if the federal government just really drops the ball on disaster response for a couple days, so It should I think it's more decent cover than we're being given credit for You know, I I think that that guy Mills, you know, he had that exact kind of Feeling inside his entire body when he was here. I'm sorry. I thought you left We I wasn't gonna say anything like that for you. You said you yeah Oh, I pushed open the door and I I told I told Luke that I was gonna walk all the way with you guys That way, you know If you if you were worried because I wanted to say one more thing about skip Mills and then have you guys roll humid Oh, oh, yeah, that makes it that's standard investigatory a procedure So actually you don't have to roll We're gonna play this scenario as written so there will be a few times where so in Delta green if you just have a skill at a certain number you Pass so if you're not under stress and there's no like time limit on the thing Then you don't have to roll for it, which I except we never do that. No, no, we don't we don't play that way We play a different way. And so here we are. So if any of you have humans at 30% say aye aye or At 30% or above that Yeah, like way above I forgot. I'm still this lady. I'm still this lady. I gotta wear my beanie. I like it. He's my head warm It's uh, I'm at a 60 miss Cambria Oh, well, then you of course would know that as I'm talking about skip Mills and I'm saying stuff like wow Government workers. Am I right? Some of them love some of them hate some of them come to work Some of them don't this guy dips out in the middle of a national emergency Maybe not national national for us. I mean my life is my country, you know, and so You would know that like she's pretty uncomfortable She's like very comfortable talking shit about him but you can tell that she was very very confused and then she says but I Will say when he did come in three days ago the last time he was here His face was covered in scratches and sweat and it was awful. He looked fucking terrible I am sorry for the cursing but this is an emergency and it's like theater in high school You could just cuss whenever you want. It's fine. Everybody loves it. You know, it's liberating. You're all looking at me right now I'm not gonna say anything about attraction of people or anything like that, but I'm someone who doesn't get the male gaze You know from from from people in his age group too often But boy howdy the last time he came in here it was not Comfortable. Oh, I mean he was he was yeah. What is your age difference there? Well, I'm 85 She's like how old is mr. Mills she's probably like mid 50s You just lied you just lied to federal agents there Well, you never ask a woman her age or a man it's rude You can't ask people how old they are unless it's their birthday and even then you just count the candles Ma'am in an emergency any bit of information might be relevant. We need you to please be forthcoming with us and even I'm actually 69 yeah Sorry No, it's fine you can laugh that's exactly the kind of like dirty humor It was that kind of dirty humor that looked like it was in this this guy's eyes I mean what he sees in his 30s early 30s people like that don't you know often? I've had a professional relationship with Skip Mills for years and not once has he ever looked at me like I was a piece of Meat that he wanted to fuck Sure, we get it. He was really giving you the eyes there the last time you saw him. Yeah, did I make that clear? Yeah, speaking of which just before you dive in any further to this conversation. That's definitely over No, no, I have I have a question for her. Okay, hit the question then we'll move what was what was mr Mills duties here Ma'am try not to laugh. I need to know what his responsibilities were his duties Well, I'm looking them up obviously Sure figure it out. I'm pretty sure that he was running the He was he was he was in charge. That's why you guys are here We needed FEMA oversight because our city utility supervisor during a power outage with ice all over the city is Nowhere to be found three days nowhere to be found You know, it sounds like he was one horny dog and Those might have been those might have been love scratches, you know on his own face Yeah, cuz the your lover scratches. Yeah When your lover scratches Across the face. Has anyone tried contacting him? Of course. What did you say? Have you been to his house? We've been no we're not gonna go to his house. Why would we yeah, of course like we're gonna go to his house Do you know how much money and time it takes to get anywhere in this fucking city right now? Yeah, I mean like we said we were in Springfield So, you know it could take some time But money is a weird way to qualify how it would take to get down to a fellas house It's not like I am the office manager. I look at the bottom line Financials, that's what I'm all about Sure. Sure man hours. We get it. We get it. Okay. Bye lady. Thank you Did we get a definitive on skips age 30s early 30s? You have a job to do. I have a job to do. Let's all do our jobs and she turns around She bails. Well, I say we go to his house I think probably what he saw in her is that she was such a strong, you know minded personality She's really, you know, I respect the hell out of that lady. She was quite strong and attractive to To some of us I think She really didn't make much of an impression on me, but to each their own well, you know some men have a natural Predisposition against not natural. It's been ingrained by society against powerful women and it's really toxic You gotta get over it. You just need to learn to Admire and respect somebody like that instead of feeling threatened. Okay, that's great advice. So you guys were You guys are so cold while you're having this conversation and you're all just looking at this door of this prefabricated trailer that is right in front of you before we jump into this and Joe will hop to you first, but due to the content of Delta green and role-playing games in general I know that we have an understanding of each other and that we are close friends and we have been playing together for a long Time and I've yet to have something happen in a game Where one of you came up to me afterwards and we're like, I felt uncomfortable during that and I wish you wouldn't have done it However, that's the goal. No Hold on to your butts So basically I want to implement a safe word For this game and honestly just moving forward in all of our games So if anyone is made uncomfortable at any time by the what is happening either whether it's me doing it or someone else Doing it in a scene just say the word and we'll immediately fast forward like cut to the next scene and then afterward off-mic We'll talk about it and how we can do better and make sure that that wouldn't happen again Is that cool with everybody or doesn't even have any suggestions about how to do that better works for me I think it's our safe word. What is the safe word is the question? Kraft mac and cheese. I Ran out of mac and cheese a few days ago, and it's really nice and innocent. I like that a lot Let's go Kraft mac and cheese. All right, so if anyone says Kraft mac and cheese out of context Then we know To bail and move on I think that's too bad. This one takes place at the haunted craft factory Yeah, the people voted for named mac and cheese Boy Boy, all right. So as you guys are diving into The utilities manager's office. Oh, he's the manager. Of course. He is it says right here He's the manager of city utilities. Just like the main dude This is what the one you're looking for So Tanya drops off the group in front of Mills office and returns to her work and the prefabricated trailer suffices as a base from which sorties sorties sorties Sorties means small parties that are sent out to for missions and such to go and yeah Oh know that I didn't either if you played enough strategic RPGs like me and Thomas did you would be? Fucking idiot if your family had exposed you to as much military history as a child like any proper American family should be then You'd be well acquainted with what a sortie is sir Fair that's why I when we're besieged What was that when we're besieged I'm gonna be in charge of things none of not you fellas Maybe Justin is you're my colonel. Yay, finally, I would have died in the initial blast Yeah, we probably would have positioned you somewhere Hey Before we start I do have to go use the restroom before before we dive in deep before we go into the office Yeah, that's fine I'm never mad at you. I want to get to the meat of this thing. Well the miles I mean the Mills meet Give me that Mills mate. Oh boy Oh Hey guys, yeah, when you go into the office It's heated and as soon as you walk in you're like, oh Hell yeah, because I wait Zach comes before we get any further we should clap again. Did you start recording again? Mm-hmm Oh, that's good. We've been I've been recording the whole time. I just forgot to sync us up when I restarted it Oh, we can do another class. So you have you've recorded two files now. Is that what you're saying? I immediately started recording again. Oh, okay. That's fine. And I anyway I shouted real loud right there So it should be easy to find in the file, but I'm gonna be off sync for the last Very this is gonna be super confusing that it sounds good. All right, let's do the clap one two three Six seven Nice It's wild how behind it all is for me. Yeah. Yeah, it looked really really bad Thankfully that's streaming baby, sir I think it's literally physically impossible for us to clap on track together through streaming technologies We could spend a while trying so you guys go into this office. It's warm. It's nice You are stoked to be there there's a few fold-out tables a desk and a computer and The only other thing that you notice is it kind of smells What is that? Like Bradford pears weird, that's like real bad, right? It smells like come does smell like come. Yeah Wow, it might not be trees even it kind of just smells like come in here Oh, damn it Is okay, I want to I want to search for come Does it does it actually smell like come do we need to look yes, um, it absolutely smells like come in here And as you kind of like, I mean you said it so as you're walking around you can't kind of focus in on a centralized place and it's the desk and if you're like Really moving your nose around the chair Behind the desk has a little bit stained on the front of it. And then if you bend over the underneath of the desk like if you're just like smelling around That's good audio You're just getting a nose full of this guy's jaw sauce Just like she's all up down here and you would notice that like the ground Where his feet were is like the carpet is stiff and hardened and there is residue Stained under the desk like the up and up underneath it. So he's shooting up there Wants to check out his computer one, two, three. I'm sorry So I was like I was reading this Scenario again after I put it in the poll and people started voting for it and I was like, oh fuck a Cum horror show like the first clear is like there's fucking cum everywhere I think I think Terrence would willfully like raise his hand because He's like I deal with quite awful things every day so I Can do this and what do you do? Checking the computer. Yeah Let's see what he was making all this fuss about you move the mouse around and the computer's already logged on Still logged in just just for the record while this is happening I want my guy to be walking around the office like if there's file cabinets He's going through some of those just okay just doing what you would do to search a room for signs of this person's life Yeah, smoochy. What are you doing? Same? Yep, and Smith. What are you up to? I'm Observing them all and taking diligent notes in my in my FBI issued notebook That absolutely makes sense and I'm like, hey there make sure you don't disturb any of that cum Fast night as You're going through the computer you notice that there is a program that monitors the power grid In the town the power grid monitor program, but it needs a separate password But as you're going through the computer you find Mills's home address like immediately On some correspondence or sorry, that's actually Joe you guys already had his home address but you confirm it here in the office and then the web history is really It's really horrifying Fast night as you're as you're scrolling through The the porn the porn the sheer amount of porn on this computer that has been that it was accessed three days ago all between like the hours of 630 a.m. And 1 p.m. On January 3rd It's like it's pornography in the sense of like past past Films of people Fucking each other this is getting it gets weirder and weirder and weirder and darker And then more violent and more violent and then like he is trying to find the most punishing Regardless of gender regardless of anything Anything it's all about how violent the videos can get and As you're just like looking through the names of these videos you have to roll sanity. Oh These videos so fucked up just reading the titles of them makes you roll sanity for how gross I Pass 52 on a 70 you lose zero sanity as You have a 70 sanity. You're the sanest dude ever. Hell yeah, bro Yeah, I've also got one of those One of those seventies so due to your line of work as a female oversight agent I would assume that you you're you're like pretty strong Mentally for this kind of stuff. Yes, my past life has prepared me quite well for horrors and Nasty shit happening to bodies You feel me bro, he says out loud as he's searching the computer Imagine having to touch that mouse and keyboard Wentworth and Smoochie who has searched and who has SIG it or criminology I've got a search of 40 and I've got a criminology of 30 60 search and What was the other two criminology only 10? Can I pitch in on either of these? Yeah, what do you got? 70 search and 50 criminology Okay, you guys know with all of that star-studded skill points You guys see as you're looking about you see that on the backside of a desk calendar Ecclesiastes 28 is written on it in ink pen on the back of a calendar and Then go ahead and roll SIGINT or criminology, I believe that is I have a search notice again, but who had criminology. I have a 50 criminology That is what I was asking for. Please roll criminology. I fail 82 on a 50. What was it? Ecclesiastes what 28 28 and then Justin as fast night continues He gets the gist of the history of what's going on on this computer and Who's got computer science who's got the best computer I have 20 I have none I got none Thomas Hold on. Sorry. I've got the I've got Ecclesiastes 28 pulled up over my character sheet and I Have none, okay Okay, so 20% go ahead and roll that computer science there fast night Oh Crit fail 77 Explodes and kills me Okay, so You slip you slip and come and delete the file. So as you're going through here, you're trying to figure out what is Going on and you see this power grid monitor program that's still up and you decide you're gonna try to get into it Right. And so as these boys are looking around the room, you're just like typing typing You're like, oh, I bet his password is his address and then he typed it in and then you're like, oh I bet his address is Mills and then you type it in and then you're like maybe skip Mills and then capital S skip Mills and you do it until it's like you've been locked out of the system and At that moment you turn around and they're like, hey, I found Ecclesiastes 28 written on the back Mark Smith starts reciting it from memory. Oh, no, and he's kind of he kind of looks a little confused when no one else joins in Yeah, Ecclesiastes 28 woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of Forgive me pastor's son, but uh, f Ryan Is that right? I'm If I really go for the pronunciation, it's a frame Okay Yeah, well whose glorious beauty is a fading flower Which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are who overcome with wine Fat valleys, I guess that might be like a fupa there or something Behold the Lord hath a mighty and a strong hold on fellas Don't laugh cuz you're about to laugh more because verse 2 starts Behold the Lord hath a mighty and a strong one which is Which is what I said to my wife when I woke up this morning It's like oh look at that sometimes when you really got a pee it's like I didn't even know it could get that big but Which as a as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters Overflowing shall cast down to the earth with that with the hand The crown of pride that drunkards of f Ryan shall be trodden under feet and the glorious beauty Which is on the head of the fat valleys shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer Which we need that looketh upon it seeeth while it is. I'm going way Irish Why I think I'm getting to the end of the point Have you not looked this clue up before Anyway, basically if they don't it doesn't take too kindly to these drunkards of f Ryan interesting Whose glorious beauty is a fading flower was that 20 Ecclesiastes 28? Yes, and I'm of course quoting from the new King James version you asking that in character because he just resigned out loud No, I was asking out of character cuz when I do it, I don't think I pulled up the same thing I don't see f from listed anywhere in here Oh Boy if I pulled a Bible boner and quoted the wrong verse I love how much this like hardcore religious guy talks about his dick No, what are you talking about a dick when you talk about pulling a boner? Okay, yeah Bacon well, well, we'll make note of that and you can recite it later if it comes up But I think that might just be the password for his computer. Have you tried that yet Terence? ashamedly looks Like it looks over. I I did I did too many. I did too many of the bad ones and Now we are all locked out of the computer the come pewter Did you guys like my awesome joke, I mean Did you find anything in the computer before it locked you out? I I saw disturbing pornography that would shake a normal person to their core, but one such as I is not phased by humanity's depravity Okay What a cool sentence to say to new friends I Lean over to to Frederickson Barry Frederickson, I'm like not exactly a fella you'd want to have over for you know Meet a dinner of meat and potatoes, you know with with maybe like the Hendrickson's or maybe just your kids That man's proclivities do not concern me do I hear all this urchin do I hear this We're in a tiny office Yeah, I mean it was implied that he was leaning over and saying that to me under his breath But if you want it, okay, I roll to hear it roll to hear it. Oh Boy good thing I have the lowest alertness possible. It's good for Delta Green. Oh, yeah Seeing what's coming So does Terrence We haven't seen what was coming only what came So, what's the plan I think we ought to head to this guy's house So was the the confirmation of his home address the only other thing that I found in my young. Yeah. Okay Can I do a search role on the place as well? You can not would it would it be fruitless? Yep, you're good. Oh Yeah, actually go ahead and roll roll search for me real fast Fuck 83 on a 70 Perfect. I didn't have anything. I Admire the gambit I Like that you're like, you know what I'm gonna challenge myself to have something exactly You found a cool candy bar and a can of coffee You're feeling fucking good ad 15 sanities Random free candy bar gives you 15 Someone comes up and says something not mean to you gain a sanity point Oh Poor Terrence, I feel like in this office There would be a paper map of the city for his records and I want to use it to try and locate His house in comparison to where we are how far away it is. Oh something also I meant to ask earlier is This does the city utilities. Do they have internet up and running here city utilities does have the internet live right now All right, so we could what we could do even though we don't have Access to the internet on our phones like when we go out and about we can download a local map of the area on Google Maps and Then we just have that. Oh, I think that's really smart we can also do some scout and find out how to get from here to there and Smoochy you were talking earlier at there about finding out where the shelters are you could get to Google in that while we have All we have that Wi-Fi I will do that So essentially what you've got is you've got the shelters are on the south side of town and then along the other so the main shelter that's being used is Written Written down on my sheet. It says Truman Memorial High School In the south down there is being used. Is there a phone number listed for it? Of course, why wouldn't there be? Alright, give it a call Okay, roll a 50% luck straight up and down on whether or not the phone line works this time around. I got a one Crystal-clear. Yeah Reception Truman Memorial High School Becky speaking. Hey Becky Um You guys are using the school as a shelter at the moment, correct? That is correct. Um, do you happen to Have a list of the people staying there like a check-in sheet of any kind, you know We tried to start one but at the end of the day it got real out of hand I'd say we got about half the people's names down right now, but we're working on it Could you check and see if there's a name on there? I'm looking for somebody Gosh because you rolled a critical success, I guess I got the sheet right in front of me Yeah, I'm looking for mr. Mills Mills Mills Mills, I'm a speed reader nope, okay I Guess I'll ring you up if I need anything else. Who is this? I'm in charge Security We're civilians, I'm FEMA I'm with FEMA. Oh Okay, you should lead with that next time is what I'm gonna say because if you called back here with just a normal success I'm asking who you are first Yeah, well save this number as FEMA. So everybody knows Did you call from your what did you call from I Could I have there was a phone in the office? Skip Mills office, but could I have call? I'm gonna give you I'm gonna tell you that it would be smarter if you would have called from the office Okay. Yeah, I I didn't have reception. So I use the cum covered telephone to call. I Want to be clear the cum was in one location You just did that he wasn't trying to Peter Parker's way through the office, okay So I use So you find out that Skip Mills is not at the shelter well he I tell them well, they didn't have his name on the list there, but she also said that uh, Not everybody's name is listed. So I think that we should try his house first and and go there as a Bug backup plan Jay Hawkins is saying and I agree that the classic spider-man noise is the whip not goose Spider Wang spider Wang goose, whatever a spider King On the phone, no, we didn't just under the desk look out here comes Skippy Mills Good good one Garth. I like was he looking on the top of his desk for a dice that he dropped You never know They do end up in strange places That's true, I can't actually fault it there's a chance that thing ricocheted about 12 times and landed back there Behind the scenes everybody Well, okay, so it does bear noting that when we got the idea for letting you watch These recording sessions we didn't know they would very quickly become remote technological nightmares, yeah We thought it would be a fun time with us all in the room So, thank you for bearing with us and joining and I hope your quarantines going good Yeah bear down on finals guys fat dog. Yeah, it's fat dog this Very insensitive of you Zach God I his face when he's like That's where I got it from sorry we're talking about community Okay, I was like, I don't remember this coming up. Yeah, it's it's a community episode. All right I'm gonna go pee and then let's crack back into this Are you serious? No, so, okay Joe Yo, Barry Fredrickson gonna look over for your name Fredrickson looking at the map while Smoochie is on the phone you notice that Skip Mills lives a few miles away from here in the north side of LaFontaine Earl's rent a space is on the way there. It's in between the two locations cool It's tempting is it might be to hit that up. We should maybe check it on the way back. Oh Shit I'm not a southern character It's immediately default role-playing voice, oh it's hard. Oh Don't you know so yeah, that's what I sound like And always have so don't let nobody tell you any otherwise and if I go leprechaun It's not because I'm actually secretly a leprechaun. So Can we roll to check on that? a Leprechaun Love it So, you know, they told us that the first thing we need to do is to find Stephen Mills. Skip Mills. Skip. Yeah skip I just I Definitely, I'm not this is you just know I'm not saying this is the group because we're not supposed to give out personal information but Definitely one of his kids is named skip and after seeing this come covered office. He's like He's like no, no skip would do this This is a Stephen for sure Okay, okay so I I agree I think we should go find skip and then on the way back we can hit that storage box and if he Turns out to be some help. I think we'll need all the help we can get with that thing. Probably I agree Yeah, yeah real quick before we go. Well, you know what? Maybe we should just get the drop on them at the shelter I was gonna say maybe we should have that call that lady that Becky back and And say hey, could you just start looking around for old skip there? But maybe we don't want to alert him that we're on to him Perhaps you could have her call us if she discovers him there That's what I was getting at, but I don't want her tipping him off But if she does come across the information, you know without probing, yeah, I don't I don't know You know what to expect from skip but uh My conversation with that lady. I don't know if I could convince her to To even try to go look for him. Oh, wow. I didn't say it was it was she real rude dinner No, I mean, I guess I could call back if you guys think but uh, it kind of just seems like we're Not Going anywhere, yeah, let's just go. Yeah, I'm just gonna say it you could go somewhere. Oh, yeah. Yeah, let's go to skips house Any idea how to get there? Yeah, we've got them and like how are we gonna get there walking right? I think we should probably oh that's you're simple We got it. It's too cold and slippery out there. We got to take a vehicle I'm sorry, but I'm from the north and they're just you know, it it riles me up here and these folks say such How far is the house from where we are? Can we can we get a vehicle from the city utilities to use Exactly. They've got all kinds of they've got all kinds of vehicles for doing just this sort of sort of work Yeah, does anyone have bureaucracy? I do what's it because I'm so good at talking to people. I have 50 Holy shit, so I let's does anyone else have a higher bureaucracy than that? No. Okay, so Do you want to play this out Justin? Oh, you know it transport Can I go talk to Tanya my one true love? Oh, oh she oh there she is Sorry Sorry, I had to turn it about that way. You see the logo, you know Carhartt It's uh, it's not a little it's a lifestyle brand now and it also keeps you warm Is Tanya just hanging out outside or something outside of the trailer or do we need to work our way back? Yeah, no, you can't leave that there. If you leave that there, then we'll have to come get it later What do you think? No, you can't just do that. Oh, if everyone did every what you're doing every single day Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt what seemed to be extremely good leadership skills, but yeah well, that's all I have I I We need to borrow one of your big trucks Not the small ones but a big snow truck of some kind to Go find skip. Do you think we could swing that? He slips her a $1 bill as he's saying And I wink and I go I know how this works She dies laughing she thinks this is the funniest thing she's ever seen she's like People people in the government have no sense of humor these days. That's fucking hilarious Joking only she rifles through this big keychain that she has and she finds one that's got a Honestly, I'm out of my element here and it's not in the scenario What kind of vehicle would they be using to to drive around town? Do you think this is a big old like a monster truck a pickup truck with the weird stuff in the back a month? Yeah, it's a monster truck. I changed my mind town monster truck It's used for it's used for parades and stuff for the city utility. It's called this. It's called the snow angel It is like a disco ball that's always rotating on the back yeah, no, it's a pickup truck with a disco ball hanging from the mirror up front and monster truck no and Not even one of those pickup truck monster trucks. Ooh, yeah, like where it's like a little it's like a regular-sized pickup truck But it has big old monster truck wheels. Oh, yeah, we can do that. That's yeah You got big ass and truck nurse Okay disco balls I And it's got a big old sick-ass machine gun on the back It's got there's no balls on the back that are branded city utility. Oh hell yeah, we'll take it We'll take it on our way out. I want to go over in the corner of the office We're in and in my backpack. I pull out what looks like a Smoke detector and I stick it on the ceiling and turn it on. Oh sick. What'd you just put in there? Yeah, what was you fill in your fellow? Investigators and on what you just put what I did there. Yeah, it's uh, it's got a camera in it See if anybody comes back here You know Just in case very cool You don't you know, I think that's pretty cool too don't start any fires cuz it doesn't work like that It's just do you have more of these? I've just brought the one don't don't you know that now would be a good time to talk about what we all brought to this Year party. I think that's a great idea after you guys see me stick that on there you say that and I just put my I have like a hiker size backpack Put it on the ground and start pulling stuff out of it to show you guys I've got a bunch of hand and feet warmers just in case cool. I've got two GPS trackers like tiny GPS trackers I've got that smoke detector that I already stuck on the ceiling I've got a pair of night-vision goggles a pair of handcuffs a pair of binoculars and A grapple hook with 15 feet of rope tied to it. That's cool Joe He looks at you guys and he pulls a little notebook out of his pocket out of the inside coat of his pocket I simply brought the only tool that I need Typically we find new tools in the field. Wait, what is it a pocket knife? No pocket notebook Okay, I admire that kind of old-fashioned Terrence Terrence thinks that that's really fucking cool Instinct. Yeah, I got a don't you know, I think that's pretty fucking cool tool Terrence opens up He has like a leather. What do you call like us? What is it when it's like a little like a weird hard leather suit? Yes. Yeah, he like pops it open and he has a scalpel and some other little metal instruments some gloves and surgical masks a magnifying glass some first-aid supplies a cool book and a lighter and some cigarettes and I think did I say gloves and scarf? I can't remember if I said that I zoned out. I Just brought the essentials and some a couple extras What about what about you? Well, here's what here's what I got and marks myth He has just like a carry-on like wheeling little suitcase thing and he's got some some warm sweaters some warm socks a book about like the history of the FBI like a Book about like an historical event in the 30s or something cool But then he also sets down like his his checked luggage and it's this big long hard case and you see two Like target shotguns in it. It's like, you know, I'm I'm When you know when I'm not shooting Unknown horrors for for the big DG there. I I took up shooting skeet And it's pretty it's I've traveled all over with these before so is no problem checking them on the plane there So if anybody else needs if anybody thinks they're handy with a shotgun there Oh, I'd say I'm slightly above average with a firearm. I'm almost exactly average. Yeah, I Know my way around a shotgun, but I don't believe I'll be needing one right now You know, it's here. They're too big and if I shoot it on middle to shoot me backwards like a cartoon character That is a yeah, that is an issue with these sometimes there So I'd say just go ahead and bring those with us in the truck and hopefully we don't have to use them anyway Yeah, so I got those in socks Can I have you guys do the headphones off for just real quick and I'll do a quick wave my Guy was very purposefully not telling them about the two guns that he has He discarded the carry-on and put him into holsters on underneath his coat and very specifically Only pulled out that notebook from inside his coat. He didn't open this coat. Fantastic. Yeah You're back so You guys are going to skip Mills's first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so you load up the truck And you head a few miles to the home of skip Mills in LaFontaine and as you're driving through it's the same site that you saw earlier through the back of that truck the City was just completely destroyed I mean I we live in the Midwest and we have the internet so we know what that looks like Well, dude, do we Zach some of us some of us some of us lives through it Zach And some of us apparently we're at Zach. Yeah yours truly Didn't I moved here one year after I moved here in Oh eight? Perfect the great ice storm of ott7 struck struck Springfield drunk Springfield it struck it down for two full weeks Covered an ass it was stuck at my friend's house and we couldn't play Guitar Hero because there was no electricity. That's horrible I bet that's the worst thing that happened It was actually really fun Yeah, you guys loving this quarantine, all right, so You guys get out to this house in a dilapidated a dilapidated a dilapidated neighborhood a few miles from city utilities Nearly all the residences on this block are foreclosed and those that aren't are busy recovering from the storm The windows of this house have been papered as You park even you can hear jazz music loudly blaring From inside and as you all get out, I want you to tell me what you're bringing with you as you smell Who an odd stench that it seems really familiar since you've been in that office for a while But even through this like frigid air It's just Bradford Tree City out here is like you're walking through the campus of Missouri State University in fall famous canals like jism Yes, I I leave my backpack in the truck But I bring with me one GPS tracker and then I put a new Set of foot warmers in my shoes and hand warmers and my gloves nice continue on staying warm, baby Terrence would have his suitcase with him at all times. It's not like a super humongous suitcase because I'm not carrying anything like Enormous in there. It's a tiny suitcase. Yeah, like a mid-sized not like those huge I don't know. I'm just thinking of how people have those like enormous ones. I just have my my nine millimeter Under my under my parka as we step out of the monster truck I've got my gun and a pair and a pair of socks. Okay, I throw an extra pair of socks into my Into my back pocket when you hop out. I look back at the truck I'm like, do I know that you have that gun on you or not? Yeah, don't know all of us except for Joe have our service. I don't have a gun on me I don't have a gun either. I've thought when he sent the circle thing that said no guns That means I couldn't have a gun that is what yeah for sure unless you were with the force But he but he's with the force is what it sounds like he described Did you describe out of character the? Yeah, I think you said FBI mustache at one point nevermind. We don't necessarily know that you're No, well first of all, what do you guys how are you involved with all this if you're not I've never met anybody who wasn't Like me on one of these missions, but first of all, what do I mean by like me? I don't mean anything by like me because you don't know I'm no I'm no federal agent I'm a I'm a second Second Amendment enthusiast and I'd rather not get into my personal details and to be honest. I really don't care about yours How is he come on like that guy's gotta be a cop listen to him? anyway Mind if I bring one of your shotguns? Well, I kind of I kind of was leaving them behind cuz it was inconspicuous We also you know, hey, I thought you all would be strapped as it were Mark Smith would know that looking around This neighborhood is desolate. Honestly the idea of being inconspicuous in a place like this seems strange because when you look around it is Ghost town. I mean frozen iced over but still like there is nothing and the only the only reason that it feels Normal in any way is the music coming from this house, but that combined with the smell and also What you have come to expect from Delta Green leads you to believe that You know, it's probably just house full of Come that's gonna come alive. Oh, yeah So cube Mark Smith looks around and he like sees he just hears the wind howling Behind the jazz and like a dog barking in the distance, but he doesn't see any other activity And he thinks about what he's seen on these on these missions before You know Dad might not be a bad idea there and I hand him I hand him one shotgun and I take the other when you hear those dogs barking will you roll for me an intelligence or a science biology or a Now That everybody now just Thomas when you say certain things it unlocks me to ask you for a role sometimes 39 on a 75 intelligence when you're listening to those dogs barking You could have sworn that you heard one. That's like Like howls out in pain and then you hear a Oh That doesn't sound like a dog did any of you fellas hear that hear that dog maybe just get It by an owl there. I heard something. I don't know I didn't I might have just heard barking but I wasn't paying no attention. I was looking at this shark It's always yeah, it's always good To be be aware of the firearms in your possession at all times because it's really cold outside the moment You're not that's when accidents start happening. But what are we waiting around for? Let's go. Come on We got a cum monster to catch real fast I assume that the this is a neighborhood that doesn't have power is that the case and If that is the case, do we see lights from the house that we're approaching? So there are lights in this house that you see on but the windows are papered over But you can kind of see some light through the paper but mostly you can tell that there is power due to You know the music blaring you can assume unless it was some sort of wireless speaker with a pre-charged phone easily possible in these times, however Most people aren't like flaunting their electricity or flaunting their battery life When they don't write power the rest of the neighborhood is dark around us, yes, okay Yeah, and looking around like it said earlier You honestly can't really tell the difference between the homes that have been foreclosed And the ones that people are living in that don't have power anymore, but this definitely does seem like a place where? Where power is is few and far between cool. I forgot if you answered me earlier. Is it day or night time right now? It is morning. Okay, you guys arrived in it like 8 a.m.. 7 a.m.. Somewhere in there, so it's probably 9 a.m.. By now cool. What took it's just really far from the airport We were at the airport at 1145 right it says in my notes that the agents arrive at 7 a.m.. On January 6th I don't know why that is if you arrived in st. Louis at 1245 But maybe you had to wait we had to wait for lion's choice to open Honestly you probably had to wait for this like and then we do and then we drove the 10 minutes to La Fontaine Yeah, no you you definitely just had to wait for the rest of the like the trail the supplies and everything to get all packed Up and oh that makes sense they realize Yeah, and then like you know Gary wasn't there yet And so they had to wait on Gary and then they realized that they'd loaded up with the wrong supplies into this truck And so they had to switch them out with the supplies that were going into the other truck But they're both going to these her. It's cold out here. That's good How do you guys approach the house quickly So any of you fellas have any kind of crime fight in experience Official vigilante or otherwise oh, yeah, okay? Well, why don't you and I any is anybody here real good at talking as it were? Super cold um yes, I am General alright, I don't know if he's gonna be super receptive to seeing us just with the shotgun So we might want to keep those a little bit hidden, but why don't you talk to this fella, okay? I took the shotgun under my duster And I knock on the door the music is so loud from inside that you know that no matter how hard you knock You're probably not gonna get a response this music is like blaring. Okay. I checked the door is it locked nope I? Open it up What do I see when you open it up one you are here looking at me with a stench you're hit Just like like almost like your hair just goes stands back as it's just like a waft a big waft of this smell that you have smelled now many times today that reminds you of Come I don't know. I'm trying to think of a different way to say that of like it reminds you of your room and Creator But You find as you guys walk into this home Mills has turned his home into a sickening tribute to the flesh The walls are plastered with pornography of every shade some printed from the internet and some from purchased Magazines the TVs and computer screens are all transmitting filth the home reeks of Organic decay and the heat is set as high as it will go It is toasty it is a toaster oven in here and the the oh God everyone everyone roll Constitution except for except for Fast night you're good. No shit. I rolled a one again No way, I promise that is wild less interesting, but I rolled an 83 again No way Yeah, technically that's just as crazy guys so I Failed mine I was a 97 So the two of you are Immediately taken aback by everything about this and oh geez cut monster Wentworth just covers his nose with a glove and Maybe wretches a little but yeah, it's the most emotion you guys have seen in Frederickson for God knows how long and maybe ever and As you are adjusting to the inside of this home It's hot as fuck Terrence walks in and the first thing he notices is the heat not the Noxious fumes that are being emitted from everything. Where does the music sound like it's coming from? The music is coming from upstairs would Anyone care to accompany me upstairs for to turn this off? I'm already headed up the stairs So, oh, that's cool that you just did Well, I did it five seconds ago Okay, so Justin is going up the stairs with a smoochie following behind. What are the other two doing? Wentworth is just staying downstairs Trying to overcome how grossed out he is and using the time to like In his acclamation to the room. He's using it to scan the room and take it all in See if there's anything he can glean from the scene downstairs. What's your human? I mean the baseline 10, okay And what is your medicine? I've got a first aid of 30 Okay, and what is your alertness? 70 on the alertness, okay Thomas does Mark Smith have human or medicine 60 human no medicine 50 alertness. Okay. So as you guys are kind of walking around downstairs Justin and Luke as you guys are heading upstairs go ahead and take your headphones off As You guys are walking around oh gosh, let's see Mark Smith you notice that skips descent into madness It takes a path Seems to be layers and layers of pornography that he's can coon himself in with are getting more and more Violent more and more deviant and you kind of begin to think as you're looking around That this was some sort of attempt to cage himself in with his own twisted urges coating the walls and stimulation to prevent himself from leaving and Joe we've got Frederickson with alertness noticing that This is not the house of a bachelor or at least not one as mundane as Mills was before the store because the interior design is gaudy and There are pictures of skip with his mother all over the mantle and I'm gonna go ahead and give these one of these bird fellas To get these boys back in here. Hey Luke, he can't hear me. That's the whole point. His headphones are literally off to We couldn't yell out enough Hi, hey and then so let's have Thomas and Joe take your headphones off as the other two go upstairs Hmm clump clump clump as the two of you are walking up the stairs Oh Terrence fast night as soon as you turn the corner He's got like one of those where you like walk up the set of stairs and then turn a corner to go up to the next set of stairs as soon as you hit that corner and you look up with Henry smoochy literally on your back like right looking over your shoulder the two of you see a man in his early 30s and He is completely naked Cool that's all No, that's not so he is He is just covered in blood and scratches all over him He is emaciated and he looks gaunt and his eyes are like Completely like back in his head like he is not paying attention to you at all But his dick is in his hand and he's just like slowly like hitting it against his thigh Making this like pat pat pat pat pat sound and he turns and looks at you guys and you see something in his eyes and I I need you to roll a humid either one of you or both of you. I have psychotherapy That'll do it. Okay. Oops. Yeah, I didn't pass on humid. I Did not pass either. Okay, so this guy is just like looking at you with these big eyes and he starts walking towards you and he's like Hey Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, are you guys um You guys are you guys are? You guys are real, right? Skip yeah skip is this you I need you both through all sanity. I Passed 23 on a seven. I got a 17 on a 50. Oh, yeah. No, you guys are real you guys are Oh, yeah Well, I bet you're real Kind of shoulders back He puffs his chest out and he starts kind of like doing one of these where he's like kind of dancing Well a little shoulder movement side to side back and forth and his hips are kind of moving back and forth And he's like, what's up guys? What's up, you coming into my house? You wanna hang out? You wanna have a time? Skip, what are you guys doing? What are you what are you doing? Why aren't you at work? Like no you guys are good. Maybe just one of you probably for now I don't think I could handle both at the same time if you know what I mean, are you looking at you? That's fun. Yeah, what are you guys doing? Who wants to who wants to come who wants to come first? I mean over here not I mean if you want to we could but I read that's probably what? You guys into this skip no. No the fuck is going on here. Sorry. I just I haven't really happened I Really haven't been able to practice my game in a while. You know what I'm talking about But can I see where the music is coming from? Yeah, it's behind him in a room Yeah, you can use like a serious understand him But yeah, it is probably just a stereo blaring in one of the rooms. I get frustrated trying to Figure out what the hell's going on with him and all the loud music So I just I want to go into that room and shut the music off. Okay, so Justin what is fast night doing? I want to shout downstairs for the the other Agents to come up here with us since we found skip sounds good Justin take your headphones off. Okay? Luke as Henry smoochy or rather Glick goes into you you walk right past him and he's like, oh, hey, this guy's up first sounds good and He gets this Huge smile on his face He follows you into the room where you're going to turn off the stereo and you turn it off It's dead silent. And when you turn around As his mouth just like fully opens up and coming out of it is this wiggling worm that is like It's got segments on it But more importantly on the tip of it is just this black gaping hole and on the outside of it there are four bone like needles that are coming out like Tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink and they all like a claw like a claw arm Basically in a machine where you win games, but this one they're made of bone and they are Extremely sharp and they are coming right for you Okay, wait just to clarify this thing came out of his mouth is it still connected to him or yes so it seems to be in order mouth worm thing and then Mouth on the end of the worm and then around the mouth are these Ford bone needles coming out also, I love watching Joe and Thomas's face as they're watching this Joe's face is Cracking me up. Anyway, I Need a roll from you Yeah, so get those dice ready. What are you doing to try to combat this or are you gonna happen? well, no, I Let out a scream like ah, oh actually roll sanity first just for important reasons Oh 27 on us 50. Okay, so you're still gonna lose one sanity. Okay, and you can scream if you want to Yeah, I scream and while I'm doing that I raise my shotgun up I don't and I pull the trigger but the safety's on What why would you make the safety on without rolling cuz I didn't turn it off cuz He was saying how he likes gun safety, so I try to do that and Before I can like flip it over to turn the safety off. I just like shove the barrel into the thing's mouth Okay, cool so I'll let you roll firearms if you want to if it's higher than melee weapons because you're using the firearm as a Melee weapon and I am rolling and I succeeded with a 28 Okay, I got higher firearms. So I I Got an 85. Oh I doubt that's a success.
