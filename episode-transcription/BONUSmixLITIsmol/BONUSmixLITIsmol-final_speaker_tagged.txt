You're in the den of sin or higher and thank you so much for joining us Here and now getting a little behind the scenes of how long it takes to start recording and for those of you who are listening Later thank you so much for being a patron on our patreon page super fucking cool of you. Yeah All over my body to play this game like I'm Ray Charles. So let's begin Right now It's the first week of January in the year of your choosing So you need to get your like financials in line now that way You can do better than the people who don't have knowledge Extreme cold front from the Northeast caused a 30 degree drop in ground temperature over a matter of hours simultaneously humidity reached a hundred percent and a thunderstorm Blanketed the region the rain already barely above freezing coated everything in layer upon layer of ice Roofs collapsed under four inch sheets trees exploded as SAP flash froze in the trunks transformers shorted out and fell flaming from their posts Cars not crushed by falling debris skidded off impassable roads or froze up Flights in and out of the area were canceled the governor declared the city a disaster area But the ice and continuing winter weather prevented dispatch of services inside LaFontaine a mothballed green box a Storage facility rented by the conspiracy in the old days sent a silent alarm to Delta Green on the night of the storm the contents of the box were never inventoried after the organizational restructuring in 2001 and Friendly caretaker on site is not responding Characters each get a call from a known Delta Green case officer the afternoon of January 5th The call comes in the unusual way in the usual unusual way From one of the half dozen numbers arranged ahead of time But which frequently change the caller did his best or her best to sound like they were Confirming an ordinary dinner or business meeting. They gave a time and place a private TSA conference room at Lambert Airport, st. Louis, Missouri 1145 p.m. That night it was up to each agent to make personal arrangements and get a last-minute flight to Lambert now I'm gonna have everyone else take off their headphones while we're recording each person's Introduction because there might be some stuff in the introduction that you don't want the other players to know and that's completely fine as your Delta Green agents, you won't know each other's identities because we're playing along the the actual rules is written Delta Green strategy So if you actually do learn information about each other I will probably have it come back to bite you at the end of the scenario because that's what happens with knowledge you get burnt Let's start. Let's go alphabetical order. So that begins with And when you are Wanted back Justin's not like oh, he's listening to his character voice. He's trying to get in character. I love it so, uh, whenever we want you back, we'll we'll do the the the classic
660.66 736.04 speaker3  I guess it's just your duty to know out the alphabet, which is cool with me You might not have gleaned from that last time though that he is a hitman he's a straight-up hitman He he goes he jet-sets around killing folks For the government for whoever because It's he just responds to his handler miss Turner who he's been with forever for as long as he can remember and He just drops everything at the at the drop of a hat to do whatever she asks. I
730.30 754.28 speaker2  Specifically asked Joe to play this character or at least like persuasively suggested it It was like one of he was one of my favorite characters we've had on the show. Sorry to interrupt carry on
749.94 846.58 speaker3  That said that he needed to report to Lambert Airport in st. Louis by 1145 she went ahead and arranged for the tickets and left me a credit card and $500 in cash and we also since this is kind of our thing. She has these custom-made carry-ons that hold Two pistols for him and she left all that at a dead drop for me and I just went on straight to the airport but before I left I Told the landlord of my apartment building that I needed him to look after the cat for me And he asked why and I said I was gonna go and assess the situation in La Fontaine, Missouri Because I had deduced that that would be the only reason they would send me to st Louis, Missouri during one of their Worst natural disasters ever and I've always felt like a little bit of the truth helps to sell a lie Yeah, as I was walking out the door, I remember that they're in the middle of an ice storm So I grabbed a really nice thick black pea coat and a wool stocking cap because I thought things might get chilly
840.22 893.70 speaker2  Middle of an ice storm. So that makes sense. Shall we bird? Shall we make our bird hands together? Oh Yes
888.66 1034.74 speaker3  Okay, interesting. So I don't know why I was doing that fun time voice, but you know My character's name is William T Wiggins he is a coroner in a small town in Illinois, so someone close to The East border with st. Louis. I'm gonna assume not too far He's a short and pale Lad with black hair like like jet black hair I Almost like to imagine like a middle part but like a handsome middle part like it looks better than the the normal one very sleepy Seems to always have his mouth covered by a scarf or a mask or shirt collar, etc He is always wearing a really nice suit even when he's doing his coroner duties and black leather gloves when he's not habits when he doesn't have the The medical gloves on he's very strange, but also quite good at his job Won't let him know that you did that cuz you're an omnipresent God in this world That's really cool of you So I wanted to have like surgical masks and gloves Leather gloves a scarf magnifying glass First aid supplies of some kind I didn't know if those are allowed If you were like, I'm a coroner it's a tool for me or is it too knife like
1030.54 1047.58 speaker2  Unless it's in your but you you could probably put it in your like checked luggage
1045.42 1101.10 speaker3  A necklace where like if he dies It brings him back to life and also there's a big gun that he can grab from another dimension and It does all it does to deep 30s of damage But I'm glad you let me have the necklace
1099.10 1119.42 speaker2  Hell yeah, that's up to you
1117.42 1292.92 speaker3  Whenever I got the call William was in the morgue doing his work slicing up bodies and whatnot When he got the call, I'm assuming it was probably in the middle of the night he dropped something into a cadaver and There's a personal familial emergency. I must see to Please take care of this any points inside of the corpse Mishap I'm sure you shall be rewarded Handsomely also, I don't know why we're cutting into this corpse Clearly he has been shot in the head multiple times and then he walks away from Thaddeus his only friend Do kind of whatever I'm very like on a whim. I'll just leave on a whim. I'll just leave He's used to me. Just kind of like getting getting weird about stuff and leaving but I'm good at my job. So he's like It's like a TV character when it's like oh, he's a detective who's super weird, but he's so damn good. We can't help it We have to keep hiring him like monk William is quite nice to him even though he's super weird and and He's kind of like a treats him like kind of like a son in a weird way Interesting side fact that I came up with before this while I was creating the character He is a I decided he is a in his off time. He likes to do fencing He thinks like everything else is stupid and not for smart people because he sucks Or are you trying to make fun of my character no
1290.92 1318.84 speaker4  Okay boy Oh
1316.76 1340.98 speaker2  Turn your microphone on
1338.72 1441.56 speaker1  former cop former undercover cop business my part partner dick hat-trick And I were on we were like snooping out for a PI job we had I get the call From The number that I don't recognize but I think I know what it is We're sitting in a car together and I when I talk I act like I'm talking to my daughter and After the phone call I look at him I'm like hey my Daughter just had a emergency. I don't really want to get into it, but I've got to go. Can you can you? Hold this down on your own Sure and then I get out of the car take a uber home get a backpack and fill it with Hand and feet warmers since I know I'm going somewhere cold I bring a smoke detector that is fake that has a camera in it.

1573.30 1598.26 speaker2  Yes, so you're gonna be playing a fee a FEMA oversight personnel like a suit so Are you going with mr. Lighthouse? Oh
1594.78 1638.66 speaker1  No, I'm I'm uh, that's just my Delta green
1636.66 1702.42 speaker3  Then I then my normal voice so So he excused himself to her and Years ago. She thought he was maybe like having an affair Just a boring like Like he hated his partner at that time Bummer that like big not like they couldn't work out but like they they solved this. They got the job done man, but like so she he what she watched him do that a few times and
1700.18 1713.94 speaker1  Yeah, they're they're detectives in both
1711.38 1749.94 speaker2  That's what that's what you need, right?
1747.54 1799.94 speaker3  But he is like he's got his Hold on. I pulled up the regulations He's got his unloaded shotguns and a locked hard-sided container as checked and declared luggage Two skeet shooting
1797.38 1813.82 speaker1  Towards a lighter more high-capacity
1806.98 1890.86 speaker3  While some law enforcement agencies have transitioned to larger calibers from the nine millimeter in recent years they do so that the expense of reduced magazine capacity more felt recoil and Isn't really as good as having a pistol you can shoot rapidly and accurately in terms of disabling someone He's got a good
1887.10 1934.70 speaker2  For sure old weather. Are you ready to give him the the birdie? Yes Luke asleep
1932.70 1962.66 speaker3  Oh Was trying to do an upper Midwest and I kept going wicked Irish. Oh, yeah. No mine. I already forgot Well, mine was so I'm gonna have to remember
1955.18 2375.18 speaker2  Louis allow the agents into the conference room inside is a balding man in his early 50s with a heavy pond And deep circles under his eyes. He does not offer his name here But the agents know him as DHS Special Agent Patrick Hill. They have met him before He's a Delta Green case officer and he arranges missions He's the go-between and cutout between the agents on the ground and the rest of Delta Green and the mission is the agents job The agents are his job. Ooh, what a cool thing to say Back before 9-11 people did our group's work out in the cold We got activated reactivated anyway during see during the transition decisions were made. I didn't make those decisions I don't know the people who did but they were made and now we're here. So I don't know more. I can't no more We're all only here because we were Missionary got it. Okay, so around sometime 2002 some team or another was tasked with repurposing assets from the old group into the new program you guys know with all them the government switch over there and at least one of the ones we knew about and to my Understanding it was it's like a cost risk analysis based on the needs of the moment and the current budget you know how this shit goes so Official locations just wasn't worth it in the end I don't know if it was because the contents were too volatile or Someone couldn't be bothered to find a truck or they didn't trust the transition. I don't know Okay, I mean it's the you know who these people are I wasn't there but one of those storage sites that they used was in La Fontaine Yeah, that La Fontaine the one from the news from the utility company one He looks down at his papers skip Mills To keep an eye on the place gave him some bullshit about maintaining a secret counterterrorism storage site or something Do it for God in country the typical patriotic make your life special bullshit I don't know. He was just strictly observing report didn't even have a key as far as I can tell But the idea was to come back to the Fox Got I got to find the Fox first, but then he's gonna come back to the box I suppose in a few months when when things that eventually settled down Well It's been a few months a Obsec clusterfuck you're preaching to the choir Obsec operational security clusterfuck for those of you who you know might do math out loud to people. They just met You're preaching to the choir Anyway, the site is designated GB to to for you know, like Security system sent a silent alarm to someplace way above my pay grade right and it reports a breach Shit is so far buried in the shuffle the nobody and signals pucks up on the damn thing until two days later That's when they dragged my ass out of bed. So we have nothing on the ground I don't know if this Mills was on the silent alarms call list or not All I know is that I can't get a hold of him, but then I can't get a hold of anyone Phone lines are down across the entire city. Most of the cell towers are dead Something like 70% of buildings are without power still Yeah, all the cell towers are dead. So I guess they're gonna miss out on anyway We're Blind down there. All we know is that the door to GB to to for has been opened for going on a week And we don't know what was inside. We don't know if this Mills guys on the level. We just don't know It leaves in a few minutes you're on an oversight group working for FEMA Don't abuse the cover. You're just suits. Okay, just watching you're making sure everything's going All right, and this legend is paper thin I can't for the life of me think of why anyone would put you all in the same room together. I mean Fucking lucky you is the best I can do on short notice Paperwork is on the table. I got you some office space squared away at the city utilities company Which is where that skip Mills guy was fuck knows. I spent enough time on the radio trying to find their boss From there find out where this Mills guy is and what he knows Head out to GB to 24 and inventory the content see if you can tell if anything's missing Okay, right because if you go there it's a green box the stuff in there Should be kept away from people and if it's missing Then other people are seeing it Nod your heads. Can I get nods? Good job, everyone. Fuck me. Okay. Now if something's out there You got to do it needs to be done text me if you need anything, but keep those messages There's a hundred miles of solid fucking ice around you in every direction and more alphabet soup Agencies and media in the theater than you can shake a dick at so don't expect miracles hell Don't expect anything You're on your own
2367.98 2377.18 speaker3  Neutralize whatever that might be and we have to talk to skip Mills and see what they are. That's the friendly
2375.18 2394.06 speaker1  That's the friendly
2388.14 2412.70 speaker2  You have fucking used my what the shit dude you introduced yourself as mr. Hill Oh
2408.82 2421.66 speaker3  Residence address for this skip Mills. I understand He was the attendant at the storage units, but you surely knew where he lived. He looks through these papers
2419.66 2462.94 speaker2  And he's like shit. I mean Boy yeah, where are we at here? Oh The apartment or it's a house. Yeah, I found the house. There's an address
2461.38 2478.36 speaker3  He's wearing a black pea coat You can tell that there's maybe a suit underneath and he's wearing a wool stocking cap and leather gloves and you reach down and grab your
2472.14 2503.22 speaker2  Identification as FEMA oversight and you can introduce yourself with whatever name is on it, which is oversight IDs
2501.22 2624.36 speaker1  agent or mr. But with a with a more FBI Henry smoochy on it tan like khaki duster on with black dress pants and Sun likes aviator sunglasses and a fedora. Ooh, but it looks cool Five-o'clock shadow 35 year old just average slightly more handsome than average but not like handsome enough to For anyone to be like wow, that guy's handsome. I thought you were gonna be like slightly more handsome than Thomas's Yeah, he just says I guess I'm Henry smoochy
2621.94 2721.10 speaker3  my character stands up he Addresses himself quietly. I am Terrence and he looks at his thing fast night I'm I am Terry. I'm Terrence fast night that that is Me you guys all feel really good about your chances average frame jet black hair with a middle part Dressed in like a nice Brown suit with a white dress shirt and tie He's wearing like a little Surgical mask over his His mouth. So sometimes it's a little hard to hear him and he's very he's a little quiet and reserved But he's very well dressed and seems put together. It looks very tired. And that's that's that's me. That's me, baby
2717.94 2807.28 speaker2  And because my uncle is money My uncle has money and unlike everyone else in the old family and he was like come up to Breckenridge I'll pay for everything and I was like, yes, please and when I got there I was like you have like equipment for me to use and he's like hell yeah And he starts cracking up and then he pulls out this full Baby blue like bright baby blue and bright orange like to head to toe back and forth like Badass like bright snow suit and it was so cool And every single person as I was like walking everywhere was like, holy shit that guy Oh my god, that's right. And then they saw me get off it like the green one like the easiest slopes and I'm like I actually lost a ski and had to like ask people to help me try to find my
2804.68 2825.10 speaker1  the razor crazy carts
2823.10 2851.70 speaker3  Do you guys want to spend your stimulus
2849.70 2925.52 speaker2  so I'm gonna go pee and We will jump into La Fontaine, Missouri Which is gonna be very cold. It's one of those like trucks military trucks with the covered wagon shit on the back and So you're gonna be in there packed with Blankets and food and clothing and shit just all packed in there so if you guys want to like do a quick think about how you might want to have a Conversation during this time so that we can get to know your characters and so that your characters can get to know each other Then that might be a good way to jump into the scenario
2923.08 2975.32 speaker3  But one of us did die and up in the battle I'm just gonna sit here and stare into space earlier when they left me alone We could do them together
2969.24 3006.44 speaker2  I saw my pit stains were getting they got out to the point to where my entire sleeve was covered at the bottom and
3000.88 3067.36 speaker3  It's like a it's like a baby kangaroo or a tiny loop once I clone myself
3062.76 3317.94 speaker2  Somebody ordered a cappuccino dry for me when like when I first started at the coffee shop and I was like Let's The briefing said LaFontaine was ill-prepared for winter weather The city had sold most of its salt trucks and plows to keep from declaring bankruptcy during the reception But nothing the reception heard you for this the reception they threw a massive reception And Yep, nothing prepared you for this level of destruction Nearly every road is blocked with felled trees phone and power lines dangle everywhere the few Emergency responders you see are still chiseling vehicles out of the ice like sculptures and most who succeed seem to have impotently skidded off the road The majority of homes remain damaged and without power their residents are left to freeze in winter temperatures Getting to the few operational shelters requires trekking on foot across the eerily beautiful city of ice Upon arrival They're crammed into crowded shelters filled with cots and hastily packed Suitcases and even the lucky ones with vehicles rugged enough to escape often have to find a path ahead through the felled trees and the roar of chainsaws is Constant even after five days relief teams have made scant headway a few major roadways are cleared and salted The commercial and university districts to the south have power restored inches through The north of LaFontaine is the oldest part of the city cut off from the rest by a moat of abandoned warehouses Railyards Factories and other remnants of the city's industrial past the massive old growth trees dotting its residential Neighborhoods caused more damage here than anywhere else The only lifeline south the Zora Neale Hurston bridge remains a clogged icy mess It will be difficult to tell who needs help in northern LaFontaine Only the locals can distinguish which homes were abandoned to the storm and which were left vacant by the real estate crash It appears that while the storm will certainly be expensive. None of the relief workers will be haunted by any lost lives So that's good everybody who's like seemingly got trapped in their houses and shit made their way to a shelter It's uncomfortable But patrols and emergency shelters are so far keeping those without power fed and warm And as you guys are rolling through the camera kind of like zooms up to the back of this Transport and then through we see soldiers in the very back and then like kind of a muffled wall and all throughout the middle aisle Just like clothes and food and blankets and supplies and then in the next part The four of you sit two on one side two on the other facing each other
3315.72 3345.80 speaker3  They just get they gave me and
3344.50 3361.24 speaker2  We don't have like prying ears
3359.24 3373.28 speaker3  eyes wide
3368.96 3383.96 speaker1  Yeah, mr. Mr. Fast Knight there so you're saying in real life you have a
3382.04 3397.14 speaker3  As far as I know I'm I'm still new to all this. I I I don't know. I know I'm needed and so I came well
3392.52 3421.22 speaker1  Cuz this there's a lot of it this job can be stressful in a lot of different ways and I think not being able to go by a pretty cool name is
3416.80 3428.54 speaker3  Am unaware of how the coolness of a name factors in to our mission
3426.44 3443.94 speaker1  we should be playing this by the book and
3437.88 3452.82 speaker3  Like surgical mask up over his thing because he's uncomfortable being in a crowded dirty truck
3450.82 3473.14 speaker1  Yeah, we just find We find skip Mills and
3470.26 3485.14 speaker3  Sought shelter, perhaps we can get records of
3480.94 3505.18 speaker1  Didn't he didn't he give us his his address where he's known to be now
3498.66 3592.30 speaker3  I'm suggesting that he might not be home. I suppose we could look at a map of some kind and if there's a shelter near his home that he'd probably go to the nearest one or The closest one to these storage Based Off
3588.78 3603.06 speaker1  Like damn it skip. We just can't have any more blood on our hands
3600.96 3684.18 speaker2  Pool parking lot around back generators cars are all back there and these trailers are popped up back there and as you guys go into the city utilities building you see Overworked receptionists do their best to calm the crowd Exhausted linemen trudge in and out returning for more equipment or just trying to catch a few minutes sleep in the locker room and as you guys walk in you see a woman who is short squat has big glasses and she's wearing a car heart pulled all the way down and She comes up and she's like, hey, hello. Hello. Are you the FEMA oversight group? It's nice to meet each one of you. Thank you so much and she goes to shake your hands
3682.18 3720.88 speaker3  Like he's waiting for someone to kiss it Very
3715.82 3732.66 speaker1  But where I come from, you know, you shake a hand if someone's trying to shake your hand. Yeah
3729.30 3848.10 speaker2  Well, I just heard it and so I responded role-playing Let's see tired and stressed out
3840.98 3865.14 speaker1  You know, we can't thank you enough we all as FEMA agents were responding to Springfield back in all seven. So So we know what it's like to go through this kind of major
3863.42 3918.06 speaker3  snow when too much is Snow When when too much is bad
3912.66 3923.52 speaker1  Yeah, we need to speak with mr. Mills, do you know where we might find him I wish oh my gosh
3918.06 3996.02 speaker2  If you could tell me where he is, that would make me a happy lady. But here I am. Look at my face Am I happy lady to you Professionals are here to really keep an eye on things and she like points around as you guys are about to open the door And you see that the parking lot has been cleared of its thick coat of ice and large Command tents and the diesel generators heating them take up the space nearest the building and otherwise the cold keeps the parking lot Mostly empty save when trucks drive in to be resupplied or repaired in and out as they go but as you guys move past those tents, you see there is a trailer that is a makeshift office It's the relief effort HQ and it's where you guys have been sent because you are the suits in charge How's that feel? It's just a disaster
3990.72 4016.40 speaker1  particularly think it's out of the ordinary if the federal government just really drops the ball on disaster response for a couple days, so It should I think it's more decent cover than we're being given credit for You
4012.36 4027.52 speaker2  Feeling inside his entire body when he was here. I'm sorry. I thought you left
4026.44 4045.68 speaker4  That way, you know
4042.56 4079.44 speaker2  We're gonna play this scenario as written so there will be a few times where so in Delta green if you just have a skill at a certain number you Pass so if you're not under stress and there's no like time limit on the thing We play a different way. And so here we are. So if any of you have humans at 30% say aye aye
4077.44 4103.40 speaker1  Yeah, like way above
4098.36 4298.32 speaker2  Government workers. Am I right? Some of them love some of them hate some of them come to work Some of them don't this guy dips out in the middle of a national emergency Maybe not national national for us. I mean my life is my country, you know, and so You would know that like she's pretty uncomfortable She's like very comfortable talking shit about him but you can tell that she was very very confused and then she says but I Will say when he did come in three days ago the last time he was here His face was covered in scratches and sweat and it was awful. He looked fucking terrible I am sorry for the cursing but this is an emergency and it's like theater in high school But boy howdy the last time he came in here it was I mean what he sees in his 30s early 30s people like that don't you know often? Meat that he wanted to fuck
4295.52 4331.32 speaker1  You know, it sounds like he was one horny dog and Those might have been those might have been love scratches, you know on his own face Yeah, cuz the your lover scratches. Yeah
4327.36 4336.24 speaker4  Do you know how much money and time it takes to get anywhere in this fucking city right now?
4334.44 4381.40 speaker1  So, you know it could take some time But money is a weird way to qualify how it would take to get down to a fellas house
4379.40 4396.64 speaker3  attractive to To some of us I think
4390.00 4407.88 speaker1  Predisposition against not natural. It's been ingrained by society against powerful women and it's really toxic You gotta get over it. You just need to learn to
4406.64 4451.44 speaker2  were You guys are so cold while you're having this conversation and you're all just looking at this door of this prefabricated trailer that is right in front of you before we jump into this and Joe will hop to you first, but due to the content of Delta green and role-playing games in general I know that we have an understanding of each other and that we are close friends and we have been playing together for a long Time and I've yet to have something happen in a game However, that's the goal. No
4449.44 4466.96 speaker4  Hold on to your butts
4459.26 4583.06 speaker2  So if anyone is made uncomfortable at any time by the what is happening either whether it's me doing it or someone else Doing it in a scene just say the word and we'll immediately fast forward like cut to the next scene and then afterward off-mic We'll talk about it and how we can do better and make sure that that wouldn't happen again Let's go Kraft mac and cheese. All right, so if anyone says Kraft mac and cheese out of context Then we know This is what the one you're looking for So Tanya drops off the group in front of Mills office and returns to her work and the prefabricated trailer suffices as a base from which
4580.04 4617.46 speaker1  You'd be well acquainted with what a sortie is sir What was that when we're besieged I'm gonna be in charge of things none of not you fellas Yeah, we probably would have positioned you somewhere
4615.46 4629.60 speaker2  Yeah, that's fine
4626.90 4643.42 speaker4  Give me that Mills mate. Oh boy Oh
4639.86 4672.28 speaker2  It's heated and as soon as you walk in you're like, oh
4667.88 4716.78 speaker1  So it should be easy to find in the file, but I'm gonna be off sync for the last
4710.58 4819.16 speaker2  You are stoked to be there there's a few fold-out tables a desk and a computer and The only other thing that you notice is it kind of smells What is that? Like Bradford pears weird, that's like real bad, right? you can't kind of focus in on a centralized place and it's the desk and if you're like Really moving your nose around the chair Behind the desk has a little bit stained on the front of it. And then if you bend over the underneath of the desk like if you're just like smelling around That's good audio You're just getting a nose full of this guy's jaw sauce Where his feet were is like the carpet is stiff and hardened and there is residue Stained under the desk like the up and up underneath it. So he's shooting up there
4817.04 4845.32 speaker4  So I was like I was reading this
4843.32 4902.60 speaker3  like raise his hand because He's like I Can do this and what do you do?
4897.88 5037.72 speaker2  You're going through the computer you notice that there is a program that monitors the power grid In the town the power grid monitor program, but it needs a separate password But as you're going through the computer you find Mills's home address like immediately On some correspondence or sorry, that's actually Joe you guys already had his home address but you confirm it here in the office and then the web history is really It's really horrifying Fast night as you're as you're scrolling through The the porn the porn the sheer amount of porn on this computer that has been that it was accessed three days ago all between like the hours of 630 a.m. And 1 p.m. On January 3rd Films of people Fucking each other this is getting it gets weirder and weirder and weirder and darker And then more violent and more violent and then like he is trying to find the most punishing Regardless of gender regardless of anything Anything it's all about how violent the videos can get and As you're just like looking through the names of these videos you have to roll sanity. Oh
5035.72 5057.48 speaker3  Nasty shit happening to bodies
5053.44 5072.26 speaker2  Smoochie who has searched and who has SIG it or criminology
5070.26 5083.00 speaker1  70 search and 50 criminology
5077.14 5141.56 speaker2  You guys see as you're looking about you see that on the backside of a desk calendar Ecclesiastes 28 is written on it in ink pen on the back of a calendar and Then go ahead and roll SIGINT or criminology, I believe that is He gets the gist of the history of what's going on on this computer and
5139.56 5156.20 speaker1  Have none, okay
5154.20 5173.92 speaker3  Explodes and kills me
5167.96 5224.64 speaker2  Going on and you see this power grid monitor program that's still up and you decide you're gonna try to get into it Right. And so as these boys are looking around the room, you're just like typing typing You're like, oh, I bet his password is his address and then he typed it in and then you're like, oh Mills and then you type it in and then you're like maybe skip Mills and then capital S skip Mills and you do it until it's like you've been locked out of the system and
5221.40 5340.98 speaker1  Forgive me pastor's son, but uh, f Ryan Is that right? I'm Which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are who overcome with wine Fat valleys, I guess that might be like a fupa there or something Don't laugh cuz you're about to laugh more because verse 2 starts Behold the Lord hath a mighty and a strong one Which as a as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters Overflowing shall cast down to the earth with that with the hand The crown of pride that drunkards of f Ryan shall be trodden under feet and the glorious beauty Which is on the head of the fat valleys shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer Which we need that looketh upon it seeeth while it is. I'm going way Irish Have you not looked this clue up before
5338.62 5369.62 speaker3  I don't see f from listed anywhere in here
5367.62 5384.66 speaker1  Okay, yeah Bacon well, well, we'll make note of that and you can recite it later if it comes up But I think that might just be the password for his computer. Have you tried that yet Terence?
5383.18 5433.58 speaker3  ashamedly looks Like it looks over. I I did I did too many. I did too many of the bad ones and Now we are all locked out of the computer the come pewter that would shake a normal person to their core, but one such as I is not phased by humanity's depravity
5429.74 5467.62 speaker4  What a cool sentence to say to new friends I
5464.14 5491.32 speaker3  But if you want it, okay, I roll to hear it roll to hear it. Oh
5488.34 5534.16 speaker1  So, what's the plan I think we ought to head to this guy's house
5532.16 5548.88 speaker3  You're feeling fucking good ad 15 sanities
5544.32 5553.96 speaker2  Someone comes up and says something not mean to you gain a sanity point Oh
5550.68 5566.52 speaker3  Poor Terrence, I feel like in this office There would be a paper map of the city for his records and I want to use it to try and locate
5560.20 5617.34 speaker1  His house in comparison to where we are how far away it is. Oh something also I meant to ask earlier is Access to the internet on our phones like when we go out and about we can download a local map of the area on Google Maps and Smoochy you were talking earlier at there about finding out where the shelters are you could get to Google in that while we have
5613.48 5637.00 speaker2  so the main shelter that's being used is
5635.20 5684.68 speaker1  Alright, give it a call Have a list of the people staying there like a check-in sheet of any kind, you know
5680.40 5706.68 speaker2  I'd say we got about half the people's names down right now, but we're working on it
5704.68 5742.20 speaker1  I
5740.20 5756.60 speaker2  I'm asking who you are first
5754.60 5835.66 speaker1  Could I have there was a phone in the office? Skip Mills office, but could I have call? well, they didn't have his name on the list there, but she also said that uh, Not everybody's name is listed. So I think that we should try his house first and and go there as a Bug backup plan
5831.64 5878.40 speaker4  Spider Wang spider Wang goose, whatever a spider King
5871.54 5932.00 speaker1  Well, okay, so it does bear noting that when we got the idea for letting you watch These recording sessions we didn't know they would very quickly become remote technological nightmares, yeah We thought it would be a fun time with us all in the room
5929.16 5940.52 speaker2  I'm gonna go pee and then let's crack back into this
5939.04 5946.36 speaker4  Joe
5940.52 5973.64 speaker2  Yo, Barry Fredrickson gonna look over for your name Fredrickson looking at the map while Smoochie is on the phone you notice that Skip Mills lives a few miles away from here in the north side of LaFontaine Earl's rent a space is on the way there. It's in between the two locations cool
5971.64 5999.16 speaker1  Shit I'm not a southern character And always have so don't let nobody tell you any otherwise and if I go leprechaun It's not because I'm actually secretly a leprechaun. So
5997.16 6004.80 speaker3  a
6003.72 6021.24 speaker4  Love it
6015.00 6073.24 speaker1  Definitely, I'm not this is you just know I'm not saying this is the group because we're not supposed to give out personal information but Definitely one of his kids is named skip and after seeing this come covered office. He's like Okay, okay so I I agree I think we should go find skip and then on the way back we can hit that storage box and if he I was gonna say maybe we should have that call that lady that Becky back and And say hey, could you just start looking around for old skip there? But maybe we don't want to alert him that we're on to him
6069.92 6076.04 speaker3  Perhaps you could have her call us if she discovers him there
6073.32 6144.40 speaker1  That's what I was getting at, but I don't want her tipping him off My conversation with that lady. I don't know if I could convince her to We got it. It's too cold and slippery out there. We got to take a vehicle I'm sorry, but I'm from the north and they're just you know, it it riles me up here and these folks say such
6140.28 6186.56 speaker3  Can we can we get a vehicle from the city utilities to use
6182.52 6214.92 speaker2  It's uh, it's not a little it's a lifestyle brand now and it also keeps you warm
6211.92 6268.24 speaker3  We need to borrow one of your big trucks Not the small ones but a big snow truck of some kind to
6262.40 6311.36 speaker2  Honestly, I'm out of my element here and it's not in the scenario What kind of vehicle would they be using to to drive around town?
6307.36 6451.34 speaker1  But it has big old monster truck wheels. Oh, yeah, we can do that. That's yeah We're in and in my backpack. I pull out what looks like a See if anybody comes back here You know I have like a hiker size backpack Put it on the ground and start pulling stuff out of it to show you guys I've got a bunch of hand and feet warmers just in case cool. I've got two GPS trackers like tiny GPS trackers I've got that smoke detector that I already stuck on the ceiling I've got a pair of night-vision goggles a pair of handcuffs a pair of binoculars and A grapple hook with 15 feet of rope tied to it. That's cool Joe
6445.02 6490.30 speaker3  He has like a leather. What do you call like us? What is it when it's like a little like a weird hard leather suit? scalpel and some other little metal instruments some gloves and surgical masks a magnifying glass some first-aid supplies a cool book and a lighter and some cigarettes and
6486.34 6553.74 speaker1  He has just like a carry-on like wheeling little suitcase thing and he's got some some warm sweaters some warm socks a book about like the history of the FBI like a Book about like an historical event in the 30s or something cool But then he also sets down like his his checked luggage and it's this big long hard case and you see two And it's pretty it's I've traveled all over with these before so is no problem checking them on the plane there So if anybody else needs if anybody thinks they're handy with a shotgun there
6552.46 6603.74 speaker3  character my Guy was very purposefully not telling them about the two guns that he has He discarded the carry-on and put him into holsters on underneath his coat and very specifically Only pulled out that notebook from inside his coat. He didn't open this coat. Fantastic. Yeah
6599.26 6658.26 speaker2  And you head a few miles to the home of skip Mills in LaFontaine and as you're driving through it's the same site that you saw earlier through the back of that truck the I mean I we live in the Midwest and we have the internet so we know what that looks like Didn't I moved here one year after I moved here in Oh eight?
6656.26 6672.10 speaker1  It was actually really fun
6667.02 6733.14 speaker2  You guys get out to this house in a dilapidated a dilapidated a dilapidated neighborhood a few miles from city utilities Nearly all the residences on this block are foreclosed and those that aren't are busy recovering from the storm The windows of this house have been papered as You park even you can hear jazz music loudly blaring From inside and as you all get out, I want you to tell me what you're bringing with you as you smell Who an odd stench that it seems really familiar since you've been in that office for a while But even through this like frigid air It's just Bradford Tree City out here is like you're walking through the campus of Missouri State University in fall jism
6727.52 6773.78 speaker1  But I bring with me one GPS tracker and then I put a new Set of foot warmers in my shoes and hand warmers and my gloves nice continue on staying warm, baby Under my under my parka as we step out of the monster truck
6770.14 6798.74 speaker4  Into my back pocket when you hop out. I look back at the truck
6796.70 6820.22 speaker3  Did you describe out of character the? Yeah, I think you said FBI mustache at one point nevermind. We don't necessarily know that you're
6815.42 6861.02 speaker1  Like me on one of these missions, but first of all, what do I mean by like me? I don't mean anything by like me because you don't know I'm no I'm no federal agent I'm a I'm a second Second Amendment enthusiast and
6855.74 6898.42 speaker2  This neighborhood is desolate. Honestly the idea of being inconspicuous in a place like this seems strange because when you look around it is Ghost town. I mean frozen iced over but still like there is nothing and the only the only reason that it feels Normal in any way is the music coming from this house, but that combined with the smell and also Come that's gonna come alive. Oh, yeah
6897.58 6908.46 speaker4  cube
6903.38 6930.78 speaker1  Behind the jazz and like a dog barking in the distance, but he doesn't see any other activity And he thinks about what he's seen on these on these missions before You know Dad might not be a bad idea there and I hand him I hand him one shotgun and I take the other
6926.58 6980.34 speaker2  intelligence or a science biology or a Now You could have sworn that you heard one. That's like
6978.34 6999.06 speaker1  It's always yeah, it's always good
6995.54 7011.22 speaker3  I assume that the this is a neighborhood that doesn't have power is that the case and If that is the case, do we see lights from the house that we're approaching?
7008.50 7138.76 speaker2  But you can kind of see some light through the paper but mostly you can tell that there is power due to You know the music blaring you can assume unless it was some sort of wireless speaker with a pre-charged phone easily possible in these times, however Most people aren't like flaunting their electricity or flaunting their battery life Yeah, and looking around like it said earlier You honestly can't really tell the difference between the homes that have been foreclosed And the ones that people are living in that don't have power anymore, but this definitely does seem like a place where? I don't know why that is if you arrived in st. Louis at 1245 Up and oh that makes sense they realize Yeah, and then like you know Gary wasn't there yet And so they had to wait on Gary and then they realized that they'd loaded up with the wrong supplies into this truck And so they had to switch them out with the supplies that were going into the other truck
7137.36 7197.16 speaker1  experience So we might want to keep those a little bit hidden, but why don't you talk to this fella, okay? Open it up
7190.00 7356.42 speaker2  Just like like almost like your hair just goes stands back as it's just like a waft a big waft of this smell that you have smelled now many times today that reminds you of Come I don't know. I'm trying to think of a different way to say that of like it reminds you of your room and Creator Mills has turned his home into a sickening tribute to the flesh The walls are plastered with pornography of every shade some printed from the internet and some from purchased Magazines the TVs and computer screens are all transmitting filth the home reeks of Organic decay and the heat is set as high as it will go except for Immediately taken aback by everything about this and oh geez cut monster Frederickson for God knows how long and maybe ever and As you are adjusting to the inside of this home
7354.54 7370.50 speaker0  Okay, so
7365.70 7387.74 speaker3  Trying to overcome how grossed out he is and using the time to like In his acclamation to the room. He's using it to scan the room and take it all in
7385.74 7525.52 speaker2  Okay, and what is your alertness? Mark Smith have human or downstairs Justin and Luke as you guys are heading upstairs go ahead and take your headphones off skips descent into madness It takes a path Seems to be layers and layers of pornography that he's can coon himself in with are getting more and more Violent more and more deviant and you kind of begin to think as you're looking around That this was some sort of attempt to cage himself in with his own twisted urges coating the walls and stimulation to prevent himself from leaving and This is not the house of a bachelor or at least not one as mundane as Mills was before the store because the interior design is gaudy and
7524.64 7533.48 speaker4  Oh
7528.96 7623.40 speaker2  He's got like one of those where you like walk up the set of stairs and then turn a corner to go up to the next set of stairs as soon as you hit that corner and you look up with Henry smoochy literally on your back like right looking over your shoulder the two of you see a man in his early 30s and He is completely naked He is emaciated and he looks gaunt and his eyes are like Completely like back in his head like he is not paying attention to you at all But his dick is in his hand and he's just like slowly like hitting it against his thigh you see something in his eyes and I walking towards you and he's like Hey
7621.40 7651.52 speaker4  You guys are real, right? Oh, yeah
7645.52 7714.76 speaker2  He puffs his chest out and he starts kind of like doing one of these where he's like kind of dancing Well a little shoulder movement side to side back and forth and his hips are kind of moving back and forth I mean over here not I mean if you want to we could but I read that's probably what? I Really haven't been able to practice my game in a while. You know what I'm talking about Yeah, you can use like a serious understand him
7711.80 7722.04 speaker1  Figure out what the hell's going on with him and all the loud music
7720.08 7836.24 speaker2  Justin what is fast night doing? Luke as Henry smoochy or rather He gets this Huge smile on his face He follows you into the room where you're going to turn off the stereo and you turn it off It's dead silent. And when you turn around As his mouth just like It's got segments on it But more importantly on the tip of it is just this black gaping hole and on the outside of it there are four bone like needles that are coming out like Basically in a machine where you win games, but this one they're made of bone and they are Mouth on the end of the worm and then around the mouth are these Ford bone needles coming out
7834.24 7865.72 speaker4  well, no, I
7862.48 7893.30 speaker1  I don't and I pull the trigger but the safety's on Before I can like flip it over to turn the safety off. I just like shove the barrel into the thing's mouth
7889.40 7898.84 speaker2  Melee weapon and I am rolling and I succeeded with a 28
7896.84 7926.34 speaker1  I Got an 85. Oh
7924.34 7965.62 speaker3  I heard some screeches
7962.10 8084.94 speaker2  Conflagration, what's that word mean? So a proactive re envisioning Completely silent and then you would hear Henry smoochie scream out and then the two of you decide You see that Terrence fast night is at the corner turn of the stairs waiting for the two of you and you both approach just in time To see Henry smoochie get pushed out of this room Backwards so he's flying out of the doorway of this room up against the wall And he slams is the back of his head into the wall and you see right on top of him right in front of him Is a naked? bleeding cut-up emaciated gaunt just disgusting human being with his dick out and He more importantly than the dick out Protruding from this man's mouth is this weird segmented worm and you see from the side you've got these bony needles that are extremely sharp and there are four of them on the end of this like worms mouth that are coming out and they are attached just on either side of the eyes and just inside the jaw of Henry smoochie and this worm is truck is slowly going into like the bones are holding it in place and the worm is like moving slowly and Trying to wiggle its way into the mouth of Henry smoochie and that is where we're gonna call it for this evening
8082.94 8106.78 speaker0  Thing cooking up
8102.86 8120.56 speaker3  Didn't think nothing else bad bad was gonna happen. I could make it really easy for you
8117.06 8144.22 speaker1  Want to make it easier for you, I was just gonna shoot the creature but I You
