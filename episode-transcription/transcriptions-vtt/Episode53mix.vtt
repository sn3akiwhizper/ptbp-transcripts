00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
What is crackin' my babies? Answer, my bones. Constantly.

00:06.400 --> 00:17.900
It's your bone daddy Wolf the dog, here to delight and fright as I hit you with the news both past and present from 694.2 PTBP.

00:17.900 --> 00:23.900
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at witch.hazels on Instagram,

00:23.900 --> 00:32.000
who created a stellar piece of art depicting Sharon Shadow Berryman, Liz Lonklin, and Judy Krenkelhoff.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.800
Seriously, go check it out. They right.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.500
Hi, Mr. The Dog. Hazel and Pals here.

00:39.500 --> 00:45.100
Sorry we had to send this message by Raven. They're basically rats where we're from.

00:45.100 --> 00:49.100
So why not catch one and convince it to be an errand boy?

00:49.100 --> 00:53.700
Just wanted to thank y'all for consistently putting out amazing content.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.600
The show got me through a hard time this year.

00:56.600 --> 01:05.000
Let's my group of cucks and I share endless laughs and spooks, and inspires us in our own tabletop misadventures.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.300
Mini-cacophonous Howls, Hazel, Alia, Britt, Flynn, Gabby, and Liam.

01:12.300 --> 01:21.000
Haha, please. My father was Mr. The Dog. You can simply call me Wolf... The Dog.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.800
I have an unkindness of ravens constantly circling my general area.

01:26.800 --> 01:31.100
Maybe they can smell the death on me and mine.

01:31.100 --> 01:33.400
But who knows?

01:33.400 --> 01:38.900
I'm glad we can put out something that can fright and excite you simultaneously, Hazel.

01:38.900 --> 01:45.100
Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter,

01:45.100 --> 01:47.400
tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,

01:47.400 --> 01:53.600
or write a five-star review on iTunes and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.300
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, that insatiable invertebrate.

01:57.300 --> 02:05.100
And the dudes from PretendingToBePeople want me to remind you they are accepting questions for a third Q&A episode.

02:05.100 --> 02:13.000
So, if you have questions for any of the trash bags that make that show, tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.200
There's also a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.000
Or email them to PretendingPod at Gmail.com.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
Or go all out, record audio of you asking your question and send that so they can use it in the episode.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.200
Similar to the second Q&A episode, this one will be exclusive for our honorary police officers over on Patreon,

02:36.200 --> 02:40.000
who keep this show alive five bucks a month at a time.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.800
Those beautiful people who hold that dirty title currently have access to six exclusive bonus episodes,

02:47.800 --> 02:50.700
and that number is growing each month.

02:50.700 --> 02:57.000
Now, if you want a question answered, but you can't afford that Patreon lifestyle, fear not.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.300
The PTBP crew will answer some of the questions they don't get to in the Q&A session right there on the internet.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.900
Maybe your question will be one of them.

03:06.900 --> 03:12.900
Or maybe you don't give two fucks about the cucks who run amok to chuck this deluxe guck.

03:12.900 --> 03:18.000
In which case, you probably want me to shut the fuck up and deliver the news.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.300
Last time, Judy's body got taken over, Ash freaked out and ran away from the stakeout with the feds,

03:25.300 --> 03:34.100
Ken realized he's in the crawl space under the cabin, Jeremy found a closet of sorts, and Liz Longlin lost a noggin.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.900
Let's get right back into the business.

03:36.900 --> 03:41.100
It's Blue False Indigo with Moondance.

03:41.100 --> 03:51.100
She runs.

03:51.100 --> 03:57.100
Ooh.

03:57.100 --> 04:03.100
The sun.

04:03.100 --> 04:08.100
Is sleeping soon.

04:09.100 --> 04:14.100
She knows.

04:14.100 --> 04:20.100
That the time has come.

04:20.100 --> 04:42.100
To dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the moon.

04:42.100 --> 04:49.100
Ash Hornbeam. It's completely dark outside, and it's pouring down raining.

04:49.100 --> 04:57.100
You are only seeing where your feet are taking you, splashing in all this mud by the moonlight,

04:57.100 --> 05:03.100
and the pretty consistent lightning flashes illuminating everything around you.

05:03.100 --> 05:08.100
You make your way onto the trail and continue running.

05:08.100 --> 05:19.100
And in the distance, you see Judy Krinklehoff, sister, older sister of your friend Ken Krinklehoff, walking toward you.

05:19.100 --> 05:25.100
Judy!

05:25.100 --> 05:28.100
Uh, hi, hi, hi.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.100
What are you doing here?

05:29.100 --> 05:33.100
I was just walking, uh, in the woods, uh, for a walk.

05:33.100 --> 05:37.100
I assume I'm running the opposite way that she's walking.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.100
Yeah.

05:38.100 --> 05:43.100
I grab her by the arm, and, uh, I just hold onto her, and I bring her with me, and I'm like,

05:43.100 --> 05:45.100
We have to get out of here!

05:45.100 --> 05:47.100
I go with him.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.100
Okay. She goes with you.

05:49.100 --> 05:55.100
I start running down the trail. Is this the trail that leads to the campsite?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.100
Yes.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.100
I head towards the campsite.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.100
You arrive at the campsite.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.100
What do I see?

05:59.100 --> 06:13.100
Fire was never made, so it's kind of hard to tell where it is, but you see, getting soaked by the rain are your bags and everyone's gear that was brought into the woods with you.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.100
Do I see the naked man?

06:15.100 --> 06:19.100
No, you do not. The rope that was tied around the tree is no longer there.

06:19.100 --> 06:27.100
As soon as we get to the campsite, I just fall on my knees, and I'm on all fours, gasping for air.

06:27.100 --> 06:30.100
I look at Judy.

06:30.100 --> 06:34.100
Kin fell. Kin fell. Kin fell in a hole? Kin fell in a hole.

06:34.100 --> 06:37.100
Uh, yeah, I can.

06:37.100 --> 06:42.100
That sucks that Kin fell in the hole. That sucks that he fell in the hole.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.100
But it wasn't...

06:45.100 --> 06:49.100
It wasn't a real hole. He just fell through...

06:49.100 --> 06:52.100
He fell through the...

06:52.100 --> 06:54.100
He fell through the earth.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.100
I saw it happen. He just disappeared.

06:56.100 --> 07:04.100
I think that you don't know what you're talking about, and maybe we should find some big rocks to make a shelter to get rid of the rain?

07:04.100 --> 07:11.100
Ash just looks down at his hands covered in dirt and mud and muck and...

07:11.100 --> 07:17.100
You see there's hand sanitizer sitting on the... I don't know if you wanted to use it.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.100
No.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.100
Clean off your hands.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.100
Ash is freaking out, and he doesn't know what to do.

07:22.100 --> 07:26.100
Judy pats him on the back, and then just walks away and starts looking for rocks.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.100
Okay.

07:27.100 --> 07:33.100
When Judy pats Ash on the back, he throws up like a burped child.

07:41.100 --> 07:50.100
As you finish throwing up like the fucking child that you are, you're bent over, just like hands on your knees.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.100
Hands on the ground.

07:51.100 --> 07:57.100
Hands on the ground, knees on the ground, just vomiting, and Judy finds a couple of big rocks.

07:57.100 --> 08:06.100
I find some big rocks. I set them down next to you, and I am looking at them, picking them up, then I'm looking over at Ash.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.100
Then I go back to look for some more rocks, and I'm like,

08:09.100 --> 08:15.100
Ash, maybe you should just sit still for a little while and just try to breathe.

08:15.100 --> 08:19.100
I'm really nervous about you. You seem to be acting really weird.

08:19.100 --> 08:22.100
He sits down cross-legged.

08:22.100 --> 08:29.100
He starts to think about just what he's seen in the past minute and a half, two minutes.

08:29.100 --> 08:41.100
He is torn between going back to where he fled from to go find his friend, but also this is his crush.

08:41.100 --> 08:57.100
So you don't want to leave. I don't want to leave.

08:57.100 --> 09:00.100
Does Judy know you have a crush on her?

09:00.100 --> 09:01.100
No.

09:01.100 --> 09:12.100
So he sits cross-legged, and Ash sits there looking just at his hands, and he's freaking out, and he wants to go back to the cabin, but he waits for Judy.

09:12.100 --> 09:23.100
Okay, so Judy is frantically looking for a rock, and then I walk up behind Ash, and I hit him on the head with a huge rock.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.100
Luke staring at me.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.100
You're trying to hurt me?

09:25.100 --> 09:26.100
Yeah, absolutely.

09:26.100 --> 09:33.100
This is like a gimme because he is not paying attention at all, so just roll damage for me.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.100
So you're going to roll 1d6 for damage.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.100
Okay. I got a six.

09:38.100 --> 09:42.100
How many hit points do you have, Ash Hornbeam?

09:42.100 --> 09:46.100
Two. I started with seven, so that would have basically killed me anyway.

09:46.100 --> 09:51.100
Ash Hornbeam, what are you thinking about as the lights go out?

09:51.100 --> 10:08.100
I'm hit in the head with a rock. I'm kind of spun around to where I fall on my back facing Judy, and the last thought before my lights go out is, every girl I've ever liked has hurt me.

10:08.100 --> 10:32.100
Oh no!

10:32.100 --> 10:33.100
Joe?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.100
Hey.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.100
It's dark, man.

10:36.100 --> 10:41.100
I mean, I guess the flashlight's on now. It's not as dark.

10:41.100 --> 10:45.100
My one clinging to hope. A little light.

10:45.100 --> 10:51.100
And you see the door on the other side. You see these tubes.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.100
I think I put my ear to the door is where we left off.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.100
Joe?

10:56.100 --> 11:04.100
Ken Krenkelhoff has his ear to the door leading up to the inside of this cabin, you would assume.

11:04.100 --> 11:09.100
And you hear, muffled in the distance,

11:09.100 --> 11:12.100
Let's run!

11:12.100 --> 11:17.100
Get the fuck out of here!

11:17.100 --> 11:22.100
Like, through the door, or like from back where I came? From back up the slide?

11:22.100 --> 11:25.100
Just from somewhere in the distance, you can't quite tell.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.100
Shit. Can I tell the voice that was yelling?

11:28.100 --> 11:30.100
It was Jeremy Pettymore.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.100
I figured. I'm going to try to open the door.

11:33.100 --> 11:37.100
You open the door, and you poke your head up.

11:37.100 --> 11:45.100
Very, very cautiously, this whole action is, I'm moving so slowly and so scared that it's imperceptible.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.100
Roll stealth for me.

11:47.100 --> 11:52.100
Okay. Yeah, I'm actually decent.

11:52.100 --> 11:58.100
But I do not pass. A 67 on a 50.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.100
This door just makes a dumb amount of noise.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.100
Damn it.

12:02.100 --> 12:09.100
And it doesn't seem to matter as you get your head up into the room, as the room is empty.

12:09.100 --> 12:13.100
This is not the inside of a cabin.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.100
This is a lab.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.100
Okay.

12:17.100 --> 12:32.100
All around the room, there are these same tubes that are translucent, and filling them all is this black liquid substance that is oozing through the tubes and going down into the floorboards.

12:32.100 --> 12:45.100
And you would see they're coming from these like stations that are long, about like three feet long and two feet wide.

12:45.100 --> 12:49.100
And there are these like coffin-shaped boxes.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.100
Okay. Is the room lit in any way?

12:51.100 --> 12:57.100
It is. It is completely lit by lights.

12:57.100 --> 13:05.100
Just as a normal cabin would be, it's got electric to it and a lot of like white light, like laboratory lighting, right?

13:05.100 --> 13:06.100
Fluorescent?

13:06.100 --> 13:14.100
Yeah. And I think as you get up into the cabin and start looking around, you would also see there is a wooden trunk.

13:14.100 --> 13:17.100
A large wooden trunk up against the wall.

13:17.100 --> 13:21.100
And there is a desk with papers littered all over it.

13:21.100 --> 13:27.100
Other than the desk with papers, is there anything written anywhere? Can I glean any...

13:27.100 --> 13:33.100
Is there maybe a brand on the machines or is there signage on the walls like, wear your lab coat or anything like that?

13:33.100 --> 13:41.100
No signage whatsoever. The only things that are written are really on this desk and then on this bulletin board above the desk.

13:41.100 --> 13:49.100
I'm going to investigate the desk and the bulletin board and just, if I feel, if I feel sufficiently alone, I'm going to take my time.

13:49.100 --> 13:53.100
Uh, okay. I think you likely...

13:53.100 --> 13:58.100
I haven't heard anything since I've been up here that would make me think there's somebody else in this room or...

13:58.100 --> 14:02.100
Go ahead and roll an alertness for me.

14:02.100 --> 14:05.100
I pass a 21 on a 50.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.100
You hear a...

14:06.100 --> 14:19.100
Out the window and looking out the front window of this cabin, you see Liz Lonklin and Jeremy Pettymore on the other side of a moat that is outside this cabin.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.100
Seemingly surrounding it about five feet wide.

14:22.100 --> 14:29.100
And on the other side, Jeremy Pettymore and Liz Lonklin are running and you look over at the exact moment.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.100
Liz Lonklin stops dead in her tracks.

14:33.100 --> 14:42.100
A massive metal claw from a branch on a tree right above her swings down, decapitating her.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.100
Oh no!

14:44.100 --> 14:52.100
And blood just spurts and squirts. Like when you're peeing after you had sex and it just goes everywhere.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.100
Uh huh.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.100
That's the blood coming out of Liz Lonklin's body.

14:56.100 --> 15:00.100
You know how to paint such a picture for me, Zach. Thank you. Thank you so much.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.100
I do it specifically for each person.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.100
Oh fuck.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.100
Real sanity.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.100
Yeah. No problem.

15:14.100 --> 15:18.100
Oh my god, I pass a six on a 29.

15:18.100 --> 15:23.100
Okay. I think you're just going to go with your usual idea, which is...

15:23.100 --> 15:24.100
That didn't happen.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.100
That's not real.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.100
There's no way that happened.

15:26.100 --> 15:29.100
This is some kind of television screen monitor here at this window.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.100
Exactly. To show you a scary thing.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.100
It's trying to scare me.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.100
After that happens, what's Jeremy doing? Where's the last place I've seen you?

15:35.100 --> 15:38.100
He's gone. He dipped. He just kept running.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.100
Oh god.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.100
He just kept running.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.100
Oh my god.

15:41.100 --> 15:46.100
Well, I don't want to go outside where the claw that decapitates people is.

15:46.100 --> 15:50.100
So I'm going to turn around and look at this desk.

15:50.100 --> 15:53.100
So of course, naturally after seeing that, you want to read some papers.

15:53.100 --> 15:58.100
I want to do some accounting to make sure other decimal points are in the right places.

15:58.100 --> 16:06.100
You see the articles of organization for a new business called Cole's Orphanage.

16:06.100 --> 16:10.100
New school under modern etiquette.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.100
Okay.

16:11.100 --> 16:19.100
And all of the other papers are plans for a gun that is being created.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.100
Oh my god.

16:20.100 --> 16:26.100
And looking at the plans, it seems to have been recently completed.

16:26.100 --> 16:33.100
There are also plans for small metal spheres, one inch in diameter.

16:33.100 --> 16:42.100
And looking at the plans, it seems that they are being put into small human bodies.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.100
Yeah, I was going to say that when I see the Cole's Orphanage thing,

16:45.100 --> 16:49.100
I take a weary glance at the three feet long coffins.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.100
Uh-huh.

16:52.100 --> 16:55.100
Oh no. Oh no.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.100
Can I go through the drawers of the desk?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.100
Sure.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.100
I just want to see if I can find anything.

17:01.100 --> 17:06.100
I've got my spear still, but I think I'm kind of panicky just looking for anything I can.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.100
Okay, roll search for me.

17:08.100 --> 17:15.100
And that'll give you a good old, a very interesting piece of information.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.100
Fuck.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.100
Don't pass. A 97 on a 50.

17:18.100 --> 17:22.100
You're in no state to be reading in detail anything, really.

17:22.100 --> 17:26.100
You're just looking over these plans in a very broad, vague sense.

17:26.100 --> 17:34.100
Okay, going back to survey mode, is this room four walls or is there other places I can go in here?

17:34.100 --> 17:35.100
Just four walls.

17:35.100 --> 17:38.100
Is there only the front door out of this place?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.100
Yes.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.100
And it's kind of by the window that I just saw terrible things happen?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.100
Yes.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.100
Fuck.

17:43.100 --> 17:50.100
When you walk over and look at that window, you see that there's also another building within the premises of this moat.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.100
Okay.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.100
Being surrounded by the moat.

17:52.100 --> 17:59.100
And it is smaller than this cabin and the door is open and there's a light coming out of it.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.100
Can I see any shadows in the light?

18:00.100 --> 18:03.100
You see no shadows in the light.

18:03.100 --> 18:08.100
Yeah, I want to, I don't know, I kind of want to look at a coffin.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.100
Can I see, does it open in any way?

18:10.100 --> 18:12.100
Oh yeah.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.100
I want to open it.

18:14.100 --> 18:20.100
Wait, if I can see into the coffin at all and there's black goo in the coffin itself, I don't want to open it.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.100
But if it's opaque, I guess I'm going to open it.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.100
It is opaque.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.100
I'm opening it.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.100
Go, oh fuck.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.100
Roll dexterity.

18:31.100 --> 18:36.100
Roll dexterity to see how quickly this happens.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.100
I pass a 35 on a 75.

18:39.100 --> 18:47.100
You open up this coffin and this black viscous, sludgy, oily goo starts pouring up out of it,

18:47.100 --> 18:51.100
all over the table that it's on, and then onto the floor.

18:51.100 --> 18:57.100
And you get out of the way just in time to not touch any of this, but it is starting to spread throughout.

18:57.100 --> 19:06.100
And as it dissipates out of this coffin, you see that inside the coffin, there is a two-year-old body.

19:06.100 --> 19:08.100
Oh no.

19:08.100 --> 19:17.100
That is not quite human-looking, as if it is being 3D printed and it is not finished.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.100
Oh my god.

19:19.100 --> 19:20.100
Wow.

19:20.100 --> 19:24.100
So it's like all the edges aren't sharp yet, everything's smooth.

19:24.100 --> 19:30.100
So picture a face with a plastic bag over it, that's what this face looks like.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.100
I can totally picture it, holy shit.

19:32.100 --> 19:39.100
In my haste backwards, do I have time to maybe close the lid so it's not pouring out more?

19:39.100 --> 19:40.100
Probably not.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.100
Probably not.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.100
Okay.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.100
Then I am going to run out the front door.

19:44.100 --> 19:48.100
And when I say run out the front door, I am panicking running to the front door,

19:48.100 --> 19:53.100
but when I get to the door, I want to try and gingerly open and close it behind me.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.100
Okay.

20:02.100 --> 20:13.100
Jeremy Pettymore, you're running through the woods.

20:13.100 --> 20:20.100
Rain is pouring down on you and you're splashing in puddles and mud is splashing up onto your pant legs.

20:20.100 --> 20:24.100
And the dark night sky is being lit by the moon.

20:24.100 --> 20:29.100
And all these lightning flashes that keep illuminating everything around you.

20:29.100 --> 20:36.100
You've seen so much shit tonight that every single time lightning flashes, you think you see something off in the woods.

20:36.100 --> 20:40.100
And then eventually you do see a figure walking toward you.

20:40.100 --> 20:45.100
And it is Judy Krinklehoff, the older sister of Ken Krinklehoff.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.100
Judy, where the fuck did you come from?

20:47.100 --> 20:53.100
I was just walking in the woods and I saw you and you're running and your clothes are all cattywampus and I don't know what to do.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.100
Cattywampus?

20:54.100 --> 20:55.100
Nevermind.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.100
Nevermind.

20:56.100 --> 21:00.100
Anyway, wait, were you with the girls?

21:00.100 --> 21:02.100
No, they ran away and they left me.

21:02.100 --> 21:05.100
I was in the shackled by myself and then I had to run and find help.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.100
What shack?

21:06.100 --> 21:08.100
The shack up at the front by the parking lot.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.100
The parking lot?

21:09.100 --> 21:11.100
We should go back there.

21:11.100 --> 21:15.100
Okay, I'm just really scared so can you just stay really close to me please?

21:15.100 --> 21:16.100
I guess.

21:16.100 --> 21:20.100
You're like three years older than me and at this point in our life cycles that's like,

21:20.100 --> 21:28.100
really, honestly, I feel like you're an adult figure and I'm like, okay, but damn.

21:28.100 --> 21:33.100
I know, but like size-wise and body-wise and like how are puberty cycles have been working?

21:33.100 --> 21:40.100
Like you are significantly larger than me so if somebody tries to come and get us you could probably kill them first so can you please just go in front?

21:40.100 --> 21:49.100
Jeremy has like never heard more overshuring but he's like, okay, and he runs in front of her.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.100
And he doesn't look back.

21:56.100 --> 21:59.100
Okay, so you're running, I guess, in front of me?

21:59.100 --> 22:00.100
Yeah.

22:00.100 --> 22:09.100
So I run up behind him and I pull the machete out from behind my shorts and I stab him in the back multiple times.

22:09.100 --> 22:14.100
Well, I'd like to avoid that if I could.

22:15.100 --> 22:25.100
Jeremy Pettymore, I'm going to need you to roll an alertness at a negative 40 because of the situation you're in to even roll dodge against her.

22:25.100 --> 22:28.100
Right, I've got to get below a 10.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.100
24.

22:30.100 --> 22:35.100
You do not notice and therefore there will be no opposed check here.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.100
So are you stabbing?

22:37.100 --> 22:38.100
You're stabbing multiple times?

22:38.100 --> 22:39.100
Yeah, I'm stabbing.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.100
Okay, so we're going to roll melee.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.100
What is your melee?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.100
You're going to have a bonus.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.100
I have a 40.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.100
Plus 20.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.100
Okay.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.100
I got a 66.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.100
That is a critical failure.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.100
Oh, fuck.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.100
I kind of wanted it for her.

23:03.100 --> 23:04.100
What the hell?

23:04.100 --> 23:18.100
He screams as Judy Krinklehoff goes to stab him in the back, missing desperately and falling forward, tripping on the mud and the rock underneath her and landing directly on the machete face first.

23:18.100 --> 23:42.100
As the machete slides its back between a crevice of two rocks on the trail and her face falls directly into it, splitting her skull wide open enough for Jeremy Pettymore to see a small one inch in diameter silver sphere in the middle of her head and black ooze begins gushing and running out from underneath it.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.100
Roll Sanity, Thomas.

23:44.100 --> 23:51.100
Jeremy Pettymore has no idea what that is, but Thomas Cox is gaining a new understanding of the central mystery.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.100
Fucking 19.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.100
Jeremy Pettymore is fine.

23:58.100 --> 24:01.100
Always has been, always will be.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.100
Jeremy Pettymore, what are you going to do?

24:03.100 --> 24:04.100
Run.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.100
Let me do that when I'm not yawning.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.100
Is this game boring?

24:09.100 --> 24:10.100
Run.

24:13.100 --> 24:14.100
Run.

24:16.100 --> 24:18.100
Go fuck yourself.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.100
It's late.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.100
Late.

24:47.100 --> 24:48.100
How did you know my theme song?

24:48.100 --> 24:49.100
I never sang it for you.

24:49.100 --> 24:50.100
That's awesome.

24:50.100 --> 24:53.100
I read your dream journal.

24:53.100 --> 25:00.100
Ken Krenkelhoff walks out of the cabin, out of the front door, onto the front porch.

25:00.100 --> 25:04.100
You see three figures approaching.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.100
It's raining.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.100
It's dark.

25:07.100 --> 25:14.100
The moonlight is revealing part of them, but then a lightning strike reveals three individuals.

25:14.100 --> 25:17.100
They're all wearing black suits with white shirts.

25:17.100 --> 25:21.100
Two of them have black ties and one is wearing a bolo tie.

25:21.100 --> 25:24.100
Ooh, the cool one.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.100
Obviously.

25:25.100 --> 25:29.100
The tall one has got buzzed blonde hair.

25:29.100 --> 25:34.100
The man with the bolo, shorter, pants pretty tight.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.100
He's got a thick mustache.

25:36.100 --> 25:42.100
And then the third is a woman and she is smiling.

25:42.100 --> 25:47.100
A cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.100
Oh, you fucker.

25:49.100 --> 25:51.100
Covering one of her eyes.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.100
Oh my god.

25:52.100 --> 25:57.100
And they see you and she begins chanting.

25:57.100 --> 25:59.100
Where are they in relation to me?

25:59.100 --> 26:01.100
Are they inside the moat perimeter?

26:01.100 --> 26:06.100
They are just on the other side of the moat, walking toward you pretty slowly.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.100
I want to run.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.100
I want to get away from that.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.100
That's creepy chanting, lady.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.100
Roll power.

26:13.100 --> 26:19.100
Oh, it's my second worst stat.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.100
She rolled a 20.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.100
I fail.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.100
61 on a 35.

26:24.100 --> 26:29.100
As you turn back to go into the cabin, when you reach out to open the door,

26:29.100 --> 26:36.100
your hand phases into the door and you feel a slight push behind you.

26:36.100 --> 26:43.100
And your body moves toward and into the door of the cabin.

26:43.100 --> 26:51.100
Wood fills your body as the thoughts in your mind go out of existence

26:51.100 --> 27:03.100
into the door of the cabin, killing Ken Krenkelhoff in an extremely similar way to Clark Bishop's parents.

27:03.100 --> 27:05.100
Yep. Holy fuck.

27:05.100 --> 27:17.100
Your mind still works for just long enough for you to watch as these three people ransack this cabin.

27:18.100 --> 27:24.100
As soon as they come in, one of them starts yelling about the ooze that is all over the floor.

27:24.100 --> 27:31.100
Another one grabs a bucket and runs out to the moat, comes back in with a bucket full of water,

27:31.100 --> 27:35.100
and splashes it on the ooze, pushing it backward.

27:35.100 --> 27:38.100
Two of them grab the trunk and they leave.

27:38.100 --> 27:40.100
One of them comes back in.

27:40.100 --> 27:51.100
It's the woman, and she starts chanting again, and the entire place begins to light up in flames.

27:51.100 --> 27:58.100
Ken Krenkelhoff dies burning as part of the cabin in these contention woods.

27:58.100 --> 28:05.100
Jesus God. Oh, that's awful.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.100
He was conscious for some of that.

28:08.100 --> 28:10.100
Oh, no.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.100
Thomas Jeremy Pettymore is fucking running.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.100
Yeah, he is.

28:27.100 --> 28:34.100
Are you going to stop by your campsite before you bail to grab your bag of things?

28:35.100 --> 28:40.100
No, I assume he has the pistol on him, and otherwise he is just fucking booking it.

28:40.100 --> 28:47.100
He's seen Ken disappear, Ash is apparently stuck in a tree somewhere that no one could find,

28:47.100 --> 28:52.100
so he is just fucking booking it back to the ranger station.

28:52.100 --> 28:57.100
Okay, when you make it back to the ranger station, you see there's one light that is shining down,

28:57.100 --> 29:01.100
like a streetlight on the parking lot. It's flickering.

29:01.100 --> 29:05.100
Rain is torrential downpour at this point. You are completely soaked.

29:05.100 --> 29:12.100
You've got some blood on your shoes from where Judy Krenkelhoff fell on that machete,

29:12.100 --> 29:20.100
and it splattered out onto you, and it's probably washed off with the mud and the wet at this point,

29:20.100 --> 29:28.100
but you see from the moonlight shining down a reflection on all this water that's pouring from the sky,

29:28.100 --> 29:33.100
and the lightning strikes are illuminating everything around you.

29:33.100 --> 29:41.100
You're all alone in the parking lot, and you see there's the car, the notice on the driver's side window.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.100
He's running for the Bronco with the Bronco keys.

29:43.100 --> 29:48.100
I forgot you had those. You run to the Bronco, you slam the keys into the ignition,

29:48.100 --> 29:50.100
and when you go to turn it over...

29:50.100 --> 29:53.100
Give me a roll. You're going to say it doesn't start, right?

29:53.100 --> 29:54.100
Yeah.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.100
Give me a roll.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.100
I'll give you a roll.

29:56.100 --> 29:57.100
Okay. I don't know what that should be, but...

29:57.100 --> 29:59.100
Oh, driving.

30:05.100 --> 30:09.100
Okay, I didn't put anything to drive because I'm a 14-year-old.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.100
Yeah.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.100
But naturally, on your page, you have a 20% drive.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.100
And you rolled?

30:14.100 --> 30:15.100
A 27.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.100
Oh. Forks.

30:17.100 --> 30:18.100
Yeah.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.100
Fucks.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.100
Spoons.

30:20.100 --> 30:21.100
Fucks.

30:21.100 --> 30:22.100
So he doesn't know how to start a car.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.100
When you go to...

30:23.100 --> 30:24.100
It's just dead.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.100
There's a point to where something is wrong.

30:26.100 --> 30:31.100
Either the battery's dead, like literally no lights are coming on when you turn the car over.

30:31.100 --> 30:34.100
I get out of it and I start running down the road towards town.

30:34.100 --> 30:42.100
As you're running down the road toward town, trees are on either side of you lining this country road.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.100
I'm going to get ashed.

30:43.100 --> 30:48.100
They're going over the top of you creating a sort of canopy.

30:48.100 --> 30:52.100
And the camera is down low, like on the ground.

30:52.100 --> 30:56.100
As you're running off into the distance.

30:56.100 --> 31:05.100
And then we see a black sedan driving incredibly furiously come over the top of the camera.

31:05.100 --> 31:08.100
And behind it, a four-wheeler.

31:08.100 --> 31:16.100
And as they approach, the four-wheeler overtakes the black sedan and rolls up next to you as you're running.

31:16.100 --> 31:21.100
And you look over, and riding this four-wheeler is a man.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.100
Pretty fit.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.100
Early 40s.

31:23.100 --> 31:27.100
He's wearing a black suit with a white shirt and a bolo tie.

31:27.100 --> 31:31.100
And he has a fucking badass mustache.

31:31.100 --> 31:35.100
And you recognize it as John Lee Pettymore the Third.

31:35.100 --> 31:37.100
Your second cousin.

31:37.100 --> 31:39.100
I wave.

31:39.100 --> 31:41.100
I want to hop on the four-wheeler.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.100
John!

31:42.100 --> 31:43.100
John!

31:43.100 --> 31:44.100
Uncle John!

31:44.100 --> 31:45.100
Uncle John!

31:45.100 --> 31:47.100
He stops the four-wheeler.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.100
And he sees you.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.100
And his heart sinks.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.100
And you can see it in his eyes.

31:51.100 --> 31:52.100
Uncle John!

31:52.100 --> 31:54.100
Thank God you're here.

31:54.100 --> 31:56.100
What's wrong, Uncle John?

31:56.100 --> 31:58.100
And he lifts up a pistol.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.100
Okay.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.100
Puts it to your head.

32:01.100 --> 32:08.100
Jeremy Pettymore, 14 years old, closes his eyes tight and is shaking.

32:08.100 --> 32:12.100
You feel the gun trembling on the other side as well.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.100
And then there's nothing.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.100
She knows.

32:44.100 --> 32:45.100
She knows.

32:45.100 --> 32:46.100
She knows.

32:46.100 --> 33:02.100
She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the moon.

33:12.100 --> 33:32.100
She moves with the howling wind.

33:32.100 --> 33:44.100
The sun, the sun, the sun has come again, come again.

33:44.100 --> 33:55.100
Her eyes, her eyes have seen it all.

33:55.100 --> 34:07.100
The wonders of, the wonders of the shadow of the moon.

34:25.100 --> 34:36.100
Alright, thanks everybody for listening to the Woods of Contention mini-arc of Pretending

34:36.100 --> 34:37.100
to Be People.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.100
Zach, what's wrong with your voice?

34:38.100 --> 34:41.100
Way to crush that mood that they just came out of.

34:41.100 --> 34:46.100
They're back in the scrap pit.

34:46.100 --> 34:51.100
Justin's not here, but we figured we'd pop on in at the end of this episode.

34:51.100 --> 34:59.100
And we recently just said that we would take Q&As for a new Patreon episode that's coming out next month.

34:59.100 --> 35:07.100
And we figured we'd pop in here and answer a couple of the quickly asked answers on the subreddit.

35:07.100 --> 35:10.100
And we're going to take down a couple of them right now.

35:10.100 --> 35:17.100
So, Sky Spore, or Sky's por, or Sky's po ar asks,

35:17.100 --> 35:20.100
What do you all do when you're told to leave the room?

35:20.100 --> 35:27.100
We kick and scream and say, no Zach, no, no, no, I'm not gonna, I don't wanna.

35:27.100 --> 35:29.100
I go and hide in the corner.

35:29.100 --> 35:30.100
I don't know what happens.

35:30.100 --> 35:31.100
They don't notice me every time.

35:31.100 --> 35:33.100
I don't know what happens.

35:33.100 --> 35:37.100
I have to grab Thomas by the ankles, but I just have to find Joe.

35:37.100 --> 35:41.100
As soon as he's found, he like hangs his head.

35:41.100 --> 35:44.100
And it's actually just Joe with his hands over his eyes.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.100
Sitting in his chair still.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.100
He thinks that's how it works.

35:47.100 --> 35:52.100
And in all the commotion, Luke just sits in his chair and nobody really notices.

35:52.100 --> 35:56.100
I usually go sit in the kitchen and smell whatever Taylor's cooking.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.100
Yeah.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.100
Tonight's her meal prep night.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.100
It's Zach's wife's meal prep night.

36:01.100 --> 36:04.100
So she's always making like dope smells in the kitchen.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.100
It currently smells delicious right now.

36:06.100 --> 36:08.100
Every time we open the door, it walks in.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.100
Some awesome fucking barbecue chicken.

36:09.100 --> 36:14.100
She had like barbecue chicken, beets and sweet potato.

36:14.100 --> 36:17.100
As opposed to the smells she normally makes.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.100
Ew!

36:18.100 --> 36:21.100
Yeah, her disgusting farts.

36:21.100 --> 36:28.100
She's prepping those right now.

36:28.100 --> 36:31.100
That's the bitch I own for.

36:31.100 --> 36:35.100
It's pretty annoying because when the weather is nice, I think you guys can go outside,

36:35.100 --> 36:37.100
but it's fucking terrible out now.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.100
Yeah, it snowed and iced yesterday.

36:39.100 --> 36:42.100
Yeah, so the answer is we hang out with Taylor.

36:42.100 --> 36:45.100
Just kind of shit amongst ourselves.

36:45.100 --> 36:48.100
If there's multiple people back there, we will talk.

36:48.100 --> 36:52.100
Beyond being podcast superstars, we're all good friends.

36:52.100 --> 36:56.100
So we shoot the shit and hang out because we see each other once a week this way.

36:56.100 --> 37:00.100
We don't have to fucking keep up the act on these Q&As.

37:00.100 --> 37:02.100
You signed the contract.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.100
I don't care.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.100
I don't fucking care.

37:05.100 --> 37:08.100
There's an ADA that says that you have to like us.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.100
Right.

37:09.100 --> 37:12.100
Also, we pet the cats, Ramona and Ropo.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.100
Oh yeah.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.100
Two cats.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.100
Nice sweet kitties.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.100
Tell them about your not so fat cat now.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.100
Well, yeah.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.100
How big was she?

37:19.100 --> 37:22.100
Ropo was 35 pounds when we got her.

37:22.100 --> 37:25.100
So fucking insane.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.100
And she's short too.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.100
She's really short.

37:27.100 --> 37:28.100
She's not a long cat.

37:28.100 --> 37:32.100
There are so many breeds of dog where that would be like a problematic weight.

37:32.100 --> 37:36.100
Oh, it was extremely problematic.

37:36.100 --> 37:37.100
And she was so cute.

37:37.100 --> 37:40.100
We had to get her, but I didn't want a diabetic cat.

37:40.100 --> 37:44.100
So we've been working out with her every day.

37:44.100 --> 37:46.100
She's really toning up her core.

37:46.100 --> 37:51.100
We just moved an elliptical machine into a room that Ropo is going to be good at.

37:51.100 --> 37:55.100
Honestly, mostly Ramona just chases her around and doesn't let her eat.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.100
So that's the diet that she's on.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.100
It's really worked.

37:58.100 --> 37:59.100
Yeah.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.100
What is she now?

38:00.100 --> 38:02.100
She is down to 16 pounds.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.100
Oh, shit.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.100
Really?

38:04.100 --> 38:05.100
Wow.

38:05.100 --> 38:06.100
Yeah.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.100
It's super impressive.

38:07.100 --> 38:12.100
However, now she has this flap of skin that just drags the ground everywhere she goes.

38:12.100 --> 38:14.100
And she was never pregnant, I don't think.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.100
But fun story about Ropo.

38:15.100 --> 38:19.100
Her name was Roly Poly when we got her, and they shortened it to Ropo.

38:19.100 --> 38:24.100
But she was owned by a woman who took in lots of shelter animals.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.100
And when the woman died-

38:27.100 --> 38:30.100
And fattened them up to eat them?

38:30.100 --> 38:32.100
Fucking clearly.

38:32.100 --> 38:35.100
But before she could eat Ropo, she passed away.

38:35.100 --> 38:42.100
And when they went into the house, they found I think she had eight cats and 13 dogs or something.

38:42.100 --> 38:46.100
And Ropo was hiding in the cabinet under the sink.

38:46.100 --> 38:47.100
Aw.

38:47.100 --> 38:50.100
Full of old lady face.

38:50.100 --> 38:51.100
100%.

38:51.100 --> 38:57.100
They had to use special tools to cut the cabinet off to get Ropo out of it.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.100
Your cat is so fat.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.100
How fat is she?

39:06.100 --> 39:07.100
The jaws of life.

39:07.100 --> 39:15.100
I did like the first night that we had Ropo, I woke up to her just like chewing on my cheek.

39:15.100 --> 39:18.100
And like, I'm not dead yet.

39:18.100 --> 39:24.100
We got another question from Room Service Nachos.

39:24.100 --> 39:27.100
It says, why is Luke so handsome?

39:27.100 --> 39:33.100
As a child, I had to have facial reconstructive surgery because I was too ugly for my parents to love me.

39:33.100 --> 39:36.100
But now, look at me.

39:36.100 --> 39:39.100
Asked by Luke and answered by Luke.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.100
There you go.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.100
Don't dox my Reddit account.

39:42.100 --> 39:45.100
You doxed your own Reddit account.

39:46.100 --> 39:50.100
We've got another question here from, I believe it's Malidori.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.100
M-A-L-I-D-O-R-I.

39:52.100 --> 39:55.100
It says, howdy everyone. Fellow Missourian here.

39:55.100 --> 39:56.100
What up, what up.

39:56.100 --> 40:00.100
I hope you're all staying nice and warm with the winter incoming fast.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.100
It is coming all over us.

40:02.100 --> 40:07.100
Speaking of staying warm, one, what is your all beverages of choice?

40:07.100 --> 40:10.100
They've been into Kraken Spiced Rum recently.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.100
Fall beverage of choice?

40:11.100 --> 40:14.100
I think it's not specifically fall, but...

40:14.100 --> 40:16.100
Y'all's beverage of choice.

40:16.100 --> 40:18.100
Y'all's fall beverage of choice?

40:18.100 --> 40:21.100
Me and Thomas went through the Kraken phase. We used to bring that to parties all the time.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.100
I used to buy the little...

40:22.100 --> 40:25.100
Yeah, before we were 21.

40:25.100 --> 40:30.100
I'm picturing the tiny little shooters with the Kraken on it.

40:30.100 --> 40:33.100
We would get the big bottle.

40:33.100 --> 40:41.100
Also, that is exactly the viscosity level that I'm thinking when I talk about the ooze in this campaign.

40:41.100 --> 40:43.100
Oh, really?

40:43.100 --> 40:50.100
Kraken is brutal, and it'll take your life from you.

40:50.100 --> 40:54.100
I like hot tea.

40:54.100 --> 41:01.100
I've been buying a shitload of that memory lane chocolate milk.

41:01.100 --> 41:03.100
That shit is fucking awesome.

41:03.100 --> 41:10.100
You buy the gallon of it, and it lasts me three days.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.100
Oh, Jesus.

41:11.100 --> 41:12.100
Yeah, I drink way too much milk.

41:12.100 --> 41:21.100
We actually tried to record last week, but Luke came in, and his mouth was so filmy with chocolate milk that he couldn't talk.

41:21.100 --> 41:25.100
I threw up on the table, and we spent the time cleaning it off instead of recording.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.100
Whoever sits in that spot just pukes every single time.

41:28.100 --> 41:30.100
Oh, yeah, this was Taylor's fault.

41:30.100 --> 41:36.100
Dude, that's the fucking craziest thing I've ever seen in real life.

41:36.100 --> 41:37.100
Yeah, in real life.

41:37.100 --> 41:42.100
This is your wife puking for ten minutes after trying to make herself burp.

41:42.100 --> 41:48.100
She thought it was super funny at the time, and then it wasn't really funny immediately.

41:48.100 --> 41:49.100
What about you guys?

41:49.100 --> 41:54.100
Well, you know, Kristen Schall's horse? It got funny again.

41:54.100 --> 41:59.100
I've been trying to force myself to like those seltzer waters, the La Croix type thing.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.100
Dude, the bubblies are way better.

42:00.100 --> 42:03.100
Because I hate them, but I've got to stop drinking soda.

42:03.100 --> 42:07.100
Yeah, bubbly's good and spindrift is good. I've been having good luck with those.

42:07.100 --> 42:11.100
What's the one that you said you bought it all or something?

42:11.100 --> 42:12.100
Spindrift.

42:12.100 --> 42:18.100
Spindrift, yeah. I've cleaned out the grocery store that is near me because nobody else is buying the spindrift there.

42:18.100 --> 42:21.100
I just noticed actually the other day they were restocked. So yeah.

42:21.100 --> 42:22.100
Lucky.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.100
I'm bumping up dim numbers.

42:23.100 --> 42:33.100
So I actually am fully moved away from even the flavored seltzer waters to the best choice unflavored original seltzer water.

42:33.100 --> 42:34.100
Wow.

42:34.100 --> 42:35.100
I just can't do that.

42:35.100 --> 42:36.100
That sucks.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.100
You can see these two cans right next to me.

42:37.100 --> 42:40.100
You could put lime juice in them to make them taste good.

42:40.100 --> 42:41.100
I put lime juice and bitters in there.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.100
Yeah, there you go. What sort of bitters? Angostura?

42:43.100 --> 42:45.100
Angostura. I'm not a monster.

42:45.100 --> 42:46.100
Peychaud's.

42:46.100 --> 42:48.100
Oh, Peychaud's is dope though.

42:48.100 --> 42:51.100
So is that so you don't drink soda and beer?

42:51.100 --> 42:52.100
Yes.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.100
Okay.

42:53.100 --> 42:54.100
Yeah.

42:54.100 --> 42:57.100
Because a thing I really like is just water.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.100
Yeah.

42:58.100 --> 43:03.100
At the point, a thing I don't like is unflavored sparkling water.

43:03.100 --> 43:06.100
Oh, I'm such a fan. I also love water. I chug so much water.

43:06.100 --> 43:11.100
I drink a lot of water too. I'm trying to replace just the soda that I would also drink.

43:11.100 --> 43:18.100
One of my roommates has an affinity for buying tons of bottled water at a time.

43:18.100 --> 43:19.100
Oh, that sucks.

43:19.100 --> 43:24.100
It does suck, but it also doesn't suck because I drink way more water now and pollute the ocean.

43:24.100 --> 43:25.100
There it is.

43:25.100 --> 43:27.100
There's the terrible part.

43:27.100 --> 43:31.100
I was going to say that I refill my water bottles, but my sister gets mad at me every time.

43:31.100 --> 43:36.100
Apparently that's bad for you. I guess it's still carcinogenic or something like that to reuse the water bottles.

43:36.100 --> 43:40.100
If you just have it sit in there for like a minute or two.

43:40.100 --> 43:45.100
There's also this cream soda that I have been super into recently.

43:45.100 --> 43:46.100
Lost Trail?

43:46.100 --> 43:52.100
No, it's that shit that I brought over to your house. I don't know. It's fucking good. I'll look it up.

43:52.100 --> 43:57.100
So those are the beverages that we like for our choices.

43:57.100 --> 44:00.100
Was he talking alcohol though? Or were they talking alcohol though?

44:00.100 --> 44:03.100
My go-to if I'm at a bar is High Life and a shot of Fernette.

44:03.100 --> 44:05.100
Yeah, Fernette Baraka.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.100
For the win.

44:06.100 --> 44:10.100
I'm a beer guy in general, but I also always have a bottle of whiskey at the house.

44:10.100 --> 44:17.100
I'm fully obsessed with Angostura Amaro. That's my current go-to, especially for fall drinking.

44:17.100 --> 44:21.100
Oh man, that with a shot of espresso next to each other? Baby, baby.

44:21.100 --> 44:22.100
Nice.

44:22.100 --> 44:23.100
Baby, baby.

44:23.100 --> 44:26.100
My heart will always belong to Bell's Two-Hearted Ale.

44:26.100 --> 44:28.100
I think that's up there with me too.

44:28.100 --> 44:35.100
I think the people who follow us on our social media accounts saw your love of Bell's Two-Hearted Ale in a picture recently.

44:35.100 --> 44:41.100
I mean, we tag Bell's in a lot of pictures where we're drinking Two-Hearted, but the recent picture from Halloween.

44:41.100 --> 44:42.100
Yeah.

44:42.100 --> 44:43.100
Pretty great picture.

44:43.100 --> 44:44.100
Nice.

44:44.100 --> 44:48.100
If any of you have played Disco Elysium, I was a disco cop.

44:48.100 --> 44:50.100
And it was a killer costume.

44:50.100 --> 44:59.100
Yeah, you only see my bottom layer and the wife beater shirt that I ripped in half.

44:59.100 --> 45:01.100
Don't worry, he was proving a point.

45:01.100 --> 45:04.100
You did the facial hair though. That's what brought it all together.

45:04.100 --> 45:05.100
You look great.

45:05.100 --> 45:10.100
It's called Natural Brew Cream Soda for anybody out there liking cream soda.

45:10.100 --> 45:11.100
Natural Brew.

45:11.100 --> 45:12.100
Natural Brew, dog.

45:12.100 --> 45:25.100
All right, so this type of sweet behind the scenes action is what you can expect on our upcoming Q&A episode that'll be for patrons only at our $5 and up level.

45:25.100 --> 45:33.100
There are honorary police officers of the Pretending to Be People Patreon, and we are so fucking grateful for them.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.100
Thank you.

45:34.100 --> 45:35.100
Jesus.

45:35.100 --> 45:36.100
Big time.

45:36.100 --> 45:37.100
Thank you, babies.

45:37.100 --> 45:38.100
Seriously.

45:38.100 --> 45:43.100
Don't forget about that and up, by the way.

45:43.100 --> 45:47.100
And yeah, I'll say it here, we'll have some new tiers popping up soon.

45:47.100 --> 45:53.100
Can we maybe debut the highest level tier that we discussed the other day?

45:53.100 --> 45:54.100
The very highest level?

45:54.100 --> 45:56.100
Yeah, the very highest level.

45:56.100 --> 46:05.100
If you want to support our podcast for $10,000 and buy Zach and I hair plugs, that would be immensely appreciated.

46:05.100 --> 46:07.100
It would be super helpful for-

46:07.100 --> 46:08.100
Really, really cool.

46:08.100 --> 46:09.100
What is that tier called?

46:09.100 --> 46:12.100
Buy Zach and Thomas hair plugs, please.

46:12.100 --> 46:15.100
Please.

46:15.100 --> 46:20.100
Hey, and we want to add a really big thank you to our guests from Basement Cats.

46:20.100 --> 46:21.100
Basement Cats.

46:21.100 --> 46:22.100
Straight up.

46:22.100 --> 46:23.100
Ali and Lindsay.

46:23.100 --> 46:25.100
And then Taylor also was there.

46:25.100 --> 46:26.100
Your beautiful wife.

46:26.100 --> 46:29.100
And all three of them really knocked it out of the park.

46:29.100 --> 46:33.100
I was so stoked to have them be a part of this little adventure that we made together.

46:33.100 --> 46:37.100
This is one of those things that Zach let us listen to, so I was able to join in-

46:37.100 --> 46:38.100
Yeah.

46:38.100 --> 46:42.100
It's the first time we've gotten to go back in here, kind of hear everything that went on behind our backs.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.100
So that was a lot of fun to listen to.

46:44.100 --> 46:45.100
Super fun.

46:45.100 --> 46:46.100
And spooky.

46:46.100 --> 46:47.100
Yeah.

46:47.100 --> 46:50.100
It also just makes it way much more fun that it is closed because you get to record and

46:50.100 --> 46:54.100
then every week you get to find out a little more of what was going on.

46:54.100 --> 46:55.100
Yeah, right.

46:55.100 --> 46:56.100
Exactly.

46:56.100 --> 47:02.100
I was really nervous actually about running six PCs in one area, but I think everyone

47:02.100 --> 47:05.100
had a pretty good time and it turned out sick.

47:05.100 --> 47:07.100
I'm really happy with the end result.

47:07.100 --> 47:09.100
I love listening to it.

47:09.100 --> 47:10.100
And playing it.

47:10.100 --> 47:12.100
And we got some cool artwork out of it too.

47:12.100 --> 47:13.100
Oh my gosh.

47:13.100 --> 47:14.100
Really cool artwork.

47:14.100 --> 47:16.100
Go check out Witch Hazel.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.100
I believe so.

47:17.100 --> 47:18.100
Witch.hazel on Instagram.

47:18.100 --> 47:20.100
You might check that she's okay with us saying it on air, but yeah.

47:20.100 --> 47:21.100
Yeah.

47:21.100 --> 47:22.100
It's witch.hazels.

47:22.100 --> 47:23.100
I think it's plural.

47:23.100 --> 47:24.100
Yeah.

47:24.100 --> 47:25.100
It's dope though.

47:25.100 --> 47:28.100
Super cool art of the girls' characters from this past story.

47:28.100 --> 47:30.100
It's really, really well done.

47:30.100 --> 47:32.100
And I checked out all her Instagram stuff.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.100
It was all really cool.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.100
Yeah.

47:34.100 --> 47:35.100
Follow her.

47:35.100 --> 47:37.100
Follow Basement Cats on Instagram.

47:37.100 --> 47:38.100
Check out their live shows.

47:38.100 --> 47:40.100
Is it the first?

47:40.100 --> 47:45.100
This next one is December 7th at Best of Luck Beer Hall in Springfield, Missouri.

47:45.100 --> 47:46.100
Drive to Springfield.

47:46.100 --> 47:47.100
Fly to Springfield.

47:47.100 --> 47:48.100
We got an airport.

47:48.100 --> 47:49.100
So.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.100
Come drink with us.

47:50.100 --> 47:51.100
We'll be at that show.

47:51.100 --> 47:52.100
It'll be very fun.

47:52.100 --> 47:53.100
Thanks for listening.

47:53.100 --> 48:01.100
And we'll have more content for you that is part of the contention narrative coming very,

48:01.100 --> 48:02.100
very soon.

48:02.100 --> 48:03.100
Bye guys.

48:03.100 --> 48:04.100
Bye.

48:04.100 --> 48:05.100
Like and subscribe.

48:05.100 --> 48:07.100
Yes.

48:35.100 --> 48:36.100
Bye.

48:36.100 --> 48:36.100
