00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
Greetings and salutations, my pack.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.460
It's your hellacious howler, Wolf the Dog,

00:06.460 --> 00:12.840
and I am shoutin' at you live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.500
My screams can be heard no matter where you are,

00:16.500 --> 00:20.260
as long as you are tuned into the very good numbers.

00:20.260 --> 00:23.000
That's how radios work, I think.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.720
One thing that always works is the adoration of the public.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.060
It just gets my crawdads boilin'.

00:31.060 --> 00:35.260
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Josh in Maryland.

00:35.260 --> 00:38.980
They tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod.

00:38.980 --> 00:42.720
Wow, thanks, Josh. I really appreciate it.

00:42.720 --> 00:43.860
They write,

00:43.860 --> 00:46.900
Thank you all for your excellent show.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.520
I cannot wait to see what season two brings.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.020
You introduced me to Delta Green,

00:53.020 --> 00:56.600
and I've made that all of my friends' problems.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.100
So far, they have sustained major casualties

01:00.100 --> 01:04.100
in both Lover in the Ice and The Last Equation.

01:04.100 --> 01:07.980
Shout-out to Deathwatch and the Raven Inquisition,

01:07.980 --> 01:11.280
the best friends to play an RPG with.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.640
Damn, Josh. Thank you, my child.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.780
We here at PTBP love it when you make something you love

01:19.780 --> 01:21.940
everyone else's problem.

01:21.940 --> 01:24.780
Just ask all of my friends.

01:24.780 --> 01:29.080
I have literally so many of these things called friends.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.740
I'm definitely not super lonely,

01:31.740 --> 01:34.240
sittin' in this studio for all time

01:34.240 --> 01:38.880
with only my producer and dog, Wolf the Dog.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.840
I definitely don't long to share a warm garbage parfait

01:43.840 --> 01:46.380
with another under the flickering lights

01:46.380 --> 01:50.040
in the parking lot of the long-abandoned supermarket

01:50.040 --> 01:51.880
called Cream for Less.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.680
The stars and moon cast in an otherworldly glow

01:55.680 --> 01:59.680
upon our yogurt-covered claws and maws.

01:59.680 --> 02:03.140
Yeah, I definitely don't care about none of that.

02:03.140 --> 02:05.340
Ahem. Huh.

02:05.340 --> 02:09.340
Well, uh, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,

02:09.340 --> 02:11.680
tag at Pretending Pod on the Internet

02:11.680 --> 02:14.880
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

02:14.880 --> 02:17.180
and holler at us about it.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.180
Say it loud to the person on your left,

02:20.180 --> 02:21.980
at Pretending Pod.

02:21.980 --> 02:25.180
Now say it loud to the person on your right,

02:25.180 --> 02:27.020
at Pretending Pod.

02:27.020 --> 02:30.520
Say it out loud to your friend Beth's dad.

02:30.520 --> 02:34.180
Say it out loud to your fest-drenned Brad,

02:34.180 --> 02:37.020
at Pretending Pod.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.940
And now, the news.

02:39.940 --> 02:42.940
Last time, Lafayette J. Honeycutt

02:42.940 --> 02:47.140
landed on the roof of the great chauffeur party building

02:47.140 --> 02:49.940
with his Fuck Yo Gravity machine.

02:49.940 --> 02:54.200
He then came face to face with a otherworldly creature.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.440
It scuttled across the top of the building toward him

02:57.440 --> 02:59.200
as he failed miserably

02:59.200 --> 03:02.200
at an attempt to pop down to ground level.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.700
The lit towel rained down a bevy of debris,

03:05.700 --> 03:09.440
including a burning timber that drove checkers down

03:09.440 --> 03:11.940
and pinned him into the snowdrift.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.700
Thankfully, Harvey Brewer was nearby

03:14.700 --> 03:16.940
to help his future cult leader,

03:16.940 --> 03:19.440
and in a downpour of good luck,

03:19.440 --> 03:22.440
Honeycutt blasted the flying monsters

03:22.440 --> 03:24.940
with a jetpack fart to the face

03:24.940 --> 03:28.940
and flipped down next to Harvey and checkers with ease.

03:28.940 --> 03:33.940
Meanwhile, Elden Ring became Dark Soul.

03:33.940 --> 03:39.440
That led to Mr. Soul being shot by his ex-leader checkers.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.940
This was, of course, followed by the sounds of screaming,

03:43.940 --> 03:45.940
electrical discharge,

03:45.940 --> 03:49.940
and the air being absolutely filled with the buzzing

03:49.940 --> 03:51.940
of these twisted winged beasts

03:51.940 --> 03:56.440
with pulsating crenulations across their jagged heads.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.940
It's a swarm, y'all.

03:58.940 --> 04:01.940
And now, for the first time,

04:01.940 --> 04:07.440
a brand new song here for 694.2 PTBP.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.440
It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.940
I didn't know

04:14.940 --> 04:17.940
a body could be hollow

04:17.940 --> 04:22.940
before its blood ran cold.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.940
I didn't know

04:28.940 --> 04:32.940
that the wind could soak

04:32.940 --> 04:37.940
the tissue and faggot bone.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.940
You were hollow

04:41.940 --> 04:45.440
and you spoke to me.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.440
Hollow and you sang.

04:54.440 --> 05:00.440
I thought you might be starving,

05:00.440 --> 05:07.440
so I gave you everything.

05:08.940 --> 05:13.440
I feel so low energy after your kind of hype there.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.440
Well, something was said right before we cut to the 30 seconds of silence

05:19.440 --> 05:23.440
that made Scott literally say the phrase,

05:23.440 --> 05:27.440
Jesus wept.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.440
And it reminded me,

05:29.440 --> 05:31.440
we used to play Bible trivia

05:31.440 --> 05:32.940
when our Sunday school teacher

05:32.940 --> 05:36.440
didn't have anything prepared for us on Sunday morning,

05:36.440 --> 05:39.940
and Bible trivia was a game that was like, you know,

05:39.940 --> 05:41.940
Trivial Pursuit, whatever, is in a box

05:41.940 --> 05:43.940
and so we'd bust it out and play.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.940
And the question was,

05:45.940 --> 05:48.440
what is the shortest verse in the Bible?

05:48.440 --> 05:51.940
And my friend's younger sister said,

05:51.940 --> 05:55.940
enthusiastically as anyone has ever proclaimed any two words,

05:55.940 --> 05:57.940
Jesus wept.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.940
Jesus wept.

06:02.940 --> 06:05.940
No, Jesus used the three cells.

06:06.440 --> 06:11.440
Yeah, he didn't come to wash away mankind's sins,

06:11.440 --> 06:13.440
just to wipe them away.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.440
Just smudge them a bit.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.440
Yeah, from back to front too.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.440
Jesus was a freak.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.440
Yeah, and they didn't have bidets back then,

06:21.440 --> 06:23.440
so, ugh.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.440
Oh my God.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.940
And for you listening at home,

06:26.940 --> 06:28.440
if you don't have a bidet,

06:28.440 --> 06:30.440
we're not living in Jesus times anymore.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.440
You can get one.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.440
They're relatively inexpensive

06:32.440 --> 06:34.440
and it keeps your butthole happy.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.940
Brought to you by, I'm Googling bidet company.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.940
We need to reach out.

06:39.940 --> 06:41.940
If we could get a sponsor for the podcast

06:41.940 --> 06:43.940
that wasn't like, just like Bomba socks or whatever

06:43.940 --> 06:45.940
every time, it would be cool

06:45.940 --> 06:47.940
if we were just exclusively sponsored

06:47.940 --> 06:49.940
by a bidet brand.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.940
Brought to you by,

06:51.940 --> 06:53.940
Brought to you by Tushy.

06:53.940 --> 06:55.940
Oh, that's a good one.

06:55.940 --> 06:59.940
Today only, if you type in the code PTBP

06:59.940 --> 07:01.940
and then delete it off there,

07:01.940 --> 07:03.940
you can buy, if you buy two bidets,

07:03.940 --> 07:06.940
you can save $90 at Tushy.com.

07:06.940 --> 07:09.940
And if you use Honey, it'll probably help.

07:11.940 --> 07:14.440
If your arsehole could speak, it would thank you.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.940
Oh, that's a hell of a tagline.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.940
Thomas, what do you think about that?

07:21.940 --> 07:23.940
Our Jimmy John's came, Scott.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.940
We've got delicious Jimmy John's incoming.

07:25.940 --> 07:26.940
That was freaky fast.

07:26.940 --> 07:28.940
That was freaky fast.

07:28.940 --> 07:31.940
Your sandwich place is called Jimmy John's?

07:31.940 --> 07:32.940
Jimmy John's, yep.

07:32.940 --> 07:33.940
Oh, Jimmy John's. Oh, sorry.

07:33.940 --> 07:34.940
I thought you said Jimmy John's.

07:34.940 --> 07:37.940
I was expecting it to come with flavor aid.

07:41.940 --> 07:42.940
Holy shit.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.940
The Jim Jones.

07:44.940 --> 07:46.940
Is this going to be like some special Patreon content

07:46.940 --> 07:49.940
where it's just like eating sounds for 10 minutes?

07:49.940 --> 07:50.940
Oh, God.

07:50.940 --> 07:51.940
Dibbing up of sandwiches.

07:51.940 --> 07:54.940
So we literally have to split off in our very first episode.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.940
There's a doorbell that rings like four minutes

07:56.940 --> 07:59.940
into our very first recording.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.940
Jimmy John's just showed up at the door

08:01.940 --> 08:04.940
and Luke went to the door and the guy was like,

08:04.940 --> 08:05.940
what are you guys up to today?

08:05.940 --> 08:08.940
And Luke was like, oh, we're playing a role playing game.

08:08.940 --> 08:10.940
And the guy was like, oh, sweet.

08:10.940 --> 08:12.940
Have you ever heard of Delta Green?

08:14.940 --> 08:16.940
And Luke was like, dude, I'm not kidding.

08:16.940 --> 08:18.940
That is what we're playing.

08:21.940 --> 08:22.940
Brilliant.

08:22.940 --> 08:23.940
And then I didn't say like, hey, we're recording.

08:23.940 --> 08:24.940
You should listen to this thing

08:24.940 --> 08:26.940
that will come out in two years.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.940
Well, that guy was Joe.

08:31.940 --> 08:32.940
Can I play?

08:32.940 --> 08:34.940
It was called Jimmy Joe's back then.

08:37.940 --> 08:38.940
What are we going to do?

08:38.940 --> 08:40.940
Hoover down a few bites.

08:40.940 --> 08:42.940
Take your time.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.940
I don't want to see any of you choking to death

08:44.940 --> 08:46.940
trying to catch the game in a hurry.

08:46.940 --> 08:47.940
It's a horror game, Scott.

08:47.940 --> 08:48.940
Psychic attack!

08:48.940 --> 08:49.940
Psychic attack!

08:54.940 --> 08:56.940
Well, I think everyone's stopped crunching chips.

08:56.940 --> 08:58.940
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

08:58.940 --> 08:59.940
Fantastic.

09:01.940 --> 09:02.940
Does someone want to do a recap

09:02.940 --> 09:05.940
and then we can move on to the death?

09:05.940 --> 09:07.940
There was a heavy betrayal.

09:07.940 --> 09:08.940
Oh, man, yeah.

09:08.940 --> 09:10.940
Luke really betrayed me.

09:12.940 --> 09:14.940
But then kind of a reconciliation sort of.

09:14.940 --> 09:15.940
I don't know what happened at the end there

09:15.940 --> 09:18.940
where he was first aiding you after having shot you.

09:18.940 --> 09:19.940
I know, it's wild.

09:19.940 --> 09:22.940
Well, I was pissed that I could feel you betraying me

09:22.940 --> 09:25.940
in real time and then I didn't want to kill you,

09:25.940 --> 09:27.940
but I had to stop you psychic attacking me.

09:27.940 --> 09:31.940
I'd like to read something from the psychic attack part

09:31.940 --> 09:34.940
of the Pulp Cthulhu handbook.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.940
It says, I can.

09:39.940 --> 09:40.940
Okay, I can.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.940
Sounds like you're making it up already.

09:42.940 --> 09:44.940
I'll read the whole thing then, I guess.

09:44.940 --> 09:46.940
It says that I can.

09:48.940 --> 09:50.940
And I do.

09:51.940 --> 09:53.940
The psychic may attempt a psychic attack

09:53.940 --> 09:55.940
if the target is in line of sight.

09:55.940 --> 09:58.940
If the initial opposed power roll is failed,

09:58.940 --> 10:01.940
the psychic hero may attempt another power roll

10:01.940 --> 10:03.940
on their turn in the following round.

10:03.940 --> 10:07.940
The second attempt effectively works like a push roll.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.940
If the second attempt fails,

10:09.940 --> 10:13.940
the target of the attack can never be targeted again

10:13.940 --> 10:15.940
by the same psychic.

10:15.940 --> 10:16.940
Wow.

10:16.940 --> 10:18.940
So I don't know if you read that, Scott,

10:18.940 --> 10:22.940
as like two psychic attacks back to back in one combat.

10:22.940 --> 10:24.940
Okay, so then I've done it once.

10:24.940 --> 10:26.940
So if I do it again and fail,

10:26.940 --> 10:29.940
then I'll never be able to psychic attack you ever again.

10:29.940 --> 10:32.940
And then that would restore my trust in you.

10:33.940 --> 10:35.940
Yeah, so don't think of it as a psychic attack.

10:35.940 --> 10:38.940
Think of it as an inoculation.

10:38.940 --> 10:39.940
Right.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.940
Oh, and if I fail, it works like a pushed roll.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.940
So something suitably bad happens.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.940
Possible consequences might include

10:46.940 --> 10:48.940
bleeding from ears and eyes,

10:48.940 --> 10:51.940
sanity loss and instant delusion,

10:51.940 --> 10:56.940
incapacitation by shaking and spasms, et cetera.

10:56.940 --> 10:57.940
Nice.

10:57.940 --> 10:58.940
I like et cetera, too.

10:58.940 --> 11:00.940
Yeah, et cetera sounds crazy.

11:00.940 --> 11:01.940
Yes.

11:01.940 --> 11:04.940
Anyway, that could be bad, huh?

11:04.940 --> 11:05.940
Could be bad.

11:05.940 --> 11:07.940
But I'm sure you wouldn't be silly enough to do that,

11:07.940 --> 11:08.940
would you?

11:08.940 --> 11:09.940
God, no.

11:09.940 --> 11:12.940
There's no way of telling, honestly.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.940
So shall we open up with that then

11:14.940 --> 11:16.940
with the two of you down there in the cellar,

11:16.940 --> 11:20.940
patching things up both figuratively and literally?

11:20.940 --> 11:21.940
But why?

11:21.940 --> 11:22.940
Why did you do it?

11:22.940 --> 11:26.940
You should join us.

11:26.940 --> 11:28.940
I'm not sure what any of it is.

11:28.940 --> 11:29.940
I don't know what the invention is.

11:29.940 --> 11:30.940
I don't know what that thing was.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.940
I don't know what you're trying to get me to join.

11:32.940 --> 11:36.940
Well, you didn't know what anything was before,

11:36.940 --> 11:38.940
and you were still the face of that.

11:38.940 --> 11:39.940
Fair enough.

11:39.940 --> 11:42.940
His mind has been changed.

11:42.940 --> 11:44.940
Oh, yes.

11:44.940 --> 11:45.940
Delta.

11:45.940 --> 11:49.940
Green.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.940
Well, let's, I mean, we got you patched up

11:52.940 --> 11:54.940
as much as I can do right here, but...

11:54.940 --> 11:56.940
I'm feeling much better, thank you.

11:56.940 --> 11:57.940
There's probably a doctor.

11:57.940 --> 11:58.940
Friend.

11:58.940 --> 12:01.940
There's scientists and academics and everything.

12:01.940 --> 12:03.940
There's got to be a doctor.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.940
Hey, I want you to know,

12:05.940 --> 12:07.940
just because you're no longer my master

12:07.940 --> 12:09.940
does not mean that we cannot be friends.

12:09.940 --> 12:10.940
Huh?

12:10.940 --> 12:13.940
I can teach you the ways of this creature,

12:13.940 --> 12:14.940
and you can learn.

12:14.940 --> 12:15.940
But I'm in charge, though.

12:15.940 --> 12:18.940
Assuredly, but you can learn from me.

12:18.940 --> 12:19.940
Hmm.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.940
I think you lost a lot of blood or something,

12:22.940 --> 12:25.940
and you're not making no sense.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.940
And I think with that as well,

12:27.940 --> 12:30.940
you can start hearing all the screaming and crying

12:30.940 --> 12:33.940
and strange, you know, crashing sounds from outside.

12:33.940 --> 12:36.940
A little bit of Checkers charm pops into his head,

12:36.940 --> 12:39.940
and he's like, hey, they're missing us out there.

12:39.940 --> 12:42.940
Yeah, a little bit of Monica in my life.

12:42.940 --> 12:43.940
Right.

12:44.940 --> 12:47.940
A little bit of Sandra in the sun.

12:47.940 --> 12:49.940
A little bit of Jessica.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.940
I help you walk up the stairs,

12:51.940 --> 12:54.940
and we'll head out of this horrifying dungeon.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.940
Thank you, friend.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.940
And meanwhile, upstairs, Lafayette and Harvey,

12:58.940 --> 13:00.940
you'd heard all the chaos as well

13:00.940 --> 13:02.940
from deeper within the building.

13:02.940 --> 13:03.940
What are you doing?

13:03.940 --> 13:07.940
I was having a bout of not feeling so great mentally.

13:07.940 --> 13:08.940
Am I still having that?

13:08.940 --> 13:09.940
Yes.

13:09.940 --> 13:10.940
You are.

13:10.940 --> 13:12.940
Yeah, absolute panic.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.940
You've got to get out of here as soon as possible,

13:14.940 --> 13:17.940
and I mean, you know where the front door is.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.940
I mean, you know, if you just run out of there,

13:19.940 --> 13:21.940
I'm sure you'll be fine.

13:21.940 --> 13:22.940
I'm charging ahead.

13:24.940 --> 13:25.940
Okay.

13:25.940 --> 13:27.940
So, yeah, Lafayette can see Harvey

13:27.940 --> 13:29.940
just legging it down the corridor

13:29.940 --> 13:31.940
full speed away from him.

13:31.940 --> 13:32.940
How many legs?

13:32.940 --> 13:33.940
Yeah, I was gonna ask.

13:35.940 --> 13:36.940
I started with 13.

13:36.940 --> 13:37.940
You didn't know that?

13:39.940 --> 13:42.940
He's running at, what, just over 100 miles an hour?

13:43.940 --> 13:46.940
He's done that in, like, the same direction

13:46.940 --> 13:48.940
that the creature just flew off, basically?

13:48.940 --> 13:49.940
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

13:49.940 --> 13:51.940
Yeah, he's running towards the chaos.

13:51.940 --> 13:55.940
Lafayette looks down, like, either side of the hallway

13:55.940 --> 13:58.940
and then closes the door behind him and locks it.

13:58.940 --> 14:00.940
Like, while you're in the room?

14:00.940 --> 14:01.940
Yeah.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.940
And then he starts going through the shit in Cicero's room.

14:04.940 --> 14:07.940
Well, I mean, the shit in Cicero's room

14:07.940 --> 14:11.940
largely consists of blood-splattered furnishings,

14:11.940 --> 14:16.940
blood-splattered bedding, blood-splattered carpet,

14:16.940 --> 14:18.940
blood-splattered corpse,

14:18.940 --> 14:23.940
the syringe and the strange liquid,

14:23.940 --> 14:27.940
blood-splattered ceiling, blood-splattered light fixtures.

14:27.940 --> 14:30.940
Blood-splattered love letters he never sent you.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.940
I try to open any blood-splattered drawers

14:35.940 --> 14:37.940
or cabinets and find, you know,

14:37.940 --> 14:39.940
is there anything in his bedside table,

14:39.940 --> 14:43.940
any super sentimental knick-knack

14:43.940 --> 14:48.940
that I can take to just really rub in the world's, you know,

14:48.940 --> 14:51.940
I guess I wouldn't show it off too much, but still.

14:51.940 --> 14:52.940
You would know.

14:52.940 --> 14:53.940
Ego.

14:53.940 --> 14:54.940
Yeah.

14:56.940 --> 15:00.940
Oh, gosh, what kinds of knick-knacks might he have?

15:00.940 --> 15:05.940
Yeah, I guess there's a lock of blonde hair

15:05.940 --> 15:07.940
that's tied with a ribbon.

15:09.940 --> 15:10.940
Was his wife?

15:10.940 --> 15:13.940
I see that, and I look at it, and I kind of toss it away,

15:13.940 --> 15:15.940
and I see, like, propped up next to the bed

15:15.940 --> 15:18.940
is that stupid self-playing violin, and I take that.

15:18.940 --> 15:19.940
Yes.

15:19.940 --> 15:20.940
And I...

15:20.940 --> 15:22.940
It's out of tune already.

15:22.940 --> 15:26.940
And I look at the weird, you know, the stuff he was injecting.

15:26.940 --> 15:29.940
I can see the track marks on his arms and shit.

15:30.940 --> 15:33.940
And I pocket that as well.

15:33.940 --> 15:34.940
Okay.

15:34.940 --> 15:36.940
And then are you two running up those same stairs

15:36.940 --> 15:37.940
out of that wardrobe?

15:37.940 --> 15:39.940
Yeah, I think at this point the two of them

15:39.940 --> 15:41.940
do burst out of the wardrobe.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.940
Well, hello, chaps.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.940
We got to go help or something.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.940
What are you doing?

15:47.940 --> 15:49.940
As screams are coming from the...

15:49.940 --> 15:51.940
What's down there?

15:51.940 --> 15:53.940
I don't know, something bad.

15:53.940 --> 15:55.940
Oh, where we just came from.

15:55.940 --> 15:56.940
Yeah.

15:56.940 --> 15:57.940
Something bad.

15:57.940 --> 15:58.940
Did you see it fly out of there?

15:58.940 --> 15:59.940
It's gone, yes.

15:59.940 --> 16:02.940
That was down there, and it took him...

16:02.940 --> 16:04.940
He's fucked up because he's thinking

16:04.940 --> 16:06.940
that that thing's his master, but I am.

16:06.940 --> 16:08.940
The new invention of Cicero Morgan

16:08.940 --> 16:10.940
is going to change the world, you know?

16:10.940 --> 16:12.940
And he's saying that shit.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.940
Just like everybody down there.

16:15.940 --> 16:17.940
It's going to change the world, you know?

16:17.940 --> 16:19.940
Also, the last branch, you should get in early

16:19.940 --> 16:21.940
because it's about to take off.

16:23.940 --> 16:24.940
No. No.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.940
God damn it, no.

16:26.940 --> 16:28.940
Lafayette J. Honeycutt is about to take off.

16:28.940 --> 16:32.940
He did take off in his amazing jet pack.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.940
I don't know who that is, David.

16:34.940 --> 16:36.940
I am Lafayette J. Honeycutt.

16:36.940 --> 16:38.940
Whoa!

16:38.940 --> 16:39.940
The whole time?

16:39.940 --> 16:41.940
Yeah, he parts his hair to the other side.

16:41.940 --> 16:43.940
Dramatically.

16:43.940 --> 16:45.940
Checkers recalls, he's like,

16:45.940 --> 16:47.940
I've seen him in the magazines.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.940
That's right, you have.

16:49.940 --> 16:50.940
I am the best inventor.

16:50.940 --> 16:53.940
You're the second best inventor on Earth?

16:53.940 --> 16:56.940
Well, and then I see him.

16:56.940 --> 16:58.940
I'm like, well, the best now.

16:58.940 --> 17:01.940
I was the best before.

17:01.940 --> 17:03.940
I made this kick-ass jet pack.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.940
Can you invent us something to get out of here?

17:05.940 --> 17:06.940
Alive?

17:06.940 --> 17:07.940
A jet pack!

17:07.940 --> 17:09.940
Us, not you.

17:09.940 --> 17:13.940
So Honeycutt, does that mean that I am the vessel

17:13.940 --> 17:16.940
that followed through with the energy focus

17:16.940 --> 17:20.940
in order to make you the successful man

17:20.940 --> 17:23.940
without any sort of rival to speak of?

17:23.940 --> 17:25.940
This is exactly what I was saying.

17:25.940 --> 17:28.940
He's lost it.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.940
If so, I think any invention that you come up with tonight

17:31.940 --> 17:35.940
and show off could change the world, you know?

17:35.940 --> 17:38.940
Oh, well, have you seen my jet pack?

17:38.940 --> 17:41.940
I kind of turn around and I flash it to him.

17:41.940 --> 17:43.940
I'm like, eh?

17:43.940 --> 17:45.940
Is it cool?

17:45.940 --> 17:47.940
It's very cool.

17:47.940 --> 17:49.940
I think if you want to work out how cool this is,

17:49.940 --> 17:51.940
you'd have to lick it.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.940
Yeah.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.940
Do you mind?

17:54.940 --> 17:57.940
Yeah, I also give him just a little push.

17:57.940 --> 17:59.940
I spread a little flame out the back.

17:59.940 --> 18:00.940
Ooh.

18:00.940 --> 18:02.940
Just revving the engine, just a little.

18:02.940 --> 18:03.940
Huh?

18:03.940 --> 18:04.940
Look at that.

18:04.940 --> 18:06.940
I think with all the blood and tissue around,

18:06.940 --> 18:09.940
there's just this brief smell of cooking meat.

18:09.940 --> 18:13.940
Yeah, it just like singes.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.940
Well, we got to get him to a doctor

18:15.940 --> 18:18.940
and figure out what the hell's going on out there.

18:18.940 --> 18:20.940
Well, it sounds like a lot of people are screaming

18:20.940 --> 18:24.940
and dying out there, so what if we just stayed in here?

18:24.940 --> 18:26.940
That was sort of my plan.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.940
Well, and what, wait for them to come to us?

18:29.940 --> 18:31.940
No, wait for everything to leave.

18:31.940 --> 18:32.940
They know we're up here.

18:32.940 --> 18:35.940
That thing had holes drilled in its head and it's mad.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.940
It seemed like it just wanted to get out of here.

18:37.940 --> 18:38.940
It's gone.

18:38.940 --> 18:40.940
I'm going to survive.

18:40.940 --> 18:41.940
I sure hope so.

18:41.940 --> 18:43.940
I shot him.

18:43.940 --> 18:44.940
Sorry.

18:44.940 --> 18:45.940
It's okay.

18:45.940 --> 18:46.940
I think I'm going to be protected.

18:46.940 --> 18:47.940
Split up.

18:47.940 --> 18:48.940
Wait, what? Why?

18:48.940 --> 18:50.940
Okay, you take care of him then,

18:50.940 --> 18:52.940
and I unlock the doors and go investigate the scene.

18:52.940 --> 18:56.940
Wow, he's going to be deeply unsafe now.

18:56.940 --> 18:59.940
Why don't you go see what's going on out there for me?

18:59.940 --> 19:00.940
Could you do that?

19:00.940 --> 19:03.940
Yeah, I'm not going to be harmed by this creature

19:03.940 --> 19:07.940
or any of its friends, so of course, yeah, that seems fine.

19:07.940 --> 19:08.940
Perfect.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.940
You go down there and see what's going on

19:10.940 --> 19:11.940
and report back to me.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.940
Yeah, I'll let everybody know you're up here.

19:13.940 --> 19:14.940
I kind of shuttle you out the door after.

19:14.940 --> 19:15.940
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:15.940 --> 19:17.940
Don't do that.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.940
Don't tell anyone.

19:20.940 --> 19:22.940
Well, in order to make sure that tonight goes off without a hitch,

19:22.940 --> 19:26.940
everyone should know where everyone is.

19:26.940 --> 19:29.940
You understand that tonight has just been one big hitch, right?

19:29.940 --> 19:32.940
No, it's a party.

19:32.940 --> 19:33.940
Sorry.

19:33.940 --> 19:38.940
The hitches have already gone off.

19:38.940 --> 19:43.940
You know, I'll just go with you two.

19:43.940 --> 19:44.940
It's a party.

19:44.940 --> 19:45.940
Sorry.

19:45.940 --> 19:49.940
Well, Harvey's got a head start, so let's catch up with him.

19:49.940 --> 19:54.940
So in your panic to get out, you've run to the main stairs

19:54.940 --> 19:58.940
and you were going to head to the exit,

19:58.940 --> 20:00.940
but now that you're on the stairs,

20:00.940 --> 20:02.940
you're beginning to come out of this panic

20:02.940 --> 20:07.940
and you can see that it is carnage down below.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.940
There are people running around all over the place

20:11.940 --> 20:15.940
and there are a number of these flying creatures

20:15.940 --> 20:17.940
buzzing through the air around them.

20:17.940 --> 20:20.940
A few of them are holding these devices

20:20.940 --> 20:23.940
that look a bit like cameras maybe.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.940
The people are terrified.

20:25.940 --> 20:27.940
Some of them are trying to get outside.

20:27.940 --> 20:30.940
You can see there are a few bodies on the ground.

20:30.940 --> 20:32.940
People are getting trampled.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.940
What do you do?

20:34.940 --> 20:36.940
Has anything noticed me?

20:36.940 --> 20:38.940
Notice me.

20:38.940 --> 20:39.940
What?

20:39.940 --> 20:40.940
Give me a luck roll.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.940
Give me a luck roll.

20:44.940 --> 20:46.940
It's a 21 on a 59.

20:46.940 --> 20:49.940
I mean, a couple of people run past you up the stairs.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.940
There are some of these creatures buzzing around,

20:52.940 --> 20:56.940
but nothing seems to have taken a lively interest in you yet,

20:56.940 --> 20:59.940
but it's probably only a matter of time.

20:59.940 --> 21:03.940
Can you give me an idea of the number of these bug creature things?

21:03.940 --> 21:06.940
Is it like 20 of them or is it like three or four of them?

21:06.940 --> 21:09.940
At the moment, you're mainly looking into the hallway

21:09.940 --> 21:12.940
and you can see about half a dozen of them here,

21:12.940 --> 21:16.940
but there's sounds of buzzing from outside.

21:16.940 --> 21:20.940
You hear some strange crackling noises from out there as well.

21:20.940 --> 21:24.940
And there's pandemonium in the ballroom as well.

21:24.940 --> 21:27.940
The band, funnily enough, has stopped playing at this stage.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.940
Oh, no, the music.

21:30.940 --> 21:35.940
The party's not going off without a hitch.

21:35.940 --> 21:38.940
If I'm starting to regain my senses at this point,

21:38.940 --> 21:41.940
he's remembered that he's abandoned his employer,

21:41.940 --> 21:43.940
the person he's only supposed to protect.

21:43.940 --> 21:48.940
So he's going to look back down the hallway and see if he is followed.

21:48.940 --> 21:52.940
Yeah, and as you do so, you can see the others moving towards you,

21:52.940 --> 21:54.940
silhouetted by the light from Gordon's room.

21:54.940 --> 21:58.940
And I'm going to try and tell him to slow down and be quiet.

21:58.940 --> 21:59.940
Yeah, it's easy to see that.

21:59.940 --> 22:01.940
Let's just go back and lock ourselves in that room.

22:01.940 --> 22:04.940
I slow down a little bit, but I kind of blow by Harvey

22:04.940 --> 22:07.940
and I'm like, come on, you'll be the most help.

22:07.940 --> 22:10.940
I grab him by the scruff of his collar.

22:10.940 --> 22:14.940
Hey, buddy, listen, there's a lot of them down there.

22:14.940 --> 22:15.940
I can't take them alone.

22:15.940 --> 22:17.940
I don't think four of us can take them either.

22:17.940 --> 22:19.940
What's them?

22:19.940 --> 22:21.940
You saw that thing that came out of the cellar?

22:21.940 --> 22:22.940
I shot it.

22:22.940 --> 22:23.940
There's a lot of those.

22:23.940 --> 22:27.940
Just so you know, I shot it and nothing happened at all.

22:27.940 --> 22:29.940
So do you want to go fight those now?

22:29.940 --> 22:32.940
There's got to be a way, or they could join the cult

22:32.940 --> 22:35.940
and be the most powerful members of the cult.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.940
Where did this voice come from?

22:41.940 --> 22:44.940
The most powerful members of our cult.

22:47.940 --> 22:49.940
Everything about me is a fraud.

22:49.940 --> 22:52.940
So I don't really even have an actual voice.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.940
So you're having this conversation at the top of the stairs.

22:58.940 --> 23:00.940
Unfortunately, it sounds like it.

23:02.940 --> 23:04.940
So while you're having this conversation,

23:04.940 --> 23:10.940
you see Margaret Payne running pursued by one of these creatures.

23:10.940 --> 23:14.940
Another one of them wields this camera-like device

23:14.940 --> 23:19.940
and seems to be trying to point it actually in your direction.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.940
But this bolt of energy shoots out of it

23:23.940 --> 23:30.940
and hits the mounting for the chandelier in the hallway.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.940
And you see the chandelier come down

23:32.940 --> 23:36.940
and land on Margaret Payne, pinning her to the ground.

23:36.940 --> 23:38.940
Oh, Margaret.

23:38.940 --> 23:41.940
That beautiful chandelier is ruined.

23:44.940 --> 23:49.940
Checkers sees all this and he's thinking like,

23:49.940 --> 23:50.940
yeah, I shot that thing.

23:50.940 --> 23:53.940
It didn't get affected at all by my gun,

23:53.940 --> 23:59.940
but I did see, fucking not Fayetteville, Lafayette.

23:59.940 --> 24:02.940
I saw Lafayette burn one to death.

24:02.940 --> 24:03.940
Fayetteville, D'Artagnan.

24:03.940 --> 24:04.940
Fayetteville.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.940
I saw Fayetteville burn one to death.

24:06.940 --> 24:10.940
So because I can't move because Harvey's got his grip on me,

24:10.940 --> 24:15.940
I pull my lighter back out and I try to just set the picture on the wall on fire.

24:15.940 --> 24:18.940
Stop setting shit on fire, dude.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.940
I'm just picturing in amongst all this chaos,

24:22.940 --> 24:25.940
you're standing there almost casually with your arm out

24:25.940 --> 24:28.940
as this picture frame slowly smoulders.

24:30.940 --> 24:32.940
My plan is to hide out in a room.

24:32.940 --> 24:34.940
I was going to lock myself in a room on the second floor

24:34.940 --> 24:36.940
and you're about to burn me out, dude.

24:36.940 --> 24:37.940
Well, I wasn't going to do that

24:37.940 --> 24:39.940
and I figured you'd just come along with us.

24:39.940 --> 24:41.940
So fire kills him.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.940
And while you're having this debate,

24:43.940 --> 24:46.940
you can see Margaret Payne is there,

24:46.940 --> 24:47.940
still under the chandelier.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.940
She's looking around in panic

24:49.940 --> 24:51.940
and she just makes eye contact with you at the top of the stairs,

24:51.940 --> 24:55.940
one bloody hand reaching up towards you.

24:55.940 --> 24:59.940
And there's one of these creatures that's swooping down,

24:59.940 --> 25:02.940
buzzing down towards her menacingly.

25:04.940 --> 25:05.940
We got to help Maggie.

25:05.940 --> 25:07.940
She's in Margaret Payne.

25:10.940 --> 25:13.940
Now's the moment for a gentleman to shine, I suppose,

25:13.940 --> 25:16.940
and I jet pack down the hallway.

25:18.940 --> 25:20.940
Fantastic.

25:20.940 --> 25:21.940
Are you going for the chandelier?

25:21.940 --> 25:23.940
Are you going for the creature that's about to attack her?

25:23.940 --> 25:24.940
What are you doing?

25:24.940 --> 25:28.940
I'm going to go, yeah, I'm going to go try to intercept it

25:28.940 --> 25:30.940
before I can get to her.

25:30.940 --> 25:36.940
And I'm like, Harvey, lift that off the lady there, you brute,

25:36.940 --> 25:37.940
if you're still with me.

25:37.940 --> 25:41.940
I'm following him for sure, but do you hit the creature?

25:41.940 --> 25:42.940
We don't know yet.

25:42.940 --> 25:44.940
Well, let's find out.

25:44.940 --> 25:48.940
So I think this comes down to your 35% piloting roll.

25:48.940 --> 25:50.940
I'll let you use that as a combat skill.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.940
This thing is going to attack you in return,

25:53.940 --> 25:56.940
and it's going to try to bring you down to the ground

25:56.940 --> 25:58.940
so it can rip you apart with its pincers.

26:02.940 --> 26:04.940
Yeah, 33!

26:04.940 --> 26:05.940
33 on a 35?

26:05.940 --> 26:06.940
Yeah.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.940
Oh, my God, it's a success.

26:08.940 --> 26:09.940
Oh, but it's not a crit.

26:09.940 --> 26:10.940
Yeah, no crit.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.940
But it's a success.

26:12.940 --> 26:14.940
Let me just see.

26:14.940 --> 26:15.940
I've got a success for it.

26:15.940 --> 26:18.940
I'm just checking to see whether it's an ordinary or a hard one.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.940
It is an ordinary one.

26:21.940 --> 26:24.940
It just missed a hard success by 1%.

26:26.940 --> 26:31.940
So, yeah, you slam into this thing at speed.

26:31.940 --> 26:35.940
It doesn't have a face, so it's difficult to describe it as looking surprised,

26:35.940 --> 26:37.940
but it looks surprised.

26:39.940 --> 26:41.940
So what's your plan?

26:41.940 --> 26:44.940
Are you trying to take it outside?

26:44.940 --> 26:46.940
Are you slamming it into a wall?

26:46.940 --> 26:48.940
Are you slamming it into the ground?

26:48.940 --> 26:50.940
I am probably as surprised as it is,

26:50.940 --> 26:54.940
and I am just going to try to jetpack away.

26:54.940 --> 26:56.940
I don't know if I can get it to follow me,

26:56.940 --> 26:59.940
but I basically want to try to lead it away.

26:59.940 --> 27:00.940
You've got a hold of it, I think.

27:00.940 --> 27:01.940
You've got it.

27:01.940 --> 27:03.940
I mean, basically, you've barreled into it.

27:03.940 --> 27:04.940
You've got hold of it.

27:04.940 --> 27:05.940
Right.

27:05.940 --> 27:08.940
Then I hold it tight, and I'm like,

27:08.940 --> 27:10.940
oh, what's something clever to say, boys?

27:10.940 --> 27:13.940
Always the thing that you want, huh?

27:14.940 --> 27:15.940
Say that.

27:16.940 --> 27:21.940
Yeah, I say, well, you can't always get what you want, I suppose.

27:23.940 --> 27:26.940
Something about this party has been bugging me.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.940
I say, fuck you, bug man.

27:33.940 --> 27:35.940
And as I'm holding it tight,

27:35.940 --> 27:41.940
yeah, I'm going to try to just drop it into a wall with some momentum,

27:41.940 --> 27:43.940
bowl it a little bit.

27:43.940 --> 27:45.940
Okay, so, I mean, as you're doing that,

27:45.940 --> 27:48.940
I think it's going to have one chance to attack you,

27:48.940 --> 27:50.940
because as you're holding onto it,

27:50.940 --> 27:55.940
it becomes very apparent in just how many sharp appendages it has,

27:55.940 --> 27:58.940
and it's bringing a couple of these big pincers up

27:58.940 --> 28:01.940
to see whether it can remove your face.

28:04.940 --> 28:07.940
How are you trying to prevent it from removing your face?

28:08.940 --> 28:12.940
I think I'm going to try to take some wild maneuvers with the,

28:12.940 --> 28:14.940
like, if I see him going for a swipe,

28:14.940 --> 28:19.940
I'm going to try to, like, do a big drop with the jet pack.

28:19.940 --> 28:21.940
So you can use your pilot as a defensive skill,

28:21.940 --> 28:23.940
and give that a try.

28:25.940 --> 28:26.940
93.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.940
Okay, I got a success.

28:30.940 --> 28:37.940
So, yeah, this creature has brought its claw up,

28:37.940 --> 28:40.940
and, oof, this could hurt.

28:42.940 --> 28:45.940
I think you should clip that and put it at the beginning of the first episode.

28:45.940 --> 28:47.940
Ooh, this could hurt.

28:48.940 --> 28:53.940
So that's six hit points of damage as this pincer closes on your face.

28:53.940 --> 28:57.940
I mean, it takes a chunk of meat off the end of your nose,

28:57.940 --> 28:59.940
and there's blood running down into your mouth.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.940
You bastard.

29:03.940 --> 29:04.940
I say.

29:04.940 --> 29:05.940
I say.

29:05.940 --> 29:06.940
Good man.

29:07.940 --> 29:11.940
And with that, you said you were going to try to throw it into a ball.

29:12.940 --> 29:13.940
Yeah.

29:13.940 --> 29:18.940
Okay, I think it's going to try to hold on to you as you do that.

29:19.940 --> 29:24.940
So, yeah, if you want to give me again your pilot roll,

29:24.940 --> 29:31.940
and I shall roll again for its, sink its sharp appendages into Lafayette roll.

29:32.940 --> 29:37.940
I'd like to do just a fast-talk roll to it to say don't.

29:38.940 --> 29:40.940
He says it real fast, though.

29:40.940 --> 29:41.940
I roll to 0-3.

29:41.940 --> 29:42.940
Oof.

29:43.940 --> 29:44.940
I rolled a 20.

29:45.940 --> 29:47.940
Okay, so it beats you.

29:47.940 --> 29:48.940
Yeah.

29:48.940 --> 29:51.940
And so, yeah, I mean, you try to throw it away from you,

29:51.940 --> 29:59.940
but as you do so, it sinks its sharp claws and the ends of its legs into your flesh.

29:59.940 --> 30:01.940
And as you try throwing it away from your body,

30:01.940 --> 30:09.940
you can just feel multiple rips in your body as it holds onto you for dear life.

30:09.940 --> 30:14.940
Because that's an extreme roll, it does maximum damage on this.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.940
So that is...

30:17.940 --> 30:18.940
Ow!

30:19.940 --> 30:21.940
So, yes, that is 10 hit points of damage.

30:22.940 --> 30:23.940
Ouchy ouchy.

30:23.940 --> 30:27.940
Is that 16 that you just within a second?

30:28.940 --> 30:29.940
Yes.

30:29.940 --> 30:33.940
My current hit points now are, that was 10 just then?

30:33.940 --> 30:34.940
Yeah.

30:34.940 --> 30:35.940
Yeah, so I'm down to 9.

30:35.940 --> 30:36.940
So that's good.

30:36.940 --> 30:40.940
Okay, so you're still wrestling with this creature in the air.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.940
What's everyone else doing while this is going on?

30:43.940 --> 30:49.940
Can Harvey see that happening and he wants to run up and punch this thing off of him?

30:49.940 --> 30:51.940
It's got to be quite difficult to do,

30:51.940 --> 30:55.940
because the two of them are pretty much bouncing off the ceiling and the walls all around you,

30:55.940 --> 30:57.940
moving at speed.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.940
So it's not only like trying to hit a pinata,

31:00.940 --> 31:03.940
but it's like trying to hit a pinata that's actively running away from you.

31:03.940 --> 31:08.940
Well, if that's the case, if I don't think it's possible, then I would help try to get Margaret out from another chandelier.

31:08.940 --> 31:11.940
Okay, yeah, you can give me a strength roll to do that.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.940
That's a 50 on a 90?

31:15.940 --> 31:20.940
Yeah, you manage to lift the chandelier off her and she's quite bloody and bruised,

31:20.940 --> 31:23.940
but she drags herself out from underneath it and says,

31:23.940 --> 31:28.940
Oh, thank you so much. I thought I was done for there.

31:28.940 --> 31:30.940
We need to get to 6.

31:30.940 --> 31:33.940
Safety, we're safe. Where is safe?

31:33.940 --> 31:36.940
Shall we get a car and get out of here?

31:36.940 --> 31:39.940
Sorry, the car's not an option. They're destroyed out there.

31:39.940 --> 31:44.940
There was nobody upstairs. That's probably the most safe place at this point right now.

31:44.940 --> 31:47.940
All right, yes, yes, I'll do that.

31:47.940 --> 31:53.940
And she starts limping up the stairs as fast as her damaged legs will take her.

31:53.940 --> 31:57.940
At the top of the stairs, Checkers is trying to light things up.

31:57.940 --> 32:02.940
At the top of the stairs, Checkers is trying to light fires.

32:02.940 --> 32:09.940
Well, you are being beaten to the punch slightly because you can see where these things,

32:09.940 --> 32:13.940
the ones that are armed with these things that look like cameras have been firing them,

32:13.940 --> 32:18.940
that there are bits of the wall and ceiling now which are beginning to catch fire.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.940
Perfect.

32:23.940 --> 32:27.940
Yeah, we're on their side now, so this seems fine.

32:29.940 --> 32:33.940
Elden, what do we do now? That's your master.

32:33.940 --> 32:35.940
Yeah, I'm looking for the religion man.

32:35.940 --> 32:36.940
The Reverend.

32:36.940 --> 32:40.940
Okay, give me, actually give me a listen roll.

32:42.940 --> 32:44.940
Ooh, 14 on a 50.

32:44.940 --> 32:50.940
So you don't see him, but you hear from the ballroom his voice and it's loud.

32:50.940 --> 32:56.940
It's cutting through the chaos and he's shouting in absolute fury,

32:56.940 --> 32:59.940
you idiots, you are ruining this.

32:59.940 --> 33:01.940
You are ruining everything.

33:02.940 --> 33:07.940
Come on guys, we should go talk to the man with the collar.

33:09.940 --> 33:10.940
I follow you.

33:11.940 --> 33:19.940
So we're going down the stairs as the injured Margaret Payne is being helped up the stairs by Harvey Warby.

33:19.940 --> 33:24.940
I think I probably just sent her on her way because my wife is still flying around.

33:27.940 --> 33:29.940
She's going to hide under a bed somewhere.

33:29.940 --> 33:30.940
Smart.

33:30.940 --> 33:33.940
Yeah, I mean the rest of you gather downstairs.

33:33.940 --> 33:39.940
There are people running all over the place just trying to get the hell out of here.

33:39.940 --> 33:41.940
A couple of them are on fire.

33:44.940 --> 33:45.940
There are some on the ground.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.940
Immediate laughter from the PTBP crew.

33:47.940 --> 33:49.940
Someone was on fire.

33:51.940 --> 33:53.940
In the climax of a horror movie.

33:55.940 --> 33:57.940
A couple of people on fire, some Wilhelm screams.

33:57.940 --> 33:59.940
It's like, this is great.

33:59.940 --> 34:01.940
Yeah, it is exactly that.

34:01.940 --> 34:09.940
What I would like if you're trying to make your way through to the ballroom is dodge rolls off everyone to avoid being stampeded by the panicking people.

34:10.940 --> 34:11.940
10.

34:11.940 --> 34:12.940
Uh oh.

34:12.940 --> 34:14.940
Hey, I passed a 21 on a 25.

34:14.940 --> 34:15.940
94.

34:15.940 --> 34:16.940
I fail.

34:16.940 --> 34:21.940
So, those of you who failed, so, sorry, was that just Mr. Soul who failed?

34:21.940 --> 34:23.940
Soul and Harvey Birdman.

34:23.940 --> 34:24.940
No, I passed.

34:24.940 --> 34:25.940
Oh, you passed. Sorry, my bad. Just me?

34:25.940 --> 34:26.940
Just you.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.940
Oh, okay, cool. I thought anyone...

34:28.940 --> 34:32.940
So the rest of you are kind of weaving and elbowing your way through the panicking throng.

34:32.940 --> 34:40.940
But, yeah, Mr. Soul gets knocked to the ground and someone's foot slams into your face as they're running off.

34:40.940 --> 34:41.940
Oh, no.

34:41.940 --> 34:47.940
And you take a grand total of one hit point of damage.

34:47.940 --> 34:48.940
Oh, no.

34:48.940 --> 34:50.940
It was a little dainty foot.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.940
Oh, just a little dainty foot.

34:52.940 --> 34:53.940
Yeah, it was a size three.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.940
It was a child.

34:55.940 --> 34:57.940
But the point is, you're down at the ground.

34:57.940 --> 35:06.940
The rest of you, through the doors to the ballroom, you can see Reverend Nye is just marching through the panicking crowd.

35:06.940 --> 35:14.940
The air is thick with smoke now, and there's more of these creatures buzzing around these electrical arcs flying everywhere.

35:14.940 --> 35:20.940
And you see the air around Reverend Nye seems to be shimmering.

35:20.940 --> 35:23.940
It's like he has his own personal heat haze around him.

35:23.940 --> 35:32.940
His eyes are absolutely black and he just marches up in the direction of one of these flying creatures, shouting,

35:32.940 --> 35:35.940
you idiots, you're ruining this, you idiots.

35:35.940 --> 35:40.940
And he raises his hand up and there is this shockwave of force.

35:40.940 --> 35:49.940
And the creature flies through the air, impacts the wall behind it, and then just splats like a bug on a windshield.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.940
We should have just done that.

35:51.940 --> 36:01.940
I see that through the crowd of legs and feet, like all through, and I'm like, oh, my God, another one like me.

36:01.940 --> 36:08.940
Oh, yeah. I mean, his eyes are absolutely jet black at the moment and the air is shimmering around him with the heat.

36:08.940 --> 36:10.940
I can learn so much from this man.

36:10.940 --> 36:14.940
I help him off the ground and like try to get him over to the reverend.

36:14.940 --> 36:19.940
Yeah, the reverend standing there looking around, his face a mask of fury.

36:19.940 --> 36:28.940
And as he sees you coming towards him, Jesse's movement coming towards him, he whips around and raises his hand up again.

36:28.940 --> 36:31.940
But pauses for a moment as he sees that it's you.

36:31.940 --> 36:35.940
How do I do that, too, so we can eliminate the issues?

36:35.940 --> 36:37.940
There is no time.

36:37.940 --> 36:42.940
We have to protect Cicero's invention at all cost.

36:42.940 --> 36:51.940
It needs to be shown to the world this is such a delicate time, such a precious time.

36:51.940 --> 36:57.940
We need to make sure that his invention goes out there and changes the world.

36:57.940 --> 37:00.940
Can his invention help get rid of all these things?

37:00.940 --> 37:07.940
I don't know. Maybe. I mean, honestly, I don't understand how it works.

37:07.940 --> 37:16.940
This is Cicero's doing. But if you think you understand it, then have at it.

37:16.940 --> 37:25.940
Dark soul runs over and in one fell swoop grabs onto the canvas atop it and does the big swipe to unveil it.

37:25.940 --> 37:28.940
And I want to roll Cthulhu Mythos.

37:28.940 --> 37:32.940
Actually, Cthulhu Mythos doesn't really apply.

37:32.940 --> 37:33.940
Oh, shit.

37:33.940 --> 37:45.940
Yeah, what you're looking at is just basically a big metal box with a number of dials and meters on it.

37:45.940 --> 37:48.940
Fuck.

37:48.940 --> 37:55.940
Lafayette! David! Help! Science! Science, man!

37:55.940 --> 37:58.940
This is beyond my mystical capabilities.

37:58.940 --> 38:04.940
I yell and look and see him flying around with a crab person on him.

38:04.940 --> 38:08.940
If I get out of that, I've got just the thing for this.

38:08.940 --> 38:14.940
Let's see whether Lafayette can get out of this so he can have another try at splatting your bug friend.

38:14.940 --> 38:21.940
Can I offer help in some way that maybe I'm such a hulking big mass that maybe I can just try and get my body in the way of them?

38:21.940 --> 38:29.940
I'll tell you what. Let's have a dex roll to see whether you can get into a position whereby you can actually attack them.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.940
Or at least attack the bug. Maybe not Lafayette.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.940
I hit an 11 on a 50.

38:38.940 --> 38:48.940
Okay. Yeah, I mean, you reckon if you get up onto the stage, you can probably maybe stage dive onto the flying clusterfuck that's going around you.

38:48.940 --> 38:49.940
Yes!

38:49.940 --> 38:51.940
Hell yeah, that's what I want to do.

38:51.940 --> 38:53.940
Right as the breakdown starts.

38:53.940 --> 38:57.940
This is some jingle all the way shit and I am here for it.

38:57.940 --> 39:08.940
Could I attempt a biology roll against this creature to find any weak spots? It's a science I have. Science biology.

39:08.940 --> 39:15.940
I think because this thing does not follow terrestrial biology, you could make a Cthulhu Mythos roll.

39:15.940 --> 39:24.940
Yeah, I don't have anything good there. I guess I'll continue trying to fly against a pilot against it.

39:24.940 --> 39:28.940
Yeah, I mean, you can certainly see Harvey getting ready to join in the fray.

39:28.940 --> 39:31.940
Yeah, so I'll just try to steer things towards him.

39:31.940 --> 39:38.940
Okay. Yeah, then give me a policy roll. This would be a great time to roll a double zero.

39:41.940 --> 39:42.940
67.

39:42.940 --> 39:43.940
Damn.

39:43.940 --> 40:08.940
The good news is that you are heading roughly in the direction where Harvey is. The bad news is, I mean, initially they were flying overhead, but now Lafayette seems to have lost control of this and they've ducked down a bit and you realize that now both he and the creature are cannonballing towards you, Harvey, at speed.

40:08.940 --> 40:14.940
I mean, you have a choice about what to do here. You've got maybe half a second before they hit you like a wrecking ball.

40:14.940 --> 40:18.940
I want to try and tank the hit and grab onto him to pull him down to the ground.

40:18.940 --> 40:19.940
Okay.

40:19.940 --> 40:26.940
Yeah, you can make a fighting brawl roll here, and if you fail, this could hurt really badly.

40:32.940 --> 40:33.940
Oh, no.

40:34.940 --> 40:39.940
I was so fucking excited because I have an 80 in fighting brawl, but I rolled a 98.

40:39.940 --> 40:40.940
Oh.

40:40.940 --> 40:44.940
I mean, it's not a fumble. You could spend 18 points of luck and make that a success.

40:44.940 --> 40:46.940
Oh, hell yeah, that's what I'll do.

40:47.940 --> 40:48.940
Yeah.

40:48.940 --> 40:49.940
What does that leave you with?

40:49.940 --> 40:50.940
What's 59 minus 18?

40:50.940 --> 40:51.940
41.

40:51.940 --> 40:58.940
You're about to miss, but then you slip on, like, a trumpeter's blood and get a direct hit.

40:58.940 --> 41:00.940
Trumpeter's blood.

41:00.940 --> 41:02.940
That fucking clarinet is dead.

41:04.940 --> 41:10.940
Okay, so you're grabbing hold of this thing as it is barreling towards you.

41:10.940 --> 41:16.940
Am I strong enough? Does that roll help me pull them and, like, pull them, or do I get pulled along with them?

41:16.940 --> 41:21.940
At the moment, yeah, you're probably getting pulled along with them.

41:22.940 --> 41:33.940
So, yeah, I'm imagining it now as the two of you holding on to this creature being piloted by Lafayette's jetpack.

41:33.940 --> 41:43.940
Harvey may be holding on to the undercarriage of this creature, and, yeah, the creature is pretty nonplussed by all of this.

41:43.940 --> 41:48.940
And I think it probably wants to get Harvey off it at this stage.

41:49.940 --> 41:56.940
It's basically got to bring up one of its pincers and try to gut you with it. What are you doing when it does this?

41:57.940 --> 42:03.940
Harvey wants to hit this thing in the squishy part of its head that we've seen pulsating. He wants to try and hit it there.

42:03.940 --> 42:06.940
So whatever maneuver I can make to do that.

42:06.940 --> 42:10.940
That's just a straight fighting brawl roll. Cool.

42:10.940 --> 42:17.940
I'm going to throw up. It's an 85 on an 80.

42:17.940 --> 42:19.940
Do you have five luck?

42:19.940 --> 42:20.940
I do have five luck.

42:20.940 --> 42:27.940
But you'd need to get a hard success, because I got an ordinary success on its attack versus you, and you're fighting back here.

42:27.940 --> 42:32.940
So, yeah, you'd need to have a result of 40 here.

42:32.940 --> 42:33.940
Ouch!

42:33.940 --> 42:35.940
Yeah, that's not happening.

42:35.940 --> 42:37.940
Would I roll an 85?

42:38.940 --> 42:39.940
45 luck?

42:39.940 --> 42:40.940
I've got 41.

42:43.940 --> 42:47.940
On the price side, it's obviously a bit...

42:47.940 --> 42:55.940
Oh, oh, wait! Hang on. One of my special talents is called Rapid Attack, and I can spend 10 luck to gain an extra melee attack.

42:55.940 --> 42:56.940
Yeah.

42:56.940 --> 42:58.940
Go for it. Go for it.

42:58.940 --> 42:59.940
Awesome.

43:04.940 --> 43:06.940
But you can spend luck on this one.

43:06.940 --> 43:08.940
Okay, yeah. That's an 81.

43:08.940 --> 43:12.940
This is a follow-up attack, which I'll deal with in a moment.

43:12.940 --> 43:18.940
But on your first attack there, you did take three damage as it sunk its claws into you.

43:18.940 --> 43:24.940
But then you're punching it right back. It's still trying to gut you, so it's fighting back.

43:24.940 --> 43:27.940
So it needs a hard success here.

43:27.940 --> 43:30.940
And it's only got an ordinary one, so this time you are hurting it.

43:30.940 --> 43:31.940
Nice!

43:31.940 --> 43:32.940
Hell yeah!

43:32.940 --> 43:34.940
So give me a damage roll on that.

43:34.940 --> 43:36.940
That would be a d3 plus your damage bonus.

43:36.940 --> 43:38.940
d3, you're just half a d6, is that how you do it?

43:38.940 --> 43:39.940
Yeah.

43:39.940 --> 43:43.940
That's a 2, but my damage bonus is a d6.

43:43.940 --> 43:44.940
Ah, that's good.

43:44.940 --> 43:45.940
That's a 5.

43:45.940 --> 43:46.940
So 7.

43:46.940 --> 43:47.940
7.

43:47.940 --> 43:51.940
Okay, I better make a con roll for it.

43:53.940 --> 43:58.940
You punch it in the squidgy part of its head, and yeah, it goes limp.

43:58.940 --> 43:59.940
Oh, hell yeah.

43:59.940 --> 44:00.940
Oh.

44:01.940 --> 44:03.940
Well done, Avi.

44:03.940 --> 44:08.940
While this is going on, the other two had both of you over with all the equipment?

44:08.940 --> 44:11.940
Yeah, I was over with Dark.

44:11.940 --> 44:17.940
And Reverend Nye has come over as well, and he looks out the window at this stage,

44:17.940 --> 44:24.940
and through the snow sees just the burning remains of the tower out there.

44:24.940 --> 44:31.940
And he just stops for a moment, staring at this thing.

44:32.940 --> 44:38.940
There was the heat haze of anger around him before, but it seems to have gone up a few hundred degrees.

44:38.940 --> 44:43.940
And you can just feel the stage shaking underneath him.

44:43.940 --> 44:45.940
Did you need that?

44:49.940 --> 44:52.940
What happened to the tower?

44:52.940 --> 44:55.940
Oh, yeah, that's crazy.

44:55.940 --> 44:57.940
No one knows who could have done this.

44:58.940 --> 45:02.940
We're all looking for who's burned down the tower.

45:03.940 --> 45:06.940
It must be those monsters that did it.

45:06.940 --> 45:09.940
Do you want to give me a fast talk roll like your life depends on it?

45:10.940 --> 45:11.940
Yeah.

45:13.940 --> 45:17.940
I got a 64, but I have a 60, so I'm going to spend 4 luck and pass.

45:17.940 --> 45:18.940
Okay.

45:18.940 --> 45:23.940
And so there is a brief moment of hesitation.

45:24.940 --> 45:32.940
And the temperature drops again by a few degrees, and he looks around and says,

45:32.940 --> 45:38.940
I will find out who is responsible for this and I will destroy them.

45:41.940 --> 45:42.940
Yeah.

45:42.940 --> 45:44.940
Yeah. Would you like help?

45:44.940 --> 45:48.940
No, he says, and turns and storms off the stage.

45:48.940 --> 45:50.940
Wait, how does this thing work?

45:50.940 --> 45:52.940
He ignores you and walks off.

45:53.940 --> 45:55.940
How does this thing work?

45:55.940 --> 45:58.940
Can I try to find an on button?

45:58.940 --> 46:00.940
Luke, it doesn't anymore.

46:00.940 --> 46:02.940
Oh, yeah, because of the tower.

46:02.940 --> 46:06.940
Because literally the stuff you did, you were a part of it.

46:06.940 --> 46:08.940
We smashed it up real good.

46:10.940 --> 46:16.940
So while the Reverend Nye storms off the stage, I mean, he almost casually flicks his hand up

46:16.940 --> 46:20.940
and another one of these things spirals and bounces off the ground.

46:20.940 --> 46:23.940
This is one that's holding a camera type thing.

46:23.940 --> 46:30.940
And as it bounces off the ground, this huge arc of electricity comes off it and shoots

46:30.940 --> 46:32.940
over in your direction.

46:32.940 --> 46:35.940
Can I have a group luck roll?

46:35.940 --> 46:38.940
Whoever's got the lowest luck out of the four of you?

46:38.940 --> 46:39.940
I have 4.

46:43.940 --> 46:44.940
34.

46:44.940 --> 46:45.940
Damn.

46:46.940 --> 46:47.940
OK.

46:47.940 --> 46:51.940
And with that, the arc of electricity hits the console.

46:55.940 --> 47:00.940
And all of a sudden, there are explosions and sparks coming off it.

47:00.940 --> 47:03.940
There's electricity now.

47:03.940 --> 47:08.940
I mean, not just the arc of electricity, but the electricity within the console is sparking

47:08.940 --> 47:10.940
your way now as well.

47:11.940 --> 47:16.940
Just all this, you can feel your hair standing on end.

47:16.940 --> 47:20.940
Yeah, the air itself seems to be electrified.

47:20.940 --> 47:22.940
What are you doing?

47:22.940 --> 47:27.940
Is that, did the camera thing, it's like dropped by the bug guy, right?

47:27.940 --> 47:28.940
It is.

47:28.940 --> 47:32.940
And yeah, it's basically just spinning around on the ground, sending out random sparks of

47:32.940 --> 47:34.940
energy now.

47:34.940 --> 47:35.940
Oh, OK.

47:35.940 --> 47:37.940
I was going to grab it, but I don't think I'm going to grab it.

47:37.940 --> 47:40.940
Well, I'm going to run after it and try to grab it.

47:40.940 --> 47:41.940
OK.

47:41.940 --> 47:44.940
And I'm going to go try to work this machine.

47:44.940 --> 47:49.940
Yeah, my goal is to grab it and then direct it at the machine to give it even more juice.

47:49.940 --> 47:54.940
And I'm going to be trying to press buttons that look like they do stuff.

47:54.940 --> 47:59.940
And I'm well educated, so maybe I read about it in a book.

48:01.940 --> 48:04.940
This new invention that it was just revealed.

48:04.940 --> 48:05.940
Yeah.

48:05.940 --> 48:08.940
Yeah, this hasn't quite made it into the books yet.

48:08.940 --> 48:10.940
OK, fuck.

48:10.940 --> 48:11.940
Right.

48:11.940 --> 48:12.940
Sorry.

48:12.940 --> 48:16.940
OK, so you're trying to get the machine working.

48:16.940 --> 48:22.940
What's Lafayette doing now that the creature that you're flying around with seems to have

48:22.940 --> 48:23.940
stopped fighting?

48:23.940 --> 48:28.940
Well, if it stopped grappling me, I'm going to stop grappling it and try to bring Harvey

48:28.940 --> 48:32.940
and I to a safe stop and we just kind of ditch the corpse, maybe try to drop it on another

48:32.940 --> 48:33.940
one of these things.

48:33.940 --> 48:34.940
OK.

48:34.940 --> 48:35.940
Yeah.

48:35.940 --> 48:36.940
Yeah.

48:36.940 --> 48:37.940
You can do that easily enough.

48:37.940 --> 48:40.940
You are in a target rich environment.

48:40.940 --> 48:45.940
So, yeah, we bought one of the other ones with this thing's corpse and it's pretty funny

48:45.940 --> 48:48.940
and we share a little chuckle about that.

48:48.940 --> 48:54.940
And and then, yeah, I see them like futzing with this machine, which now seems to be on

48:54.940 --> 48:56.940
fire and sparking with electricity.

48:56.940 --> 48:57.940
Yeah.

48:57.940 --> 49:03.940
Lafayette's eyes just get super wide and he's like, come, Harvey, we need it right away.

49:03.940 --> 49:12.940
He lands right next to the machine and kind of pushes checkers out of the way and he starts

49:12.940 --> 49:15.940
going away at it using computer use.

49:15.940 --> 49:18.940
This would be electrical repair.

49:18.940 --> 49:21.940
Well, then he uses electrical repair.

49:21.940 --> 49:22.940
Yeah.

49:22.940 --> 49:23.940
OK.

49:23.940 --> 49:27.940
Before we do that, let's just deal with, was it Mr.

49:27.940 --> 49:34.940
Soul who was going off to try to grab the electrical gun that was misfiring?

49:34.940 --> 49:39.940
Yeah, doing a real hopscotch situation, trying to avoid the electrical bolts flying off this

49:39.940 --> 49:40.940
thing.

49:40.940 --> 49:46.940
OK, then give me a DODGE roll to see what you can get to it without getting shot in

49:46.940 --> 49:48.940
the process.

49:48.940 --> 49:50.940
54 on a 30.

49:50.940 --> 49:52.940
So I'm going to spend 24 LUCK.

49:52.940 --> 49:53.940
Oh, nice.

49:53.940 --> 49:54.940
To succeed.

49:54.940 --> 49:55.940
OK.

49:55.940 --> 49:57.940
So I'm going to go from 39 down to 15.

49:57.940 --> 49:58.940
Oh, OK.

49:58.940 --> 50:00.940
That's what Scott likes to hear.

50:00.940 --> 50:06.940
So, yeah, you've managed to leap over this arc of electricity just as he was about to

50:06.940 --> 50:10.940
take your legs off and grab hold of this device.

50:10.940 --> 50:16.940
It looks like, yes, it does have controls on it that are supposed to determine when

50:16.940 --> 50:17.940
it discharges.

50:17.940 --> 50:20.940
But on the other hand, this thing is very definitely damaged.

50:20.940 --> 50:22.940
It's just shooting randomly.

50:22.940 --> 50:29.940
Knowing that it's randomly shooting, I'm just focusing on hefting it, you know, and

50:29.940 --> 50:35.940
making sure that it is facing not at anyone who's working on the machine, but basically

50:35.940 --> 50:40.940
like at a wall until I can run over to the machine close enough to direct it into the

50:40.940 --> 50:44.940
machine and not at any of my new friends who are over there.

50:44.940 --> 50:45.940
OK, yeah.

50:45.940 --> 50:47.940
Yeah, you can do that.

50:47.940 --> 50:50.940
Yeah, I don't see any reason for a roll.

50:50.940 --> 50:56.940
So you can just do that for a bit while the others try to get to grips with the malfunctioning

50:56.940 --> 50:57.940
machine.

50:57.940 --> 51:02.940
Now, just as Lafayette is getting to grips with it and trying to work out how to fix

51:02.940 --> 51:03.940
this.

51:03.940 --> 51:06.940
I mean, first of all, yeah, you can make that electrical repair roll to see whether you

51:06.940 --> 51:08.940
can see how to fix this.

51:08.940 --> 51:13.940
Twelve, which is, I believe, an extreme success.

51:13.940 --> 51:14.940
OK.

51:14.940 --> 51:16.940
So, yeah, I mean, you can see.

51:16.940 --> 51:23.940
I mean, if you can just get inside the works and disconnect that red wire over there,

51:23.940 --> 51:28.940
then you can at least stop any further damage or at least you can probably limit any

51:28.940 --> 51:31.940
further damage while it's on fire.

51:31.940 --> 51:36.940
I mean, it's going to be difficult saving the machine because of the fire, but that's

51:36.940 --> 51:37.940
a separate problem.

51:37.940 --> 51:44.940
But the problem is that as you reach in to do that, this shockwave of energy comes off

51:44.940 --> 51:51.940
the machine and all of a sudden it's like the room gets turned upside down.

51:51.940 --> 51:55.940
Oh, we could do cocaine off the ceiling.

51:55.940 --> 51:59.940
His final trick was perfecting the anti-graviton.

51:59.940 --> 52:00.940
Yeah.

52:00.940 --> 52:01.940
Yeah.

52:01.940 --> 52:06.940
I mean, as a mad scientist, yeah, clearly that's what's come to mind.

52:06.940 --> 52:07.940
Yes.

52:07.940 --> 52:12.940
This has managed to reverse the graviton pulse or some shit like that.

52:12.940 --> 52:13.940
Yeah.

52:13.940 --> 52:16.940
All of a sudden you are falling towards the ceiling fast.

52:16.940 --> 52:17.940
Wow.

52:17.940 --> 52:18.940
Wow.

52:18.940 --> 52:21.940
So it was like yours, but cooler.

52:21.940 --> 52:26.940
I wouldn't say that.

52:26.940 --> 52:32.940
What I'd like off all four of you is a jump roll just to see whether you can land on the

52:32.940 --> 52:34.940
ceiling without getting hurt.

52:34.940 --> 52:37.940
Ouchie.

52:37.940 --> 52:38.940
Oh, wait.

52:38.940 --> 52:41.940
I pass a 10 on a 20.

52:41.940 --> 52:43.940
An 0-1 on a 20.

52:43.940 --> 52:44.940
He got an 0-1.

52:44.940 --> 52:45.940
Oh, my God.

52:45.940 --> 52:46.940
Bloody hell.

52:46.940 --> 52:47.940
Yeah.

52:47.940 --> 52:50.940
I mean, you were born to walk on ceilings.

52:50.940 --> 52:51.940
Yes.

52:51.940 --> 52:54.940
I failed a 67 on a 20.

52:54.940 --> 53:01.940
I mean, for a start, you are going to take a big one hit point of damage as you land

53:01.940 --> 53:03.940
awkwardly on the ceiling.

53:03.940 --> 53:08.940
But I would also like a luck roll off Lafayette.

53:08.940 --> 53:10.940
Oh, 36.

53:10.940 --> 53:12.940
Oh, 36 on a 36.

53:12.940 --> 53:13.940
Oh, baby.

53:13.940 --> 53:15.940
The whole day.

53:15.940 --> 53:20.940
So, yes, you managed to avoid damaging your jet pack in the process.

53:20.940 --> 53:24.940
Thank God, Jetty.

53:24.940 --> 53:25.940
Wow.

53:25.940 --> 53:30.940
And, sorry, Mr. Soul failed as well, did he?

53:30.940 --> 53:31.940
Yeah.

53:31.940 --> 53:34.940
I could spend 10 luck, but I only have 15.

53:34.940 --> 53:36.940
Yeah, you take five hit points of damage.

53:36.940 --> 53:39.940
You land far more heavily on the ceiling.

53:39.940 --> 53:42.940
And so this is quite a high ceilinged room.

53:42.940 --> 53:50.940
So you are now 20 feet at least away from the burning machine that is right above you.

53:50.940 --> 53:52.940
I mean, it's maddening.

53:52.940 --> 54:02.940
You know which cable you could pull just to try to deactivate this, but it's way up there.

54:03.940 --> 54:08.940
However, will you get to it?

54:08.940 --> 54:16.940
Well, that might be a problem, Scott, for someone who doesn't have a jet pack.

54:16.940 --> 54:21.940
One, two, three, take away the compliment because you look so fine that I really want to make you mine.

54:21.940 --> 54:22.940
Okay, yeah.

54:22.940 --> 54:27.940
So he jet packs up to there or gives it a go anyway.

54:27.940 --> 54:34.940
I don't think I actually want a pilot role for this because you are basically just flying up a few feet.

54:34.940 --> 54:39.940
It's not like you're being attacked at this stage, and it's not like you're fighting strong winds.

54:39.940 --> 54:43.940
This is fairly basic stuff, so I don't think you need a role for this.

54:43.940 --> 54:47.940
He nimbly maneuvers to the machine in his kick-ass jet pack.

54:47.940 --> 54:53.940
Yeah, I mean, you've seen the wires that you can just rearrange to bypass the damage circuits.

54:53.940 --> 54:55.940
What is your goal here?

54:55.940 --> 55:02.940
Are you trying to restore this part of the machine to functionality, or are you trying to disable it?

55:02.940 --> 55:08.940
I think I'm trying to disable it, but what can I gleam of this machine's function from messing around in its innards?

55:08.940 --> 55:11.940
Give me an engineering role to understand it.

55:11.940 --> 55:13.940
96 on a 90.

55:13.940 --> 55:18.940
No, I'll spend six luck.

55:18.940 --> 55:19.940
I'll spend six luck.

55:19.940 --> 55:27.940
And so, yeah, looking at this, you're fairly certain that it's doing something absolutely amazing.

55:27.940 --> 55:32.940
Something that an idiot like Morden should never have been able to figure out how to do.

55:32.940 --> 55:43.940
It doesn't have a power source per se, that it seems to be somehow pulling ambient energy out of just the fabric of reality itself.

55:45.940 --> 55:48.940
Whoa. Holy shit.

55:48.940 --> 55:52.940
Simply to harvest energy or to power itself for some other end?

55:52.940 --> 56:04.940
It does seem to be what you thought, that it seems to be a device that can broadcast electricity or at least transmit electricity through the air.

56:04.940 --> 56:09.940
Give me an intelligence role as well, just to see whether you can work out something else there.

56:12.940 --> 56:14.940
A pass, 64 on a 75.

56:14.940 --> 56:26.940
Yeah, I mean, the other thing that might occur to you is this is also a bit similar to some of Tesla's weirder designs for death rays.

56:26.940 --> 56:30.940
Can I tell, so is this thing like spitting out energy right now?

56:30.940 --> 56:32.940
I mean, it isn't activated at the moment.

56:32.940 --> 56:38.940
You've managed to restore functionality, so you could switch it all on if you wanted to.

56:38.940 --> 56:40.940
Can I tell where the energy would come out?

56:40.940 --> 56:41.940
Through the aerial.

56:41.940 --> 56:47.940
Well, Harvey, we might be able to repurpose this. I shot this down, I guess, to the ceiling below.

56:48.940 --> 56:53.940
Harvey, we might be able to repurpose this thing as, well, some sort of death ray.

56:53.940 --> 56:57.940
But I'll need you up on the aerial, manning it like a turret gun.

57:01.940 --> 57:05.940
Is the way that the ceiling, now that we're on the ceiling, do I have easier access to it now?

57:05.940 --> 57:07.940
Because it was above the eaves of the window, right?

57:07.940 --> 57:14.940
Yeah, you'd need to clamber down, or rather, clamber up to the window, up from your perspective.

57:14.940 --> 57:18.940
So, yeah, you could jump up and pull yourself up to the window.

57:18.940 --> 57:19.940
I want to try to do that, yeah.

57:19.940 --> 57:28.940
There is this small matter of what happens when you get outside, whether what's happening with gravity is limited to this room or whether you might risk falling off into the sky.

57:29.940 --> 57:30.940
I'm real excited to find out.

57:30.940 --> 57:36.940
At the very least, his goal would be to grab onto the aerial outside there.

57:36.940 --> 57:37.940
Okay.

57:37.940 --> 57:39.940
So if he does end up falling into the sky.

57:39.940 --> 57:45.940
I mean, you could smash your way through what's left of the window really easily. It's quite badly damaged already.

57:45.940 --> 57:49.940
And then, yeah, if you want to try to grab hold of the aerial.

57:49.940 --> 57:57.940
Can I, before I do that, can I take the pocket square out of my tuxedo pocket and just throw it out the window and see where it goes?

57:57.940 --> 57:58.940
Ooh!

57:58.940 --> 57:59.940
Oh, yeah.

57:59.940 --> 58:00.940
Big brain!

58:00.940 --> 58:02.940
Give me a luck roll.

58:02.940 --> 58:03.940
Okay.

58:06.940 --> 58:08.940
That's a fail, a 68 on a 30.

58:08.940 --> 58:12.940
Okay, it floats up into the sky, or falls up into the sky.

58:12.940 --> 58:16.940
Okay, with that knowledge, I'm going to more carefully grab onto the aerial.

58:17.940 --> 58:20.940
Okay, with that knowledge, I'm going to more carefully still continue with the plan.

58:20.940 --> 58:24.940
I want to be able to grab onto the antenna that's on the outside here.

58:24.940 --> 58:29.940
I mean, outside, you can see that the cars have disappeared outside.

58:29.940 --> 58:36.940
And you can just hear the despairing cries of a few people who've gone out the front door and have fallen up into the sky as well.

58:36.940 --> 58:38.940
Holy shit!

58:38.940 --> 58:40.940
This is amazing!

58:40.940 --> 58:42.940
So cool!

58:43.940 --> 58:48.940
But you're clambering out carefully, holding onto the aerial.

58:48.940 --> 58:51.940
Are you trying to break it away from the ball?

58:51.940 --> 58:59.940
I mean, I'm doing what Lafayette told me to do, which was to try and use it and man it like a turret, but I don't know...

58:59.940 --> 59:01.940
Yeah, I mean, it's got a fixed mount on it.

59:01.940 --> 59:13.940
In order to have the freedom of movement to use it like that, you'd probably have to break it away from the ball and move it around or hold it.

59:13.940 --> 59:15.940
You seem like you're built to do that.

59:15.940 --> 59:20.940
Am I able to hold onto the building and the antenna at the same time so that if I do break it free?

59:20.940 --> 59:23.940
You could probably hook your legs around the window and hold on like that.

59:23.940 --> 59:28.940
That's what I want to do. And then I want to try and break the antenna free of the building.

59:28.940 --> 59:36.940
Then what I want is a combined strength and dex roll, so it's whichever one is lower out of the two that you're rolling against.

59:36.940 --> 59:39.940
Okay, I'm rolling on my dex, which is at a 50.

59:41.940 --> 59:43.940
And I got an 0-5.

59:43.940 --> 59:44.940
Oh yeah!

59:44.940 --> 59:46.940
It's an extreme success.

59:46.940 --> 59:53.940
Okay, so yeah, you do. You manage to break this thing off the wall and you are hanging there by your ankles.

59:53.940 --> 01:00:03.940
Feeling like you're upside down, even though you're looking up into the sky, there are plenty of these buzzing things around you.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:11.940
What's Lafayette doing at this stage? You can see that Harvey is hanging on outside the window now. You can hear the crunching.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.940
Once I broke it free, I'll yell in something like,

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.940
I got it, boss!

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:21.940
Yeah, Lafayette is floating up by the machine and he's nervously watching Harvey do all this.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:32.940
And he says, alright now Harvey, well if my calculations are correct, this should act as sort of a death ray.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.940
Here goes nothing!

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.940
And he flips the switch and turns the thing on.

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:43.940
So as this is happening, what is going on with our two cultists?

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:52.940
Checkers is just like, anytime one of those things flies near him, he's just like running away from it.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.940
But he's kind of just like not really sure what to do and just trying to stay safe.

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.940
Okay, and how about Mr. Soul?

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:10.940
Dark Soul is aiming this camera gun lightning bolt shooter action guy at the bugs now that are like still flying around.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:18.940
Yeah, this doesn't really fall under any weapon skill you might have. It's not a human weapon, so I'll give you the base chance, which is 20%.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.940
Cool.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:23.940
I rolled a 10.

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.940
Holy shit!

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:30.940
So yeah, you are just spraying electric death around this room.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:38.940
I mean, every now and then when you set fire to a bit of wall or perhaps vaporize one of the serving staff.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:45.940
But you are on the whole blasting away and killing more bugs than anything else.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:51.940
I mean, it doesn't help that you can't choose when it fires. You're just pointing and moving it around and hoping.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.940
Do you want to give me a luck roll?

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:58.940
He's just crying again. He's really confused on whether or not this is good.

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:01.940
25 on a 15.

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:07.940
As you're firing around, one of these stray bolts hits Reverend Eye.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:16.940
He's in the process of just with one fist, smashing one of these insects into an absolute pulp.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:25.940
And the bolt hits him almost immediately. His clothes are on fire, his hair is on fire, and he just turns around.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:35.940
His face looks almost inhuman now with the black eyes and the twisted, contorted features.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.940
And he almost seems to ignore the burning of his clothes.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:46.940
And he marches across the ceiling towards you, his fists raised, murder in his black eyes.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.940
What do you do?

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:55.940
I keep the camera trained on him, hoping for a shock to blast off soon.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.940
As I'm crying, I just say,

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:05.940
I just don't think that you're going to believe that it was an accident and you're just too powerful.

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:12.940
And even though I could learn so much from you, sir, it's just hopefully gonna any second now blast off.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:17.940
And he's getting closer and closer and the thing hasn't fired off yet. It hasn't fired off.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.940
You just have to, please, sir, please.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:29.940
And then just as he's about to catch up with you, just as he's about raising his fist ready to do to you what he's done to so many of these flying things,

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:36.940
the gun fires off again and shoots into him and you can see it just blasts a hole through his chest.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:38.940
And he slumps to the ceiling.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:43.940
Fuck yeah.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.940
Okay, that one was all me.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:53.940
Checkers sees this happening and like fires a shot into the dead body.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.940
Okay, yeah, that probably finishes the job off.

01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.940
Friend.

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.940
Master.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.940
I think we're gonna be okay.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:11.940
I sure hope so. It's all up to him and I point it at Harvey.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.940
Segue.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:27.940
What's up, everybody? It's Zach. Just want to pop in here real quick to thank you all for listening to the series with Scott Dorward.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:36.940
It's always such a pleasure to game with Scott and if you haven't checked it out, he also ran a Call of Cthulhu scenario he wrote called Bleak Prospect for us.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.940
It takes place in a Hoover town and it is super spooky.

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:46.940
And if you've been enjoying pretending to be people, please consider supporting us on Patreon.

You immediately gain access to 30 bonus episodes.

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:59.940
We play one-page RPGs, do Q&A sessions, go through session zeros and have a rip-roaringly good time while doing it.

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.940
And your financial support means so much to me personally.

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:08.940
I'm the producer, the editor, the social media person, the business boy, everything.

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:17.940
And it's my favorite thing in the world, but I also work a full-time job and have a healthy marriage and I try to keep a decent social life.

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.940
I sleep sometimes.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:28.940
Your support on Patreon allows me to continue to spend a dumb amount of time working on this show.

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:32.940
And I'm down to scale that up if you all are.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:41.940
So, season two is fast approaching. I don't have a date set yet, but while we do take a short break on the main feed to get season two up and running,

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.940
we're going to do a couple live streams for patrons at every level.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:54.940
Yes, so we will have every single person who is a patron of pretending to be people on Patreon for the live stream, in the chat,

01:05:54.940 --> 01:06:01.940
everybody going to get hyped for the new season alongside your monthly dose of the Den of Sin over there at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:10.940
So, if you don't already follow us on social media, now's the time to follow at pretending pod to not miss out on what's all happening,

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.940
because it's all happening, baby.

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:28.940
And with that, Lafayette flicks the switch and the death ray bursts into life.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.940
Harvey was looking down the end of it to see if it was on.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.940
I think it's totally Cicerad.

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:47.940
So, yeah, you can feel it sparking, bursting into life, and then this almighty arc of power just comes out.

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:57.940
It's only partly visible. It's less that you can see a bolt of light coming out of it and more that it seems to be setting the air around it on fire.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.940
Holy shit.

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:04.940
And, you know, certainly wherever you point it, things seem to be exploding and catching into flames.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:10.940
I'm aiming it as, I'm just kind of trying to get a feel for it, aiming at things outside the building that are flying around,

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.940
just trying to get my feel for the zapiness of it.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:20.940
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much a continuous beam, so if you're just swirling around, I mean, it is difficult to aim,

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.940
and, you know, these things are, you know, small and fast moving.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:32.940
On the bright side, your view isn't obscured by snow anymore because the snow seems to be falling up rather than down, but...

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:41.940
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll give you a choice. If you've got a higher firearm skill than Dex, I'll let you use that instead.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.940
I do have higher firearms for both handguns and rifles.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.940
Okay. I say this comes under rifles.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.940
That's a seven.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.940
Okay.

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.940
Wow, dude. Wow.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:08:03.940
So, I think, yeah, I mean, you are against all the odds, you know, wielding this thing with alarming accuracy,

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:08.940
and, I mean, you're not necessarily shooting every one of these creatures out of the sky,

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:13.940
but you've certainly shot enough of them that the others are fucking right off.

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:15.940
They do not want anything to do with this.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.940
Holy shit.

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:18.940
Fuck yeah.

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:19.940
Well done, Harvey.

01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:21.940
Good shooting, chap.

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:23.940
I turn around and look at you guys.

01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.940
Oh, thanks, guys. Oh, shit.

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:29.940
Fucking half the second story of the house just, like, slides off.

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:37.940
And it sounds like Mr. Soul and Checkers are looking over, joining in all this excitement.

01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:41.940
You probably don't notice the sound behind you at first,

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:47.940
but there is this deep, ominous rumbling sound coming from behind you.

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:52.940
What is it?

01:08:53.940 --> 01:09:01.940
And as you look around, you can see Reverend Nye's body is thrashing on the ground

01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:08.940
and splitting open and something, something is coming out of it.

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:13.940
There is this huge, blackish, red tentacle reaching out, pushing up through the floor.

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:22.940
This huge claw and another huge claw reaching out as if it's lifting itself up through the ruined remains of a body

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:24.940
that is far too small to contain it.

01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:26.940
Harvey, quick.

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.940
Direct your fire on the beast.

01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:29.940
Can I have sanity?

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:33.940
That's a hard fail on that one.

01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:34.940
Pass.

01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:35.940
Pass.

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:36.940
Oh, my God.

01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:37.940
A hundred.

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:38.940
No.

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:39.940
A hundred.

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:40.940
No.

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.940
You guys are so dead.

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:46.940
So Harvey takes the maximum sand loss on this because this is a fumble.

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.940
Fuck.

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.940
So you lose 100 points of sand.

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:52.940
What?

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.940
Oh, my God.

01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:57.940
Was it a D100?

01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.940
So that puts me down to 33.

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:00.940
No, I'm just kidding.

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.940
This is a D10 D100 sand loss.

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:12.940
So let's roll, then, for Mr. Soul, who also failed, didn't he?

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:13.940
Is that right?

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:14.940
Yeah, I failed.

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:15.940
Oh, no, no, no.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:16.940
Sorry, I succeeded.

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.940
I failed.

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.940
So Checkers loses 87 points of sand.

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:23.940
That puts me at three.

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.940
Wait, Frugal, you still had 90?

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:27.940
Yep.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.940
Oh, you're a shell of a man.

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:34.940
Oh, man.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:39.940
Yeah, I mean, you are at least indefinitely insane, but yeah, bloody hell.

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.940
And Mr. Soul loses 10 points of sand.

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.940
And yeah, can I have an INTELLIGENCE roll to see whether you go into a bat of madness?

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.940
61 on a 50.

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:53.940
That is a fail.

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.940
OK, so you are not going into a bat of madness, at least.

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:57.940
So that's something.

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:00.940
And then that just leaves Lafayette.

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:03.940
Lafayette loses 9 points of sand.

01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:06.940
How much has Lafayette lost in total?

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:07.940
10 total.

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:11.940
OK, and you've got more than 50 sand, haven't you?

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:12.940
Yes.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.940
OK, so yeah, then give me an INTELLIGENCE roll.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:20.940
7.

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.940
So you are having a bat of madness as well.

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:31.940
So basically, the only one of you who's not in a bat of madness at the moment is Mr. Soul.

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:45.940
What's even worse than that is that the person with the death ray hanging outside the window is on zero sand as this huge monster is filling up the room.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:12:03.940
I guess I'll leave it down to you guys as to whether you want to play this out in detail or just perhaps cut to a little summary of what horrible things happened to you as a result of this series of rolls.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:04.940
Let's hear the summary.

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:06.940
I'm down for the summary.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:29.940
I mean, I think between the fact that you now have a monstrous avatar of Nyarlathotep in your midst who is personally pissed off with each and every one of you and hoist them into little bits, and you have a lunatic with a death ray outside just firing wildly, I cannot see this situation ending well for any of you.

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.940
Well, we've faced worse odds.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:48.940
I think I'll leave it up to each of you, I think, to describe how horribly this ends for you.

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.940
So let's go round one by one.

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.940
How do you think this ends for Checkers?

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:15.940
Checkers sees this coming out of the ground and then just, he's lost it pretty much, but he looks up at Harvey and just sees nothing in his eyes and like realizes like, oh, we are totally fucked.

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:23.940
He goes to like just shoot himself to end it, but he doesn't have any bullets left, so he just kind of lays down.

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:29.940
Lays down on the ceiling, waiting for death.

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:39.940
And he just kind of tosses the pamphlets around him and he's like, maybe whoever finds me will take over.

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.940
And how about Lafayette?

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.940
He couldn't spend 30 luck to get out of this, could he?

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:50.940
Yeah.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:51.940
Wait, how much luck do you have?

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:52.940
30.

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:53.940
Oh, shit.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:14:05.940
If you have that much luck left, yeah, let's come back to your last then as potentially the last survivor of the massacre on the mount, as I'm sure the press will call it later.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.940
Then, OK, how about Harvey?

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:16.940
I mean, Harvey obviously is permanently insane, but that shouldn't stop you narrating a little ending for him.

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:31.940
Well, I mean, the thing that sent him into insanity is the tentacles coming out of the floor and it startled him so bad that he fumbles with the death ray and it just goes bobbling all around and it's taken out things and people and stuff he's not meaning to aim at.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.940
And he's still insane.

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:37.940
So once he gets back control of it, he's trying to point it at the tentacle thing.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:43.940
But maybe one of those errant blasts hit the machine that was powering it on.

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:44.940
Oh, yeah.

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.940
So I've got no juice to shoot at this thing.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:49.940
And it's seeing me as the biggest threat right now.

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:56.940
I assume a tentacle comes out and just grabs a hold of me and does what tentacle things in Cthulhu do.

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:01.940
I'm imagining your dying words are pew, pew, pew.

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:12.940
And how about Mr. Soul as the only sane person at the moment?

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:29.940
Yeah, Dark Soul lets off one more of these camera lightning bolts into this fucking enormous creature beast that is making its way into our dimension here and realizing that it does absolutely fuck all.

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:30.940
Oh, no, no, it does.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:31.940
It doesn't do fuck all.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:33.940
It doesn't do fuck all.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:34.940
It makes it angry.

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:36.940
Ah, yeah.

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:44.940
So once I get its attention and make it upset, then I realize, like, oh, I'm fucked.

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:45.940
This is over.

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:50.940
And so he crouches down at the side of Checkers.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:52.940
Psychic attack him.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.940
I'll see what I can do, boss.

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.940
And he turns back and psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack.

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:08.940
And he is thrusting his mind directly into this fucking creature, which the rule book says you can't do.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:13.940
You can do is I mean, you absolutely thrust your mind into it.

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.940
Just don't get your mind back again afterwards.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.940
Your mind is now its chew toy.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.940
That's even worse than your body.

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:32.940
And then, yeah, that just leaves Lafayette.

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:44.940
So how, once the dust and the screaming and the death and the fire and the madness end, how does Lafayette survive all this?

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:50.940
Well, I don't think it has ended by the time he's long gone.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:55.940
He sees all of his three companions for the evening just, like, meet horrible fates.

01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:01.940
He's probably still floating by the controls when the machine gets, like, shot by Harvey.

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:09.940
And at that moment, he just, like, watches in horror as the beast reaches out a tentacle and consumes his man.

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:13.940
As he's watching the building just collapse down around him.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:15.940
Or up.

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.940
Yeah, collapse up around him.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:29.940
He just sees a hole, through some beams, and jetpacks out of there, spending his last luck to, you know, narrowly get by before the Indiana Jones door closes on him.

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:31.940
He jets away into the night.

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:39.940
And, you know, I think the device has been destroyed, so there's no way of undoing the gravitational reverse that it did.

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:50.940
And I ordinarily would ask you for a luck roll to see what the widespread effect of this is, but you don't have any luck.

01:17:53.940 --> 01:18:03.940
So I think as Lafayette flies out over the dawn, over Vermont, you can just see this world that has been changed and reshaped.

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:05.940
Fucking cows and shit floating past me.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.940
Everything that was loose has flown off into the sky.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.940
You're gonna change the world.

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:14.940
You know?

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.940
And shall we leave it there?

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.940
As Lafayette's jetpack starts sputtering out of fuel.

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:29.940
That was incredible.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:31.940
Wow!

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.940
Thank you so much, Scott. That was amazing.

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:39.940
Has anybody ever tried to use the death ray as a gun?

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:43.940
One group has, but they weren't very successful.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:48.940
Certainly nowhere near as successful as Harvey was. That was fucking amazing.

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:54.940
Wow.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:56.940
That was great.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:02.940
Can I ask a question? If we hadn't fucked up the tower, what was the plan? That the beam would hit that tower and then do what?

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:14.940
Yeah. So the basic plan was that Cicero had built this device, not because he was a decent inventor. He was a really shit inventor, as you word out.

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:28.940
But he'd found this injured amigo at some stage and started, first of all, extorting it to create stuff for him, and then realized that he could just extract its cranial fluid, inject it into himself, and it would boost his own intelligence.

01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:31.940
So he started coming up with weird shit like that.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:39.940
So his plan was just simply to create a device to succeed where Tesla didn't, and wirelessly transmit electricity.

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:57.940
The tower was basically just a big lighthouse, and the idea was that he'd flick a switch and demonstrate to everyone that there weren't any power sources up in the tower, and yet that light would suddenly beam with an incredibly bright wattage.

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:00.940
But obviously it all went a bit wrong.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:05.940
I was going to say, that's pretty mundane. That's pretty dope. That's pretty standard cool.

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:20.940
Yeah. I mean, unbeknownst to him, Nyarlathotep had taken an interest in his work and was encouraging him along, because with World War II and the offing, he decided that what would really help World War II would be if people had death rays.

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:31.940
And so he was really keen on getting Cicero's invention out there into the world, just in time to turn the battlefields into killing fields.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:38.940
You kind of wrecked all that, but you did wipe out most of humanity, so you win some, you lose some.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:40.940
Yeah, anyone who wasn't in a basement.

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:44.940
What was the deal with the preacher, the Reverend?

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:58.940
The Reverend was an avatar of Nyarlathotep. He was basically a human avatar of Nyarlathotep, who was there just, I mean, he was the one who was going around mind-controlling people just to try to make sure that they got the good word out to the world and bigged up Cicero's invention.

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:00.940
Gotcha. Incredible.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:01.940


01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:03.940
Absolutely incredible.

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:05.940
Scott, you knocked it out of the park again for us.

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:07.940
Thank you so much, dude.

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:08.940


01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:13.940
I've been looking forward to this for a while now, and it lived up to it. I've had so much fun.

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.940
I'm glad you enjoyed it. I had an absolute blast running it.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:18.940
Yeah.

01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.940
And yes, I did laugh.

01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:31.940
For those of you who have yet to check out Scott's other stuff, you can find The Good Friends of Jackson Elias everywhere that you find podcasts.

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:44.940
It is an incredible podcast about horror gaming, role-playing, and horror gaming in general, and horror gaming in general.

01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:46.940
Yeah, that too.

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:48.940
Did I get that?

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:50.940
Concise to the point.

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:55.940
We also talk about horror films and weird fiction, but yeah, it's mostly horror gaming.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:00.940
It's a solid podcast. It's one of my go-to weeklies. I'm a huge fan, so check that out.

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.940
Thank you.

01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:07.940
And you can go back if you haven't listened to it already, The Bleak Prospect that you ran for us a year and a half, two years ago.

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:11.940
Yeah, it is extremely good. That's why you're the only person we've brought back.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:15.940
Eat it, David Winters.

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.940
I shall rub that in everyone else's faces.

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:24.940
There you go.

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:31.940
Well, I look forward to hopefully playing with you on the TV again, sir.

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:35.940
Oh, marvelous. Oh God, you were going to take a picture of that, weren't you?

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:37.940
Yes, we need to take a group picture now.

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:39.940
Oh, fuck.

01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:01.940
I didn't know that the wind could sew

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:07.940
The tissue and faggot bone

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:15.940
You were hollow and you spoke to me

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:22.940
Hollow and you said

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:30.940
I thought you might be starving

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:38.940
So I gave you everything

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:46.940
Thorns and rocks and devil's claw

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:51.940
Briers and dried red clay

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:55.940
Crocus blossoms in February

01:23:56.940 --> 01:24:00.940
And I live in May

01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:05.940
Time between a mother's fingers

01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:09.940
And spit off of a bridge

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:14.940
Restless legs at 3 p.m.

01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.940
While waiting for a fix

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:25.940
And I live in May

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:30.940
Time between a mother's fingers

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:35.940
And spit off of a bridge

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.940
Restless legs at 3 p.m.

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:46.940
While waiting for a fix

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:50.940
And I live in May

01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:56.940
Time between a mother's fingers

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:06.940
So come back here and see what's left of me

01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:15.940
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:22.940
My voice is nothing now

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:27.940
But the howl of the wind

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:31.940
Come closer dear in my teeth

01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:35.940
Better in my jaw

01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:44.940
Come closer dear in my teeth

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:49.940
Better in my jaw
