00:00.000 --> 00:06.040
Welcome, my flock. It's your pastor, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to give you a sermon

00:06.040 --> 00:11.960
about the merits of garbage collection. We are the only trash-based ministry that will

00:11.960 --> 00:21.680
broadcast you all live from 694.2 PTBP. I pray for y'all every day, hoping that a bounty

00:21.680 --> 00:29.560
of trash will fill your bellies, as it always does mine. For some reason, my producer keeps

00:29.600 --> 00:36.440
yapping on about how it's December the 6th or something, and it's about, like, 4 PM or

00:36.440 --> 00:42.240
something thereabouts. I don't know. I just wish he'd stop yammering.

00:42.240 --> 00:48.980
Time means nothing in the house of the Lord. Wolf bless you, my children, and Wolf bless

00:48.980 --> 00:54.560
this mess. It's a new Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from

00:54.560 --> 01:01.360
AtMeganIsANerd, who tweeted about the show way back in September. She writes,

01:01.360 --> 01:08.060
Dear Mr. Wolf, While my fellow agents and I were investigating some issues in contention,

01:08.060 --> 01:13.600
we became trapped in some kind of temporal anomaly. My colleagues have been scattered

01:13.600 --> 01:20.280
to the four winds of time, and your broadcast seems to be the only constant. To Chad, Drew,

01:20.280 --> 01:25.960
and Sabrina, if you can hear this, I hope you catch up to my timeline soon so we can

01:25.960 --> 01:31.960
properly theorize about what the hell is going on here. Looking forward to catching your

01:31.960 --> 01:36.560
house with a full pack soon, Mr. Wolf. From Megan.

01:36.560 --> 01:44.840
Well, Megan, my voice has been known to permeate through time and space. I beckon, but only

01:44.840 --> 01:52.440
a scant few hear the call. I know Chad, Drew, and Sabrina will hear your message, because

01:52.440 --> 01:57.640
any chosen will hear a message when I so command it of the cosmos.

01:57.640 --> 02:04.000
Haha, but anyway, I do truly hope your friends find you instead of being caught in some sort

02:04.000 --> 02:09.240
of horrible alternate timeline from which there is no return. Remember, if you want

02:09.240 --> 02:14.360
to write up something for your wolf to hout, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter.

02:14.360 --> 02:19.600
I've pretended to be people on Facebook. Fuck you, Zuckmarkerberg. Or write a five-star

02:19.600 --> 02:26.620
review on iTunes and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com. Of course, you can also support

02:26.620 --> 02:33.240
the show financially over on Patreon.com slash PretendingPod. Five bucks a month instantly

02:33.240 --> 02:40.680
unlocks access to seven exclusive bonus episodes. The most recent one is a Q&A episode.

02:40.680 --> 02:46.200
Zach discusses his campaign notes. Justin reveals his relationship with me, Wolf the

02:46.200 --> 02:51.780
Dog, but I don't know who that motherfucker is, y'all. Luke and Thomas come up with names

02:51.780 --> 02:58.280
for Contention's Army Surplus store, and Joe tells the story of a legitimate alien sighting.

02:58.280 --> 03:04.940
So legitimate, in fact, it could be up next in the news. The perhaps second iterations

03:04.940 --> 03:10.600
of the formal Contention police officers got an address and phone number for the target.

03:10.600 --> 03:18.440
The co-founder and current majority shareholder of BarCorp, Bruce Robin. Maggie Cook tossed

03:18.440 --> 03:25.120
them a folder full of information about BarCorp, including a connection to Jesus Christ Ministries,

03:25.120 --> 03:30.080
the $2 billion projected gross profits for next year, and the listings for the other

03:30.080 --> 03:36.480
three entities with the highest stake in BarCorp. Stacey Beans, Francis Beans, and The Mill

03:36.480 --> 03:42.360
on the other side of the city, and then she burned John Lee Pettymore and dipped. Our

03:42.360 --> 03:48.880
terrible protagonist went to the downtown brownstone of Bruce Robin, a once respectable

03:48.880 --> 04:03.820
home and current shithole. The number 811-818-9520-1311-811 fuck. I feel like a piece of chicken that

04:03.820 --> 04:11.600
wasn't properly tenderized, brined, and marinated, and no one wants to eat me, not even the dog.

04:11.600 --> 04:18.160
Wolf spit me out. I'm swept up, thrown in the trash. I am nothing. At the landfill,

04:18.160 --> 04:23.520
I land on a plastic bag named Phil. She's sweet, but I can't provide nutrients to a

04:23.520 --> 04:32.440
fucking piece of plastic. Can I, Phyllis Theodora Festerbone III? Fucking no, I cannot. But

04:32.440 --> 04:37.840
what I can do is drop the beat that makes you bleat. It's kudzu with no backbone.

04:48.160 --> 05:13.160
Oh man. Another week. Another doll hair? You're not gonna trick me with that again. Oh my

05:13.160 --> 05:19.880
gosh, guys. Wait, if this is episode 56, I think it's our year anniversary. Really? Or maybe last

05:19.880 --> 05:26.320
week was. So the date that we released the first three... December 2nd, I believe. So I looked it

05:26.320 --> 05:33.440
up. My podcast app says November 18th. Yes, so the first episode got released because I submitted it

05:33.440 --> 05:38.560
to iTunes for approval, and then they just uploaded it as soon as they got approved. So then we did

05:38.800 --> 05:43.720
our official launch later. Okay, I'm glad that you said that because it was incongruous in my brain

05:43.720 --> 05:49.680
that I was sure that we had our launch in December. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense now. Yeah, yeah. I was

05:49.680 --> 05:54.080
actually thinking about this. Do you want to put out a special one-year episode where we just party

05:54.080 --> 05:59.960
on Mike? Mike party. Mike party. Who's Mike party? You are now. I know that guy. What was Mike party

05:59.960 --> 06:07.520
sound like, Joe? He's Mike party! Mike party here. Hope you're all having a good time. I brought

06:07.560 --> 06:15.680
cocaine. So you guys are making your way to Bar Corp, and you're driving through the city,

06:15.680 --> 06:21.800
which again, just this like sickly thickness hanging in the air, and you see these flowers

06:21.800 --> 06:26.440
everywhere. I want to touch it. Oh, you touch the sickness? Actually, you put your hand outside the

06:26.440 --> 06:30.880
window and you feel like physical resistance when you put it out, but it's probably just the wind.

06:30.880 --> 06:39.360
Physics roll, please. None of you have a science, I would assume. You don't strike me as characters

06:39.360 --> 06:45.920
who would be good at science. I have a 0% in it. Same. I bet John Lee Pettymore would have been

06:45.920 --> 06:51.400
good at science, but he definitely can't roll for it. Well, he was like, there was one teacher who

06:51.400 --> 06:56.320
tried to reach out to him in like ninth grade. Biology, man. Yeah. He said, I just want to

06:56.320 --> 07:00.960
reach cars. Mr. Yeah. Mr. Hawkins just couldn't get through. John, at this point in your life,

07:00.960 --> 07:06.200
you're going to go in one of two different directions. You can't just keep turning left

07:06.200 --> 07:10.960
all the time. I was thinking more of like a robot voice since you said Hawkins. John,

07:10.960 --> 07:18.360
like there's two paths that you can take at this point. I'm such an idiot. And nevermind.

07:18.360 --> 07:27.680
I don't get it. You can't just turn left your whole life. You are an idiot. Jesus. Yeah. Luke

07:27.680 --> 07:33.320
Hawkins is the town from Stranger Things. I was trying to go there. I was like, I can't think of

07:33.320 --> 07:41.760
a Stranger Things. I love you. You're the person who thinks his name is Stephen Hawkins. I realized

07:41.760 --> 07:47.600
as soon as I've said it twice that I've got no response from the room. I was like, fuck,

07:47.600 --> 07:56.960
I am stupid. Hawkins. Hawkins. Hawkins. Don't you guys get my joke? Hawkins. Oh my God. Hear every

07:56.960 --> 08:05.600
dumb ass I went to high school with. I'm method acting Keith. Maybe too much. Yeah, you've been

08:05.600 --> 08:18.480
doing that your whole life. Can Keith Vigna do a pull up? Sure. Yeah. No. Keith Vigna. My

08:18.480 --> 08:25.840
strength's 55. Oh shit. That's not great. That's below average. That's above average. Yeah. It's

08:25.840 --> 08:35.200
five above average. I stand by it. So you guys are going to Bar Corp and the city is gross and

08:35.360 --> 08:40.560
there's flowers and Luke's an idiot. Yep. And there's a thickness in the air. And I love him.

08:40.560 --> 08:46.560
I love you. I love you too. So is this going to be the tallest building in the city? No, but it is

08:46.560 --> 08:53.520
17 stories high from what you can tell. As you pull up, you see the whole front is just covered

08:53.520 --> 09:00.000
in glass all the way from the bottom to the top. It's beautiful. And you can see as you're walking

09:00.000 --> 09:08.080
in, there are marble columns and the entry, the foyer that you see after you pass through the fun

09:08.080 --> 09:14.960
circular turnstile at the bottom leading into a large lobby. It's so fun. I'll go through it

09:14.960 --> 09:22.720
twice. Clark Bishop wearing an old seventies or eighties contention PD uniform goes through the

09:22.720 --> 09:29.760
turnstile twice. Keith Wigner looks down at himself. I just realized, yeah, I do not look

09:29.760 --> 09:35.360
like a cop, right? Yeah. We did want to roll into here looking like cops. Can we go to a thrift

09:35.360 --> 09:41.200
store? I guess and get some blue windbreakers. Okay. We spray paint the FBI on the backs.

09:42.880 --> 09:49.360
Let's cut to that montage right now. Oh, that's fun. Oh, they're having fun.

09:50.320 --> 09:56.960
I put on a sparkly boa and I'm like, everyone's got their arms crossed and they shake their head.

09:56.960 --> 10:04.080
No, you come back with a tiara and they're all like two thumbs up. So what are you guys wearing?

10:04.080 --> 10:08.880
A blue windbreaker. You know how, when you go to a thrift store, sometimes you'll just find like

10:08.880 --> 10:14.000
seven of the same like shitty company. It can be a windbreaker. It can be a t-shirt or whatever.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.520
They all have that like gray cottony cloth on the inside. Yeah. Okay. So we found three blue

10:19.520 --> 10:24.960
ones of those that are just blank. Um, could have been for a sports team. Yeah. You, you find,

10:24.960 --> 10:30.400
yeah, you find them there. They're all, they all fit you well, pretty nondescript. So you can make

10:30.400 --> 10:35.360
them look however you would like to make them look. Then I also, I grabbed any cowboy hat I

10:35.360 --> 10:40.640
find there and throw it on. Nice. I grabbed one of those obviously fake police hat.

10:41.520 --> 10:49.040
It's from a Halloween costume. I put that on. It's got the plastic with no words on it.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.640
Yeah. That'll help. Yeah. I have that on and then I'd keep all my other clothes on. Yeah.

10:56.640 --> 11:01.040
I'm keeping my uniform on it and just putting the windbreaker over it. Okay. So Keith Vigna,

11:01.040 --> 11:07.360
describe what you're wearing. I think big like cargo shorts. I think they're teal, teal,

11:07.440 --> 11:13.360
big cargo shorts, a like bright orange polo. I believe that's correct. Sparey's boat shoes

11:13.360 --> 11:19.680
with a Halloween cop hat and a blue windbreaker. Maybe we should address your bottom layers too,

11:19.680 --> 11:26.080
Keith. It's December and it's gotten pretty cold. So you've got goose pimples all over your shins,

11:26.080 --> 11:33.440
baby. Uh, looking around, I find goose pimples, like a Carhartt one piece long sleeve that is

11:33.440 --> 11:37.440
connected to the pants too. You know what I'm talking about? I put that on. Overalls?

11:38.240 --> 11:45.040
Well, coveralls. Yeah. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. They cover your overalls. The full thing. I put those

11:45.040 --> 11:49.920
on and some boots. Okay. With a blue windbreaker and are you keeping the hat? I'm keeping the hat

11:49.920 --> 11:54.240
and then I just ditch the clothes that I came in. So you're just, you're just free and easy

11:54.240 --> 11:59.600
underneath. Free and easy under my coveralls. You put the clothes that you were wearing onto the

11:59.600 --> 12:06.640
rack. That's how you think this works. This is a take a penny, leave a penny store, right?

12:06.640 --> 12:13.040
Exactly. Everything you bought was yellow tag and it just happens to be 50% off yellow tag day.

12:13.040 --> 12:19.920
Fucking love. Now to the 17th floor. Now immediately standing exactly where you were

12:19.920 --> 12:27.280
before, but wearing what you're wearing now, Clark, Keith, Pettymore, you guys show up to

12:27.280 --> 12:32.400
the headquarters of Bar Corp. Is there anyone in the lobby? There is no one in the lobby except for

12:33.040 --> 12:40.960
a security guard and a secretary sitting at a large marble desk on the far end from you.

12:40.960 --> 12:49.760
And behind them, there's an extremely large mural painted on the wall. And it is the painting of

12:49.760 --> 12:57.040
George Washington crossing the Delaware, except for replacing all the guns are flowers.

12:57.600 --> 13:01.840
Was there signage on this building as we walked in? Do they advertise that they are headquartered

13:01.840 --> 13:07.680
here? No. Is there a directory like by an elevator or something? 17th floor. I mean,

13:07.680 --> 13:12.800
just to see if this is only Bar Corp or if there's other stuff in this building. There is a directory

13:12.800 --> 13:18.560
and you would see that the floors are separated into different departments within Bar Corp,

13:18.560 --> 13:25.200
but they are all under the umbrella. Is there a Jesus Christ Ministries part here? There is.

13:25.200 --> 13:30.480
What else was under in that envelope that we'd found? It was Jesus Christ Ministries

13:30.480 --> 13:36.560
Health and Rehabilitation Unlimited and the Learning Center. Can I, I don't know if it's

13:36.560 --> 13:41.360
a role or just a knowledge that Clark would have, but reading the directory, are there any

13:41.360 --> 13:47.040
businesses or institutions that spring out as that's a contention thing that we know for sure

13:47.040 --> 13:50.880
contention has one of this company? Well, this is where the clinker's corporate headquarters are.

13:53.600 --> 13:59.200
No, you would not recognize any of these names from your small town of contention. And what is

13:59.200 --> 14:03.760
the 17th floor? What is it described as? It's actually not on the directory. Does it stop at

14:03.760 --> 14:08.720
16 or does it stop even before that? It stops at 12. Is the elevator somewhere we can just go

14:08.720 --> 14:13.920
up to it? Yeah. I want to, I want to flash my badge at the security guard. We've got an

14:13.920 --> 14:20.400
appointment with Winifred Worth. We're on our way up. Role persuade or law or bureaucracy?

14:23.520 --> 14:32.080
Uh, 47 on a 60 for persuade. The silent security guard motions that that is okay and the secretary

14:32.080 --> 14:37.440
sitting nearby is too busy looking at the computer screen to even pay attention. Does she have a

14:37.440 --> 14:44.320
name tag? A place? The doctor is actually a man. The what? Oh, the doctor is actually a man.

14:44.320 --> 15:02.960
Does this, uh, that doesn't make any sense. The secretary was his dad. Oh, that was really dumb.

15:02.960 --> 15:08.640
Do they have a placard? She has a placard. Yeah. What's her, what's her name? Uh, it's not

15:08.640 --> 15:13.520
Winifred. It's kind of what I was saying. Oh no. It's a ginger Evans. Cool. That's a pretty hot

15:13.520 --> 15:19.600
name. Uh, is there a button for the 17th floor in the elevator? When you go into the elevator,

15:19.600 --> 15:26.960
you see that there are buttons for one through 12. Uh, you guys just want to go to 12 and I assume

15:26.960 --> 15:31.200
take some stairs up then or we could ask that security. Yeah. I guess I just want to be like,

15:31.200 --> 15:34.880
Hey buddy, we're supposed to be on the 17th floor. This only goes up to 12.

15:34.880 --> 15:40.320
He points to the, it's a different elevator. Grazie. And I've been learning Italian.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.280
Did that come with the Kevin body? Did it?

15:45.360 --> 15:48.080
You know, no, I mean, John Lee Pettymore has mysteries that

15:49.840 --> 15:57.200
is a rich inner life. As you go into the elevator that he points you to, as the door closes,

15:57.200 --> 16:02.000
you hear, uh, as he gets on a little, uh, walkie talkie. Do we hear what he says?

16:02.000 --> 16:08.800
He initiated it. Yeah. Gotcha. And, uh, this elevator has 14 through 17 listed.

16:08.800 --> 16:16.720
17, 17. They already clicked the button Clark. I mean, you still have time as it goes up.

16:18.720 --> 16:22.640
Is there any advantage to maybe not going straight to the top,

16:22.640 --> 16:29.120
maybe walking at the 16th and then we could definitely, uh, we could go through all 16

16:29.120 --> 16:33.200
other floors first. Really make sure we've done a search role for everything. You guys are going

16:33.200 --> 16:39.120
to have to kill so many people. You've got that prepared, right? You've got, you've got all,

16:39.120 --> 16:44.800
all 16 floors just started out. Oh yeah. I make stats for everybody.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.680
You better have some fucking stats for Winifred worth.

16:52.640 --> 17:00.320
She's about to get in some combat. Do you want to try to go up the stairs to the last one or

17:00.320 --> 17:04.480
just come right out? I just thought it out there. It's a part of the, maybe an element of surprise

17:04.480 --> 17:08.880
is they don't see the elevator doors open with us in it. Yeah. I mean, but our, since we're dressed

17:08.880 --> 17:14.640
up, since we are cops and also dressed up as far as, yeah, we're above board for now. Oh guys,

17:14.640 --> 17:22.080
we just reached the 17th floor and the door opens and standing directly in front of the elevator

17:22.080 --> 17:34.080
doors mows you down is a woman. She is small in stature. She has shock white hair. She is wearing

17:34.080 --> 17:44.000
a very dope outfit. Her blouse is white satin and the left half is black striped vertically.

17:44.720 --> 17:51.680
Her pants are the same material, high-waisted and one of her pant legs on the opposite side.

17:51.920 --> 17:56.000
The right side is stripped. It's striped backwards. So yeah, they're catty corner.

17:56.000 --> 18:06.160
And then she is wearing white platform shoes that have studs all around the sole and on her hands,

18:06.160 --> 18:13.520
which she has folded neatly together. She has silver rings and it seems to actually just be one

18:13.520 --> 18:19.280
big ring that wraps in and out of her fingers. Would you say that she would brass knuckles

18:19.280 --> 18:24.240
almost like brass knuckles? Would she be trying to procure 101 Dalmatians?

18:29.680 --> 18:33.360
I expected you. Can I get a sense of age? She is either

18:34.320 --> 18:40.560
58 or a really, really good 72 type or somewhere in between.

18:40.560 --> 18:47.440
Gotcha. There's no fucking way she's 73, Joe. She couldn't be the way she looks.

18:47.440 --> 18:52.480
How old are you Winifred? That's exactly not the

18:52.480 --> 18:58.160
question that I expected to come out of your mouth first, but I am 71.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.840
Damn, you was right. That's about what I figured.

19:02.480 --> 19:07.520
How long have you been working for Mr. Beans? I'm sorry. What is your business here?

19:07.520 --> 19:12.720
Well, ma'am, I think it's pretty obvious from our very official windbreakers that we're the police.

19:12.720 --> 19:19.280
Yes, from contention. Yeah, our buddy here has a, you know, he wants to commiserate.

19:19.280 --> 19:23.520
Beans, sorry for you, I suppose. That's what you'd like to be known as these days.

19:23.520 --> 19:29.200
I don't know what you're talking about. Rolled disguise.

19:32.480 --> 19:41.040
Damn, 32 on a 30. I can see right through whatever she looks at you.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.600
This is... And Clark Bishop.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.320
Ma'am. And then she looks back at Keith.

19:46.320 --> 19:50.560
So, do you have the list of questions for me? You don't know who I am?

19:50.560 --> 19:55.120
I assume you're someone. Is that correct? More or less.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.120
You don't know him, but you know me. How do you know my name?

19:59.120 --> 20:03.520
The internet? Vast. So much knowledge. Just at your fingertips.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.520
What'd you do? Google Keith's friends? Yep.

20:06.160 --> 20:11.680
I want to Google that in my smartphone real quick and see what's coming up.

20:11.680 --> 20:18.160
It's a picture of Clark Bishop and it says, John Lee Pettymore is no longer my best friend.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.040
Friendship with John Lee Pettymore ended. Vigga is my new friend.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.600
Yes, I don't know all the memes, but I got your name from that.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.560
You like that Baby Yoda meme? I'm unaware.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.240
He's a little cute rascal.

20:36.240 --> 20:41.120
Well, we're just going to go ahead and go on in there and talk to Bruce.

20:41.120 --> 20:45.200
Well, first off, if you'd like to hand me the questions that you have prepared.

20:45.200 --> 20:45.840
Top secret.

20:47.360 --> 20:51.280
Police business, ma'am. This isn't a friendly call. It's a work call.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.480
While they're talking, I want to look around this floor we're on and see,

20:55.520 --> 20:57.760
are we the only ones here with her? Yes.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.920
Yeah. It's not like a busy office.

20:59.920 --> 21:10.320
This has a long hallway and the floor is marble and the walls are lined with similar murals

21:10.320 --> 21:14.800
as the one that you saw upon your entry. They are Renaissance America.

21:14.800 --> 21:19.120
Wait, what is that time period called in America? The early.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.920
The Renaissance? I like just said a word.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.720
Revolutionary. There wasn't an America.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.520
He's asking what you call that type of art that Crossing the Delaware is, which I don't know.

21:29.520 --> 21:30.000
Boring.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.680
That word. Colonial? Is it colonial art?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.560
Thomas doesn't know, but he knows it's not that.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.520
There's a lot of different American painting schools.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.120
Sure. It's one of them.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.920
Are they all flowered?

21:51.920 --> 21:52.240
Yes.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.960
So we can't come up with the name of that time period, but they're all that time period?

21:56.960 --> 21:57.520
Yes.

21:57.520 --> 22:04.800
I want to gesture to her almost conspiratorially and nod to take her off to the side.

22:05.840 --> 22:11.760
Listen, ma'am, he's just absolutely torn up to hell about his brother and he thinks that

22:13.040 --> 22:16.080
Mr. Robin's the only person in the world who might understand.

22:17.120 --> 22:21.040
Can you see it in your heart to let him ask these questions personally?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.720
And I'd like to try to persuade her.

22:22.720 --> 22:27.360
Yeah. I'm going to have you roll against her instead of at a disadvantage.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.240
Fuck.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.160
She passed with a 26.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.360
I passed, but with an eight.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.680
Which would have been great if this wasn't contested.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.040
She whispers up into your ear.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.440
That's very well and good, sir.

22:42.240 --> 22:50.560
However, you don't have any jurisdiction here and I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

22:50.560 --> 22:54.400
So now I want to push her to the ground and run right past her.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.520
Oh shit.

22:55.520 --> 22:55.920
Okay.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.840
Roll unarmed combat for me.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.720
Fuck. Is this contested?

23:02.720 --> 23:04.400
Yep. She passed with a 17.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.320
Oh, that's what he got.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.600
I rolled a 17.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.280
Ty goes to the pusher.

23:09.280 --> 23:13.280
Yay!

23:13.680 --> 23:16.080
I was so fucking bummed when I rolled that.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.280
I was like, damn it.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.600
Did you fucking really roll 17?

23:21.600 --> 23:21.920
Yeah.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.040
Hell yeah, dude.

23:23.040 --> 23:23.760
Why would you lie?

23:28.320 --> 23:30.080
Oh yeah. None of us do that.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.400
I don't hide my rolls from you guys.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.080
I just sit far enough away.

23:35.920 --> 23:39.920
So describe what you push with.

23:41.760 --> 23:46.720
I, I give her a look like, I am so sorry, ma'am.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.560
And then I just like fucking suplex her to the ground.

23:52.000 --> 23:52.560
Run.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.560
And I, I see this happen and I run towards where I think the office is.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.760
It's just the door at the end of the hallway.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.720
Big double doors.

24:00.720 --> 24:08.000
As they take off running, I look down at her and I kind of do a half-hearted shrug and follow.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.760
Thomas, if you could roll a D6 for damage.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.920
It's the only time I'm going to lie about a roll and say, I got a one, I got a four.

24:23.040 --> 24:26.640
As he hears like something crack, he's like, I'm so sorry.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.880
We're really hoping she looked bad for 50.

24:29.440 --> 24:34.240
You put her down right on her hip and just hear like a snap crunch.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.360
Basically, this got really sad.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.080
The good news is she ain't getting up.

24:47.120 --> 24:51.520
Well, maybe you should have let a grieving man talk to the only person in the world who

24:51.520 --> 24:52.480
would understand.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.000
I am truly sorry though.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.360
And I run off after him.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.360
I don't think you're truly sorry.

24:57.360 --> 25:02.400
I think you're white claw sorry because you're adhering to no laws.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.360
I'm spend drift tired of your shit.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.240
I'm sorry.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.200
Sorry about that, ma'am.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.840
And we'll get an ambulance on its way, but we got to do it.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.080
And I just keep walking by.

25:14.080 --> 25:14.480
Okay.

25:14.480 --> 25:18.240
She pulls out her phone and dials 911.

25:18.240 --> 25:22.080
I kicked that out of her hands and I'm like, I'm so sorry, ma'am.

25:22.880 --> 25:26.560
I'm going to do the dialing because I don't think you're just going to call the hospital.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.240
I think you're going to call the police on us.

25:28.240 --> 25:28.640
Okay.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.600
And I show her that like, I'm calling 911 too.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.400
And I'm like, you know what?

25:32.400 --> 25:37.280
You can tell them anything you want once they get here, but we need a few minutes with Mr.

25:37.280 --> 25:37.680
Robin.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.440
911, what's your emergency?

25:39.440 --> 25:40.960
Oh my God.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.120
My mother just fell on the 17th floor of the bar court building.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.160
Bar court building.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.280
She broke her damn hip.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.880
You need to get here fast or, you know, take your time.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.080
She's a tough old bean.

25:52.080 --> 25:56.320
Sir, if you could stay on the line for me, what's the address of the bar court building?

25:56.320 --> 25:59.200
Oh, it's a 501 East fake street.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.800
And what is your name, sir?

26:02.080 --> 26:03.280
Keith Vigna.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.200
And what is your mother's name, sir?

26:06.320 --> 26:07.440
Winifred Worth.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.760
Sir, we have people on their way right now.

26:09.760 --> 26:15.920
If you could stay on the line with me, I'd like to ask you a couple more questions.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.360
You just say beep into the phone.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.800
I say beep and hang up.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.160
Sir, you're still...

26:22.560 --> 26:24.400
Sir, I heard you say beep.

26:24.400 --> 26:24.720
Okay.

26:24.720 --> 26:31.680
So you make your way to the end of the hall and I need whoever has the highest alertness

26:31.680 --> 26:32.960
to roll alertness.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.000
I've got 60.

26:34.000 --> 26:34.960
Got a 70.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.960
Clark Bishop rolling alertness.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.240
Gonna get some dice with numbers on them.

26:42.320 --> 26:48.640
You turn around to see Winifred pull out another cell phone from her other pocket.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.480
Winnie.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.520
Winnie now.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.080
Darling.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.840
Also, I told you, you need to stand up, Winnie.

26:59.920 --> 27:05.280
Well, we'll talk to her for one sentence and then we'll just push her on the ground.

27:05.920 --> 27:06.960
Well, you made us do it.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.600
I didn't feel like that.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.320
You wanted it.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.080
You set this whole situation up.

27:14.080 --> 27:14.080


27:14.080 --> 27:15.120
I'm so sorry.

27:15.120 --> 27:20.160
I don't know why you would push a nice old lady who's just trying to do her job.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.680
Ma'am, frankly, I'm real sorry about your hip.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.080
I am.

27:24.080 --> 27:28.880
But there's some extra worldly shit going on and your boss might be involved in it.

27:28.880 --> 27:32.960
And we're just trying to literally save the fucking earth starting with our town in this

27:32.960 --> 27:33.360
city.

27:33.360 --> 27:37.680
So I mean, I'm sure you've got great medical through Bar Corps.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.600
You're the fucking CEOs.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.280
There are three men here and they have pushed me to the ground.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.160
I kick it out of her.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.360
No, no, no, Winnie.

27:48.080 --> 27:48.480
Damn it.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.200
Can we be friends here?

27:51.200 --> 27:52.560
After all this?

27:52.560 --> 27:53.680
Let's start again.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.000
Yeah, fuck Winnifred.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.040
I'm at the double doors and I'm like, guys, get the fuck over here.

27:59.040 --> 27:59.680
Come on.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.360
The doors are locked.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.200
I have lock picking.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.960
Oh, that might be useful.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.160
I'd also like to search.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.240
I got a 45 on a 50.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.680
Winnifred for the keys.

28:09.680 --> 28:10.720
Does she have a desk?

28:10.720 --> 28:12.320
No, there's no desk in this hallway.

28:12.320 --> 28:12.640
Okay.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.280
I'm looking at her, like her eyeballs and her fingerprints.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.560
And I'm like, what if she is the key?

28:19.200 --> 28:24.960
It's actually normally pubic hair that gets you into different locations, just right under

28:24.960 --> 28:25.520
the armpit.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.400
I picked the lock.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.040
Pick the lock.

28:27.040 --> 28:33.360
And Thomas John, Kevin Lee Pettymore hears the door open as you're going toward Winnifred

28:33.360 --> 28:35.600
to try to find the keys on her.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.520
I'd still like to do a search rule on her.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.240
I want to frisk her for any other cell phones.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.680
Okay, go ahead and roll search.

28:43.120 --> 28:43.620
Fail.

28:44.000 --> 28:44.320
Okay.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.920
You don't find her third cell phone.

28:47.920 --> 28:48.800
Wily old bat.

28:48.800 --> 28:54.720
You open one of these double doors into a large office in a state of slight chaos.

28:54.720 --> 28:59.920
To your right, there's a wall entirely comprised of a single large bookcase that seems to have

28:59.920 --> 29:04.880
been recently fingered through books at a time, some of which have been left scattered

29:04.880 --> 29:07.280
about the reading area haphazardly.

29:07.280 --> 29:14.320
To your left, a conference table with eight chairs is completely overrun with file folders,

29:14.320 --> 29:16.400
large binders, and loose papers.

29:17.040 --> 29:24.080
Ahead of you is a large desk in a similar condition and five deep button high back to

29:24.080 --> 29:32.400
leather chairs that sit in a half circle facing the desk and the panicked, pacing man behind

29:32.400 --> 29:37.680
it, jerkily moving back and forth in front of the large window that makes up the back

29:37.680 --> 29:44.400
wall of this office, giving you all a bird's eye view of the city somehow both lackluster

29:44.400 --> 29:45.520
and rancid.

29:46.080 --> 29:49.200
Bruce Robin is muttering to himself.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.120
He's wearing a black nothing.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.080
A black nothing.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.600
He's wearing black pants.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.320
How do they fit?

30:00.320 --> 30:01.120
Just right.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.080
Well tailored.

30:02.080 --> 30:02.960
These pants.

30:03.520 --> 30:12.480
And a white shirt, no tie, top button unbuttoned, and a crushed red velvet like burgundy smoking

30:12.480 --> 30:13.040
jacket.

30:13.040 --> 30:20.320
And his hair is all askew just like mop style all over his head and it doesn't suit his

30:20.320 --> 30:22.320
face or the way that he is dressed.

30:22.960 --> 30:26.400
I need you all to roll alertness, all three of you.

30:28.000 --> 30:28.720
Fail.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.220
Fail.

30:30.960 --> 30:31.460
Pass.

30:31.940 --> 30:33.220
62 on a 70.

30:33.220 --> 30:36.820
You can hear him very faintly under his breath.

30:37.780 --> 30:41.860
Hey, hey, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:41.860 --> 30:49.460
8-1-1-8-1-8-9-5-2-0-1-3-1-1-8-1-1-1-9.

30:49.460 --> 30:51.780
Yeah, yeah, Bruce likey, yeah.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.340
Mr. Robin?

30:54.340 --> 30:54.900
Yeah.

30:54.900 --> 31:00.500
And he turns and he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, what are you guys, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

31:00.500 --> 31:01.300
what are you guys doing?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.380
Hey, what are you guys doing up here?

31:03.380 --> 31:05.300
Well, we came to talk to you, sir.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.220
What were those numbers you were just muttering?

31:07.220 --> 31:07.860
I heard that.

31:07.860 --> 31:09.300
What were those?

31:09.300 --> 31:10.020
Roll human.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.900
That's a fail.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.100
Can we all roll?

31:16.100 --> 31:16.420
Yeah.

31:16.420 --> 31:16.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:18.020 --> 31:18.660
Fail.

31:18.660 --> 31:19.160
I pass.

31:19.860 --> 31:20.980
47 on 80.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.180
You got 80, human?

31:22.180 --> 31:22.580
Yeah.

31:22.580 --> 31:23.460
Fuck yeah, dude.

31:25.460 --> 31:25.940
Numbers.

31:27.060 --> 31:27.780
I know.

31:27.780 --> 31:30.900
8-1-1-8, you know, you just said it.

31:31.460 --> 31:32.900
No, no numbers for me.

31:32.900 --> 31:37.060
8-1-1-8-1-8-1-9-5-2-0-1-3-1-1-8-1-1-1-9.

31:38.660 --> 31:39.140
Yeah.

31:39.140 --> 31:41.940
No, Bruce no likey, Bruce no likey.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.700
Well, you just said Bruce did likey.

31:44.420 --> 31:44.980
No.

31:44.980 --> 31:45.700
Come on, come on.

31:45.700 --> 31:49.940
Hey, guys, come on, come on over here and sit down, sit down in these chairs right here.

31:49.940 --> 31:53.220
Yeah, come on, Bruce likey if you sit down here.

31:53.220 --> 31:55.540
I'm actually very comfortable standing, sir.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.220
Yeah, Clark doesn't take a seat either.

31:57.220 --> 32:05.460
He immediately walks over and there is a glass on his desk, like a rocks glass,

32:05.460 --> 32:10.260
and he picks it up and he holds it in his hand with like white knuckles and he walks

32:10.260 --> 32:16.340
toward you guys and he's like, I think maybe you should just probably just sit in the seats,

32:16.340 --> 32:16.660
right?

32:16.660 --> 32:18.740
Yeah, yeah, we can talk, yeah.

32:18.740 --> 32:20.420
Clark puts his hand on his gun.

32:20.420 --> 32:24.340
No, no, no, no, no, no, there's no need for any of that business here.

32:24.340 --> 32:27.780
Then you can put that glass down and step back behind the desk there.

32:27.780 --> 32:30.180
All right, well, come on down, come on down.

32:30.180 --> 32:36.180
And he walks over to his desk and he kind of slides across the top of it to go sit on

32:36.180 --> 32:36.980
the other side.

32:36.980 --> 32:37.540
Cool.

32:37.540 --> 32:44.500
I'll walk over directly facing him.

32:44.500 --> 32:52.820
So he just like a fat kid getting out of a pool, just like sets his belly down on the

32:52.820 --> 32:59.540
desk and then like slowly tips over and then pops up and rotates around to the side.

33:00.820 --> 33:03.700
Although Keith goes and sits at the chair.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.500
Yeah, yeah, Bruce Leicke, yeah, do that.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.820
I'll stand near a chair, but I'm not going to sit in it.

33:08.820 --> 33:13.060
I'm going to stand behind the chair that Keith's in, kind of with my like hand on the,

33:13.060 --> 33:15.380
not on my shoulders, but like on the top of the chair.

33:15.380 --> 33:17.540
Hand shoes and horse grenades, I'll take it.

33:17.540 --> 33:19.220
Yeah, yeah, all right, well.

33:20.180 --> 33:24.180
Can I do a check that we're not standing on like a trap door?

33:24.180 --> 33:25.620
Oh, sure.

33:25.620 --> 33:27.540
Zach's like, ooh, there is a trap door.

33:29.060 --> 33:30.100
Roll dexterity.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.820
No, you can roll search, I guess.

33:32.820 --> 33:34.260
I was afraid you were going to say that and I don't have it.

33:34.260 --> 33:36.420
20% for you, sir.

33:36.420 --> 33:38.260
I fail, 97.

33:38.260 --> 33:42.820
You don't seem to be standing anywhere except for right next to a very comfy chair.

33:42.820 --> 33:43.140
Okay.

33:43.140 --> 33:44.180
Do you know who I am?

33:44.180 --> 33:45.300
He just stares at you.

33:45.300 --> 33:46.740
You can answer his question, Bruce.

33:49.220 --> 34:02.980
You're not, you're not with, and you notice as he's just like pondering your question,

34:03.620 --> 34:08.820
blood on his knuckles, like from a cut or scrape or something, or from punching.

34:08.820 --> 34:10.260
And which one?

34:10.260 --> 34:11.060
Oh, you don't know.

34:11.060 --> 34:14.900
I mean, it would be just kind of red and cut up.

34:14.900 --> 34:21.540
He's also wearing a silver ring with a blank, flat top on his middle finger on his left hand.

34:21.540 --> 34:23.140
Is that something we've seen before?

34:23.140 --> 34:29.220
Yeah, I, I, I, I, I nod, I motion with my head and eyes at Keith and John at the ring.

34:30.260 --> 34:31.940
It looks like one of those rings I found.

34:31.940 --> 34:34.660
Is that one of the rings that we found at?

34:34.660 --> 34:35.460
Jim Cook's house.

34:35.460 --> 34:35.860
Okay.

34:35.860 --> 34:36.900
And when you rubbed it.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.180
Light came out of it or something?

34:38.180 --> 34:39.620
Or when you put it on, I think.

34:39.620 --> 34:40.580
Oh, the M.

34:40.580 --> 34:43.540
It was the M made out of four double helices.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.660
Double helix, yeah.

34:45.540 --> 34:49.300
You were at Jim Cook's house when I got pushed through the wall.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.020
Yeah, it was in there.

34:50.020 --> 34:51.620
It was in the kitchen or in the kitchen.

34:51.620 --> 34:51.940
Yeah.

34:51.940 --> 34:56.020
Well, I mean, I found it in the bathroom, but then I laid it on the counter when I left.

34:56.020 --> 34:57.700
And then we came back and looked at it.

34:57.700 --> 34:58.200
Yeah, I did.

34:58.740 --> 35:02.260
Wait, I have that around my neck on a chain.

35:02.260 --> 35:02.820
You do.

35:02.820 --> 35:04.500
Yeah, you do.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.540
Show him the goddamn ring.

35:07.540 --> 35:12.500
Yeah, I, I take it off like the necklace part and I just kind of show it to him,

35:12.500 --> 35:13.700
but I don't say anything.

35:13.700 --> 35:16.900
His eyes get massive.

35:16.900 --> 35:18.740
In an excited way or a scared way?

35:18.740 --> 35:19.460
Both.

35:19.460 --> 35:22.820
And he is very careful with his words.

35:22.820 --> 35:26.100
Are you, uh, are you with?

35:27.300 --> 35:27.940
I'm so sorry.

35:30.980 --> 35:31.620
Jon does that.

35:33.380 --> 35:33.780
He waves.

35:33.780 --> 35:34.900
He's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:38.580 --> 35:40.980
I was waving off Zach like, don't get too far into that.

35:44.340 --> 35:48.260
Marietta say yes.

35:48.260 --> 35:48.740
I nod.

35:49.300 --> 35:49.780
Okay.

35:51.220 --> 35:54.100
Well, if it's coming, let it happen.

35:56.420 --> 36:00.900
And he sits down in the chair behind the desk, kind of hangs his head.

36:00.900 --> 36:02.660
Marietta was that robot company.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.100
They made the androids.

36:04.100 --> 36:04.580
Yeah.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.020
We found a file in Jim.

36:06.660 --> 36:07.620
Do I do this in character?

36:07.620 --> 36:08.660
No, you out of character.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.660
We can just talk about what you guys know about Marietta.

36:10.660 --> 36:14.180
We found all those folders in Jim Cook's secret room in his house.

36:14.180 --> 36:19.220
And folder one was called operation stapler and it had the M helix.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.540
And we figured out that that meant myriad.

36:21.540 --> 36:26.580
And it had to do with the respecking androids to cut down on costs to sell to other companies.

36:26.580 --> 36:28.020
And that's when we also found.

36:28.020 --> 36:28.180
Yeah.

36:28.180 --> 36:31.220
We also saw the same M logo hole puncher.

36:31.220 --> 36:34.340
Well, yes, that's when we learned about hole puncher and some other things.

36:34.340 --> 36:39.300
But we also saw the myriad logo on the Android who attacked us outside of, uh,

36:39.300 --> 36:39.700
that's right.

36:39.700 --> 36:46.100
It was on the, on the crotch of the James, the mill workers house and I've got the ring

36:46.100 --> 36:48.020
that has that symbol on it as well.

36:48.020 --> 36:51.220
Did it glow or something when I put it on or when I like rubbed it?

36:51.220 --> 36:54.980
It was when you put it on because it didn't do anything for me when I found it originally,

36:54.980 --> 36:56.180
but I never put it on.

36:56.180 --> 36:56.820
Okay.

36:56.820 --> 36:59.220
So at this point, what I'm just holding it.

36:59.220 --> 37:00.100
Confirmed.

37:00.100 --> 37:03.300
And when you say yes, I slipped the ring on.

37:03.300 --> 37:12.980
With his head slumped down, tongue flitting back and forth across his top lip, Bruce

37:12.980 --> 37:20.260
Robin's eyes shift up to stare past you through a messy curtain of unwashed hair.

37:20.900 --> 37:23.700
And he begins chanting.

37:23.700 --> 37:33.220
Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn.

37:33.220 --> 37:35.540
I jump across the desk and punch him.

37:35.540 --> 37:35.940
Okay.

37:35.940 --> 37:41.060
So we are going to roll against each other dexterity.

37:41.060 --> 37:48.180
However, I'm going to give you a plus 40 for your pulp Cthulhu talent that you took to

37:48.180 --> 37:49.620
do combat first.

37:49.620 --> 37:50.260
Oh, gotcha.

37:50.260 --> 37:50.760
Cool.

37:54.260 --> 37:55.300
Well, okay.

37:55.300 --> 37:56.580
I succeed with a 50.

37:59.620 --> 38:01.460
I crit pass a 33.

38:01.460 --> 38:02.500
Yeah, baby.

38:03.460 --> 38:06.340
The crit trumps the low, the fact that I'm still lower, right?

38:06.340 --> 38:07.460
It absolutely does.

38:07.460 --> 38:08.260
Yes.

38:08.260 --> 38:12.820
I Superman leap across the desk, landing the punch in flight.

38:14.820 --> 38:18.180
I think that's going to probably tackle the chair over and we'll be playing on the ground,

38:18.180 --> 38:20.260
but I've knocked the fuck out of this dude's jaw.

38:20.260 --> 38:21.860
Roll unarmed combat.

38:24.660 --> 38:30.820
I pass a 47 on a 70.

38:30.820 --> 38:31.700
I failed.

38:31.700 --> 38:35.300
So roll a D six, a four.

38:35.300 --> 38:38.260
As you tackle him, the chair tips over backwards.

38:38.260 --> 38:38.580
Yes.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.580
A punch from Clark Bishop is the exact same.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.340
And you hear a snap as a sip.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.140
That's the exact same damage.

38:47.860 --> 38:51.460
As you tackle him to the floor, you actually see.

38:52.340 --> 38:53.220
Oh, hi.

38:54.180 --> 38:58.500
A pistol in his hand gets knocked just out of his reach.

38:58.500 --> 39:02.580
And he had grabbed it underneath his desk with his head down.

39:02.580 --> 39:05.860
Dude, I wanted to say, I was starting to haunt him.

39:05.860 --> 39:08.740
Han and Greedo like gun at the table, but I didn't.

39:08.740 --> 39:10.740
So I'm really glad you knocked that gun out of his hand.

39:13.780 --> 39:16.900
As soon as that happens, I want to shut his talk box.

39:16.900 --> 39:18.900
I want to jump over the desk as well.

39:18.900 --> 39:22.100
And what I want to do is I want to try to stomp on his hand

39:22.100 --> 39:24.420
and then pull the ring off of his hand as well.

39:25.060 --> 39:25.540
Okay.

39:25.540 --> 39:32.180
Uh, roll unarmed combat against him and I'll give him a negative 40 for being pinned.

39:32.180 --> 39:34.740
Essentially, I got a hundred.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.540
Oh shit.

39:35.540 --> 39:40.100
When you go to stomp on his hand, he grabs the bottom of your foot and he just pushes

39:40.100 --> 39:42.100
and you fall on your ass.

39:42.100 --> 39:42.820
Oh no.

39:42.820 --> 39:48.580
I want to grab anything I can, uh, a box of like tissues, maybe a tie that he took off.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.180
Anything I can see.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.260
And I want to just shove it in his mouth.

39:52.260 --> 39:54.020
You can grab the tie that he took off.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.380
It's on his desk.

39:55.380 --> 39:55.780
Okay.

39:55.780 --> 39:59.620
I want to, I want to try to just like throw that in his spell speaker.

40:05.060 --> 40:09.460
All right, so you're going to roll strength against him and I'll give him a negative.

40:10.660 --> 40:12.180
He passed with a 31.

40:12.180 --> 40:13.620
I failed 54 out of 50.

40:14.260 --> 40:14.580
Shit.

40:14.580 --> 40:15.620
How we are cool.

40:15.620 --> 40:19.700
And he keeps, he, he like keeps his teeth gritted together.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.980
So you can't make it through his big old chompies.

40:22.980 --> 40:24.660
Unclench your chompers.

40:24.660 --> 40:25.620
Can I punch him again?

40:27.220 --> 40:28.100
Uh, yes.

40:28.100 --> 40:31.060
And he will actually go now.

40:31.060 --> 40:34.660
So he's gonna make an attempt to get you off of him.

40:34.660 --> 40:35.140
Okay.

40:35.140 --> 40:38.660
Uh, so if you're going to punch him, he's going to roll on overcomded against you as well.

40:38.660 --> 40:39.460
Contested me and you.

40:39.460 --> 40:39.860
Yes, sir.

40:39.860 --> 40:40.360
Okay.

40:41.860 --> 40:44.980
But when you rear back to punch, he succeeds with a 51.

40:44.980 --> 40:45.620
I fail.

40:45.620 --> 40:47.940
So he simply gets you off.

40:51.220 --> 40:53.220
That's a wrap on pretending to be people.

40:53.220 --> 40:54.340
Thank you, Bruce.

40:58.740 --> 41:00.020
Buy a Clark a drink first.

41:00.900 --> 41:02.580
And he's gonna grab the gun.

41:02.580 --> 41:08.100
So he, this round is able to grab the gun again.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.140
He has it.

41:09.140 --> 41:11.540
So it is Clark Bishop's turn.

41:11.540 --> 41:12.580
He has the gun?

41:12.580 --> 41:13.080
Yes.

41:13.940 --> 41:16.340
And he is continuing his chant.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.500
You can hear it right now in the background.

41:21.540 --> 41:22.500
Is he standing?

41:22.500 --> 41:23.620
No, he's still on the ground.

41:23.620 --> 41:25.460
I think I just want to punch him again.

41:25.460 --> 41:25.700
Yeah.

41:25.700 --> 41:29.140
Just a real quick synopsis of what this looks like currently.

41:29.140 --> 41:35.620
He's on his back on the back of the chair with his like head on the ground and his legs

41:35.620 --> 41:37.460
like up in the air.

41:37.460 --> 41:43.060
Keith is on his ass trying to recover from getting like brush hour two flipped on his

41:43.060 --> 41:50.580
back and John Lee Pettymore is like straddling him trying to get this tie in his mouth.

41:50.580 --> 41:51.220
Temporarily.

41:51.220 --> 41:55.140
He's just like got a tie full of saliva that he's like shaking off his hands.

41:57.300 --> 41:58.420
So you're going to go to punch him?

41:59.220 --> 42:00.260
Is he holding the gun?

42:00.260 --> 42:01.300
He is holding the gun.

42:01.300 --> 42:05.620
I think I would, I mean, whatever, whatever role you need for, I would be keeping my hand

42:05.620 --> 42:07.620
on his hand, keeping that gun away.

42:07.620 --> 42:07.860
Okay.

42:07.860 --> 42:10.980
So that'll be unarmed combat pin attempt.

42:14.580 --> 42:16.580
I pass a 10.

42:16.580 --> 42:19.940
I crit pass with an 11.

42:19.940 --> 42:20.180
Shoot.

42:20.180 --> 42:22.100
The gun merges into his hand.

42:23.780 --> 42:25.300
Man becomes one with machine.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.940
It's no longer possible to disarm him.

42:27.940 --> 42:28.580
Keith Europe.

42:28.580 --> 42:30.500
It is impossible to disarm him.

42:30.500 --> 42:31.460
Oh, no.

42:31.460 --> 42:35.860
No, he's got a real tight grip on the gun though.

42:35.860 --> 42:41.700
And he is like far more maneuverable at this juncture for this round because of that critical

42:41.700 --> 42:42.260
success.

42:42.260 --> 42:44.900
I get up, I pull my gun out and I shoot him in the stomach.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.260
Draw your gun, roll firearms.

42:47.460 --> 42:48.580
64 and a 70.

42:48.580 --> 42:51.220
Do you say anything terrible when you do this?

42:51.220 --> 42:53.540
No, I just kind of, I see the gut.

42:53.540 --> 42:54.260
I see the gun.

42:55.060 --> 42:58.980
I see the gun waving around and just, I don't want to see Clark get shot.

42:58.980 --> 43:01.700
I don't have the stomach for this kind of work.

43:01.700 --> 43:02.180
No, I don't.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.300
He says nothing cool.

43:03.300 --> 43:05.780
He just reacts immediately and pops one.

43:06.820 --> 43:07.940
Oh shit.

43:07.940 --> 43:12.020
Blood splatters out and gets all over John Lee Petty more.

43:13.700 --> 43:15.220
My new windbreaker.

43:15.220 --> 43:16.740
Whose turn it is currently.

43:19.780 --> 43:21.540
It was $2 and 50 cents.

43:22.740 --> 43:24.100
Half off yellow tech.

43:24.260 --> 43:29.380
Um, but 25, uh, it's new to you though.

43:29.380 --> 43:32.740
Would I have time to talk to him in between a combat round?

43:32.740 --> 43:32.980
Yeah.

43:32.980 --> 43:33.780
Are you going to stay down?

43:33.780 --> 43:34.500
Motherfucker.

43:34.500 --> 43:35.620
You can answer our questions.

43:38.020 --> 43:40.580
I want to just like smack him in the face with my pistol.

43:40.580 --> 43:41.300
The bottom again.

43:41.300 --> 43:41.540
Okay.

43:41.540 --> 43:44.100
I actually, I forgot to have Luke roll damage.

43:44.100 --> 43:46.580
So roll a D for damage.

43:46.580 --> 43:48.580
Unless you, did you grab at this point?

43:49.220 --> 43:52.820
Do I have my tiny gun or do I just have a service pistol?

43:52.820 --> 43:53.860
You have your tiny gun.

43:54.660 --> 43:56.340
Do I have a service pistol as well?

43:56.340 --> 43:56.820
Yes.

43:56.820 --> 43:58.820
I want to shoot him with just a regular pistol.

43:58.820 --> 44:00.180
Not the tiny powerful one.

44:00.180 --> 44:05.380
If I Clark got a handful of pistols from the circle of knowledge, so you guys would all

44:05.380 --> 44:05.860
have one.

44:05.860 --> 44:06.660
So I want to shoot him.

44:06.660 --> 44:08.580
There was just like seven sitting around that accord.

44:08.580 --> 44:08.900
Yeah.

44:08.900 --> 44:13.700
I want to, uh, I want to shoot him just laying in the backseat, sticking out of the gun box.

44:13.700 --> 44:14.420
You guys want a gun?

44:14.420 --> 44:14.900
I got some.

44:15.860 --> 44:23.540
So, uh, still a 10 for that or a little bouquet of a seven.

44:24.100 --> 44:24.500
Okay.

44:24.500 --> 44:25.620
So man.

44:25.620 --> 44:25.860
Okay.

44:28.660 --> 44:36.340
He passes a constitution check to stay with it and he is going to continue bleeding onto

44:36.340 --> 44:38.900
the floor pooling in this chair.

44:38.900 --> 44:44.820
It is one of those chairs that we like to describe on this show that has the buttons

44:44.820 --> 44:46.020
deep pushed in.

44:46.020 --> 44:51.380
So there's blood pooling like syrup in a waffle into the back of this chair.

44:51.380 --> 44:51.940
Nice.

44:51.940 --> 44:52.340
Thank you.

44:54.420 --> 44:57.940
Thomas, go ahead and roll a human.

44:57.940 --> 44:58.180
Okay.

45:00.020 --> 45:00.420
Ooh.

45:00.420 --> 45:00.900
Eight.

45:00.900 --> 45:03.380
He looks at you and he's like, yeah, yeah.

45:03.380 --> 45:05.380
Bruce no likey Bruce Bruce will stop.

45:05.940 --> 45:06.180
Yeah.

45:06.180 --> 45:07.620
Bruce no likey Bruce will stop.

45:11.140 --> 45:12.180
John no likey.

45:12.180 --> 45:13.860
When you do that, stop that.

45:13.860 --> 45:14.580
That's what I know.

45:14.580 --> 45:19.700
Like you want Keith to shoot at you again and your Getty, you know, like that rat.

45:19.700 --> 45:21.860
He continues chanting.

45:21.860 --> 45:23.460
I'm a little exasperated with him.

45:24.420 --> 45:26.500
Down the hallway and see what Winifred's doing.

45:26.500 --> 45:32.500
As you turn to look back down the hallway, your ear starts ringing because a gunshot

45:32.500 --> 45:33.540
just went off.

45:33.540 --> 45:40.260
And as soon as you turn around, you see Bruce Robin has pointed the gun to his own head

45:40.260 --> 45:44.420
and has committed suicide in front of Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna.

45:44.420 --> 45:47.140
I need you all to roll sanity except for Keith Vigna.

45:47.140 --> 45:48.180
Mission accomplished boys.

45:48.180 --> 45:51.460
Who does not have to roll sanity when humans die.

45:51.460 --> 45:52.340
That's correct.

45:53.140 --> 45:56.420
That's a great skill to take and tilt the green.

45:58.660 --> 45:59.140
Fuck.

45:59.140 --> 46:00.580
Crit fail 77.

46:00.580 --> 46:02.180
Uh, just a regular fail for me.

46:02.180 --> 46:08.660
Clark Bishop loses one sanity and John Lee Pettymore loses two sanity.

46:08.660 --> 46:09.540
I'm at 14.

46:13.860 --> 46:14.100
Fuck.

46:14.740 --> 46:19.940
He's just covered in this dude's like blood and he's kind of out of it for a second.

46:19.940 --> 46:22.580
Keith walks over and gets the ring off his finger.

46:22.580 --> 46:25.140
Keith, you get the ring off of his finger.

46:25.140 --> 46:33.860
And when you turn around, you see that John Lee Pettymore is writing on the desk in blood.

46:34.820 --> 46:40.820
Two, one, eight, two, one, three, five, one.

46:40.820 --> 46:44.580
Thomas looking up, you have no recollection of writing this.

46:44.580 --> 46:46.340
Do you stop him before he's done?

46:46.340 --> 46:46.980
Yeah, for sure.

46:47.540 --> 46:49.300
I mean, it's freaking me out that he's not responding.

46:49.300 --> 46:53.860
And then seeing those numbers and hearing those numbers from Bruce moments before it's

46:53.860 --> 46:55.380
all adding up to something bad.

46:55.380 --> 46:58.020
So Clark is putting a stop to that as quick as possible.

46:58.980 --> 47:01.540
John, what was, why were you writing those numbers?

47:02.340 --> 47:02.820
I'm sorry.

47:04.900 --> 47:05.460
I'm sorry.

47:06.420 --> 47:07.780
It's been a rough couple of days.

47:09.300 --> 47:12.100
Just having that guy's face blow up all over me like that.

47:16.580 --> 47:17.860
That shook me just a little bit.

47:18.580 --> 47:22.180
But Hey, uh, listen, Maggie sent us here to kill this.

47:22.180 --> 47:22.820
Fuck.

47:22.820 --> 47:23.940
He's dead.

47:23.940 --> 47:27.380
Let's strip him, search the office and a fucking report back.

47:27.380 --> 47:30.500
I guess Clark is kind of bewildered.

47:30.500 --> 47:31.380
Nodding one.

47:31.380 --> 47:33.540
Do those, do those numbers mean something to you, John?

47:33.540 --> 47:34.180
What numbers?

47:35.060 --> 47:35.380
Those.

47:35.380 --> 47:38.180
And I pointed what he had been writing on the desk.

47:38.180 --> 47:42.260
Those, those numbers that you were writing on the desk, does that mean something to you?

47:42.260 --> 47:43.700
I mean, that's the numbers he wrote.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.380
It must, I'm sorry.

47:45.380 --> 47:46.820
I can't, I'm a little shook up.

47:46.820 --> 47:49.060
I must've just been writing the last thing I remembered.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.460
Keith puts that ring on.

47:51.460 --> 47:53.700
So I've got two, two of them on.

47:53.700 --> 47:56.260
If I like touch them together, does anything happen?

47:56.260 --> 47:58.500
No, but they both have the little...

47:58.500 --> 47:59.860
Your dick gets a little smaller.

47:59.860 --> 48:01.380
Are they, are they exactly the same?

48:02.980 --> 48:04.180
They are the exact same.

48:04.180 --> 48:09.540
I'm going to string the second one onto that chain again and put it around my neck.

48:09.540 --> 48:15.300
And then all of a sudden the double doors to Bruce Robin's office swing open and the

48:15.300 --> 48:20.180
three of you realize you aren't standing in the same places.

48:20.180 --> 48:28.180
You were just standing and none of you are wearing clothes, but you are completely covered

48:28.180 --> 48:35.860
in warm blood and written in the same fresh blood from the lifeless body of Bruce Robin

48:35.860 --> 48:42.980
is a new set of numbers covering everything in the office, the floor, the walls, the window,

48:42.980 --> 48:46.980
everything over and over and over and over.

48:46.980 --> 48:57.620
It repeats two, one, eight, two, one, three, five, one, eight, one, five, two, nine, one,

48:57.620 --> 49:01.300
four, and you have no recollection.

49:01.300 --> 49:03.620
What the fuck?

49:31.300 --> 49:41.620
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

49:41.620 --> 49:45.380
How can you have enough?

49:45.380 --> 49:51.940
Drowning out all the noise.

49:51.940 --> 50:07.940
Cause nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows.
