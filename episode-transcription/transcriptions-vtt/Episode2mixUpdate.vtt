00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
Salutations, my babies. You are listening to 694.2 PTBP,

00:05.520 --> 00:11.760
Contingent's best and only radio show. Now, Wolf got a little bit of news for y'all today.

00:11.760 --> 00:16.240
Now, I heard through the grapevine that Officer Keith Vigna didn't get the chief a birthday

00:16.240 --> 00:21.280
present. Now, that's some cold shit. She did, however, receive a box with a single rose,

00:21.280 --> 00:28.080
a white hard hat, and a black silk bow tie before leaving town. And Julia Maxwell crashed her car

00:28.160 --> 00:32.960
driving drunk and was pronounced dead at the city hospital. Now, ain't that some shit for you?

00:32.960 --> 00:37.680
A body was found at the piston junkyard. The body has a brand on the back reading,

00:37.680 --> 00:43.440
This is a fool. That's some spooky stuff, y'all. That's just some spooky stuff.

00:43.440 --> 00:49.280
Now, we got a new jam for y'all today. It's Kudzu with No Backbone.

00:58.080 --> 01:22.080
Alright, Joe, if you wouldn't mind giving me a quick description of your character,

01:22.080 --> 01:27.600
Clark Bishop. Yeah, sure. Clark is a 17-year veteran on the force. He's in his late 30s,

01:27.600 --> 01:32.320
balding and letting himself go. He's a hard worker and does his best, but it's often not enough.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.160
He pretends to know what he's doing. Often he doesn't, though. He's gotten pretty good at

01:36.160 --> 01:42.240
faking it. Clark is from contention, and he knows the town pretty dang well. He's a lonely guy who

01:42.240 --> 01:45.120
gets home from work, heats up his TV dinner, and watches Wheel of Fortune.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.760
And then he goes to bed and dreams about being a noir-style detective.

01:49.760 --> 01:54.960
Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Okay, so you are going out to Carrie Page's home,

01:55.600 --> 01:58.720
where she is called in last night that her dog is missing.

01:58.720 --> 02:05.200
Councilwoman Carrie Pages. She is regarded highly in the community. You know of her,

02:05.200 --> 02:10.160
you probably don't know her very well. She's got a night to play. She's in the old neighborhood.

02:10.160 --> 02:15.600
It's where all these old houses are lined up. They've all been taken care of really well. These

02:15.600 --> 02:20.160
houses have been passed down from family to family. They're like rarely bought and sold

02:20.160 --> 02:23.440
in this neighborhood. What do you want to do when you arrive at her house?

02:23.440 --> 02:25.760
I'm gonna just walk on up and knock on the door.

02:25.760 --> 02:31.280
All right, cool. So she answers the door. She has a beehive bun, cat-eye glasses,

02:31.280 --> 02:33.680
and is wearing a bejeweled pantsuit.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.320
No shit.

02:34.320 --> 02:41.280
It is lightly bejeweled, but any bejeweling of a pantsuit is immediately noticeable.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.160
And she is kind of freaking out a little bit.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.080
Hello, thank you so much for coming.

02:48.080 --> 02:48.640
Miss Page.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.240
So my dog is missing. Tyler, you know Tyler? Have you seen Tyler?

02:52.240 --> 02:52.960
Tyler, do you have a...

02:53.920 --> 02:59.920
Here's a picture. Here's a picture of him. And she hands you a picture. He's an old black lab.

02:59.920 --> 03:05.600
Every morning he goes out and he typically just uses the restroom and comes right back inside

03:05.600 --> 03:10.800
before I feed him his breakfast, before I leave for the day. But today he did not come inside.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.040
And, you know, I saw some... There was something...

03:14.080 --> 03:17.920
Last night in the backyard, I thought I saw something moving, but,

03:17.920 --> 03:22.800
you know, there's this rash of homeless people. Are you doing anything about that?

03:22.800 --> 03:27.200
There seems to be more homeless in the community these days. And I just think...

03:27.200 --> 03:31.440
I'm very worried about Tyler. He's got a lot of meat on his bones.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.920
And if the homeless people are looking for something...

03:33.920 --> 03:35.840
But I'm not trying to say that homeless people...

03:35.840 --> 03:36.720
Oh, no, man.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.600
I'm not trying to say that homeless people eat dogs. But I am saying that

03:39.600 --> 03:43.840
perhaps he is a good-looking eating dog. He's a good dog to eat.

03:43.840 --> 03:50.640
I'm not... He is the kind of dog who would be... He's my... He's everything to me.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.640
Ma'am, has Tyler ever gotten out before?

03:52.640 --> 03:56.720
Tyler is a very good dog. He is always very patient with me.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.280
And he goes out the backyard and he comes right back in,

03:59.280 --> 04:01.200
because he loves his home and he loves his food.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.960
Has he ever gotten out of the backyard before?

04:02.960 --> 04:05.280
No. We have very tall fences.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.760
Have you put up pictures yourself already?

04:07.760 --> 04:10.880
No, that was this morning. Early this morning.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.920
And I have not seen him since about 5 a.m.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.880
It is 9 o'clock now and I'm late.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.920
And I would really appreciate you to find my dog.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.080
Would you mind if I took a look in your backyard?

04:22.080 --> 04:22.640
Go for it.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.920
I go in the backyard.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.760
You go into her backyard. It's a nice backyard.

04:25.760 --> 04:29.040
She's got a little back deck set up. She's got a little grill out there.

04:29.040 --> 04:32.800
Lawn chairs and such. Big grassy area for the dog.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.040
8-foot privacy fences all the way around.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.880
Do I see anything out of the ordinary? Just on first glance of the yard?

04:38.880 --> 04:39.360
No.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.440
And then I want to just do a perimeter around the fence and see if there's any holes on the bottoms.

04:43.440 --> 04:44.960
Go ahead and roll search for me.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.960
Fail. 63 on a 20.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.120
Okay. You see no holes in the fence. Nothing out of the ordinary as you're searching.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.520
She comes outside and she's like, have you found him?

04:55.520 --> 04:56.960
No, you're right. He's not here.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.440
I know.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.480
Do you ever take him for a ride or anything?

05:00.480 --> 05:05.840
He goes out to the vet every once in a while when he is in need of a veterinary's assistance.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.600
Do you ever take him for a walk?

05:07.600 --> 05:12.000
I have taken him for many walks, but I'm in the car is when we go to the vet.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.280
When you take him on walks.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.440
Sir, I am a good dog owner. I take my dog for walks all the time.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.880
I'm just trying to think of where that dog might have gone off to on its own.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.320
He would come back. I know him.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.960
But he hasn't yet, right?

05:24.960 --> 05:26.960
You have not found my dog. Is that correct?

05:26.960 --> 05:27.680
Correct.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.760
Okay. I would like you to find my dog.

05:29.760 --> 05:30.720
I'm working on it, ma'am.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.220
Thank you.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.520
Does that dog like to go anywhere?

05:34.320 --> 05:41.760
I don't know what you mean. He comes inside and he eats his food every morning and now he's not

05:41.760 --> 05:45.200
there eating his food. He should be in the room eating his food right now.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.920
When you take him on a walk, what route do you take?

05:47.920 --> 05:49.520
I go around the neighborhood.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.920
All right. I'm going to take a quick lap around and I'll come back if I find anything.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.200
Otherwise, here's the plan. We're going to put up some signs.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.000
Thank you so much.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.080
And we're going to find that dog.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.800
I appreciate this. Would you like more pictures of him?

06:02.800 --> 06:03.760
If you got them, sure.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.560
She hands you five framed pictures of Tyler.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.320
I take them.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.480
And then she grabs one back and she's like, I'm going to hold on to this one.

06:14.160 --> 06:14.480
Thank you.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.520
You can hold on to any of these.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.240
Thank you.

06:16.240 --> 06:20.720
All right. And then I do what I said I was going to do. I'm going to do a lap around the

06:20.720 --> 06:24.000
neighborhood and yell Tyler out the window as I go.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.500
Awesome.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.520
Kind of hating every moment of it.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.280
For sure. For sure.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.080
Tyler.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.080
As you go around the neighborhood, you don't see anything out of the ordinary.

06:38.080 --> 06:41.040
You also don't see any homeless people in the area.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.480
You would notice as you're going around the neighborhood, the dogs in this neighborhood

06:44.480 --> 06:48.160
do seem to be like the ones who are outside, which there are probably a handful.

06:48.160 --> 06:51.680
They're all barking pretty loudly at different points.

06:51.680 --> 06:56.960
Not constantly, but like in spurts, you'll hear a bunch of dog ruckus and then nothing.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.200
Does Clark have knowledge of dog disappearances lately?

07:01.760 --> 07:06.160
There've been no dog disappearances lately from any council members who would have called

07:06.160 --> 07:06.960
the police about it.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.560
Sure. Clark's plan, I don't know how much you want to do right now, but he would go back

07:10.560 --> 07:16.400
to the office. He would literally do a missing dog poster as part of his service to the council

07:16.400 --> 07:19.840
woman. He wouldn't do it for anybody else probably, but he's going ahead and doing it,

07:19.840 --> 07:20.880
making copies of the photos.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.640
Just begrudgingly making dog, missing dog posters.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.160
And then going out and posting them.

07:26.160 --> 07:26.960
Okay. Awesome.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.720
Oh, and he would also check the vet. He would call the vet or the dog pounder,

07:30.720 --> 07:32.880
wherever dogs would turn up if they are found.

07:32.880 --> 07:37.680
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. There's a dog pound. Yeah. There's like an animal shelter, dog pound

07:37.680 --> 07:39.920
combo thing going on in this town. I would assume.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.600
Clark calls them up and inquires about an old black lab.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.400
Yeah. Nothing.

07:44.400 --> 07:44.880
Okay. Cool.

07:44.880 --> 07:45.920
So yeah, that's what his day is.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.160
They say lunch explorer?

07:50.160 --> 07:51.760
Lunch explorers.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.080
Yeah. That's my, that's my dream job.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.680
I would absolutely explore many lunches.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.000
That's like Anthony Bourdain, but for daytime TV.

08:00.720 --> 08:05.440
All right, Thomas, if you could give me a quick, quick, a quip.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.800
Does it quit equip?

08:08.160 --> 08:10.480
How about those fat cats in Washington?

08:10.480 --> 08:12.800
Let's take that.

08:14.080 --> 08:14.640
All right.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.640
All right. Do you want to give me a description of John Lee Pettymore?

08:18.640 --> 08:21.760
Yeah. So John Lee Pettymore, he is the fourth of his name.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.160
He is a, well, he's half contention native.

08:24.160 --> 08:29.920
His, uh, his father was killed by the DAA on his drug farm when like just after John

08:29.920 --> 08:34.160
was born and his, uh, his mother moved them back to contention where she was from.

08:34.160 --> 08:37.200
So he comes from kind of a, a pretty rough and tumble background,

08:37.200 --> 08:40.400
but he definitely wanted to turn his back on that a little bit.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.600
He's about six feet tall.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.280
He's got light brown hair.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.960
Um, and just a fucking killer cop stash.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.240
He's pretty average build.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.480
Like he was very scrawny in high school.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.320
So he's a little like touchy.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.280
He like, he looks fine, but he thinks he's like still for sure.

08:55.280 --> 08:58.880
He kind of had a, he kind of had a pretty wild teenage years.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.440
He really, he got in trouble a lot.

09:01.440 --> 09:06.560
He raced sprint cars for a while, but an injury kind of scared him out of those and,

09:06.560 --> 09:08.160
uh, ended his career there.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.840
Got him into a safer line of work.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.320
Kind of. Yeah.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.920
He was, yeah, Cthulhu hunting.

09:16.960 --> 09:21.280
In every campaign I've ever played that line of work has worked out great for my character.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.000
Absolutely.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.320
Yeah.

09:22.320 --> 09:22.640
Oh man.

09:22.640 --> 09:22.960
Who was it?

09:22.960 --> 09:25.520
Was it Archie who got ripped through the wall by the hell dogs?

09:25.520 --> 09:25.920
Yeah.

09:25.920 --> 09:26.640
That was tight.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.000
All right.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.400
Perfect.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.200
Thomas, John Lee Pettymore is going out.

09:31.200 --> 09:36.640
Do you want to go to the spot where he called it in or do you want to go talk to Jimmy?

09:36.640 --> 09:40.080
I, uh, I want to go to the spot and I will probably call Jimmy on the way and ask him

09:40.080 --> 09:40.560
to meet me there.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.640
You said he's my, like a distant cousin or something.

09:42.640 --> 09:42.880
Sure.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.160
Yeah, that totally works.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.280
You guys, uh, known each other for a long, long time.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.320
So you call him up.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.960
Uh, Hey, uh, John?

09:52.720 --> 09:53.280
Yeah, Jim.

09:53.280 --> 09:53.840
Yeah.

09:53.840 --> 09:54.480
What's going on?

09:55.760 --> 09:56.720
You called us, Jim.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.320
What do you mean?

09:58.320 --> 10:00.800
Well, you said there was an oil spill.

10:00.800 --> 10:05.520
Uh, I mean, I don't know what oil spill you're talking about.

10:05.520 --> 10:10.080
Listen, Jimmy, uh, Drew said you called in pretty early in the morning, 4 AM and there

10:10.080 --> 10:11.040
was an oil spill.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.200
I called the police station last night.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.080
You sure did, Jimmy.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.000
Oh, okay.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.400
Um, were you tying one on buddy?

10:18.400 --> 10:19.600
No, no, no.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.440
You know, I don't mess with that stuff anymore.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.040
Um, God, I, uh, I don't know.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.320
I don't know what I know, Jimmy.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.040
Uh, well, um, I don't know, man.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.160
I don't know what to tell you.

10:30.160 --> 10:30.480
All right.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.160
Well, um, where are you at right now?

10:32.160 --> 10:33.040
No, I'm at the shop.

10:33.040 --> 10:33.920
I'm going to head down there.

10:33.920 --> 10:34.240
All right.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.360
I'll see you in a second.

10:35.360 --> 10:39.680
Subtropolis is literally two blocks away from the police department.

10:39.680 --> 10:44.480
Uh, I will, and we're both downtown, so I'll walk over there before I leave.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.240
I want to ask Drew some details.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.840
What, you got a call from Jimmy?

10:47.840 --> 10:50.640
I got a call from Jimmy at a 4 AM.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.120
Yeah.

10:51.120 --> 10:57.040
I, he was describing to me this, uh, this, this black, uh, oil that was all over the

10:57.040 --> 10:59.840
ground out on a country road out Southeast.

10:59.840 --> 11:00.800
That's strange.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.640
Did he, did he describe the location more?

11:02.640 --> 11:03.040
Exactly.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.040
Do you think you could get me to that place?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.000
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.320
You hold the Fort down, raise MIA, of course.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.200
Oh yeah, for sure.

11:09.200 --> 11:09.520
All right.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.400
I'll be back soon.

11:10.400 --> 11:10.800
Okay.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.000
So yeah, I'm going to go.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.640
I'm going to stroll down to, I guess actually I want to take him with me.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.640
So I'm going to pop over there in my cruiser.

11:16.640 --> 11:16.880
Okay.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.240
So you go to Subtropolis, you know, Jimmy is the manager there.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.240
He's like pretty much always stone.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.440
Just slinging sandwiches.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.720
Hey Jimmy, first of all, uh, can you have your, can you have your boy make me a number

11:26.720 --> 11:29.280
five and then, uh, I need to talk to you for a minute.

11:29.280 --> 11:29.760
All right.

11:29.760 --> 11:30.880
Um, yeah.

11:30.880 --> 11:31.760
Uh, what's up?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.360
So you don't have any recollection of talking to, talking to Andrew last night.

11:36.960 --> 11:42.480
Uh, um, uh, nope.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.480
What'd you, what'd you do last night, buddy?

11:44.480 --> 11:49.520
Oh, you know, I was just, uh, uh, at, out at the house, uh,

11:50.560 --> 11:51.280
hanging out.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.160
Where does he live?

11:52.160 --> 11:53.040
Went for drive.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.560
Uh, he lives, uh, he lives out kind of by the country.

11:57.200 --> 11:57.920
That part of town.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.360
Yeah, it's down there.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.520
He's like kind of got some land out there.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.040
Your, your family, like all of your distant relatives just kind of like have a plot of

12:05.040 --> 12:06.240
land that they've had forever.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.520
Um, so he's down in the Southeast part of town.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.280
It's a little bit more farmy out there.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.080
Gotcha.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.000
So Jimmy, what do you recall from last night?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.360
Go ahead and roll humid.

12:16.640 --> 12:17.200
Should Pat.

12:17.200 --> 12:17.520
Yeah.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.480
24 on a 50.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.920
He's going to level with you.

12:19.920 --> 12:28.800
Man, uh, I, I got some pretty good mushrooms in recently and I hadn't, you know, tripped

12:28.800 --> 12:29.360
in a while.

12:29.360 --> 12:34.480
So I went ahead and just did some, I did some mushrooms last night, man.

12:34.480 --> 12:39.040
And I don't know, I kind of went off into my own little space in my head.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.160
And, uh, I mean, it was a crazy fucking trip.

12:42.160 --> 12:42.640
Yeah.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.920
I, uh, I definitely don't remember calling the police station.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.160
I'm really sorry, but don't worry, man.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.360
It's no big deal.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.080
I feel bad.

12:50.080 --> 12:50.720
Sorry, man.

12:51.280 --> 12:51.760
Okay.

12:51.760 --> 12:57.280
I mean, I'm still, I'm going to have to ask you to come down to the spot with me and take

12:57.280 --> 12:57.840
a look at things.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.480
Oh, just.

12:58.480 --> 12:58.800
Okay.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.360
Yeah.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.560
Jimmy, I'm not arresting you.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.360
Oh my God.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.400
Jesus Christ.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.160
I thought as long as you sell me some of those mushrooms.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.760
I was like John Lee Powell.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.800
You know, I actually, I, I've got an eighth with your name on it.

13:08.800 --> 13:09.600
I love you guys.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.400
Hey.

13:10.400 --> 13:15.040
And so you guys drive out there and as you're driving, he's kind of telling you, uh, about

13:15.040 --> 13:15.760
his trip.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.000
And, uh, yeah, I'm eating that sandwich.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.240
Yeah, chow down that number five.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.280
It's good chip layer.

13:22.160 --> 13:22.640
Of course.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.600
And, uh, you guys make it out there.

13:25.600 --> 13:31.200
It's the exact spot that he had told Drew that he was at when you saw the oil spill

13:31.200 --> 13:33.760
and there's, uh, seems to be nothing out there on the ground.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.360
Got any recollection of being out here last night, Jimmy?

13:37.360 --> 13:42.720
Uh, he kind of stares off and he's like, no, man, pretty, pretty good stuff.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.080
It was crazy, dude.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.360
It was nuts, man.

13:45.360 --> 13:50.560
I was having these crazy dreams and like, I could have sworn it was real, man.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.200
There's just,

13:53.760 --> 13:57.920
Jimmy, uh, you know, you normally don't black out from mushrooms.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.360
I never have before.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.880
Uh, it was, uh, it was a nuts night, man.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.400
I mean, I was drinking.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.200
I'll admit it.

14:05.200 --> 14:05.840
Yeah.

14:05.840 --> 14:10.000
I was drinking a bit too, uh, but I'm pretty sure I didn't come out here.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.720
Maybe I did.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.160
I don't fucking know, man.

14:12.400 --> 14:17.520
And he like goes through his phone and he sees that he made a call to the police station

14:17.520 --> 14:20.400
which is the first time he actually believes you that this happened.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.640
And he's like, Oh wow.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.120
Yeah, that's my bad.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.840
Jimmy man, I love you, but I watched

14:32.240 --> 14:36.240
a woman's face destroyed last night cause she was driving drunk.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.640
So you're going to have to promise me, be a little more careful.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.720
I promise John, we don't want nothing to happen to that face of yours.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.520
Oh, and why would you?

14:47.520 --> 14:48.480
It's a good face.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.120
Pretty good face.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.880
Hey, don't worry man.

14:50.880 --> 14:51.840
It's just no big deal.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.640
I'll take care of it.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.280
It's fine.

14:53.280 --> 14:53.680
It's fine.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.800
And I'm sorry about the call.

14:54.800 --> 14:59.440
I don't know what that was about, but shit, you know, who knows what I was seeing?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.920
All right, well I'm going to poke around anyway.

15:01.920 --> 15:02.400
All right.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.120
All right.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.240
So do you like get out?

15:04.240 --> 15:05.760
Are you parking and getting out of the car?

15:05.760 --> 15:06.000
All right.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.440
So you park and get out of the car.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.880
You're out on this country road.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.240
There's like nobody out here.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.040
Um, you see a few houses in the distance and stuff.

15:13.040 --> 15:13.440
Yeah.

15:13.440 --> 15:17.440
Nothing, uh, nothing too particular and checking the road, man.

15:17.440 --> 15:21.040
There's not even like a stain on the ground.

15:24.480 --> 15:29.600
Well, Jimmy, I mean, Hey, you know, even in that compromised mental state,

15:29.600 --> 15:31.760
I'm glad you saw something and said something.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.160
Yeah.

15:32.160 --> 15:32.880
You called us.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.840
That's the right thing to do.

15:34.240 --> 15:40.800
Um, I am, I've got some vacation time looking up, coming up next month and I am looking

15:40.800 --> 15:42.960
forward to these mushrooms, man.

15:42.960 --> 15:43.440
Yeah.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.640
Come on out to the farm.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.080
You want to choose some shotguns?

15:46.080 --> 15:47.360
Abso-fucking-lutely.

15:47.360 --> 15:47.760
I do.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.320
Yeah, dude.

15:48.320 --> 15:48.560
Yeah.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.920
It sounds like a good time.

15:49.920 --> 15:50.480
Yeah.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.280
Bring those sandwiches.

15:51.280 --> 15:51.840
Thanks, John.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.280
I really appreciate this, man.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.920
I know, I know that you, you're trying to, you know, stay on, on your grind and, and

15:57.920 --> 16:02.480
do your job and, you know, I should probably get back and, and, and take care of these

16:02.480 --> 16:05.120
good people at contention, get them the sandwiches they need.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.000
Something about this just bugs me.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.880
I call Ray.

16:08.880 --> 16:14.320
Listen, Ray, if you are south east of town, just keep an eye out around old County road.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.240
Perfect.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.000
Let me know if you see anything out of the ordinary.

16:18.000 --> 16:18.400
For sure.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.160
He will fucking something.

16:22.080 --> 16:22.480
All right.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.840
Yeah, that's perfect.

16:23.840 --> 16:28.800
All right, Luke, if you wouldn't mind, could you describe Keith Vigna to me?

16:28.800 --> 16:29.120
All right.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.000
Keith Vigna is, uh, about five eight.

16:32.080 --> 16:36.640
He's a 170 pounds, but he's down from 200 a little, he's been working out.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.280
So he's slightly muscular, but he's still got a bit of a gut.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.600
Because of his weight loss, his favorite pants are too big.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.680
So he wears a belt and suspenders.

16:47.760 --> 16:52.240
He's got the on purpose, messy hair look, but he doesn't pull it off very well.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.920
So nobody can tell that it's on purpose.

16:53.920 --> 16:54.240
Messy.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.440
It just looks kind of messy.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.160
Perfect.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.200
Like dirty blonde.

16:57.760 --> 17:03.040
Typically he's in uniform, but the uniform he wears tends to be worn quite a few times before

17:03.040 --> 17:03.920
he washes it.

17:03.920 --> 17:08.800
When he's off duty, he wears like cheap thrift store finds that tend to be like ratty button

17:08.800 --> 17:12.240
up shirts as opposed to like cool vintage clothes.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.960
He's got like a crooked smile with a slightly yellowed teeth, like one crooked tooth.

17:16.960 --> 17:20.640
He's always got a bit of scruff on his face and he's got like bright green eyes, but they're

17:20.640 --> 17:24.880
a little bit sunken in, uh, kind of like tired look about it.

17:24.880 --> 17:25.600
Cool.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.560
Cool, cool, cool.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.360
All right, Luke.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.920
So you are Keith Vigna.

17:29.920 --> 17:34.800
See, Keith Vigna is going to check out this, uh, house that has the doors swinging open

17:34.800 --> 17:35.280
or whatever.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.040
And it was called in by Mildred Mitchell, who is the neighbor.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.080
So would you like to go to the house or the neighbor's house first?

17:42.080 --> 17:43.600
Uh, I'll go talk to Mildred.

17:43.600 --> 17:49.280
As you pull into the old neighborhood where all the old nicer houses are in town that

17:49.280 --> 17:53.680
have been well kept through generations and stuff, uh, you pull up and you see the house.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.680
It's across the street from Mildred's house.

17:55.680 --> 18:00.640
Mildred's house is like really well kept and the house across the street is just very

18:00.640 --> 18:02.080
plain normal looking.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.120
However, she is right.

18:03.120 --> 18:06.720
The screen door is swinging back and forth and the front door is actually open.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.560
There's mail piling up in the mailbox and the next to the mailbox.

18:10.560 --> 18:10.800
Okay.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.040
I'm going to Mildred.

18:13.040 --> 18:13.520
Yep.

18:13.520 --> 18:13.920
Okay.

18:13.920 --> 18:21.280
So you knock and the door opens and you see a woman who has shock white hair and big rainbow

18:21.280 --> 18:27.680
earrings and she is wearing a Snuggie and drinking tea out of a big mug.

18:31.120 --> 18:34.160
Hey, Hey, how's it going there?

18:34.720 --> 18:35.360
It's going good.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.640
Did you called in about this house next door?

18:38.640 --> 18:40.160
Yes, I believe so.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.200
Who lives there?

18:41.200 --> 18:48.320
I don't know the man, but he is, uh, he's lived there for some time and he, uh, years

18:48.320 --> 18:50.560
or a couple of years for sure.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.240
I don't, I don't, I don't talk to him very much.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.320
He's, he's very, uh, closed off.

18:56.320 --> 19:00.800
He, uh, he doesn't seem to be out and about much, but how old of a man are we talking?

19:00.800 --> 19:04.240
He is, uh, probably in his like mid thirties, I'd say.

19:04.240 --> 19:04.640
Okay.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.280
So younger, younger guy, kind of a younger guy.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.280
Um, when's the last time you saw him?

19:09.280 --> 19:14.320
Uh, I saw him, uh, a couple of days ago, I guess, uh, a couple of days ago.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.840
Was he at the house or where?

19:15.840 --> 19:16.080
Yeah.

19:16.080 --> 19:16.400
Yeah.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.960
He always, you know, comes and goes, you know, he's a person.

19:18.960 --> 19:19.440
Yeah.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.520
How long has the mail and stuff been piling up?

19:22.480 --> 19:23.280
What?

19:23.280 --> 19:25.920
The, the mail over there, I see that the mailbox looks full.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.240
Uh, how long has that been going on for?

19:28.240 --> 19:30.560
A couple of days, probably since the last time I saw him.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.800
Uh, yeah, no, he, um, I don't know.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.480
Has anything weird, has he done, is he just reclusive or is he, do you think?

19:36.480 --> 19:38.240
No, no, he's just a normal guy.

19:38.240 --> 19:42.480
You know, we're, we're pretty friendly in this neighborhood, but, uh, he's, uh, it's

19:42.480 --> 19:44.560
cold out, so I don't go out too much.

19:44.560 --> 19:44.960
Right.

19:44.960 --> 19:45.520
Yeah.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.400
Look comfortable.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.760
Yeah, yes, of course.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.720
And you kind of look behind her and like, it smells like pot.

19:50.720 --> 19:51.040
Okay.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.880
It smells like bottle over in this house.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.720
And, uh, she's just this kind of crazy looking hippie lady.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.440
Yeah.

19:57.440 --> 19:57.760
Okay.

19:57.760 --> 20:01.520
Uh, well, you know, I'm going to go, uh, run over there and kind of check out the

20:01.520 --> 20:02.000
scene.

20:02.000 --> 20:02.880
I appreciate the call.

20:02.880 --> 20:07.120
Um, I might be back over to, uh, ask a few questions, but I think for now you've been

20:07.120 --> 20:07.440
helpful.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.240
So beautiful.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.080
Yeah, no, it's just, uh, I didn't, I didn't think too much of the door being open and

20:12.080 --> 20:14.240
stuff, uh, but it hasn't shut in a while.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.960
So I thought I'd make, give you guys a call.

20:16.960 --> 20:17.280
Okay.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.240
Well, we appreciate it.

20:18.240 --> 20:23.440
I will say, um, the other night I was here at the house and I, my blinds are typically

20:23.440 --> 20:27.680
open and I was, I was just enjoying the view of the neighborhood and there was like a weird

20:27.680 --> 20:29.760
flash of light coming from the house.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.120
Uh, I don't know what that was.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.080
From inside that house?

20:32.080 --> 20:37.520
Well, it seemed to be from that house, maybe, uh, definitely from the neighborhood in that

20:37.520 --> 20:38.320
area, I guess.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.960
But it was so bright, it shined into my house, uh, which is pretty rare.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.160
I thought it was strange.

20:44.160 --> 20:48.560
I looked to see if there was a, a car of some sort, but, uh, you know, it takes me a while

20:48.560 --> 20:50.000
to get up sometimes.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.680
So I must've missed it.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.360
I don't know, but it was pretty strange.

20:53.360 --> 20:53.680
Okay.

20:53.680 --> 20:57.920
Well, uh, I might be back over to, to kind of finish up everything.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.000
Uh, but for now I'll be next door.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.360
So, okay.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.160
Okay.

21:02.160 --> 21:02.480
Bye.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.520
Thank you officer.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.520
And she like shuts the door behind you.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.080
Okay.

21:06.080 --> 21:10.240
Uh, I'm going to walk over to the house and, and actually I want to go check the mail and

21:10.240 --> 21:12.320
see if I can find out this guy's name.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.680
His name is John Peters.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.280
John Peters.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.400
John Peters.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.960
There's a car and his driveway and the screen door is swinging back and forth in the wind.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.640
The front door is wide open.

21:22.640 --> 21:22.880
All right.

21:22.880 --> 21:28.080
I'm going to go just right up to the front door and just kind of yell inside and see

21:28.080 --> 21:28.800
if anyone's home.

21:32.000 --> 21:32.480
Nothing.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.280
Nothing.

21:33.280 --> 21:33.680
All right.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.120
Uh, we get my flashlight.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.800
Are we, it's daytime right now.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.600
It is daytime.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.080
All right.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.120
I'm gonna get my flashlight out.

21:39.120 --> 21:45.680
Anyway, um, get my flashlight out and just kind of go look inside the house and see if

21:45.680 --> 21:47.280
I can find anything.

21:47.280 --> 21:47.600
Okay.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.360
So it's a large wooden door.

21:49.360 --> 21:54.480
It is open, but as you walk by, you notice that the doorknob is like fully embedded into

21:54.480 --> 21:56.720
the drywall on the wall where it is.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.200
Okay.

21:57.200 --> 22:02.000
So it's like stuck open basically right in the living room, which is the room that you

22:02.000 --> 22:06.240
see when you first walk in, there are a couple of picture frames broken on the ground and

22:06.240 --> 22:09.280
there is a large trunk also sitting there.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.480
It is wide open.

22:10.480 --> 22:14.720
There is a broken lock and a pair of bolt cutters sitting in front of it.

22:14.720 --> 22:21.280
There's a bunch of like empty cans of beer around and there's bottles all over the place.

22:21.280 --> 22:22.960
This guy clearly liked to drink.

22:22.960 --> 22:23.440
Okay.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.680
But the house doesn't look like ransacked.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.120
No, I mean this trunk.

22:27.120 --> 22:27.440
Yeah.

22:27.440 --> 22:31.760
I mean the, the, the picture frames that are broken on the ground, but it doesn't look

22:31.760 --> 22:33.600
like anyone stole a bunch of stuff.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.640
The TV is still there.

22:34.640 --> 22:38.000
I'm going to look at the pictures and see if, what do those pictures look like?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.280
Anything out of the ordinary?

22:39.280 --> 22:42.080
It's just the owner and his family.

22:42.080 --> 22:46.400
Basically there's some family pics, but it doesn't look like it's his nuclear family.

22:46.400 --> 22:46.960
It's a bachelor pad.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.040
Are we talking one story, two stories?

22:49.040 --> 22:49.520
One story.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.160
One story.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.280
I'm going to just go search the rest of the rooms in the house.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.120
Go to the kitchen and whatnot.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.800
So as you go through the house, you're going to see, oh gosh, let's see.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.560
Go ahead and roll search for me.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.760
Oh, 33 crit success.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.360
That is a critical success.

23:05.360 --> 23:05.760
Well done.

23:06.400 --> 23:11.120
So as you go through, you're going to see a key chain hanging by the door.

23:11.120 --> 23:17.040
It has his house keys, a bottle opener, his car keys, a few small keys that say G10, G11,

23:17.040 --> 23:22.560
G12, and a key fob for a rewards program at Dirty Dog Grooming.

23:23.520 --> 23:28.400
And you would know from your time in the city that that is a pet salon franchise in the city.

23:28.400 --> 23:28.880
Okay.

23:28.880 --> 23:34.800
Also, as you're going around, you would see like when you get into his bedroom,

23:34.800 --> 23:38.240
going through his stuff, maybe on his night table,

23:38.240 --> 23:43.120
there are some stubs that seem to be like bedding stubs.

23:43.680 --> 23:44.480
What?

23:44.480 --> 23:47.120
So you know how like when you go to a horse race?

23:47.120 --> 23:47.520
Yeah.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.120
You've got the like bedding.

23:49.120 --> 23:49.360
Yes.

23:49.360 --> 23:49.920
Sorry.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.200
Bedding stubs.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.880
I was thinking like a mattress tag.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.720
And these basically just have numbers on them.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.480
There's nothing that really shows what he was bedding on or anything like that.

23:58.800 --> 24:03.360
It's just a bunch of numbers and stuff, but you can tell with your search that they are

24:03.360 --> 24:05.120
stubs from some sort of bedding.

24:05.120 --> 24:05.600
Okay.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.600
Also, as you're walking past it, you didn't notice anything inside of it,

24:09.600 --> 24:14.720
but on your way back, you saw that there were words burned into the top of the trunk.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.680
What did they say?

24:15.680 --> 24:19.920
It says in all caps, do not open if you want to live.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.120
I want to peek inside that trunk and see if there's anything left.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.520
There is nothing in there.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.520
There's like padding at the bottom.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.080
Okay.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.040
But it's empty.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.160
It's like foam padding.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.360
There are indentations.

24:31.360 --> 24:31.920
I gotcha.

24:31.920 --> 24:32.240
Yeah.

24:32.240 --> 24:37.360
And there are four indentations, one large, two medium, and one small.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.320
One more thing.

24:38.320 --> 24:42.080
As you were like searching the house through on that critical success,

24:42.080 --> 24:45.680
you would see that the deadbolt was smashed.

24:45.680 --> 24:51.600
Like basically this door was kicked in and the wood in the frame of the door is like broken out.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.000
Okay.

24:52.000 --> 24:52.240
Okay.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.440
So obviously somebody came here to get whatever was in that trunk.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.640
I'm gonna call into the station.

24:57.760 --> 25:01.920
Bring up a contention PD.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.720
Hey Drew.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.480
It's Keith.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.400
I'm at this house.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.320
Are you familiar with John Peters?

25:10.320 --> 25:11.040
Do you know that name?

25:14.560 --> 25:14.880
No.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.440
Okay.

25:15.440 --> 25:20.240
Could you do a quick search for that name and see if anything pops up on him?

25:21.200 --> 25:25.840
I'm at his house and he hasn't been here in a couple of days and it looks like there's been a

25:25.840 --> 25:31.520
break in and so I'm thinking that we might have a missing persons kind of thing.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.560
Oh geez.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.520
What is happening?

25:33.520 --> 25:34.240
I know.

25:34.240 --> 25:34.560
Okay.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.560
So let me look him up real quick.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.000
Go ahead and roll luck for me.

25:38.000 --> 25:38.960
What's your luck?

25:38.960 --> 25:39.440
60.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.360
That is a seven.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.880
Yeah baby.

25:42.880 --> 25:43.600
Let's see.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.920
What would you learn about John Peters?

25:45.920 --> 25:50.080
He has had very little contact with the police.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.800
Like he has never, he hasn't done anything wrong really.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.360
Yeah.

25:53.360 --> 25:59.360
He did find, uh, he was in the hospital for a while, like a long time.

25:59.360 --> 26:04.480
He had a long stint in the hospital and that was like a couple years ago.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.520
Does it say why?

26:05.520 --> 26:05.920
No.

26:05.920 --> 26:06.560
Okay.

26:06.560 --> 26:07.680
Well thanks Drew.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.560
Yeah, absolutely.

26:08.560 --> 26:12.080
I want to go back to that trunk and try to get the fingerprints off of it.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.200
Go ahead and roll forensics.

26:13.200 --> 26:13.920
I have a zero.

26:14.560 --> 26:14.880
Okay.

26:16.160 --> 26:16.960
25.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.960
Well it wasn't a crit fail, you just failed.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.600
Yeah.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.080
Okay.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.560
You get some fingerprints off of it that you think are all right.

26:23.120 --> 26:23.600
Probably.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.800
You're like, I've never done this before, but uh, we'll give it a shot.

26:28.160 --> 26:28.560
Okay.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.400
You think you know how to do this?

26:30.400 --> 26:32.720
Uh, you like get some scotch tape out and like...

26:33.600 --> 26:35.280
I try my hardest.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.160
Is there anything else you want to do?

26:38.720 --> 26:41.600
If I've searched around the house and looked through everything, I don't know.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.480
I guess I'll file a report just saying that it looks like a break-in.

26:44.480 --> 26:49.200
I mean, I guess I can't file a missing persons because I have no other reason than the break-in

26:49.200 --> 26:51.120
to suspect that, um...

26:51.120 --> 26:52.880
Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.880
48 on a 50.

26:54.880 --> 26:55.600
Yeah.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.480
On his key ring was a rewards program for...

26:58.480 --> 26:59.600
The doggy daycare or whatever.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.640
Yeah, the dirty dogs.

27:00.640 --> 27:01.680
Dirty dogs.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.560
And uh, there doesn't seem to be a dog in this house,

27:04.560 --> 27:07.200
or any like thing that would tell you that he ever had it.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.560
Okay, I'm gonna give a call there, see if he maybe works there.

27:10.560 --> 27:10.960
Okay.

27:10.960 --> 27:11.840
Uh, he doesn't.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.440
Do they know his name?

27:13.440 --> 27:14.800
Go ahead and roll human.

27:15.360 --> 27:15.760
Shit.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.200
98.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.160
Uh, you have no idea.

27:18.160 --> 27:18.480
Cool.

27:18.480 --> 27:22.320
I'm gonna make a note of the daycare or the doggy thing.

27:22.320 --> 27:22.640
Yeah.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.200
There's no signs of any animals living here.

27:25.200 --> 27:25.600
Nope.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.240
Okay, I'm gonna go back over and talk to Mildred real quick.

27:28.240 --> 27:28.740
Okay.

27:33.360 --> 27:33.920
Hold on.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.240
She opens the door like waving her hand in front of her face and she's like,

27:40.240 --> 27:41.200
Sorry, what's up?

27:41.200 --> 27:42.960
You gonna skunk, skunk in there?

27:42.960 --> 27:44.240
Oh yeah, um...

27:44.240 --> 27:44.740
Yeah.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.600
I'm not worried, I'm here to help.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.160
Let's see, do you, have you ever seen John with a dog?

27:50.160 --> 27:51.600
Uh, John with a dog?

27:51.600 --> 27:51.920
No?

27:51.920 --> 27:53.200
I don't think he has a dog.

27:53.200 --> 27:53.680
Okay.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.280
These dogs have been going crazy.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.160
I know.

27:56.160 --> 27:56.480
Yeah.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.680
Okay, that's all I needed to know.

27:57.680 --> 27:58.080
Okay.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.920
And something clicks in Keith's mind.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.160
All right.

28:04.160 --> 28:04.720
Okay.

28:04.720 --> 28:05.520
Is that all?

28:05.520 --> 28:06.720
That's, that's, that'll do it.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.680
You can go back to, uh, tending to your skunk.

28:09.680 --> 28:10.560
I'm knitting.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.840
Yeah, go back to knitting.

28:11.840 --> 28:12.560
Thank you.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.120
Yeah, I'll come see what you did later.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.040
Anyway, okay.

28:17.040 --> 28:17.600
Have a good night.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.880
Have a good night.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.120
Yeah.

28:20.000 --> 28:20.560
Um, okay.

28:20.560 --> 28:26.400
I'm gonna go back to the station and, um, I also want to get in contact with Clark and

28:26.400 --> 28:28.640
see what he found out about this dog.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.360
You guys are gonna meet up for lunch probably right about now.

28:31.360 --> 28:31.840
Cool.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.480
All right, sounds good.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.320
Y'all ready for this?

28:34.320 --> 28:37.840
The three of you meet up for lunch at the police station.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.080
This is a weird place to eat lunch.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.440
Let's go to Klinker's.

28:41.520 --> 28:46.160
Clark definitely has a bologna sandwich in a brown paper bag and he's, he's already probably

28:46.160 --> 28:47.360
chomping on it at his desk.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.680
I know you probably won't be hungry after the bologna sandwich, but, uh, I'm thinking

28:51.680 --> 28:52.480
subtropolis.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.320
Already ate a subtropolis today.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.680
I'll just canonically, I'll just get a, I'll order a pizza.

28:57.680 --> 29:00.800
I'm interested in this dog cause I've got a connection to make.

29:00.800 --> 29:04.080
Well, maybe you can shed some light on it cause I didn't make much headway.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.400
She's missing a black lab named Tyler.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.840
She hadn't done anything to find it.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.680
So I went ahead and put up some posters for her and did a lab around the block and called

29:11.680 --> 29:12.640
the humane society.

29:12.640 --> 29:16.960
But I did note that them dogs was barking all around that neighborhood.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.920
So I went and checked out that abandoned house.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.240
I talked to the neighbor Mildred Mitchell.

29:22.240 --> 29:27.040
She is a quirky little hippie lady, but anyway, she let me know.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.400
He's kind of a reclusive guy.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.640
His name's John Peters that lives there.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.560
Obviously it looks like somebody had broken in.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.520
It was kicked open.

29:33.520 --> 29:38.800
The dead bolt had torn off some of the wood from the door frame and door handle was sticking

29:38.800 --> 29:40.080
into the dry wall.

29:40.080 --> 29:43.040
He had left his key chain with like his key fob and stuff.

29:43.040 --> 29:48.720
So it looks kind of a little suspicious that somebody broke in and he had a big trunk there.

29:48.720 --> 29:52.560
And on the top of the trunk, it said, do not open if you want to live.

29:52.560 --> 29:57.120
Looks like somebody had taken bolt cutters and chomped the lock on there.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.080
Totally empty.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.760
Like nothing else had been stolen.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.040
The TV was still there and all that.

30:01.040 --> 30:05.520
But I did notice on his key chain that he left, he had like a rewards, like loyalty

30:05.520 --> 30:09.120
card for dirty dog, dirty dog grooming.

30:09.120 --> 30:13.360
He, there was no, there was no signs of a dog living there.

30:13.360 --> 30:17.360
And I asked, I went back and asked the neighbor and she said she'd never seen him with a dog,

30:17.360 --> 30:21.920
which kind of makes me think, I don't know why he would have that loyalty key chain.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.760
Definitely bizarre and dirty dogs.

30:23.760 --> 30:24.560
It's in the city.

30:25.360 --> 30:30.800
Not sure why he would have that, but I was thinking, I was thinking, uh, he's, he's gone.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.240
He hasn't been seen in a couple of days.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.360
This dog's gone.

30:33.360 --> 30:37.280
I don't know what the connection there would be, but I, it could, it could be something

30:37.280 --> 30:38.720
just to think about.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.240
Isn't it as plain as day?

30:40.240 --> 30:41.280
Man loves dog.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.480
Dogs loves man.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.760
They run away, run away together.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.360
Damn.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.840
That's why you're the best detective on the force.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.960
What'd you find out?

30:48.960 --> 30:49.840
What kind of oil?

30:50.640 --> 30:51.440
Canola?

30:51.440 --> 30:56.720
All, you know, my, my cousin, Jimmy, cousin, Jimmy oil, my cousin, Jimmy, who runs the

30:56.720 --> 30:59.600
subtropolis, he, he was just up real late and pretty tired.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.720
I think he was seeing things.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.440
So there was no sign of a oil spill?

31:03.440 --> 31:04.240
No sign.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.040
Nothing like that.

31:05.040 --> 31:08.640
He was, is he a drinker or a smoker or a tweaker?

31:08.640 --> 31:09.680
No, Jimmy's all right.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.960
He, uh, I think he's burning the candle at both ends.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.520
You know what I mean?

31:13.520 --> 31:15.600
He's, he's going a little too hard at subtropolis.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.040
Okay.

31:17.040 --> 31:17.600
Hmm.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.560
Interesting.

31:18.560 --> 31:22.640
But he did, what he, what he said, he described in depth what he saw to me.

31:22.640 --> 31:23.920
Well, what did he see?

31:23.920 --> 31:25.840
He said it was like, no, he didn't.

31:25.840 --> 31:26.800
He didn't remember this at all.

31:26.800 --> 31:30.000
Andrew had a little more details about what the car had said.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.120
I said it was like a thick black oil just all across the road and the fields.

31:35.120 --> 31:35.520
Yeah.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.360
This was at 4am in the morning.

31:37.360 --> 31:37.760
Yeah.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.720
I went out there and there's no sign of it at all.

31:40.720 --> 31:41.840
Nobody would have cleaned it up.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.840
That would have been something that we would have known about.

31:44.480 --> 31:44.800
Yeah.

31:44.800 --> 31:48.480
And I'm certainly, it's probably not something revolved, like involved with any kind of elder

31:48.480 --> 31:49.200
God death cult.

31:50.880 --> 31:51.840
I wouldn't suspect.

31:51.840 --> 31:52.320
Probably not.

31:52.320 --> 31:52.960
Probably not.

31:52.960 --> 31:57.920
Miss Paige did say that she had seen, she thought she had seen something in her backyard

31:57.920 --> 32:00.640
not previous to the dog disappearance.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.240
She thought it was a homeless person.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.760
She said there's been a rash of homeless people in the neighborhood.

32:05.760 --> 32:09.840
And she, for a moment floated the idea that the homeless men had eaten her dog.

32:09.840 --> 32:14.800
Wait, which neighborhood, which neighborhood did the council woman live in?

32:14.800 --> 32:16.080
She was in the old neighborhood.

32:16.080 --> 32:20.160
Let's compare addresses to where she lives and where this abandoned house is.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.160
Either the rose or the bow tie.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.720
Are we talking the same, same street?

32:24.720 --> 32:26.000
Same neighborhood for sure.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.400
I would say that, uh, you were, sorry, uh, Keith Vigna, the house that you checked out

32:32.400 --> 32:38.240
is on the same street, but south of the council woman's house on the same street.

32:38.240 --> 32:38.720
Okay.

32:38.720 --> 32:39.440
Interesting.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.720
Um, we should have compared those.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.000
How many blocks away?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.120
Hold on just a second.

32:44.320 --> 32:44.880
TNT.

32:45.680 --> 32:46.480
We know drama.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.360
We know drama.

32:47.360 --> 32:51.920
Uh, you asked how many, you asked how many, uh, how many blocks away?

32:52.720 --> 32:53.680
How many blocks away?

32:55.920 --> 32:57.120
I'd say like a block.

32:57.120 --> 32:57.600
Cool.

32:57.600 --> 33:02.400
So I think John Peters is the dog and he ran away.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.600
That makes the most sense to me.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.280
Is this some kind of joke?

33:08.480 --> 33:10.640
Yeah, it's a, it's a, I'm sorry.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.480
We're talking about missing people, missing dogs.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.520
I shouldn't be joking around.

33:13.520 --> 33:16.480
You're not a, you're not a bad cop, but you are a bad cop.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.920
I gotta, I gotta grow up into these britches.

33:22.720 --> 33:27.600
In your investigation of the house, could you tell how long it had been vacant?

33:28.240 --> 33:33.040
So Mildred told me that she, the last time she saw John Peters was two days ago.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.960
And I checked, she didn't know his name.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.880
I had to check his mail to see what his name was.

33:36.880 --> 33:41.440
Mostly just junk stuff, but I don't think that he was in the house when it got broken

33:41.440 --> 33:45.520
into because there didn't seem to be signs of any struggle or anything like that.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.000
But as far as I know, nobody's seen him in at least two days.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.200
You also found out one other piece of information from Drew.

33:51.200 --> 33:58.960
The piece of information that I found out from Drew was that John had been in the hospital

33:58.960 --> 34:01.360
for a long stint a couple of years ago.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.000
With what?

34:02.000 --> 34:05.200
He, uh, had trouble transforming back into the dog.

34:11.200 --> 34:15.920
Uh, no, it, uh, they, uh, uh, it didn't, it didn't say,

34:15.920 --> 34:18.720
it just said that he was there for a while, but I did, I don't know why.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.600
My shape shifting abilities all fucked up.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.720
Take a look at my dog.

34:24.720 --> 34:25.680
I still have a tail.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.040
Oh goodness.

34:29.040 --> 34:29.200
Yeah.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.360
So I don't know why, but, um, I found that out.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.160
I told you about the key chain, the trunk.

34:34.160 --> 34:38.240
Oh, uh, Mildred said that, sorry, was it a couple of days ago she saw that she saw like

34:38.240 --> 34:42.080
a flashing light coming from that area or like inside of his house.

34:42.080 --> 34:46.080
But she said that she, you know, didn't get up in time to like see exactly where the source

34:46.080 --> 34:49.600
was, but I couldn't find anything that would have caused that coming from inside the house.

34:49.600 --> 34:50.800
Was his car still there?

34:50.880 --> 34:52.000
His car was still there.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.880
His keys to the house and the car were still there as well.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.760
Um, the only thing out of place was the trunk.

34:57.760 --> 35:03.360
The key chain has his house keys, a bottle opener, his car keys, a few small keys that

35:03.360 --> 35:09.120
say G 10, G 11, G 12, and a key fob for rewards program at dirty dog grooming.

35:09.120 --> 35:13.200
What a series of bizarre and presumably unrelated.

35:13.200 --> 35:17.600
It seems that he has a proclivity for alcohol because there's a lot of beer bottles and

35:17.600 --> 35:19.680
beer cans just kind of strewn about the place.

35:19.680 --> 35:23.280
The little keys that have the G numbers of those, uh, storage units.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.840
That is a good detective work.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.680
I've never done this before.

35:34.080 --> 35:38.080
I've never done this before, but I also, here's, I hold up a piece of scotch tape.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.320
I'm like, I try to get some fingerprints off the truck.

35:40.320 --> 35:44.000
I don't know if this is how you do it, but do you want this?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.800
That could go to police school.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.160
I plead the fifth Clark.

35:52.160 --> 35:57.440
When you look at the scotch tape, it's got a, it's got like, it's a paw print.

35:57.440 --> 36:01.840
It's like, it's like literally like five fingerprints all smashed on top of each other.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.120
Half of them are mine.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.320
Did I do this?

36:09.760 --> 36:13.520
Uh, no, I graduated from the police academy.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.240
I won't tell you which one up in the city.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.120
Yeah, I went to the city.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.880
I'm, I'm a good cop.

36:19.840 --> 36:20.560
I'm a good cop.

36:21.840 --> 36:29.040
Keith, you would know that you didn't actually put any crime scene tape up or really close it.

36:29.040 --> 36:33.280
You didn't even close the door of the house.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.480
Not even when I went in.

36:34.480 --> 36:37.120
Well, cause I didn't want it to preserve it.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.960
You know, also I was a little scared.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.240
It's a creepy old house.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.280
You guys want to go back?

36:41.280 --> 36:42.320
No, I mean, we're pretty busy.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.360
We should probably have Ray.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.600
I didn't even look in his car either.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.160
Damn.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.040
That could have been good.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.880
Do you call the dog groomer?

36:48.880 --> 36:50.240
I did call the dog groomer.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.400
He did one thing.

36:53.520 --> 36:55.200
I called the dog groomer.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.280
John Peters does not work there.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.440
And the person that I was on the phone with was not familiar with his name.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.440
Probably because I rolled at 95.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.720
Sometimes I just don't have any idea what the hell you're talking about.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.480
It's a, you, you went to the police academy in town.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.640
I went to police academy in the city.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.760
There is no police academy in this town of 5,000 people.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.400
I was in your class.

37:23.520 --> 37:24.000
You know what?

37:24.720 --> 37:28.480
I think maybe I should go check out what was in his car.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.520
Cause people tend to keep things important to them.

37:31.520 --> 37:31.600
Yeah.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.440
Maybe we should all go check this house out.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.920
It sounds like it might be a linchpin in this whole mystery.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.560
We can double check your work.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.600
You know what they say?

37:39.600 --> 37:41.120
Three's better.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.080
Three's company.

37:45.920 --> 37:50.160
So you guys head out to go back to where John Peters lives?

37:50.160 --> 37:51.120
On the, on the way there.

37:51.120 --> 37:54.320
I want to call back into Drew because I, on the posters I put up,

37:54.320 --> 37:56.240
I put the station's number on it.

37:56.240 --> 37:56.720
Yeah.

37:56.720 --> 37:59.520
Hey Drew, you get any calls about that dog?

37:59.520 --> 38:00.640
No one has called yet.

38:00.640 --> 38:01.360
All right.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.320
Keep me posted.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.600
I absolutely will.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.320
That's all I wanted.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.160
Perfect.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.720
You take a nice little drive into the neighborhood,

38:08.720 --> 38:11.600
go past Bean's pond on the way to the house.

38:11.600 --> 38:16.320
As you pull up, Keith, I think you would probably notice right away that

38:16.320 --> 38:21.040
John Peters' car is not in the driveway and the door is closed.

38:21.040 --> 38:23.520
How did he move his car if I had the keys?

38:23.520 --> 38:25.120
Are you asking the world?

38:25.120 --> 38:26.320
I'm wondering out loud.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.120
How did he move the car if I had the keys?

38:29.120 --> 38:31.440
Are you asking how car thieves stole a car?

38:31.440 --> 38:32.960
We don't know that it's a thief.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.480
Is the mail still there?

38:34.480 --> 38:35.360
Still there?

38:35.440 --> 38:37.360
No, we're looking for the mail, John Peters.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.000
Yikes.

38:40.000 --> 38:40.800
The whole point is there.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.520
Uh, the mail, the mail is gone.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.960
The mailbox is empty.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.080
Is the door still open?

38:48.080 --> 38:49.280
No, it's closed.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.160
I go ahead and take the lead and go and knock on the door.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.840
Come and knock on our door.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.720
So you pull up around the house, you got two cop cars in front,

38:56.720 --> 39:00.640
maybe one in the driveway and you go up and knock on the door and you get no response.

39:00.640 --> 39:01.120
I try it.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.920
Oh, I mean the door has been kicked in previously.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.840
It was basically set back into the frame.

39:05.840 --> 39:06.560
I go and open it.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.400
You open the door into this house.

39:08.400 --> 39:11.760
You see there are, there's some glass on the ground.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.960
There's a bunch of like bottles and cans out and about.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.480
I holler in.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.480
Hey, anybody in here?

39:20.800 --> 39:21.360
You hear nothing.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.800
Is the trunk still in there?

39:22.800 --> 39:23.440
The what?

39:23.440 --> 39:24.320
The trunk.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.840
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.560
In the house?

39:26.560 --> 39:27.760
There's no trunk in this house.

39:27.760 --> 39:28.560
Fuck.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.600
Uh, hey, where's that trunk you were talking about?

39:31.600 --> 39:32.480
It was right there.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.320
The one that said, do not open if you want to live.

39:34.320 --> 39:35.600
Yeah, it was right there.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.480
It's not there now.

39:36.480 --> 39:37.840
Are you supposed, who are you supposed to be?

39:37.840 --> 39:42.320
Yeah, the DM is fucking with us now.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.600
I'm just telling you what you see.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.600
Yeah, well it was sitting right there.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.160
Yeah, but you said it like he had no previous knowledge.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.280
Like gaslighting me.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.640
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

39:56.640 --> 40:00.480
Look, uh, we actually, this is the first time any of us have been to the Peters' house.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.520
Uh, am I John Peters?

40:04.560 --> 40:05.760
We're in the wrong house.

40:05.760 --> 40:09.040
You like quietly tuck a tail into your big britches.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.040
Keith wrote down the address wrong.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.880
Keith brought us to the wrong house.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.000
Oh, we swatted this dude.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.640
You can see, uh, as you're looking around now, there's some glass on the floor from

40:18.640 --> 40:22.880
where the picture frames were, but they're now like all sitting on like a desk.

40:23.840 --> 40:28.240
So it probably was John probably had a spare key, but fuck.

40:28.240 --> 40:31.040
Why would he have moved the trunk and not like called?

40:31.040 --> 40:34.240
Well, we're probably dealing with some shit that he didn't want to talk to the police.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.560
Can I see an outline on the floor of where the trunk was?

40:36.560 --> 40:37.600
Yeah, there seems to be.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.560
All right, I believe you Keith.

40:38.560 --> 40:39.040
Carpet.

40:39.600 --> 40:43.280
There's like a little indentation where Keith claims the trunk was.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.240
Believe me guys.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.240
And you searched the, you searched the house before?

40:46.240 --> 40:47.040
Yeah, I searched the house.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.040
All I found, like I said, was those keys.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.840
And you're a strange particular parlance.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.320
Did you roll to search this house?

40:54.320 --> 40:55.760
I crit succeeded.

40:55.760 --> 40:57.440
I don't know what that means, but it sounds good.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.560
I do a real good job searching this house.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.200
Are you making fun of his accent?

41:03.200 --> 41:04.000
The hell Vigna?

41:04.640 --> 41:06.480
Sorry dude, it's kind of rubs off.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.680
You also found something.

41:07.680 --> 41:08.800
You found the betting stubs.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.400
Oh shit, yeah.

41:13.360 --> 41:16.160
Guys, I'm a good police officer.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.880
I'm trying my, I want to do good.

41:19.760 --> 41:24.640
Yeah, so I found these stubs that look like some sort of betting receipts.

41:24.640 --> 41:25.680
What was he betting on?

41:25.680 --> 41:28.160
That's, you should take a look at him.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.840
What kind of money was he throwing down?

41:29.840 --> 41:31.920
He was throwing down some heavy money.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.600
There are dates on these as well.

41:33.600 --> 41:34.800
Like hundreds or thousands.

41:34.800 --> 41:38.160
Hundreds per night, but on multiple nights.

41:38.160 --> 41:42.560
I wonder if this, if he was betting on horses or dogs.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.760
He's betting on himself.

41:46.000 --> 41:53.040
So basically these stubs are from the past, not this month, like not anytime in November.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.720
These stubs are from the future.

41:56.560 --> 42:01.760
What the hell is going on here, Jim?

42:01.760 --> 42:03.280
They're, none of them are from November.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.880
They're all from October and previous.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.920
And there was a lot of money being bet and he never won.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.160
And there is no indication what he was betting on.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.360
Nope, none whatsoever.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.680
Is there any commonality between the bets?

42:13.680 --> 42:15.520
Is he always betting on the same thing?

42:15.520 --> 42:17.440
He's always betting on it and oh yeah.

42:17.440 --> 42:22.080
And you would also see there is a payout scale on there and he's always betting on these

42:22.880 --> 42:26.640
crazy bets, like 30 to one, 50 to one bets.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.160
None of these are like two to three.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.440
None of these are good bets.

42:29.440 --> 42:30.720
He's making bad bets.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.720
And this seems, are we assuming, like, are there names?

42:32.720 --> 42:34.400
Is this racing of some kind?

42:34.400 --> 42:35.440
There's numbers.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.960
It seems to be that the numbers are dictating what the bet is on.

42:38.960 --> 42:41.360
And I was kind of asking, are those the same ever?

42:41.360 --> 42:41.680
No.

42:41.680 --> 42:42.000
Okay.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.680
Oh, maybe sometimes.

42:43.680 --> 42:43.920
Yeah.

42:44.480 --> 42:45.520
Maybe sometimes.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.040
Maybe sometimes.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.400
And there's a knock at the door.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.440
Hey, yeah.

42:51.440 --> 42:52.800
It's clearly open.

42:52.800 --> 42:53.600
Come on in.

42:53.600 --> 42:54.480
You see a woman.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.080
Does she have a face in the front door?

42:56.080 --> 42:56.720
She is.

42:56.720 --> 42:59.280
She has shock white hair and big rainbow earrings.

42:59.280 --> 43:04.080
She's wearing a Snuggie and she has a big mug of tea.

43:04.080 --> 43:04.960
Are you all back?

43:04.960 --> 43:06.000
How's your knitting going?

43:06.000 --> 43:06.960
What's going on?

43:06.960 --> 43:08.640
Why, why are you so concerned?

43:08.640 --> 43:12.960
Well, I just thought that there were some, you know, they came by, so I just didn't know.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.320
Who came by?

43:14.320 --> 43:17.120
Well, miss Mildred, the men who came by.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.400
Have you ever seen these men before?

43:18.400 --> 43:22.400
No, but I figured they were working with you all setting up the John one with them.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.600
They look official at all.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.280
I mean, they were just a couple men.

43:25.280 --> 43:28.640
I didn't really think too much about it, but were they in suits?

43:28.640 --> 43:31.520
One of them was wearing a suit and the other one had a big old jacket.

43:31.520 --> 43:36.960
I mean, they both had big jackets on, you know, did the jacket say anything to see if

43:36.960 --> 43:37.840
they were homeless or not.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.640
Oh, eating dogs, eating dogs.

43:40.640 --> 43:43.360
Oh, they didn't, they didn't seem to be eating any dogs.

43:43.360 --> 43:44.960
Is that your is real quick.

43:44.960 --> 43:46.080
Is that your Lippmann test?

43:46.080 --> 43:47.840
Like, is he in a suit or not?

43:48.400 --> 43:49.120
He's homeless.

43:52.560 --> 43:55.040
Yeah, no, it was to fish for what they were wearing.

43:55.040 --> 43:55.540
Yeah.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.800
Did the jacket say anything on him or are they just.

43:58.800 --> 44:03.760
No, they just pulled up and then they got in his car and one of them got in that car

44:03.760 --> 44:07.600
and the other one took the other car and they both left after they came out into the house

44:07.600 --> 44:08.240
and such.

44:08.240 --> 44:11.120
And I just didn't know why you guys were back.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.600
If it was there, I just want to make sure my neighbors.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.480
Move the trunk.

44:14.880 --> 44:16.320
Were they carrying anything?

44:16.320 --> 44:16.960
The trunk?

44:16.960 --> 44:18.320
Yeah, they carried a trunk.

44:18.320 --> 44:20.160
They put it in John's car.

44:20.160 --> 44:20.720
Yeah.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.000
And they drove off with John's car.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.060
Yeah.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.520
They both drove away.

44:25.520 --> 44:26.480
See which way they went.

44:26.480 --> 44:29.440
They both, they both drove away in the same car or did they.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.320
They were in separate.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.280
One of them drove their car and the other one drove his car.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.320
Do you know what kind of car that they showed up in?

44:36.320 --> 44:38.160
It was just like a car.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.160
It was like a white Toyota.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.320
White Toyota, the four door.

44:42.320 --> 44:46.960
I don't remember how many doors I had on it, son, but I appreciate you asking.

44:49.600 --> 44:52.080
I'm glad you would value one old lady's opinion.

44:53.280 --> 44:54.480
Are you mocking her now?

44:56.000 --> 44:57.440
You know, this is a freeform medium.

45:00.400 --> 45:01.680
Well, shit boys.

45:02.240 --> 45:05.120
Keith, you, you got, you wrote down his license plate, right?

45:05.760 --> 45:08.000
Yes, for sure not.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.440
I do remember that it was a.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.960
Why don't you roll to see if you did that?

45:12.960 --> 45:14.160
What color was the car?

45:18.720 --> 45:20.000
It was a red car.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.920
Go ahead and roll intelligence for me there, Keith.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.560
Oh, that's a 54 on a 50.

45:24.560 --> 45:27.840
You have, it was a car.

45:28.640 --> 45:30.560
It was maroon.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.040
It was a maroon car.

45:33.040 --> 45:34.800
Put an APB up for that.

45:34.800 --> 45:40.080
This woman Mildred Mitchell is kind of like staring and looking around at you guys.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.920
Watching the three Stooges routine.

45:41.920 --> 45:42.800
Exactly.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.520
And she's like, well, okay.

45:45.520 --> 45:50.880
If, if you guys need any water or tea or anything, I'm right across the street.

45:50.880 --> 45:54.720
Hey Mildred, do you remember what kind of car Mr. Peterson drove?

45:54.720 --> 45:55.200
Who?

45:55.200 --> 45:57.120
Your neighbor, John Peters.

45:57.120 --> 45:59.360
Oh, he had that maroon car.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.040
Do you know what it was?

46:01.040 --> 46:02.480
You seem to be.

46:02.480 --> 46:05.360
I used to drive a maroon 97 Oldsmobile Cheeto.

46:05.360 --> 46:06.640
Was it one like that?

46:06.640 --> 46:07.440
I don't know.

46:07.440 --> 46:09.360
Is it a Cutlass Supreme?

46:09.360 --> 46:10.640
A La Sabre perhaps?

46:10.640 --> 46:11.840
What kind of car do you drive?

46:11.840 --> 46:14.480
This is a conversation that I don't care anything about.

46:15.680 --> 46:16.480
Well, you know what?

46:16.480 --> 46:18.160
I mean, but I think the world cares.

46:19.200 --> 46:21.680
This is what people want to hear.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.200
Oh, I drive a white car.

46:25.600 --> 46:26.400
That's real nice.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.440
All right, go.

46:27.440 --> 46:28.720
It's cold out here.

46:28.720 --> 46:30.080
Go home, Mildred.

46:30.080 --> 46:32.880
It's actually unseasonably warm if you recall.

46:32.880 --> 46:34.400
It's a pretty nice day today.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.080
It's cold out, Mildred.

46:36.080 --> 46:36.720
Go home.

46:37.440 --> 46:40.720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

47:07.440 --> 47:14.720
Drowning out on the nose.

47:14.720 --> 47:18.720
With no mind at all.

47:18.720 --> 47:22.720
No mind at all.

47:22.720 --> 47:26.720
No mind at all.

47:26.720 --> 47:30.720
Fly to fly to the stream.
