Howdy partners, it's your ding-dang big bang shooting rowdy son of a gun wolf the dog

00:07.340 --> 00:14.380

00:15.140 --> 00:16.980
PTBP from

00:16.980 --> 00:18.820
some other

00:18.820 --> 00:20.060
time

00:20.060 --> 00:26.440
While dealing with the unfamiliar time, let's check in with a familiar old standby

00:26.780 --> 00:32.880
This week's Helen with wolf comes from Luke aka vegan amigo who wrote a fantastic

00:33.720 --> 00:41.580
Five-star review of this show over on Apple podcast, which is a hell of a sweet thing to do they write

00:42.640 --> 00:48.340

Damn, that was weird Luke aka vegan amigo, which reminds me

01:07.120 --> 01:14.480
Let me look outside real quick. Like yep. I'm definitely some time weird again. God damn it

01:14.760 --> 01:21.840
Hey you yeah, you listen to get your hand out of your mouth and focus for one goddamn second here

01:21.840 --> 01:27.180
Thank you all Wolfie gets lonely on his travels through both time and space

01:27.480 --> 01:29.520
The knowledge that you folks are out there

01:30.180 --> 01:36.000
Metaphysically keeping me company brings me warmth both in my esophagus and in my loins

01:36.320 --> 01:44.240
I'm not sure how this community keeps growing my producer assures me we are doing the absolute bare minimum in terms of

01:44.920 --> 01:48.360
Advertising I guess bare minimum means none whatsoever

01:48.840 --> 01:51.880
So, please keep up the beautiful word of mouth

01:51.880 --> 01:59.320
It seems to be working keep telling your friends your enemies your frenemies even and keep writing up sweet

01:59.880 --> 02:03.680
Recommendations and reviews on reddit just keep doing what you're doing

02:04.040 --> 02:09.920

02:10.520 --> 02:17.640
Doing this fuck Nike y'all ready for a new jam that makes Smuckers feel like suckers a jam

That truly squelches the likes of Welch's this track is so sweet y'all

02:22.640 --> 02:30.660
It'll make the fruit green with jelly. It's the creek rocks with can't you hear them wolves are howling?

02:47.640 --> 02:49.640
Oh

03:03.120 --> 03:09.080
Standing behind a heavy wooden lectern is a young man wearing a thick

03:09.840 --> 03:13.780
Hand-stitched suit at the neck of his white shirt

03:13.840 --> 03:17.060
He sports the collar of a preacher and

03:17.580 --> 03:23.300
Pinned on his breast pocket. There is a shiny gold star

03:24.420 --> 03:28.300
words along the bottom of the screen read

03:29.260 --> 03:31.260
contention

03:31.340 --> 03:33.220
1880 something

03:33.220 --> 03:39.340
This fresh-faced kid steps back from the pulpit and begins to walk down the aisle of this

03:39.380 --> 03:42.420
His house of the Lord as he speaks

03:43.140 --> 03:45.140
directly into camera

03:45.660 --> 03:50.540
Howdy there folks. My name is Bobby custard. Welcome to contention

03:51.300 --> 03:58.020
Nuzzled here in the middle of prosperous farms and ranches this dusty mining town of contention sits

03:58.460 --> 04:06.100
We were doing a okay for a mining town, but then this fella no, no not a fella bona fide genius

04:06.100 --> 04:10.540
Well, he came along and turned contention not only into one of the most successful

04:11.060 --> 04:17.580
Mining operations this side of the long wet one, but one of the most modern pounds of round

04:18.340 --> 04:26.020
Silas Cole showed up one day is just a minor and before long he was inventing and doing all sorts of business

04:27.060 --> 04:33.120
After he bought the mine, he electrified my church here and the courthouse and the schoolhouse, too

04:33.700 --> 04:40.060
Mr. Cole surely is a gift from above you'll meet him eventually if you stick around long enough

04:40.860 --> 04:42.500
but don't

04:42.500 --> 04:46.380
Don't make eye contact or any sudden movements

04:46.380 --> 04:51.640
He's real skittish like always on the edge of another brilliant discovery

04:51.640 --> 04:57.900
I'd imagine and his wife Mary what a gem she founded contentions first library

04:58.580 --> 05:07.060
contentions got more learned folks than ever before which is a big asset in my humble opinion being there is far less crime and

05:07.100 --> 05:11.940
I don't have to do all the Bible reading during service. I

05:12.780 --> 05:18.700
Will say though. This is a bit of an unfortunate time to be here in contention. See

05:19.580 --> 05:22.780
We done had a handful of disappearances lately

05:23.460 --> 05:24.660
nothing wild

05:24.660 --> 05:31.940
usual suspects the whole saloon staff and the bartender miss kitty piano player a few gamblers the town drunk

05:31.940 --> 05:36.340
You know if half of them went missing in one go not sure anyone will bat an eye

05:37.060 --> 05:38.740
but almost ten folks

05:38.740 --> 05:40.740
within the span of a week

05:40.740 --> 05:44.340
Well, a few of the townsfolk are getting a little worrisome

05:45.020 --> 05:50.300
Not that I blame them. So we're hosting a town hall meeting today here at the church

05:50.300 --> 05:57.940
So anyone with information can talk open and we can have a vote on the best course of action moving forward now

05:57.940 --> 06:02.380
I got a dust before this place is full, but we'll see you real soon. Yeah

06:07.860 --> 06:12.620
Welcome to contention in the 1880s. It's the Old West boys

06:15.460 --> 06:17.460
Giddy up

06:20.260 --> 06:25.020
Giddy up in what in tarnation everybody's saying yeehaw, but not asking hi

06:31.300 --> 06:36.380
But I love it well, hey Luke, how are you I'm doing real good

06:37.380 --> 06:39.380
Cool mess

06:40.020 --> 06:45.900
No, I've never been but it's gonna it'll come out. Yeah, that's same. Oh good. You guys didn't practice

06:45.900 --> 06:51.060
We're on we're on for I practiced. I yelled in the shower at myself

06:51.380 --> 06:57.200
And then I just assumed mine would come out when it started. So yeah same but it's always worked for all of us before

06:58.460 --> 07:04.180
Like to let the voice find me generic southern accents have taken us this far as X. Yeah

07:04.180 --> 07:06.180
Yeah

07:06.620 --> 07:10.460
I'm doubling down on it tonight. That's that's my my only inspiration

07:11.460 --> 07:17.860
The Old West scenario, I'm gonna be method acting so we're gonna have to find a way to record without audacity or laptops or anything

07:20.320 --> 07:23.800
You just need to get Luke some some like mule blinders

07:25.660 --> 07:33.020
Close my eyes all time. I'm down boy. Calm down now. Stay focused. Just talk straight forward. Don't look now. Oh, he saw a computer

07:34.820 --> 07:40.460
Hail is that he's going wild as hell y'all for whole sanity roll sanity. Why is that picture so bright?

07:42.580 --> 07:45.460
That's what horses do right? Yeah

07:49.260 --> 07:56.200
Invented when were donkeys invented Mountain Dew Mountain Dew but what sound donkeys make whilst they drink a do

07:56.200 --> 08:02.780
It might have been around in the 1880s. It's one of the older ones. Let's see Mountain Dew was introduced in 1940

08:02.780 --> 08:06.020
Yeah, but wasn't Mountain Dew a slang term for not

08:07.460 --> 08:13.780
Dude disambiguation. Yeah moonshine cuz that's why they called it that because it tastes like

08:15.140 --> 08:17.760
Everyone knows when you slug down some Mountain Dew

08:22.260 --> 08:28.060
Notes of moonshine hit you in the mountain do is not smooth at all. It's so fucking aggressive

08:28.220 --> 08:31.880
There's a song from 1882 called the rare old Mountain Dew

08:32.780 --> 08:37.220
And there's also a 2011 song called diet Mountain Dew by Lana Del Rey

08:39.740 --> 08:44.500
Sing the first one for us. Okay, let me find it. We should see if we can get the second one for the theme

08:46.880 --> 08:51.580
Hey Lana Del Rey, she's from Missouri, right? Yeah, Jad counts, right?

08:51.580 --> 08:57.060
She's from Sykes ten has Brad Brad Pitt wrote any songs that we can throw him on

08:57.500 --> 09:00.380
Local musician Brad Pitt. He's an actor

09:01.380 --> 09:06.740
Okay, I'm about to listen to the rare old Mountain Dew see what it's like no, no, no don't listen sing it

09:06.740 --> 09:08.740
Okay, let me look up the lyrics

09:09.320 --> 09:12.360
No, no, no, don't look up lyrics sing it

09:13.620 --> 09:15.620
Well, I already looked at memory

09:16.460 --> 09:19.580
I don't know. I can't do it

09:21.260 --> 09:23.260
Have you seen my Mountain Dew

09:24.660 --> 09:26.660
It's rare

09:27.660 --> 09:29.660
Real bad real bad

09:31.900 --> 09:38.080
It's rare you gotta put more well you're never that is damn good keep going. I don't know the rest of the lyrics

09:38.080 --> 09:44.780
That's the only ones. Oh, well, the chorus would be easy to sing. Hi. Di diddly diddle arm diddly doodle

09:44.780 --> 09:49.900
I don't um diddly do ride diddle of my day. Did you look at him? Yeah

09:50.620 --> 09:56.820
For it fills the air with a perfume rare and betwixt both me and you as home

09:56.820 --> 10:02.220
We stroll we can take a bowl or a bucket of the Mountain Dew

10:03.460 --> 10:05.460
Mountain

10:09.960 --> 10:16.160
Bring me my spits bucket. I wanted to taste the Mountain Dew fresh. Oh, that's Justin talking right now

10:16.160 --> 10:18.160
Oh

10:21.120 --> 10:23.120
Yeah, Thomas

10:23.800 --> 10:28.900
It's very Irish sounding the song. Oh, I thought you were talking about Justin. I was like, he's not

10:33.360 --> 10:36.600
Well, he did hatch from a space egg

10:40.520 --> 10:42.520
You guys found me outside

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
The

10:50.120 --> 10:54.920
Remember that is because we have the VHS tape that was sent to us of us finding him

10:56.120 --> 11:03.600
Since it's like a planted memory. Yeah, but thankfully that tape included a great montage of the four of us raising him

11:05.080 --> 11:07.480
So even if we didn't have the memories

11:07.480 --> 11:12.360
It's kind of like we got to see what it was like and let me tell you there was a lot of love

11:12.360 --> 11:18.760
I remember when you guys when Zach got a big green egg to smoke meat in and I just tried to climb on in that

11:18.760 --> 11:20.760
Bad boy. Oh my god

11:21.240 --> 11:23.240
Got so singed

11:29.120 --> 11:33.520
That was sex nickname for for Justin hams

11:35.620 --> 11:42.280
Hamilton has just come out. Of course, right? Yeah, it's a good year for ham related content

11:42.360 --> 11:44.360
and

11:44.880 --> 11:47.400
Justin just wouldn't stop with this political rap

11:49.920 --> 11:51.920
He also made us go see

11:52.640 --> 11:54.640
Shit, what's that pig called?

11:54.920 --> 11:56.120
babe

11:56.120 --> 11:58.120
No the cartoon

11:58.400 --> 12:00.400
Peppa Peppa Pig. Yeah

12:00.960 --> 12:02.960
It would have been better if I could remember

12:03.760 --> 12:06.960
I was gonna say a pig but it's that's Looney Tunes

12:07.880 --> 12:09.880
indeed

12:09.880 --> 12:15.720
Looney Tunes indeed. Did you ever bartend a Peppa Pig show? No, I didn't

12:15.720 --> 12:21.000
Yeah, I made the mistake of doing that once I always signed up for the ones that I thought were country singers

12:21.000 --> 12:28.240
But then one dude's name sounded so much like a country singer and it turned out to be a Christian magician

12:30.880 --> 12:32.880
So I made no money

12:32.880 --> 12:38.000
Did he try to give you was he like here's your tip and when you reach for it, he like made it disappear and you're like

12:40.560 --> 12:42.560
Along with my face

12:43.280 --> 12:49.720
It was like Peppa Pig I guess did some kind of tour like a live music thing was like a hologram

12:50.120 --> 12:52.120
No, it was like people

12:54.280 --> 12:56.520
Peppa Pig dying brutally

12:56.640 --> 13:03.580
Anyway, it was like mostly candy and popcorn sales and then like the same seven dads getting really drunk

13:07.040 --> 13:09.240
Tips were not great except from those guys

13:10.120 --> 13:13.760
Christian magician was just a lot of homeschool jokes. All right

13:16.600 --> 13:20.040
All right, everybody get off the fucking call except Joe do we just leave

13:21.040 --> 13:23.840
Just go ahead and leave and I'll text you one at a time

13:24.360 --> 13:29.360
Okay, just go ahead and just go and leave. He's next. I'll send text. It'll go

13:30.240 --> 13:35.600
Joe and then it'll be Justin and then it'll be

13:36.120 --> 13:39.000
Thomas and then it'll be Luke cool. I can play a game

13:40.000 --> 13:43.320
Just text me. Bye. Bye. Okey-dokey. Joe. I'm gonna go pee real quick

13:44.360 --> 13:51.560
Alrighty, Joe. I don't have my headphones on but I had no idea you're so fucking humongous. You're a monster

13:53.160 --> 13:57.400
Wait, sorry, it's Luke. It's humongous. Not you. Oh, that's what you're referring to

13:57.400 --> 14:02.520
I thought you were talking about like me positioned in my camera or something. No, I was talking I was reading the characters

14:02.520 --> 14:07.800
He is he's a bit. I thought I was reading yours, but it looks for the audience and he's a monster man

14:09.880 --> 14:11.880
Zach don't put this in

14:25.480 --> 14:27.320
Joe Terry

14:27.320 --> 14:32.280
Tell me what you know, what time counter is your audacity yet?

14:32.280 --> 14:37.040
My time counter on audacity is at 19 minutes and almost 30 seconds cool

14:37.640 --> 14:44.520
Have any missing time no missing time the missing time like we had when we found

14:44.840 --> 14:46.840
Justin's egg pod. I

14:48.760 --> 14:51.080
Do miss when he was suckle at my teat I

14:55.640 --> 15:01.640
Just pictured it I'm like looking at him on the chat and he doesn't know we're talking about it. It's just like

15:04.400 --> 15:06.400
Picturing him all up on that nip and

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
Oh

15:09.800 --> 15:12.280
Well, we can play hard right yeah

15:14.000 --> 15:20.200
Did that make sense did you understand what I meant nope Edie didn't exist in the 1880s, let's get going

15:20.520 --> 15:22.720
your character's name is

15:23.880 --> 15:31.340
Everett Pace, I've asked you to give me a rundown of who your character is and you wrote something so beautiful. Thank you

15:31.340 --> 15:33.240
I was I was

15:33.240 --> 15:38.580
Taken by surprise you asked you we have a group chat and you asked for us to present a day in the life of a

15:38.580 --> 15:44.300
Character and Luke was actually the first one to present one and it was the best written thing. I'd read in a long time

15:44.960 --> 15:47.380
It made me think oh shit. I gotta write something now

15:47.380 --> 15:50.160
I actually he sent it to me, you know

15:50.160 --> 15:57.220
Like a private message and I was like you have to send this to the group so that they know what they're up against

15:57.560 --> 16:01.960
Yeah, I did not meet the challenge, but I did write a good couple paragraphs

16:02.000 --> 16:06.980
Oh, I absolutely love what you've written and let's dive into it. Yeah, okay

16:07.080 --> 16:10.900
So no one knows how long Everett Pace has been in that old

16:11.340 --> 16:15.240
Low slung sod house on the bald spot of the hill just outside of town

16:15.600 --> 16:18.360
He's just always been up there old Everett folks

16:18.360 --> 16:22.820
don't see him too often in town except for the few times he wanders in to restock his coffee and

16:23.120 --> 16:28.920
Ammo supply and once or twice a year when he ventures to the saloon for a drink as though he's celebrating something

16:29.200 --> 16:30.840
No one ever bothers him though

16:30.840 --> 16:38.140
He just looks off an unruly mess of long gray beard and an attempt at a greasy comb over on top

16:38.400 --> 16:43.700
He's got a sickly dirty complexion and walks with an uneasy slightly hunched shuffle

16:44.000 --> 16:49.960
But his eyes are bright and wild and fiery and only add to how off-putting his whole presence can be

16:50.360 --> 16:53.500
The town folk do catch glimpses of him up on the hill though

16:54.100 --> 16:56.660
He's often tending to a sprawling garden

16:57.180 --> 16:59.180
Butchering the day's hunt or chopping wood

16:59.580 --> 17:03.980
he looks so old and frail but each pull of the hoe a cleave of the cleaver a

17:04.180 --> 17:08.540
Swing of the axe reveals muscles that have been at least tuned to the work for ages

17:09.540 --> 17:15.060
Mothers in town use Everett as a boogeyman telling their children if they wander too far at night

17:15.060 --> 17:21.980
He might snatch them and can them up like the radishes and Brussels sprouts in his cellar and the kids believe it because they can't

17:21.980 --> 17:23.980
tell when or if

17:24.260 --> 17:25.980
Everett sleeps a

17:25.980 --> 17:32.260
flicker of a lantern in the wee hours of the night and the occasional but sudden crack of a rifle being fired off towards something

17:32.420 --> 17:36.400
Unseen and unheard makes the kids pull the covers up extra tight at night

17:36.400 --> 17:42.200
And so while these kids are pulling their covers right above their chins up over their noses

17:42.200 --> 17:44.900
Like you're supposed to wear your fucking masks

17:45.980 --> 17:47.980
Sorry

17:50.020 --> 17:52.020
So many under the nose

17:52.700 --> 17:57.580
Just right over the nose they're holding their their sheets tight and

17:58.460 --> 18:00.500
They're thinking about Everett

18:01.020 --> 18:08.060
Who is what is he doing at night when he's got his lantern out? Does he have his rifle?

18:08.660 --> 18:13.380
With him like what? What is he what is he doing? Is he out on his property? Is he inside the house?

18:13.700 --> 18:18.700
Can they see the lantern just bobbing along the lantern flickers from within the house?

18:18.700 --> 18:23.380
I mean that's what the kids are definitely questioning if you want the answer

18:23.380 --> 18:28.060
It's that he's uh, he's he's lived his life on this land protecting it as his own

18:28.540 --> 18:31.980
it's it's his his parcel in this world and

18:32.700 --> 18:34.100
He he guards it

18:34.100 --> 18:39.260
he he'll uh, he'll stay awake at night to make sure the crops don't get to and he'll he'll shoot a wolf if he sees

18:39.260 --> 18:41.260
one coming up or a

18:41.540 --> 18:43.780
Raccoon or any sort of thing that

18:44.540 --> 18:47.500
Threatens his and it's exactly on one of these nights

18:48.140 --> 18:50.140
Everett hears a

18:50.420 --> 18:55.500
Grumbling in the distance and it's on his land and Everett

18:56.020 --> 19:02.180
Everett knows exactly what direction it's in. It's not it's not where the animals are. It's not where his garden is

19:02.620 --> 19:08.000
Ever doesn't have animals just for the record. Oh, sorry. No animals you kill you kill by the day

19:08.100 --> 19:09.380
He lives off the land

19:09.380 --> 19:12.200
So he's he's doing a lot of his own gardening and stuff

19:12.200 --> 19:18.780
But he hunts at when he can and then just like keeps the meat until he's like needs to go back out and restock up

19:18.900 --> 19:21.380
Yep, damn, that's fucking cool. We're

19:22.020 --> 19:23.820
different now as

19:23.820 --> 19:25.820
humans

19:27.900 --> 19:33.140
So I'm hearing a low rumbling somewhere and you hear scratching and you hear earth

19:33.940 --> 19:40.100
Moving and you know that it is coming from the direction of a spot in the ground

19:40.740 --> 19:44.500
Where there is a cross made out of sticks

19:45.300 --> 19:50.620
Planted what is that spot Everett? Well, that's where that's where I'm up

19:51.460 --> 19:54.260
That's where that's where Claire is buried. That's what

19:55.500 --> 19:57.580
Why would there be a sound over there?

19:58.540 --> 20:02.900
He's you know, maybe shuffle over there a little bit and in the darkness

20:03.780 --> 20:05.740
your old eyes

20:05.740 --> 20:10.940
Do you have anything that would let you like? Yeah, I've got a decent spot hidden

20:11.340 --> 20:17.060
I've got a decent listen either one of those. I'll do my spot hidden. I mean I say decent it's 45

20:17.060 --> 20:19.600
Did I mention in my description that my guy is an old man? Oh

20:20.120 --> 20:26.900
No, I don't think you did. He's 65 or 68 years old and he's kind of frail in general

20:27.580 --> 20:29.580
I

20:29.620 --> 20:32.660
Thought there's a chance for a birthday at some point in this

20:39.020 --> 20:44.220
Okay, I'm doing spot hidden at a 45 and I pass 20 you can't

20:45.180 --> 20:48.140
I'm not sure you can go ahead and roll sanity

20:51.260 --> 20:57.140
That's also a cool character quirk of this guy he's already kind of weird in life people already assume that he's weird

20:57.220 --> 21:01.660
He thinks of himself as kind of a loner and a weirdo. He's kind of open to weird shit

21:01.660 --> 21:05.660
So he's got the highest sanity of a character. I've ever played at 80

21:06.380 --> 21:08.380
80. Oh, yeah

21:09.700 --> 21:14.500
And I pass a 26 well your eyes don't lie, you know what you see

21:15.020 --> 21:20.180
You see Miss Kitty one of the saloon workers who had gone missing

21:20.620 --> 21:24.740
He'd gone missing about a week ago. Yeah. Okay. The town is all

21:25.420 --> 21:26.300
Ah

21:26.300 --> 21:28.100
Half up in arms about it

21:28.100 --> 21:32.260
Some of them don't give a shit because it's a lot of the ruffians that have gone missing

21:32.260 --> 21:35.460
but there were a fair amount of disappearances to the point to where people are

21:36.180 --> 21:38.220
Starting to kind of maybe get concerned

21:38.860 --> 21:39.980
concerned

21:39.980 --> 21:41.740
concerned

21:41.740 --> 21:47.740
The sound is actually another degree higher. So that's exactly exactly because now they know that it more of

21:47.740 --> 21:49.740
them

21:53.100 --> 21:57.860
Miss Kitty is digging with her hands into the grave

21:58.380 --> 22:02.540
Miss Kitty, what are you? What are you doing? Miss Kitty get up. How far off is this?

22:02.540 --> 22:08.460
And where are you in your house? I'm curious. He was probably standing at his doorstep when he heard the sounds. Mm-hmm

22:08.460 --> 22:13.060
So the grave is I would I pictured it. It's like I said, he's on a bald spot

22:13.060 --> 22:18.500
I would picture it near the tree lines. So maybe like 20 yards like he's got a good plot up there

22:18.500 --> 22:24.140
Sure, so maybe 20 yards away up by the tree line. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and roll listen for me as you haul her out

22:28.820 --> 22:36.860
Fuck I fail a 47 on a 40. There's some sort of murmuring happening underneath the breath of Miss Kitty

22:37.140 --> 22:39.140
just kind of like

22:39.140 --> 22:41.140
I

22:42.660 --> 22:44.340
Keep approaching

22:44.340 --> 22:48.020
Miss Kitty, they're looking for you in town in there. Where are you being?

22:48.740 --> 22:53.580
Get out of there. You don't need to be digging around in there. She hears you coming looks up wide-eyed

22:54.300 --> 23:01.940
Looks down and then she's just gonna run away away ever. It's fine with that. That was just a yeah, it's weird

23:02.420 --> 23:06.060
Miss Kenny come back there. Look they're looking for you in town. Where are you?

23:06.980 --> 23:12.740
Miss Kenny and as ever it goes back into his home. Does he wrap up? Does he sleep?

23:12.740 --> 23:13.180
No

23:13.180 --> 23:14.740
So this is based on a real thing

23:14.740 --> 23:16.380
I read that they think that

23:16.380 --> 23:22.900
Back in the day of a person's sleep cycle was much more of a farming cycle that they would take like a lot of naps

23:22.980 --> 23:24.980
But be awake for a lot of the night

23:25.300 --> 23:32.320
Because they had to protect their areas. So he's he's a he's awake a lot of the night. I love it

23:32.320 --> 23:35.820
I love it. Yeah, I love you. I love you too that

23:36.380 --> 23:39.340
I'm getting in the car baby. I'm getting in the car. I'm coming over there

23:40.860 --> 23:42.860
Wear your fucking mask

23:43.980 --> 23:45.980
For the beginning

23:55.900 --> 24:02.860
Justin is my friend and he's got headphones on and he's on the podcast and I'm very happy

24:02.860 --> 24:06.140
What the fuck just happened?

24:08.460 --> 24:10.460
Welcome to Pretending To Be People

24:11.020 --> 24:13.020
What kind of show is this?

24:15.540 --> 24:18.300
This is the show where we talk to each other

24:19.220 --> 24:25.740
But not as each other because even in our friendships we rarely talk about things that matter

24:26.100 --> 24:30.700
It's always bullshit. So we may as well have a podcast where we're completely different people

24:30.700 --> 24:34.140
I've never known the true Zach. So why I'd start getting to know him now

24:38.460 --> 24:43.020
Please don't what's your character's name? You won't love me if you know me

24:44.460 --> 24:48.720
Old Zach, you don't want no one to know him real good

24:50.100 --> 24:52.100
Get get a heart hurt again

24:52.100 --> 24:54.100
Oh

24:56.980 --> 25:04.540
My character's name is Jack Perlman. Oh, yeah, that's a sexy name. I know right it kind of sounds like a porn name

25:06.140 --> 25:08.620
Absolutely sounds like a porn name just like

25:09.200 --> 25:15.520
Ron Perlman. Oh, is that who you've based his character off of? No, just the name Ron Perlman's great

25:15.560 --> 25:21.800
He's great fan. My man isn't a lumbering giant with a bellowing voice like Ron Perlman

25:22.200 --> 25:24.200
documentary he was in

25:24.300 --> 25:25.920
Hellboy

25:25.920 --> 25:32.040
And then the second documentary Hellboy 2 and then the comic based on the documentary. I

25:33.200 --> 25:40.400
Love it when people make comics based on documentaries. I can't wait for that March of the Penguins graphic novel to come out fine

25:41.920 --> 25:49.020
I've been reading some non-stop. Oh, yeah. I heard the I heard the Watchmen guys doing the March of the Penguins. So

25:52.400 --> 25:58.120
So I asked you all to write a thing about your character

25:58.640 --> 26:02.880
Day in the life if you a quick description day in the life kind of situation. Yes

26:03.760 --> 26:05.760
Tell me about

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Jack Perlman

26:09.880 --> 26:15.720
Jack every time every time the name Jack Perlman has said I'm gonna edit in those two noise

26:15.720 --> 26:18.440
Yeah, that's both at the same time. Like yeah combined

26:18.760 --> 26:21.280
So we same time it same time it like we always

26:23.000 --> 26:28.920
Okay, yeah, oh I thought we were gonna be truthful with oh, yeah, it's we're working on we're trying to get in sync

26:29.320 --> 26:34.260
It's hard. Oh god. Okay. Yeah, Jack Perlman. He's a

26:34.880 --> 26:38.560
He's just hit his 40s graying ever so slightly

26:39.200 --> 26:44.520
Dark tan skin from manual labor. He's a he's a rancher

26:44.880 --> 26:48.920
But unlike a lot of other ranchers he tends to do a lot of stuff by himself

26:49.680 --> 26:51.680
He hasn't really found

26:52.240 --> 26:56.080
Help that he would consider up to his his standards

26:56.880 --> 27:04.160
Basically runs the whole shindig himself. He wakes up quite early in the morning probably 4 or 5 a.m. At the crack of dawn

27:04.600 --> 27:10.480
Mm-hmm feeds his two dogs Chuck and Bob who are scruffy mutts that he took in

27:10.840 --> 27:13.680
Makes a strong pot of coffee and a big ol

27:14.560 --> 27:17.220
Biscuit breakfast to start his day off, right?

27:17.960 --> 27:22.000
He mainly raises and trains horses, which he which he loves dearly

27:22.720 --> 27:30.680
Few cows here and there and some goats just for the extra cash, but he really loves the the majesty of a big ol horse

27:34.560 --> 27:39.640
He often a lot of the day is like, you know maintaining raising them

27:40.200 --> 27:42.040
Checking him out making sure their health's good

27:42.040 --> 27:47.800
He patrols the area for any trouble cuz I assume he has like a big swath of land that he has to you know

27:47.800 --> 27:49.480
mend fences

27:49.480 --> 27:52.920
Wrangle a lot of mending a lot of wrangle in a lot of mending

27:53.600 --> 27:59.000
But at the end of the day, he either goes to the bar to grab a drink or seven

27:59.640 --> 28:01.640
having an excellent time or

28:02.880 --> 28:09.040
Alternatively, he stays completely home with a book sitting on his porch with his dogs

28:09.680 --> 28:11.680
only lit by the light of the lantern and

28:12.000 --> 28:15.640
The the glow that reflects off a bottle of whiskey

28:15.640 --> 28:22.760
So let's cut to a scene about a week ago on one of the nights where you ended up at the saloon to have

28:23.640 --> 28:25.880
one or two or

28:26.560 --> 28:28.400
seven

28:28.400 --> 28:32.800
It's hard to keep track after roll a d10. Let's see how many drinks you've had at this point. Oh

28:32.800 --> 28:34.280
Oh

28:34.280 --> 28:36.880
Where the fuck did I put my dad up Justin?

28:37.520 --> 28:44.560
Justin you amateur we're playing a role-playing game Justin the role stands for you roll the dice

28:48.920 --> 28:50.920
Can you talk about voice from now on

28:50.920 --> 28:52.920
I

28:55.720 --> 28:57.720
Can't stop smiling

28:59.920 --> 29:02.520
Help me Justin has me trapped here

29:04.760 --> 29:11.720
Boom d10 five drinks in five drinks in a good number. That's a fair amount of drinks now

29:12.440 --> 29:16.200
Just say now roll a d4 for how many hours it's been

29:17.200 --> 29:24.520
Three hours, that's actually not bad. That's not bad at all. I'm averaging about two per hour. Yeah, that's a that's a fun night

29:24.520 --> 29:26.520
Yeah, that's that's his preferred

29:27.040 --> 29:31.680
Jack's preferred is to do that, but it doesn't always go down like that

29:31.960 --> 29:38.660
Sometimes people bet you like, you know that you can't do ten shots in a row and you really need four dollars

29:40.120 --> 29:43.960
Hey, man, it's 1880 something four dollars

29:43.960 --> 29:48.720
Four dollars is mad money. I don't know. I don't know the conversion

29:48.720 --> 29:50.440
I should I bet it's real good

29:50.440 --> 29:54.960
I played Red Dead Redemption and it seemed like four dollars was a lot of money

29:55.040 --> 30:00.720
some of the guns on here were like nine dollars, so I'm gonna say four dollars here is a

30:02.000 --> 30:06.800
105 100 bucks. That's I'd yeah, would you do ten shots for a hundred bucks? No

30:09.160 --> 30:13.280
Not now, yeah, yeah cuz I know I just get extremely sick

30:13.960 --> 30:19.880
How many hours do I know one of waste $100 for a day gone like a whole day?

30:19.880 --> 30:23.520
I would be useless maybe even two these days

30:23.520 --> 30:27.920
I can't keep up when I was a young man ten shots

30:28.120 --> 30:31.680
Did you mean when we a hundred dollars when we first met each other?

30:32.440 --> 30:34.440
Four years ago. Yeah

30:35.920 --> 30:36.960
Child

30:36.960 --> 30:43.520
Four years ago. Let's dive in here. Yeah, you're kind of leaning up against the piano

30:44.040 --> 30:49.880
in the saloon and the piano player is not playing right now cuz no one's paid him is that he's a jukebox and

30:50.520 --> 30:54.880
He needs to get money in order to play song. So it's dead silent right now

30:54.880 --> 31:01.280
So he's just talking to one of the gamblers who's around here and he's like, oh, yeah, no, I swear to God bad

31:01.280 --> 31:06.960
It's a girl teenage girl walking around the new mine over there at night

31:07.040 --> 31:13.080
Not a chance married be happy about that and the other guy's like no shit

31:13.480 --> 31:17.000
You saw a teenage girl over there at that new mine

31:17.000 --> 31:22.120
I don't think Silas had to have the balls do something like that and the other piano players like

31:24.600 --> 31:29.920
He owns this town and do whatever he wants if he wants to have a new girl ever done the walk

31:29.920 --> 31:32.120
That's right. What's random and

31:32.800 --> 31:40.040
The guy's like I just don't see it happening that Mary Cole is a stand-up woman a good

31:40.200 --> 31:45.160
Smart head on top of them their shoulders that she's got nice broad strong

31:45.160 --> 31:51.200
like could easily take a man like Silas cause she truly wanted to and there's no reason she

31:51.680 --> 31:55.320
would want to deal with that kind of nonsense in his

31:56.320 --> 31:58.480
Blessed life praise be Lord

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
Does Jack join in the conversation at all

32:07.720 --> 32:15.080
Jack's not a big fan of gossip of any kind gosh just slinging on and there's here but he does he does like listening

32:15.080 --> 32:16.320
He just doesn't like

32:16.320 --> 32:20.640
Participating so he's kind of he's keeping an ear on because he wants to know what's going on in the town

32:20.640 --> 32:27.560
But he also so cutting back to this night. You've got your option here. Are you out at the bar again?

32:28.080 --> 32:35.360
This is about a week later, or are you hanging out on the porch with your dogs lantern and bottle of whiskey a week later

32:35.400 --> 32:40.840
What's the what's the weather like this? Oh, it's a buggy muggy motherfucker. I

32:43.360 --> 32:50.420
Think he just goes to the bar if if the weather's not like nicer sitting outside then he'll head to the bar

32:50.680 --> 32:55.000
There's a nice cool breeze. He'll take it outside and kind of chill but you know, you know how

32:55.840 --> 32:57.840
Ranchers in the Old West love to chill

32:58.320 --> 33:01.040
Take it mad easy. Keep it mad posse

33:02.480 --> 33:04.480
It's the Old West bro

33:05.800 --> 33:10.720
Yeah, I heard that they they they had a net that they would have to keep the bugs out

33:10.720 --> 33:14.320
There was on a stick and they were just you know

33:15.340 --> 33:17.340
Net stick and chill

33:17.720 --> 33:19.720
Oh my god

33:21.240 --> 33:23.240
That was a bad one

33:24.240 --> 33:29.460
But I appreciate it cuz you put a lot of thought into it I put a little thought into it

33:29.460 --> 33:31.920
So as you're coming home from the bar

33:31.920 --> 33:37.000
What do you ride I think just like a good old strong

33:37.000 --> 33:41.960
I can't remember the differences between the horses. I used to actually kind of know from old red dead

33:41.960 --> 33:47.160
But it's like it's like one of those like it's a larger than average like strong

33:47.600 --> 33:53.520
Horse a good like worker horse. That's like my I don't care about that. What's its name? Oh, what's its name?

33:54.840 --> 34:01.320
No, I do care. But also what's its name Jeremiah? Oh, yeah, so you're riding Jeremiah back and you hear a

34:02.920 --> 34:04.920
Oh

34:07.520 --> 34:11.440
Coming from the field that you own and you know

34:12.240 --> 34:16.840
It's the right here attempted a horse. It's the crying of a horse

34:22.880 --> 34:24.880
I don't know what they sound like

34:25.960 --> 34:29.320
Was that a sound of a horse or is that yeah, you're you're okay

34:29.320 --> 34:31.840
You know, I didn't know there's an old man dying

34:40.360 --> 34:43.320
All right, so you hear this as you're approaching your home

34:43.320 --> 34:49.480
What do you do I kick up the speed swords the source of the noise roll alertness for me?

34:49.480 --> 34:56.560
Oh, is there alertness in this game? Fuck we're playing down darker trails, which is the Old West

34:57.200 --> 35:02.560
Setting for Call of Cthulhu and spot hidden baby old spot hidden, okay

35:06.640 --> 35:08.640
Well, I rolled a 10

35:09.020 --> 35:13.240
That'll probably be 16. Yeah. I was like I rolled a dick. Why was I doing?

35:14.360 --> 35:16.360
amateur hour over here

35:16.400 --> 35:19.040
Welcome to the show Justin get your shit together

35:19.680 --> 35:23.520
You roll a 16 on spot hidden and as you're approaching

35:23.840 --> 35:28.960
You're riding toward the noise and looking off into the distance. You see a thin

35:29.680 --> 35:30.920
silhouette

35:30.920 --> 35:32.400
dipping off

35:32.400 --> 35:34.400
fast into the distance

35:35.120 --> 35:41.360
40 50 yards away from this horse that is still 20 to 30 yards away from you

35:41.360 --> 35:43.360
So almost a football field away

35:43.480 --> 35:49.240
You see this this very slight figure that is just

35:50.080 --> 35:56.400
Running and with that roll. You can see it's a humanoid but it's running like

35:57.240 --> 36:03.900
Like a wild animal and you said it's like a football field away almost. Yeah. Hey, what'd you do to my horse?

36:05.440 --> 36:08.720
Stop it will not stop it only continues

36:08.720 --> 36:12.040
Is it cooking at a speed that I could catch up with it on horseback

36:12.440 --> 36:18.240
Or is it so far away that it's like scurrying into the the wild it's heading into the wild at this point

36:18.240 --> 36:21.560
But you could chase it through the wild if you could track it

36:21.920 --> 36:28.040
Yeah, I don't feel comfortable doing that. I'm gonna go to where the horses are. I can kill you tonight if that's what yeah

36:28.040 --> 36:32.640
I'm good. I don't have tracking and it's the night and there's a ghoulish

36:33.240 --> 36:35.240
ghoul of some kind

36:35.400 --> 36:42.640
No, but I'll go to the horse to go ahead and roll sanity for how fast this it's like it's inhumanely

36:43.040 --> 36:45.040
exactly unhumanly fast

36:45.520 --> 36:47.960
Well, I need to roll two dice, please

36:51.240 --> 36:55.360
That's that's a 98 baby that's not gonna pass there does it though

36:56.480 --> 36:58.480
No, I got no

36:58.500 --> 37:02.080
Lose one sanity as you realize

37:03.040 --> 37:08.440
There's something in contention that is not human and you look up at the stars

37:08.800 --> 37:12.280
and it's a clear night sky and as you're kind of like

37:14.840 --> 37:16.840
Toward this

37:17.640 --> 37:19.640
Old man or sound

37:21.120 --> 37:22.800
You know

37:22.800 --> 37:27.120
The world isn't what you thought it might have been if something like that

37:28.040 --> 37:34.720
Exists here and when you make it up to your horse, I need you to roll another sanity check because I'm surprised at how

37:35.320 --> 37:37.320
injured it is

37:38.840 --> 37:40.840
40 I pass whatever this thing was

37:41.480 --> 37:45.160
It clearly was here for meat

37:45.840 --> 37:49.600
It knew exactly where to shred the skin of

37:50.160 --> 37:55.640
This horse to pull out the most muscle the quickest and there are

37:56.040 --> 38:03.120
Just holes on the haunches and in the shoulders of this horse that is on the ground

38:03.120 --> 38:06.720
You can kind of see through where its chest is

38:07.660 --> 38:14.880
The muscle is completely missing and you can just see it's that the top rib on its left side

38:14.960 --> 38:16.960
Where it's laying on its right?

38:19.600 --> 38:21.600
I

38:25.000 --> 38:31.040
Gently hop off my horse my damn dandelion. No, I

38:34.480 --> 38:37.240
Walk up to it with my revolver and

38:37.920 --> 38:40.140
I cock it and I look at it

38:40.680 --> 38:47.280
I'm sorry, I couldn't be here for you when you needed me and with that I put dandelion out of its misery

38:49.800 --> 38:51.800
Jack looks away

38:52.300 --> 38:55.640
Sheathing or whatever he caught putting his gun back in his holster

38:56.160 --> 39:02.480
wipes a couple tears away from his face and gets back on his horse to make the rounds to make sure

39:02.840 --> 39:04.840
Everybody else is safe

39:04.840 --> 39:06.840
I

39:16.960 --> 39:22.880
Tell us Cox, what are your thoughts about the situation now? I can hear I said Thomas Cox

39:23.520 --> 39:26.840
What are your thoughts about the situation at hand?

39:27.640 --> 39:31.960
I don't know a whole lot about it Zack. It's the Old West

39:32.560 --> 39:38.760
That I like that tell me about your character people are missing and that that won't stand

39:41.920 --> 39:45.840
That's the thing we're gonna try to get to the bottom of here I bet it'll work out for us

39:45.840 --> 39:52.160
I bet it will too. I've set this whole thing up to where you guys can look at Justin. I see meditating

39:52.160 --> 39:57.200
That's what I thought too, but we're gonna look like assholes when we're talking about this on the podcast and he's just dead

39:57.860 --> 39:59.860
There he goes

40:00.220 --> 40:02.220
He moved

40:03.060 --> 40:05.060
Thank God

40:06.300 --> 40:08.500
Yeah, so hey I'm playing

40:11.740 --> 40:14.860
Hold on I realized I never googled my character's name I

40:15.580 --> 40:18.100
Did anybody terrible? Nope?

40:18.100 --> 40:23.660
Okay, the guy who came up with the the he's the doctor who came up with the like air pathway

40:24.300 --> 40:29.260
Thing where you shove a pin in somebody's throat and EpiPen or a trachea

40:29.980 --> 40:36.780
Trachea and it's not spelled the same way. I immediately thought Horace Grant Oh Horace

40:37.580 --> 40:45.820
Green oh shit is the school from rock. Okay. Well, I am I'm playing a professor Horace Green and he is a

40:47.620 --> 40:49.620
Naturalist a paleontologist

40:50.500 --> 40:57.420
He searches for ancient creatures from the past and they're fossils and and and they're remnants

40:57.940 --> 41:01.540
Sick, does he just put bones together and call it what he thinks it is

41:02.580 --> 41:04.580
some some

41:05.020 --> 41:09.380
Huxters in his like profession do that, but he is a trained naturalist

41:09.380 --> 41:17.300
he he's at the cutting edge of modern of modern theory when it comes to paleo biology and he

41:17.300 --> 41:23.140
I don't know if that's a word back then but that's that's what he does man. That's what he lives and breathes

41:23.140 --> 41:29.780
It's a word now. Mm-hmm. I'm not in character yet, so I can say it's not exactly I'm just trying to I'm just trying to

41:29.780 --> 41:35.380
Clean it exactly who can say that before he was terribly killed by whatever

41:35.680 --> 41:40.860
Delta green monsters Zach has in store for us that professor Horace Horace Green

41:41.580 --> 41:47.300
Does not did not coin the term paleo biology and I asked you to write me a

41:47.980 --> 41:50.140
Like a day not just for me

41:50.180 --> 41:54.860
but also for you to get to learn about your character even more through the

41:55.340 --> 42:02.500
Practice of writing this was actually helpful and also for the listeners to get to know your character even more

42:02.500 --> 42:07.460
I was telling Joe earlier. This is the best decision we've ever made for

42:08.460 --> 42:12.980
For writing new character direction, yeah instead of just doing it

42:14.700 --> 42:21.180
Exactly, I really dig it. So yeah any give me what you got any DMS or GMs listening. This is a really good

42:21.660 --> 42:27.340
This is a cool mechanic before you run a game that being said I didn't know it would be read publicly

42:27.340 --> 42:33.180
So I will have to self-edit and clean this up as I go along because I sent Zach just a filthy

42:33.780 --> 42:36.620
Version so it was mostly pictures crude

42:37.580 --> 42:43.620
Crude scribblings really I was like wow. I know exactly who this character is

42:44.100 --> 42:46.780
Professor Horace Green leaves his bed at 530

42:46.900 --> 42:50.060
Although he has generally been awake for an hour or more at this point

42:50.500 --> 42:54.920
Staring at the ceiling or the curtains or a sleeping cat easy it

42:55.460 --> 43:00.560
Observing but not quite seeing these things as he lets his jumbled rush of thoughts flow freely

43:00.920 --> 43:03.720
Until they have sorted themselves into something like order

43:04.160 --> 43:09.120
He picks his way through the stacks of books that litter his floor and heads downstairs to the parlor

43:09.320 --> 43:11.680
Where the widow Anderson is already waiting with coffee

43:12.200 --> 43:14.880
He stayed at the hotel the first few months he was in town

43:14.880 --> 43:20.520
But he found himself in frequent disagreement with that establishment over payments and acceptable level of cat excretions

43:21.260 --> 43:26.020
Returning from his shell one day. He found the hotel and employed the washer woman's daughter to clean his room

43:26.540 --> 43:32.100
He opened the door to see her rearranging his table of vertebrae and promptly fled to the washroom to weep

43:32.700 --> 43:35.340
Since then he has stayed at the widow Anderson's boarding house

43:35.580 --> 43:39.760
She rises as early as he does and enjoys stiff coffee and silence in the mornings

43:40.020 --> 43:41.780
The other boarders are young men

43:41.780 --> 43:46.740
They leave quickly in the morning to make their shifts at the mine and stay out of the saloons until late at night

43:47.300 --> 43:52.040
The widow is content to leave Horace to his vertebrae and his cat enjoys her company when he is away

43:52.440 --> 43:55.660
After drinking his coffee and reading the papers Horace heads to his shale

43:56.400 --> 43:58.440
Following the creek a short distance out of town

43:58.440 --> 44:02.600
He comes to the rocky outcropping that he hopes holds the answers to his most burning questions

44:02.960 --> 44:04.960
And so Horace begins his work

44:05.040 --> 44:09.360
He chips and digs at his shale looking for signs of the monsters who once roamed this land

44:09.720 --> 44:13.480
It has been months and he has found nothing like the vertebrae that first brought him here

44:13.640 --> 44:18.920
They plainly belonged to a mosasaurus, but he had never seen or read of any specimens so large

44:19.720 --> 44:25.400
Local children will sometimes come down after their morning chores to help the crazy old professor sift through his rocks and mud

44:25.520 --> 44:28.600
But on this day is alone by the early evening

44:28.600 --> 44:31.540
He has found no signs of his mosasaurus and returns to town

44:31.840 --> 44:36.440
Making a point to stop by the hotel restaurant to enjoy his supper before changing out of his muddy clothes

44:37.200 --> 44:42.520
He cleans himself at the boarding house and reads the evening papers with the widow while he's he had sleeps in his lap

44:42.840 --> 44:47.080
He retires to his room where he will read or respond to one of his many professional

44:47.640 --> 44:54.120
Correspondents or diagram as vertebrae hearing the young boarders returning from the saloon. He knows it is time to retire

44:54.680 --> 44:56.360
He tells easy at good night

44:56.360 --> 45:02.880
Scratches his head and turns out his lamp and as soon as it's dark you hear one of your young minor

45:03.200 --> 45:07.800
neighbors drunkenly going on about one of his ex-colleagues a

45:08.320 --> 45:13.400
Regular gambler at the saloon who is counted among those recently missing in

45:14.120 --> 45:16.120
contention I

45:16.560 --> 45:18.560
Swear God is my witness

45:19.480 --> 45:25.400
Thomas told me in confidence. He said he he said found oil down there

45:25.840 --> 45:28.500
But like it was alive

45:29.280 --> 45:32.240
Like moving and breathing in the light

45:32.880 --> 45:39.760
Last week last we all saw of him. He was arguing loudly up in mr. Cole's office

45:39.760 --> 45:44.300
And then it was it was just silent. No, I'm not saying shit to

45:45.020 --> 45:48.940
Anyone about that cuz I don't want to be the next one missing

45:49.260 --> 45:54.540
So that's why I'm not gonna die. I'm not going to that meeting. No, I'm not gonna go

45:54.540 --> 46:01.860
I'm not but that I'm not telling anyone. No, no, no, no one I wouldn't tell I I mean, yeah

46:01.860 --> 46:06.780
I might know more but I'm not telling anyone am I know I'm not

46:07.100 --> 46:12.740
Just cuz Thomas is all missing and shit cuz he's arguing with mr. Cole

46:12.940 --> 46:19.060
Hmm seems a fellow named Thomas is missing from from his normal gambling

46:20.180 --> 46:26.180
Habits and and mine working after finding a living oil and arguing with mr. Cole

46:27.020 --> 46:28.900
I'll file that away

46:28.900 --> 46:30.820
living living oil

46:30.820 --> 46:37.020
That could be something that's what dinosaurs are now dinosaurs are birds Zach. Fuck wait

46:37.100 --> 46:39.720
So does that mean dinosaurs aren't real? Yeah

46:39.720 --> 46:44.040
If birds came from dinosaurs, then why are they still dinosaurs?

46:54.680 --> 46:56.680
Luke

46:57.480 --> 47:01.160
What up, what are you learning learning like larva Joe said

47:03.880 --> 47:07.800
It's fucking nasty Joe said they're wiggling around your

47:08.480 --> 47:11.920
Character description day in the life writing assignment

47:12.280 --> 47:18.400
Was so good that it like made him feel like he had to take it up a notch when he wrote his good

47:18.400 --> 47:23.840
I'm glad yours is still the best one though. Do you want to describe your character? Yeah, my

47:25.120 --> 47:27.840
My character is Ephraim Cortland

47:28.480 --> 47:33.320
Judge Ephraim Cortland. He is a very tall large man

47:34.280 --> 47:36.480
43 years old but looks

47:37.360 --> 47:41.200
Looking at him. You don't you couldn't really tell how old he is. He's just

47:41.920 --> 47:47.740
Just a disgusting. He's a slop of a human. He's a slop. He barely takes care of himself

47:48.440 --> 47:53.720
Just soars all over him from like barely washing and not washing his clothes

47:55.040 --> 48:01.400
Always has like grease and food in his mustache and on his face. He's always sweaty

48:02.400 --> 48:05.680
Greasy hair dirty fingernails and

48:06.600 --> 48:14.820
Hands just fucking gross is his guys deal. Why is he so nasty? Well, he was a well-respected judge

48:15.600 --> 48:21.960
Fair and well respected but about six years ago his wife and his daughter died from cholera

48:22.080 --> 48:26.380
And that pretty much is a redone. Yeah, he always

48:27.160 --> 48:31.000
Boils his water before he drinks it now. Does he have taste buds?

48:31.040 --> 48:37.560
He probably not because he smokes he smoked cigars. He smokes hand-rolled cigarettes

48:37.560 --> 48:42.960
He chews tobacco. He's known to make he's known to make tea with tobacco. Oh

48:44.080 --> 48:47.400
He uses that as a chaser for his whiskey

48:47.400 --> 48:51.640
He always keeps iced fully stocked bar with really nice whiskey

48:51.640 --> 48:55.720
But he he buys nice stuff so that people don't think he's a drunk

48:56.120 --> 49:04.000
Yeah, so people think he's classy but he is a drunk drinks heavily throughout the day always has a he's got a

49:04.000 --> 49:05.520
flask on him

49:05.520 --> 49:11.240
It's a metal flask like bound with leather and on on the flask. It says

49:11.680 --> 49:13.360
to EC

49:13.360 --> 49:15.360
from our EC with love

49:15.880 --> 49:18.560
Ruth Ruth Courtland was his wife

49:19.720 --> 49:23.380
So he keeps that it's very special to him always filled with whiskey

49:23.700 --> 49:29.540
How big is it how big is the flask yeah think of like a regular flask

49:31.220 --> 49:35.820
Four times that big so it's like it can fit a hell of a lot of whiskey in it

49:35.820 --> 49:41.380
So I needed to buy a flask when I was 16 years old. Yeah, not for drinking purposes

49:41.380 --> 49:44.060
But because I was playing

49:44.580 --> 49:48.700
Taney Zuko in Grease at my high school's production, of course

49:48.700 --> 49:54.180
and I needed a flask got that lead as a sophomore baby, and so I

49:55.020 --> 50:00.740
And so I went to an antique store and I bought a flask and I thought to myself this is kind of a big flask

50:00.740 --> 50:05.460
But I didn't I didn't drink that much so you didn't really know when I was 16. It was like

50:06.020 --> 50:12.900
Stealing nips from people's parents basements and such right, but I learned later when I used that flask

50:12.900 --> 50:17.020
It held half a fifth of shit. Yeah, that's

50:17.980 --> 50:23.780
375 milliliters, I'd say that's about yeah half a fifth is what this can can hold

50:24.020 --> 50:27.780
He always has it on him his clothes that he wears since he is a judge

50:28.260 --> 50:32.500
Usually like three-piece suits and stuff, but they have not been washed or taken care of

50:32.860 --> 50:37.460
He has no intention of buying any new clothes. So they're ratty and holes and stuff in them

50:37.460 --> 50:43.400
He always make sure there's an inner pocket for his flask though. Of course. All right, read me this read me this thing, baby

50:44.400 --> 50:48.740
Judge Ephraim Courtland wakes up in his comfy puffy leather chair

50:49.000 --> 50:53.640
The greasy plate is broken on the ground beside him missing the half pound of bacon

50:53.640 --> 51:00.520
It held the night before which was eaten far too quickly by the judge and washed down with a half a bottle of expensive whiskey

51:01.640 --> 51:08.280
Ephraim wipes his face with the back of his sleeve smearing grease and bits of bacon into his salt and pepper horseshoe mustache

51:08.720 --> 51:15.060
His stomach churns out a low gurgle like the sound of that sweet black gold when it bubbles up from the earth

51:15.640 --> 51:22.120
Ephraim struggles to stand up from his chair the effects of the whiskey from the night before have not yet worn off and his weight does

51:22.120 --> 51:25.040
Not help the cause as he rises up from the chair

51:25.040 --> 51:27.600
His top hat scrapes the roof of his modest home

51:27.600 --> 51:35.660
His 43 year old bones hold him up at 6 foot 10 and carries a little over 300 pounds of booze and pork filled fat

51:36.340 --> 51:43.980
The man looks like he's falling apart as if his skin was one paper cut away from expelling the rotten insides and decaying flesh

51:44.700 --> 51:50.560
he takes his top hat off and bends over holding the makeshift barf bag expectantly in front of him a

51:50.960 --> 51:57.700
Minute passes but the only bodily fluid in the hat is sweat that is profusely dripping off the man's balding head

51:58.180 --> 52:01.420
He tosses the hat to the ground and strips down naked

52:01.660 --> 52:06.900
He boils water for a bath buying some half-cooked bacon left on the dining table from the night before

52:07.940 --> 52:14.660
Against his better judgment. He finishes the undercooked fatty pork before the flies can after breakfast

52:14.660 --> 52:17.640
He decides against a hot bath. It's much too hot already

52:17.980 --> 52:23.520
He half-heartedly washes himself in a cool bath just enough to be almost presentable for court

52:23.520 --> 52:28.620
He comes as long graying patchy hair across his head and oils up his mustache

52:29.100 --> 52:33.580
He picks up an earthy tweed three-piece suit off the floor and dresses himself

52:34.380 --> 52:36.380
Bending over to put on his socks and shoes

52:36.540 --> 52:43.760
He feels dizzy his top hat finally fulfills its purpose as he empties his guts into his felt and silk wastebasket

52:44.180 --> 52:48.540
He straightens himself up feeling much better and removes a flask from his jacket

52:48.700 --> 52:53.020
He drains the flask in one goal that fills it with a half empty bottle from the night before

52:53.420 --> 52:56.980
He takes one last swig from the bottle switches it around his mouth

52:57.380 --> 53:03.220
Gargles and spits it into the top hat he tucks his flask back into his suit jacket and heads toward the door

53:03.580 --> 53:06.540
As he walks outside, he figures it to be around noon

53:06.640 --> 53:12.260
He was due at the courthouse at 9, but he knows he will be fine as he is the only judge for miles

53:12.900 --> 53:18.920
Plus the townsfolk won't get too upset if they can't pay their fine for not hitching their horse or getting unruly at the bar

53:19.800 --> 53:23.400
Did he put his hat back on no, thank God

53:25.160 --> 53:31.360
It's like what the fuck no, does he wash out his hat? No, I just leave it just leaves it on the floor

53:31.360 --> 53:36.640
Okay, so we're gonna cut back to about a week ago. This is a few days before

53:37.240 --> 53:39.240
one of the gamblers

53:39.280 --> 53:40.760
disappeared and

53:40.760 --> 53:44.400
A couple of them got into a got a pretty unruly

53:45.080 --> 53:50.080
Unruly enough to where one of them was locked up at the courthouse and

53:51.080 --> 53:53.920
Courtland is walking through and this guy

53:55.120 --> 53:56.360
completely

53:56.360 --> 53:59.040
He's got mine face not mine

53:59.040 --> 54:04.120
Yeah, but he's kind of my main because his hands are up against the bars in front of him

54:04.120 --> 54:07.640
But there's actual bars there. So he's really good at miming, right?

54:09.600 --> 54:12.740
And he sticks his head in between two of the bars

54:13.620 --> 54:16.940
His eyes get really big and he's like, you know

54:19.540 --> 54:22.260
Mrs. Cole she ain't human

54:32.100 --> 54:34.100
Ephraim just looks at the guy and

54:34.740 --> 54:41.360
like the guys holding on to the bars of the prison cell and he just punches his fingers into the

54:41.760 --> 54:43.320
bar of the

54:43.320 --> 54:48.280
Cell and you just hear the laughter continue as this man

54:49.520 --> 54:52.520
backs away into the darkness of his cell

54:55.560 --> 55:00.840
He kind of eyes the guy and just stops for a second and then continues walking

55:01.920 --> 55:03.920
back to the day in question

55:04.440 --> 55:10.080
Ephraim still gazing up at the blaring Sun whistles a long loud note and clicks his tongue a

55:11.040 --> 55:17.200
Colossal shiny brown and white Clydesdale saunters over and looks at the judge. We're late. Hey, mister

55:17.200 --> 55:25.600
Let's go the juxtaposition of this elegant well-groomed horse and the off-putting nauseating giant of a man confuses the locals

55:26.040 --> 55:28.880
How could a man like that own that horse?

55:29.800 --> 55:34.980
Ephraim Courtland mounts the horse effortlessly his grace opposite of everything else in his life

55:35.300 --> 55:41.300
He takes off at breakneck speed on his steed kicking up an enormous dust cloud as he races towards the courthouse

55:41.740 --> 55:47.980
As he rides, there are only two things on his mind his horse and how many men he wants to hang today

55:53.060 --> 55:55.060
And when Ephraim gets to the courthouse

55:55.580 --> 56:01.820
When he walks in he goes to flip on the lights the new electrical system has made

56:02.500 --> 56:10.000
Electrical lighting possible here in the courthouse. Thanks to all Silas Cole the genius and contention and as you flip them on there's nothing

56:18.420 --> 56:22.820
What's wrong what oh oh gosh, oh no, I'm sorry mister

56:22.820 --> 56:29.540
Um, it's just that it seems to be that the the copper wiring has been stolen paralegal comes running up

56:30.060 --> 56:35.100
Yes, no, um, it seems to be that all the copper wiring has been stolen out from the courthouse

56:35.980 --> 56:40.820
Nighttime why I don't know but it might be worth it to bring it up at the meeting today

56:40.820 --> 56:44.900
How do you know who told you what is this and I grab it out of her hands?

56:45.940 --> 56:47.940
And you see that there's a letter

56:48.460 --> 56:52.900
Requesting your presence at the town hall meeting at the church to discuss

56:53.500 --> 56:58.420
Disappearances what time is the meeting? You're already late. Well, I'm

56:59.340 --> 57:01.980
As I'll be going over there and

57:02.980 --> 57:10.380
Fix the fucking lights and I walk out and get back on my horse and right over to the town hall meeting

57:11.060 --> 57:13.060
quickly fast

57:28.420 --> 57:30.420
Oh

57:58.420 --> 58:00.420
Oh

58:28.420 --> 58:30.420
You know

58:58.420 --> 59:00.420
Oh

59:00.420 --> 59:02.420
Oh

59:21.700 --> 59:29.340
Can't you have wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around my poor little darling

59:29.340 --> 59:31.860
I'm afraid they'll get my darling

59:31.860 --> 59:39.300
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around my poor little darling

59:39.300 --> 59:41.860
I'm afraid they'll get my darling

59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.340
You
