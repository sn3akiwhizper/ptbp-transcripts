WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.800
You are tuned in to 694.2 PTPP here in the idyllic town of Contention.

00:08.800 --> 00:16.200
It's your oral doula, Wolf the Dog, here to guide you through this warmer than usual December 4th.

00:16.200 --> 00:26.200
We are supported today by a dear friend who is making a deliciously positive impact in some place called Springfield, Missouri.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.600
Jake's Vegan Burgers.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.800
Now y'all know Wolf the Dog loves to get his grub on.

00:33.800 --> 00:41.800
Well, Jake sent us a few samples over and I've never had meat that wasn't meat that tasted so much like meat.

00:41.800 --> 00:50.600
You can find Jake's Burgers and Taco Meat at Mama Jean's, Jake's Patty Melt and Quinoa Sausage Bowl at Druff's,

00:50.600 --> 00:58.000
Jake's Breakfast Sausage at Gailey's and Jake's Italian Sausage at Piccolo in Nixa.

00:58.000 --> 01:09.400
Whether you are vegan, vegetarian or just plain hungry, follow him at Jake's Underscore Vegan Underscore Burgers on Instagram.

01:09.400 --> 01:19.400
Y'all been on that Instagram before, seen a whole lot of pictures of dogs on there, saw some people taking pictures of sandwiches and whatnot.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.600
And now y'all know that shit's wild to your old buddy Wolf.

01:23.600 --> 01:28.800
And speaking of some wild shit, it's news time my babies.

01:28.800 --> 01:37.800
John Lee and Don D. Bettymore gave us a glimpse into the accident that propelled John into a life of civic duty.

01:37.800 --> 01:49.200
They were chased by a couple of giant, gaunt, suited men that seemed to vanish when the pair of Bettymores came across John's nemesis, Large Eddie.

01:49.400 --> 01:56.600
Now Large Eddie was roughing up Don's car in the parking lot and Don wasn't taken too kindly to it.

01:56.600 --> 02:08.600
The altercation ended with a deliriously concussed John Lee Bettymore seeing his second cousin father figure scorch Large Eddie's fist with only his hand.

02:08.600 --> 02:17.000
Back in the current timeline, the officers went to the First Church of Condention, which was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.800
The lunch was made by the pastor's wife and children and served by the youth group.

02:22.800 --> 02:34.400
The officers, well, mostly Keith, broke into Pastor Adam Kane's office, stole the motorcycle helmet he bought from Old Mildred Mitchell's booth at Forgotten Treasures,

02:34.400 --> 02:41.600
and learned that he is working on legislation to allow motorcyclists to ride without helmets.

02:41.600 --> 02:51.400
Motorcycles are death traps, so roll down the windows of your full wheeled transportation and turn it up. It's Kudzu with no backbone.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.200
I think they're just called D-Pants.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.000
D-Pants?

03:14.000 --> 03:14.800
Something like that.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.600
What do you have, though?

03:15.600 --> 03:16.800
E-Pants. They're one better.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.200
Yep. Exactly.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.600
One closer to the end.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.800
Okay, what are we doing?

03:21.800 --> 03:26.000
All right, everybody, we've got Luke here playing Keith Vigna.

03:26.000 --> 03:26.600
True.

03:26.600 --> 03:31.800
And this week we have a special guest. We have our friend Jake sitting in.

03:31.800 --> 03:32.600
Hi.

03:32.600 --> 03:41.800
He's playing Ferguson Beans, the brother of the child Keith Beans.

03:41.800 --> 03:52.600
And we're going to do a flashback to the childhood of a young seven-year-old Keith Beans and a nine-year-old Ferguson Beans.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.600
So let's hop right into it.

03:54.600 --> 04:01.000
The home of William and Lena Beans was a beautiful estate that sat just outside of contention.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.400
The grounds were sprawling and filled with well-kept gardens and ponds and bridges and statues.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.400
There were multiple buildings on the land.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.200
The Beans' home was the largest and most grand.

04:14.200 --> 04:20.200
There was a separate housing facility for the staff.

04:20.200 --> 04:26.400
And there was also a small office building where William spent most of his days and nights working on his projects.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.800
This was one of those days.

04:27.800 --> 04:32.200
William was off in his shop and Lena was in her room on the phone.

04:32.200 --> 04:37.600
Keith and Ferguson are having breakfast in a massive pristine kitchen.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.200
The sunlight shining in through the windows on a beautiful day.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.600
And what do these young boys look like?

04:43.600 --> 04:44.600
Keith, if you want to kick it off.

04:44.600 --> 04:49.600
I look a lot like Keith Vigna just 22 years younger.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.200
Are you still wearing weird pants?

04:51.200 --> 04:55.600
My pants are Ferguson's old pants, so they are a little big on me.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.600
Yeah, I've pretty much had big pants my whole life.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.600
Other than that, I look, you know, just like a normal boy.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.400
A young boy?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.000
A young boy, Keith.

05:05.000 --> 05:05.600
Young Keith.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.400
Pre-Vigna Keith.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.600
Picture of Keith.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.600
Go back to the first episode and listen to how I describe myself.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.600
And then make it smaller.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.600
That's a good tactic.

05:14.600 --> 05:19.600
And Ferguson, what does young Ferguson look like?

05:19.600 --> 05:21.600
Ferguson is beautiful.

05:21.600 --> 05:26.600
He's just kind of like, you kind of want to describe him as a handsome boy.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.600
But that seems weird.

05:28.600 --> 05:33.600
Yeah, just almost like some kind of alien or something where you're just like, whoa.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600
Right.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.600
This country has a problem with sexualizing young alien boys.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.600
Right.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.600
Is it a boy that you go to jail over?

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
No.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
No.

05:43.600 --> 05:48.600
He's just like, you know, like the golden child, I think is kind of how I think.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
And you know, already very tall.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
Too skinny.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
Like a very skinny kid.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
Okay.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
Awesome.

05:54.600 --> 06:01.600
The beans chef Helga has been told repeatedly that Fergie is to be served first.

06:01.600 --> 06:06.600
But we see her hand a plate of eggs Benedict to both children at the same time.

06:06.600 --> 06:13.600
Oh, what are you going to do with your day today?

06:13.600 --> 06:18.600
More of the cops and robbers and king of the hill nonsense, I presume.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.600
What?

06:19.600 --> 06:20.600
That's right.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.600
The chef, the lady chef who made your food for you.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.600
She's just asking what you're going to do with your day.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.600
Helga.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
Yes, Helga.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.600
She says, sorry, my voice.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.600
There's something weird in my voice.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.600
No, you sound great, Helga.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.600
It's good to see you and thank you for breakfast.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.600
It'll fuel us for our games today.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.600
Yeah.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.600
Eggs Benedict are a particularly difficult dish to make.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.600
And we just wanted to tell you that we really appreciate it.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.600
Did I get the Hollandaise sauce right?

06:49.600 --> 06:50.600
Nailed it.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.600
Oh, that's so sweet of you to say.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.600
Yum.

06:54.600 --> 07:00.600
And you guys slam down your breakfast.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.600
She says, well, it's time to change into your playing clothes.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.600
And yes, my favorite playing clothes.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.600
He only has like one pair of clothes.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.600
So I'd say it's the same clothes.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
Ferguson's got these like beautiful threads.

07:16.600 --> 07:20.600
Ferguson, I would imagine has like a walk-in closet.

07:20.600 --> 07:27.600
And a lot of like sometimes he just likes to wear the frilled like ruffled collars, like

07:27.600 --> 07:29.600
which is not period appropriate.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.600
Hey, can I, can I try one of your shirts on Ferguson?

07:33.600 --> 07:37.600
It may look a little big on you, but you're welcome to.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.600
Thank you.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.600
And I go and I pick out a Bulls jersey.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.600
Yeah.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.600
That checks out, uh, out of, out of my several walk-in closets.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.600
He's very, you know, vain.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.600
And one of them's just for sports jerseys.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.600
Yeah.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.600
But today is play.

07:55.600 --> 08:00.600
So, you know, Ferguson probably was a little confused by your selection of a sports clothes

08:00.600 --> 08:04.600
for a play time, but he pardons the insanity.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.600
That's awfully kind of you.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.600
Uh, so what is Ferguson wearing to play?

08:09.600 --> 08:11.600
Probably some linens.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.600
Some loose fitting linens.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
Yeah.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.600
Fresh, fresh linens that have never been worn before.

08:17.600 --> 08:21.600
Uh, because if they ever get stains on them, they're immediately discarded.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.600
Amazing.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.600
Okay.

08:23.600 --> 08:28.600
So you guys walk out of the front door of the house into the, uh, the sprawling estate.

08:28.600 --> 08:34.600
Ahead of you is a massive fountain and the circle drive that comes right in front of

08:34.600 --> 08:35.600
the home.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.600
And you can see the different buildings on the land that your father owns.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.600
And what do you guys, uh, what do you guys want to do?

08:41.600 --> 08:43.600
Where do you guys want to run off to?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
The sun is shining high.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
It's what a game day for play day.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.600
I go out to the fountain and I, I get a little handful of water and I splash Ferguson with

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
it.

08:52.600 --> 08:58.600
I'd imagine that upon receiving the splash, Ferguson is, uh, admiring some of the statues

08:58.600 --> 09:03.600
in the works of the masters and, um, does not immediately react to the splash because

09:03.600 --> 09:04.600
it's so engrossed.

09:04.600 --> 09:09.600
But, uh, upon realizing that this was intended to be an offense committed by the younger

09:09.600 --> 09:11.600
brother, probably shoots him a look.

09:11.600 --> 09:16.600
I snicker and I head back to the fountain to do it again.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.600
Keith, please.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.600
This is, this is not my preferred method of playing.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.600
What do you want to do then?

09:21.600 --> 09:22.600
You're boring.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
I'm not boring.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
I'm just deep in thought.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.600
About what?

09:25.600 --> 09:31.600
And I splash him against this beautiful Pieta in front of us that we've been blessed with.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.600
Look, that one has a wiener.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.600
Yes, wieners are funny.

09:34.600 --> 09:40.600
And that one's got boobs and I go up and I act like I'm going to squeeze one of the statues

09:40.600 --> 09:41.600
boobs.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
Give it a honk.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.600
Make like a clown honk noise.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.600
Ferguson laughs at that.

09:46.600 --> 09:50.600
You guys look over as this is happening and you're both giggling and you look over and

09:50.600 --> 09:55.600
there's just like an old, old woman who's a servant for your father who's just staring

09:55.600 --> 09:57.600
at you, shaking your head as she walks away.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
What do you want to do?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
These statues are boring.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.600
Well, we've, uh, we've had a good run of cops and robbers lately.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.600
Perhaps we should continue that.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.600
Can I be the robber this time?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.600
I knew you were going to say that.

10:08.600 --> 10:14.600
So, and immediately Ferguson, you were looking at Keith and you see that he has this like

10:14.600 --> 10:19.600
black bandit cloth wrapped around his eyes, like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with the

10:19.600 --> 10:24.600
little eye holes cut out and he's wearing a all black and white striped shirt with black

10:24.600 --> 10:29.600
pants and he's holding two bags that just have big dollar signs on them.

10:29.600 --> 10:36.600
Fergus, uh, coyly smiles and removes from hidden in a pocket a, uh, blue English style

10:36.600 --> 10:42.600
bobby cap and gives it a little flick and it goes from being folded up into a thing

10:42.600 --> 10:43.600
and places it on his head.

10:43.600 --> 10:48.600
And Keith, when you look at your older brother, you see him as this hat is placed upon his

10:48.600 --> 10:53.600
head in full officer regalia.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.600
He's got a look in his eyes that says the law's coming all over you.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.600
Coming for a naughty boy.

10:59.600 --> 11:04.600
I reach into one of my bag, my money bags and I get a fistful of coins out and I throw

11:04.600 --> 11:08.600
it down on the ground in front of him to, you know, make him lose his balance when he

11:08.600 --> 11:09.600
runs after me.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.600
Fergus looks at the coins in horror and says, these are my coins, Keith.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.600
And I throw another handful and I run away.

11:17.600 --> 11:22.600
I just run into the yard and I go bang bang.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.600
Ferguson is annoyed that his brother's stolen his coin collection and use them as a weapon

11:27.600 --> 11:31.600
against him, but he's patient and begins to collect the coins.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600
You'll never catch me, copper!

11:33.600 --> 11:40.600
So Ferguson, as you are chasing this Keith robber about the property, you guys come across

11:40.600 --> 11:41.600
this building.

11:41.600 --> 11:46.600
It's got Ivy crawling all up along the sides and you know this to be your father's workshop

11:46.600 --> 11:51.600
where you guys aren't supposed to hang out by, but Keith is running and trying to hide

11:51.600 --> 11:55.600
around the backside because I think maybe he knows that you won't go there.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.600
Around the backside of the workshop that was forbidden to us by our father?

11:59.600 --> 12:00.600
Correct.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.600
Oh, okay.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.600
I think that probably, I mean, how far away?

12:03.600 --> 12:05.600
What's the distance between us?

12:05.600 --> 12:06.600
Between you and Keith?

12:06.600 --> 12:07.600
20 yards.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.600
Okay.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.600
I probably would imagine that Ferguson would be doing a kind of a loud whisper sort of

12:12.600 --> 12:13.600
thing.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.600
Hey, Keith.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.600
Keith, get out of there.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.600
Get on it.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.600
Get on out of there, you goof.

12:18.600 --> 12:22.600
My name is not Keith, I'm...

12:22.600 --> 12:25.600
Fuck.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.600
I thought you were going to say the gingerbread man for sure.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.600
I'm not Keith, I'm the gingerbread man.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.600
I'm the gingerbread man.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
I'm not Keith, I'm Ricky the robber.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.600
All right, fine, Ricky the robber.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.600
You still got to get on out of there.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.600
We're not supposed to be there.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.600
I'm not that easy to catch, copper.

12:44.600 --> 12:49.600
Yeah, but I mean, this is also not like, this is outside of playtime.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.600
I don't understand what you're talking about, policeman.

12:52.600 --> 12:56.600
As you guys are having this conversation, you hear something that you've only heard maybe

12:56.600 --> 13:01.600
once before in your lives, and it was when you were much, much younger, but you hear

13:01.600 --> 13:07.600
these alarms going off all over the entire estate, and it's just like this, wow, wow,

13:07.600 --> 13:10.600
wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

13:10.600 --> 13:16.600
And you know that that means that there are intruders on the property, and as you're looking

13:16.600 --> 13:22.600
about, you actually see security is like breaking out into different formations all over the

13:22.600 --> 13:23.600
property.

13:23.600 --> 13:28.600
You probably see two or three guys coming in your direction, in your general direction,

13:28.600 --> 13:35.600
and as they're running toward you, you see three figures that you can't make out what

13:35.600 --> 13:39.600
they look like, but they are almost landing.

13:39.600 --> 13:44.600
You think that it looks like they're landing on the ground near you, however, you didn't

13:44.600 --> 13:52.600
actually see them in the air, and these things are massive, gaunt humanoids in these black

13:52.600 --> 14:00.600
suits with translucent skin, and as you're being picked up by security and running away,

14:00.600 --> 14:04.600
these things are being put down by the security guards.

14:04.600 --> 14:10.600
The guns are firing all around you, the alarms are still going off, and your father is nowhere

14:10.600 --> 14:17.600
to be seen, but security is all over the entire place as you guys are tucked back into the

14:17.600 --> 14:25.600
home where it is safe, and later that night, your dad comes in, William Beans, and he sits

14:25.600 --> 14:34.600
you both down, and he says, boys, what happened today was the reason for all of the security

14:34.600 --> 14:39.600
and the alarms that we have on the estate.

14:39.600 --> 14:45.600
Ferguson, you know that my top priority is to keep you safe, and I will do everything

14:45.600 --> 14:51.600
that I can in order to make sure that you stay safe.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
Thank you.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
Thank you.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.600
I want you to come with me, and he stands up, and he reaches out his hand toward you.

14:57.600 --> 15:03.600
Ferguson kind of looks over to Keith, and a small tear is running down my eye and my

15:03.600 --> 15:06.600
face reaches out to take his father's hand.

15:06.600 --> 15:12.600
And William walks out of the room with you, and you guys go outside, and Keith, no one's

15:12.600 --> 15:19.600
really around, so you can either go back into your room, or you can follow them and kind

15:19.600 --> 15:20.600
of like hide.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.600
Did you guys go outside?

15:21.600 --> 15:22.600
Yeah, they're leaving the house.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.600
I'm going to go to a window and see where they go.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.600
Okay.

15:26.600 --> 15:31.600
They're walking toward the office with the ivy climbing the walls where William works,

15:31.600 --> 15:35.600
that you've never been in before, and neither is Ferguson, to your knowledge.

15:35.600 --> 15:42.600
I'm going to go quickly change into some of Ferguson's all black clothes and sneak and

15:42.600 --> 15:44.600
try to hide and follow and see what happens.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
Okay.

15:45.600 --> 15:50.600
So as you make your way there, you would eventually come to a spot in the wood on the property,

15:50.600 --> 15:56.600
maybe behind a well-sculpted bush or a nice tree.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.600
Why did you make that face when I said well-sculpted bush?

15:59.600 --> 16:03.600
I was thinking of a statue with pubic hair on it.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.600
With good pubic hair?

16:04.600 --> 16:05.600
Yeah.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.600
I think that, yeah, it was like a bait and switch.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
Okay, that's fair.

16:09.600 --> 16:15.600
And as you're hiding, you're within earshot of your father and your older brother, and

16:16.600 --> 16:22.600
William comes out of the door of the office and he takes a knee and looks at you, Ferguson,

16:22.600 --> 16:24.600
and he's holding something.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.600
It's a watch.

16:26.600 --> 16:35.600
Ferguson, I don't know how much longer I'll be around, and I had hoped that I would be

16:35.600 --> 16:42.600
the one who would be able to fulfill the prophecy, but it is not me.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.600
It is you.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.600
You are the anointed.

16:48.600 --> 16:53.600
When the time is right, you must go back and save the world.

16:53.600 --> 16:58.600
And he puts this watch around your wrist, and it's way too big for you.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.600
Yeah, probably pretty heavy too.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.600
And it doesn't have anything on the face of it.

17:03.600 --> 17:11.600
And, Keith, when you see it go around Ferguson's wrist, something on his face changes, and

17:11.600 --> 17:13.600
he looks kind of different.

17:13.600 --> 17:18.600
And then William says to Ferguson, it will fit when the time is right.

17:18.600 --> 17:20.600
Is that because it's a watch?

17:20.600 --> 17:21.600
The time?

17:21.600 --> 17:23.600
When the time is right?

17:42.600 --> 17:44.600
It was awful, but it was so good.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.600
We're all standing up by the cruisers at this point.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.600
Should we do anything with this helmet right now, or should we just head on to the mill

17:49.600 --> 17:50.600
with it in tow?

17:50.600 --> 17:53.600
I think we should head with it, because I'm not going to put it on my head.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.600
Should we go lock it up?

17:54.600 --> 17:56.600
Let's lock it up and let's put it in evidence.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.600
Do we have all the other artifacts locked up somewhere?

18:00.600 --> 18:01.600
Let's do that now.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.600
Let's put them all in the same spot.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.600
Maybe not all in the same spot.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.600
What if they activate?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.600
Are you talking about a Megazord situation?

18:09.600 --> 18:11.600
Yeah, exactly.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.600
You're the weirdest nerd sometimes.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.600
Where do you get this stuff from?

18:16.600 --> 18:18.600
I thought you were just like Wheel of Fortune.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.600
Power Rangers is on Saturday mornings when I wake up.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.600
Only if you turn the TV on.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.600
Do we have like lockers, like little lockers at the PD probably?

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
Yeah.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.600
Let's put them each in their own separate locker.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
Okay.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.600
Lock them up.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.600
Put them something a little, yeah, or maybe more secure.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.600
I don't know.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.600
It's a locker at a police department.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.600
I mean, our evidence room probably has...

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
Individual.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.600
Individual.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
Yeah.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.600
We can do that.

18:44.600 --> 18:50.600
Okay, so you have now put, well, in order, let's say the camera, the gun, the radio,

18:50.600 --> 18:56.600
and the helmet all in four separate lockers within the evidence room of the police station.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.600
Yeah, and when they get close to each other, do we notice anything funny, like tubes glowing

19:00.600 --> 19:02.600
or lights changing?

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
You don't.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.600
Okay.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.600
However...

19:05.600 --> 19:06.600
Drew dies.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.600
However, Drew's dead now.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.600
Does it smell like radioactivity in here?

19:14.600 --> 19:15.600
A real ozone-y smell.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
Yeah.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.600
Did somebody spray some like hairspray or something?

19:19.600 --> 19:24.600
Not to throw a wrench into things real quick, but what did we ever do with that silver

19:24.600 --> 19:25.600
ball that we found?

19:25.600 --> 19:27.600
Did we get it sent off somewhere?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.600
No.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.600
It is in John Lee Pettymore's inventory, like on his body.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.600
In my character inventory.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.600
Yeah.

19:34.600 --> 19:40.600
Is there anything else that you guys have acquired throughout the campaign so far that

19:40.600 --> 19:45.600
you would like to put in these lockers, or is it just these four main items?

19:45.600 --> 19:46.600
Just the four main items.

19:46.600 --> 19:47.600
I think just those four, yeah.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.600
Let's keep that bag with us.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
Yeah, because that could be useful.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.600
You think?

19:50.600 --> 19:54.600
Yeah, because if we got rid of something quick, there's no reason to hold onto it.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
For sure.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.600
Who's got the bag?

19:56.600 --> 19:57.600
Who got the bag?

19:57.600 --> 19:58.600
I got the bag.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.600
Yeah, you got the bag.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.600
Clark's got the bag.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.600
Clark's got the bag.

20:03.600 --> 20:08.600
When you were looking at all four of the items that you put into the lockers at the

20:08.600 --> 20:12.600
police station, you would notice that they all have the red light showing, except for

20:12.600 --> 20:15.600
the camera, which has the green light showing.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.600
Okay.

20:16.600 --> 20:17.600
Duly noted.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.600
Perfect.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.600
Oh, shit.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.600
I don't want to mess with it right now.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.600
I'd like to mess with it just a little bit.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.600
Okay.

20:23.600 --> 20:29.600
When we have all those items together, I want to try to move the objects around in different

20:30.280 --> 20:34.600
orders in relation to each other and just see if that changes the lights at all.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.600
Okay.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.600
That takes some time.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.480
I mean, one of the objects is a pretty heavy radio, so maybe you move the items around

20:40.480 --> 20:42.920
it or you move all of them, whatever, either way.

20:42.920 --> 20:47.320
It takes some time, but you would notice that the lights don't change.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.720
The camera is green.

20:49.720 --> 20:54.400
The radio, the gun, and the helmet are all red light showing.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.400
What happened the last time we took a picture?

20:55.400 --> 21:00.200
Last time the camera turned green was in front of a weird spot, right?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.600
It was back at Splashylvania.

21:01.600 --> 21:05.280
Yeah, and it had a picture of the guy in the...

21:05.280 --> 21:06.280
In the stocks.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.280
In the stocks.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.280
I think we should take a picture.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.280
I think we should, too.

21:09.280 --> 21:12.680
Wait, if you look through the lens, can you see anything through it that's out of the

21:12.680 --> 21:13.680
ordinary?

21:13.680 --> 21:14.680
Is there a viewfinder?

21:14.680 --> 21:15.680
There is.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.280
Do I see a spooky thing through the...

21:17.280 --> 21:18.280
Okay.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.280
You never have.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.280
Take a picture.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.880
I'm pretty nervous, but let's go take a picture outside.

21:22.880 --> 21:27.640
What if I put the helmet on and put the radio on my shoulder like a boombox and I held the

21:27.640 --> 21:29.760
gun and you took a picture of me like that?

21:29.760 --> 21:30.760
That'd be cool, huh?

21:30.760 --> 21:31.760
No way.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.760
No.

21:32.760 --> 21:33.760
No?

21:33.760 --> 21:34.760
No.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.760
No.

21:35.760 --> 21:36.760
Okay.

21:36.760 --> 21:37.760
No.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.760
Okay, that's fine.

21:38.760 --> 21:39.760
Well...

21:39.760 --> 21:40.760
Come on.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.760
I can put it on my...

21:41.760 --> 21:42.760
I got an Instagram recently.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.760
I can put it on there.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.960
We know the camera is the only one with a green light right now, so let's see what it does

21:47.960 --> 21:49.400
and then we'll go from there.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
Sure.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.400
All right.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
Has the light been on this whole time?

21:52.920 --> 21:56.080
You mean it's been on the whole time we've been talking about it?

21:56.080 --> 21:58.640
It hasn't been sitting in evidence with a green light on, has it?

21:58.640 --> 22:03.320
I've called for a couple rules that would have alerted you to the fact that it has a

22:03.320 --> 22:08.160
green light, but taking it out and putting it somewhere, you would obviously recognize

22:08.160 --> 22:10.240
that there's a green light on it.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.000
It is currently December 4th.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.480
It was last used the night of December 2nd.

22:15.480 --> 22:21.400
I thought you were prepping us because this photo was going to warp us through time.

22:21.400 --> 22:26.520
Just so you know, it's December 4th now, and when you wake up, it's November 8th.

22:26.520 --> 22:30.960
Okay, I take a picture of Keith.

22:30.960 --> 22:31.960
I'm outside.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.400
I'm doing two thumbs up.

22:33.400 --> 22:39.680
No, I got my gun in one hand and I'm doing a thumbs up in the other, and I say to John,

22:39.680 --> 22:43.080
hey, if this does take a picture of me, I'm going to take it.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
You guys should follow me.

22:44.080 --> 22:50.160
I'm Keith0911 on Instagram, and then I make sure the safety's on and it's not, so I turn

22:50.200 --> 22:54.120
the safety on with my gun, and I'm like, take my picture, click.

22:54.120 --> 22:59.920
There is an extremely bright flash that is almost blinding, and as each of your visions

22:59.920 --> 23:06.600
come back into focus, you see a piece of paper being smoothly printed out of the bottom of

23:06.600 --> 23:08.480
this camera.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.960
Everyone roll Sanity.

23:09.960 --> 23:10.960
Fail.

23:10.960 --> 23:11.960
Fail.

23:11.960 --> 23:12.960
Fail.

23:12.960 --> 23:13.960
Beautiful.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.960
I rolled a 95.

23:15.960 --> 23:23.440
Okay, one at a time, go ahead and roll a D4 for how much Sanity you lose.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.440
Let's start with John and go around.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.440
I didn't leave a D4 out.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.440
That's four.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.440
Four, yeah.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.080
Can I see your D4?

23:31.080 --> 23:33.520
You might want to use a different one, but yeah.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.520
Three.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.520
Three.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.520
Holy shit, that's a chunk.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.520
Four.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.520
Oh, fuck.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.520
I got a four also.

23:40.520 --> 23:45.080
John Lee Pettymore loses four Sanity, Keith Vigno loses three Sanity, and Clark Bishop

23:45.080 --> 23:46.520
loses four Sanity.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.400
I am at my breaking point.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.520
What is everybody at now?

23:49.520 --> 23:52.040
I'm at 30, my breaking point is 30.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.840
I'm at 36, and my breaking point is 32.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.000
I'm at 37, with my breaking point at 31.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
La-dee-da.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.800
All right, Keith, we will discuss your next disorder in between sessions, but for now...

24:05.800 --> 24:10.320
You've got a crippling fear of getting your picture taken right after you got your first

24:10.320 --> 24:11.880
Instagram account.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.960
Oh no!

24:13.960 --> 24:15.520
Every time I get a like, I just break down.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.200
My social media presence is crippled.

24:18.200 --> 24:23.180
You all gather around to look at the picture that prints out from the bottom of this camera,

24:23.180 --> 24:28.860
and you see a picture that shows two men in a room made of darkness.

24:28.860 --> 24:33.560
You can barely make out the two figures in the picture, thanks to the light from a small

24:33.560 --> 24:37.860
candle, also made out of a substance without color.

24:37.860 --> 24:43.760
The candle is sitting on a table made of the same unbelievably black texture, and of the

24:43.760 --> 24:49.280
two men, one is a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt, revealing tribal tattoo sleeves

24:49.280 --> 24:53.040
on both arms going down to his hands and fingertips.

24:53.040 --> 24:58.720
He is kneeling before another man who looks like a no-bullshit John Wayne-style cowboy.

24:58.720 --> 25:03.500
This man seems to be aware of the picture being taken, holding his hand up to block

25:03.500 --> 25:07.040
his face from the camera's flash and sight.

25:07.040 --> 25:12.200
On John Lee Pettymore's hands, you see that inky black substance, and it's dripping onto

25:12.200 --> 25:14.580
the ground from the camera and the picture.

25:14.580 --> 25:20.400
It's pooling on the ground, and you can swear it's moving, but when you blink, the substance

25:20.400 --> 25:21.880
is gone.

25:21.880 --> 25:28.680
John's hands are clean, and he's holding this odd device, and this even odder picture.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.280
Fuck that.

25:35.280 --> 25:40.240
John still feels like there's goo on his- he is freaking out a little bit.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.240
Cool cool cool.

25:41.280 --> 25:46.880
Also, if I could get an alertness roll from both Keith and Clark.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.640
I fail.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.640
I pass.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.640
43 out of 70.

25:51.640 --> 25:55.800
Okay, if Thomas and Luke could leave the room just for a quick second, I'm going to keep

25:55.800 --> 25:56.960
the recording going.

25:56.960 --> 26:00.720
If you guys just want to dip out on the other side of the door, and la la la.

26:05.520 --> 26:10.700
Okay, so Clark, when you saw that inky black liquid dripping all over the camera and picture

26:10.740 --> 26:16.780
in John's hands, you looked up, and saw that exact same substance oozing out of John Lee

26:16.780 --> 26:22.820
Pettymore's eyes, his nose, his mouth, and his ears.

26:22.820 --> 26:24.540
Even still?

26:24.540 --> 26:27.340
As soon as you blink, the substance is gone.

26:31.100 --> 26:35.780
Okay, so would you guys like to do anything, or would you like to just get the camera-

26:35.780 --> 26:38.940
By the way, the camera, the light is now red again.

26:39.340 --> 26:42.580
Do you fellas recognize anybody in that picture there?

26:42.580 --> 26:44.580
Can I roll?

26:44.580 --> 26:45.580
I don't, do I?

26:45.580 --> 26:47.860
Tribal Tats looks pretty cool.

26:47.860 --> 26:50.580
Tribal Tats and Contingent would like stick out, right?

26:50.580 --> 26:51.580
Is this John Wayne?

26:51.580 --> 26:53.580
That guy looks like John Wayne.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.180
Is that guy John- no, but he does.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.820
He looks like an actual cowboy.

26:57.820 --> 26:58.820
That's kind of silly.

26:58.820 --> 27:04.100
Out of character, have any cowboys been part of this at all?

27:04.100 --> 27:07.380
Yeah, everyone in Contingent is a cowboy.

27:07.380 --> 27:08.700
We're all cowboys.

27:08.700 --> 27:12.140
Yeah, this is the 1840s.

27:12.140 --> 27:15.900
Where's your hen at?

27:15.900 --> 27:18.620
Would any of us recognize somebody with tribal tattoos?

27:18.620 --> 27:20.340
Yeah, do we know these people?

27:20.340 --> 27:24.300
Yeah, would any of us recognize the guy with tribal tattoos, because that would stick out

27:24.300 --> 27:25.300
in contention.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.300
No.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.040
Yeah, I don't know any of these folks here.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.820
It's like he knew you were taking a picture, though.

27:31.820 --> 27:34.020
He's got his hand right in front of the flash.

27:34.020 --> 27:39.980
This might seem a little nuts, but it seems like, well it's not exactly a portal, but

27:39.980 --> 27:41.360
something came through.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.080
This is some kind of gateway.

27:44.080 --> 27:48.700
So the last picture this camera took- Or a look into another dimension, another place.

27:48.700 --> 27:53.180
It could be the now, but it could also be like it's spitting out old pictures.

27:53.180 --> 27:56.980
So the pictures that we've seen that this camera's taken, the last one was a guy in

27:56.980 --> 27:58.260
stocks.

27:58.260 --> 28:03.240
One was, was it people in front of like a black building in like old timey clothes?

28:03.880 --> 28:08.480
That's the pictures we found on- Right, that one wasn't one that we took, but it was found

28:08.480 --> 28:09.480
with the camera.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.480
Yeah.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.480
What was her name?

28:11.480 --> 28:13.000
That was in Julie Maxwell's car.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.880
Was that the only other picture that we found over there too with her?

28:15.880 --> 28:18.840
I think that is the only one that I think John found.

28:18.840 --> 28:22.600
Hey y'all, if you'll remember, that man in the picture was John Peters.

28:22.600 --> 28:23.600
In the stocks?

28:23.600 --> 28:24.600
In the stocks.

28:24.600 --> 28:25.600
Oh, that's right.

28:25.600 --> 28:26.600
Oh, that's right.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.600
That's right.

28:27.600 --> 28:31.160
I don't know what that means, but that is just some information to ponder over.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.760
Anybody gotta hit the restroom before we go?

28:33.280 --> 28:34.280
This is Joe real fast.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.560
Did we, we still don't know anything about where he is, right?

28:36.560 --> 28:37.560
John Peters?

28:37.560 --> 28:38.560
I don't think so.

28:38.560 --> 28:39.560
We haven't answered any questions.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.520
If we do know, I would like to be reminded.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.520
Okay.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.520
Oh, shit.

28:43.520 --> 28:48.840
Um, so Billy Harrison, who was part of the team, as far as we understand, they were just

28:48.840 --> 28:50.560
looking for that bag, right?

28:50.560 --> 28:51.560
Uh, sorta.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.880
I think didn't the, I think the FBI agents mentioned John, John Peters to me.

28:54.880 --> 28:55.880
Right.

28:55.880 --> 28:57.880
But the reason they wanted to get to him was because they had the bag.

28:57.880 --> 28:58.880
You're right.

28:58.880 --> 28:59.880
You're right.

28:59.880 --> 29:00.880
You're right.

29:01.000 --> 29:07.560
Maybe John was involved in whatever they were, this, this organization, this phone number.

29:07.560 --> 29:08.700
Maybe John was a part of that.

29:08.700 --> 29:09.800
They were working together.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.320
Maybe John brought all this stuff here.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.320
Maybe got out of here.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.360
A rogue agent or something.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.360
What was he betting on?

29:16.360 --> 29:18.480
I mean, I think something got out of hand.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.480
MMA fights or something.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.920
Oh, I forgot all about that, Keith.

29:21.920 --> 29:22.920
He was betting on fights.

29:22.920 --> 29:23.920
It seemed like.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.360
Fights or was it races?

29:25.360 --> 29:27.360
We figured out one of them was an MMA fighter.

29:27.360 --> 29:28.360
One of the names.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.360
Oh, that's right.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.200
He had a whole list of funny fighter names.

29:31.200 --> 29:35.680
His name was Oz Mayhem Wolf.

29:35.680 --> 29:36.680
Ah-woo.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.680
Ah-woo.

29:37.680 --> 29:43.480
And they were all versus-ing like the world crusher or something like that.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.480
Yeah.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.480
What was it?

29:45.480 --> 29:46.480
Squaring off against.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.480
How about that?

29:47.480 --> 29:48.480
Instead of versus-ing.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.480
Thank you.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.600
They were all squaring off against planet juggernaut.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.600
Planet juggernaut.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.920
I was close with the world crusher.

29:55.920 --> 29:56.920
Yeah.

29:56.920 --> 29:57.920
Juggernaut.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.200
I barely knew her not.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.040
Also, a quick reminder.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.900
Just about things that you've already seen.

30:03.900 --> 30:10.760
The Fonzie woman at the hotel motel said that Marvin sent them to contention to find out

30:10.760 --> 30:15.360
what happened to Jermaine Glass and Alfred Glass when they came to collect money from

30:15.360 --> 30:16.360
John Peters.

30:16.360 --> 30:17.360
Okay.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.000
Only Alfred came back and he's a blubbering idiot now.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.260
He won't shut up about some gun.

30:22.260 --> 30:24.980
He sounded like a lunatic and Jermaine is missing.

30:24.980 --> 30:25.980
So here's what I'm thinking.

30:25.980 --> 30:29.380
The Glass dudes are associated with the mobster guy.

30:29.380 --> 30:35.440
John Peters probably bet on these fights and lost and they are like sharks coming to get

30:35.440 --> 30:36.440
money from them.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.440
Well, yeah.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.440
Yeah.

30:38.440 --> 30:39.440
Did we already think that?

30:39.440 --> 30:42.740
That's just- I think that's what he just said.

30:42.740 --> 30:43.740
Yeah.

30:43.740 --> 30:44.740
You know what?

30:44.740 --> 30:46.940
I think I can fit that in my mouth and clean it up.

30:46.940 --> 30:49.740
Will you describe- Give him the light bulb.

30:49.740 --> 30:50.740
Give him the light bulb.

30:50.740 --> 30:51.740
Dude.

30:51.740 --> 30:52.740
Oh yeah.

30:52.740 --> 30:53.740
That's a good gangster thing.

30:53.740 --> 30:54.740
Put this in your mouth.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.460
Will you describe the picture as we hold it now?

30:57.460 --> 31:00.860
Imagine the unlucky idiot who figured that out for the first time.

31:00.860 --> 31:01.860
Yeah.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.500
That would be so awful.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.500
So much pain.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.940
Let's saw shit.

31:08.940 --> 31:12.520
As you look at the picture now, you see the same thing.

31:12.520 --> 31:18.180
So it's a darkly lit room, a table made of that nothingness, a candle made of that nothingness.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.780
The room is made of nothingness.

31:19.780 --> 31:23.940
A substance without color, an unbelievably black texture.

31:23.940 --> 31:25.020
There are two men.

31:25.020 --> 31:27.020
We've seen almost everything made out of this stuff.

31:27.020 --> 31:30.980
It's also- Tribal guy is standing- The tribal guy's kneeling before another man.

31:30.980 --> 31:31.980
I'm sorry.

31:31.980 --> 31:32.980
Okay.

31:32.980 --> 31:33.980
So he's kneeling, the John Wayne guy is standing.

31:33.980 --> 31:34.980
Yes.

31:34.980 --> 31:35.980
Yes.

31:35.980 --> 31:37.660
And we don't get a clear view of his face because of his hand?

31:37.660 --> 31:38.660
Correct.

31:38.660 --> 31:39.660
All right.

31:39.660 --> 31:45.020
I mean- Let's stick this with the other pictures and try to figure it out later, but I think

31:45.020 --> 31:46.380
we should head off to the mill.

31:46.380 --> 31:47.380
I agree.

31:47.380 --> 31:48.380
Sounds- Yeah.

31:48.380 --> 31:51.180
A mystery for- Next Tuesday.

31:52.180 --> 31:58.220
Hey, also, I don't want to do this, but just to make the thing better, I did cocaine and

31:58.220 --> 32:00.680
you said it would only last for a few hours, so.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.060
So you feel like hot, sweet garbage.

32:03.060 --> 32:05.260
Also, it is 1 p.m. now.

32:05.260 --> 32:06.260
Okay.

32:06.260 --> 32:09.540
Hey guys, I got to go pee real quick before we head out to the mill.

32:09.540 --> 32:11.660
I'll be right back.

32:11.660 --> 32:12.660
Okay.

32:12.660 --> 32:13.660
Thanks for telling us.

32:13.660 --> 32:14.940
I go to the bathroom and I rip a line of cocaine.

32:14.940 --> 32:17.060
Go ahead and roll a D6 for me.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.260
Rip a line of cocaine.

32:19.260 --> 32:20.260
It's a four.

32:20.340 --> 32:21.700
You're good for four more hours.

32:21.700 --> 32:23.140
You're good until 5 p.m.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.140
Cool.

32:24.140 --> 32:25.140
You are coked up to the gills.

32:25.140 --> 32:26.140
Hell yeah, baby.

32:26.140 --> 32:27.140
You are coked.

32:27.140 --> 32:30.820
You did a fat line in the bathroom of the police station.

32:30.820 --> 32:36.100
I walk out of the bathroom with my smartphone in my hand and it's playing-

32:36.100 --> 32:38.100
Keith, were you doing coke in there?

32:38.100 --> 32:40.460
Hold on, let me- That's cute.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.660
Let me explain to you how you see me before you ask me.

32:43.660 --> 32:48.100
Well, we just see you with all that- You just came out of the bathroom without any time

32:48.100 --> 32:49.100
passing.

32:49.140 --> 32:50.780
Yeah, you didn't flush.

32:50.780 --> 32:55.460
I walk out of the bathroom like maybe 15 seconds after I enter the bathroom.

32:55.460 --> 33:00.380
I've got my phone out up to my ear and it's playing Life's Been Good by Joe Walsh and

33:00.380 --> 33:03.300
I'm like banging my head to the guitar riff.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.420
Okay, yeah, I'm good to go now.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.180
Okay.

33:08.180 --> 33:09.180
All right.

33:09.180 --> 33:10.700
Thanks for telling us.

33:10.700 --> 33:13.220
Okay, so you guys are heading off to the mill?

33:13.220 --> 33:14.220
I think that's what we want to do.

33:14.220 --> 33:15.780
Can I ride with one of you guys?

33:15.780 --> 33:17.500
I just kind of want to like jam.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.660
I'll ride with Clark then.

33:18.660 --> 33:19.660
Sorry, Clark.

33:19.660 --> 33:20.660
Yeah, Clark.

33:20.660 --> 33:21.660
Okay, cool.

33:21.660 --> 33:23.060
Yeah, we're going to have a good time on the way up there, dude.

33:23.060 --> 33:25.380
It's going to be a really good time.

33:25.380 --> 33:26.540
I just don't feel like driving right now.

33:26.540 --> 33:30.020
I think it would be safer if the two of us were right up there together, you know?

33:30.020 --> 33:31.020
Okay, yeah, yeah.

33:31.020 --> 33:32.500
I'm already walking out the door.

33:32.500 --> 33:36.260
Okay, so John, are you driving separately as well?

33:36.260 --> 33:40.660
Okay, so you guys begin driving off to the mill.

33:40.700 --> 33:50.300
As you take the main drag in contention north up to the highway to head toward the city,

33:50.300 --> 33:52.420
Zach is just puking off Mike.

33:52.420 --> 33:55.380
Our DM is literally vomiting with excitement.

33:55.380 --> 33:57.940
He's looking like Ramona right now.

33:57.940 --> 33:58.940
Meow.

33:58.940 --> 34:01.580
I really want some fried rice.

34:01.580 --> 34:09.060
About halfway in between downtown and the highway, you go over a overpass that leads

34:09.060 --> 34:10.260
over the creek.

34:10.260 --> 34:14.900
It's actually, you would know, it's the same creek that runs behind the first church of

34:14.900 --> 34:15.900
contention.

34:15.900 --> 34:19.460
In fact, as you take the main drag, looking to your right on the other side of the creek,

34:19.460 --> 34:22.820
you can see the back of the first church of contention.

34:22.820 --> 34:29.420
Going over that bridge, that overpass, you do see lots of animals in the water at this

34:29.420 --> 34:31.400
juncture as well.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.700
This is a different place?

34:32.700 --> 34:34.700
Yes, different part of the same creek.

34:34.700 --> 34:36.780
Hey, I call out over the radio.

34:37.300 --> 34:42.060
Hey, you know, this is just a thought, and we'll have to wait to look into it, but maybe

34:42.060 --> 34:48.740
having a cat mind, or a person mind in a cat body, we'll find her cat husband because he'll

34:48.740 --> 34:51.300
be the only goddamn cat that's not in that creek.

34:51.300 --> 34:52.300
Oh my God.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.300
That could be.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.300
Good job.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.660
Is he letting Vigna use your radio?

34:56.660 --> 34:57.660
No.

34:57.660 --> 35:02.540
If I had seen him going for my radio, I would have smacked his hand.

35:02.540 --> 35:04.100
He's definitely doing coke, right?

35:04.100 --> 35:05.100
Over.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.100
Yes, I am.

35:06.100 --> 35:07.100
He says yes he is.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.100
Over.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.100
Yeah, I heard.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.100
Over.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.100
Keith, you're doing coke?

35:11.100 --> 35:12.100
I mean, not right now.

35:12.100 --> 35:13.100
I did it.

35:13.100 --> 35:14.100
Why are you doing coke?

35:14.100 --> 35:15.100
Why my hand?

35:15.100 --> 35:17.740
Because I don't feel very good without it.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.580
We could have got you a cup of coffee.

35:19.580 --> 35:20.580
I know.

35:20.580 --> 35:25.300
Well, the powers that be told me that that wouldn't work.

35:25.300 --> 35:26.520
The powers that be?

35:26.520 --> 35:27.520
Just go with it, man.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.020
I don't, you know.

35:29.020 --> 35:30.280
Are you hearing voices, Keith?

35:30.280 --> 35:33.340
The more you talk about it, the more nervous I'm going to get.

35:33.340 --> 35:34.340
Let's just roll with it.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.720
Just act like I'm normal.

35:36.340 --> 35:37.340
I am normal.

35:37.340 --> 35:42.460
Are you going to be at the top of your game if shit goes down?

35:42.460 --> 35:45.840
If I wasn't on coke, I wouldn't be at the top of my game.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.520
I would not be able to function.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.520
I'll tell you that.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.520
Alright.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.520
That's why I went to...

35:50.520 --> 35:51.880
Keith, we're going to talk about your dependency later.

35:51.880 --> 35:52.880
I'm not dependent.

35:52.880 --> 35:53.880
I'm just, it's useful for me right now.

35:53.880 --> 35:57.040
That's the definition of dependency if the top of your game is with it.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.600
Well, it doesn't seem to have caused any problems yet.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.600
Let's just go.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.600
Why are you guys talking about...

36:02.600 --> 36:03.600
Just make sure it's that way.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.600
You usually don't care this much about me.

36:05.480 --> 36:09.360
Keith, it's not that I don't care.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.360
What is it then?

36:10.360 --> 36:14.480
It's that I don't care a whole lot.

36:14.480 --> 36:21.480
Well, thanks for the pep talk.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.800
I crawl over the console into the backseat.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.800
Well, no, it's a cop car.

36:26.800 --> 36:27.800
I can't do that.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.800
I attempt to and then I remember where I am.

36:29.800 --> 36:33.200
You just bang your forehead on the cage.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.200
I just want you to know...

36:34.800 --> 36:37.800
Life's been good to me so far.

36:37.800 --> 36:38.800
Keith!

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
Keith!

36:39.800 --> 36:46.800
You had your hands on the call button this whole time.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.800
To the mail, to the mail, to the mail, mail, mail.

36:48.800 --> 36:49.800
Okay, cool.

36:49.800 --> 36:54.680
So real quick, the three of you are almost to the highway.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.880
John or Clark, who is ahead?

36:56.880 --> 36:57.880
Who is behind?

36:57.880 --> 37:03.200
I threw my lights on and sped a decent way ahead of them after the whole radio conversation.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.200
Okay, fair enough.

37:04.200 --> 37:08.200
Go ahead and, John, make me an alertness check.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.200
Six!

37:09.200 --> 37:11.200
I finally passed one of those.

37:11.200 --> 37:15.320
You see the sky ahead of you begin to swirl.

37:15.320 --> 37:20.280
About thirty feet above the ground, a flat oval begins to form.

37:20.280 --> 37:26.760
The sky around it spirals like cloth, making folds as it gathers in bunches in certain

37:26.760 --> 37:29.320
places in the sky.

37:29.320 --> 37:36.240
The oval is black, but a technicolor energy is erupting from its darkness, and then the

37:36.240 --> 37:40.640
sky is just as it was, but something is falling.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.640
Roll sand.

37:41.640 --> 37:42.640
Fail.

37:42.640 --> 37:46.640
Alright, go ahead and roll a D4 for me.

37:46.640 --> 37:49.800
God damn it, four again.

37:49.800 --> 37:54.800
That puts you at your breaking point!

37:54.800 --> 37:59.120
John Lee Pettymore is at 32 sanity, and his breaking point is 32.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.680
I'm broke, y'all.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.400
We're going crazy together, brother.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.840
I'm not crazy.

38:04.840 --> 38:10.800
John Lee Pettymore, the windshield of your vehicle is smashed in, and tiny shards of

38:10.800 --> 38:14.680
glass immediately cover everything around you.

38:14.680 --> 38:21.000
Slumped across your dashboard is the lifeless body of a grown man, and blood is splattered

38:21.000 --> 38:22.480
everywhere.

38:22.480 --> 38:23.480
Roll sanity.

38:23.480 --> 38:26.760
Oh hell, what the hell, what the shit?

38:26.760 --> 38:31.600
That's not the craziest thing I've ever seen, I guess.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.360
You lose one more sanity, so you're down at 31.

38:34.360 --> 38:37.640
Now real quick, Clark, I need you to roll a drive check.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.560
Oh shit.

38:39.560 --> 38:42.000
Pretty important drive check.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.800
I fail.

38:44.800 --> 38:49.960
I got a 78 on a 15.

38:50.840 --> 38:56.840
You slam on your brakes as this body from a technicolor rip in the sky slams into your

38:56.840 --> 38:58.120
windshield.

38:58.120 --> 39:04.200
You instantly feel another violent impact, this time from behind, as Clark plows into

39:04.200 --> 39:05.720
your cruiser.

39:05.720 --> 39:09.620
You lose control of the vehicle and swerve into oncoming traffic.

39:09.620 --> 39:15.800
You hear the sound of a horn blaring, and you vaguely remember the sight of a minivan

39:15.840 --> 39:22.240
driving in the oncoming lane before this chaos of disorienting glass and blood and pain.

39:22.240 --> 39:27.560
You see a flash of color fly by out of the corner of your eye and then, as your car finally

39:27.560 --> 39:34.840
jerks to a stop, you hear a deafening crash, and the rumble of fire.

39:45.800 --> 40:05.720
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
