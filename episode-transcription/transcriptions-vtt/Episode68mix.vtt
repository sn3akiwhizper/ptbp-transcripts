Charles Digby Roger and Angela Fairfield Walter and Alan Grimes and Bradley Cooper

02:47.860 --> 02:53.100
met with James the executive director of calm comfy campground during

02:53.100 --> 02:58.300
orientation a game of two truths and a lie got a little out of hand the group

02:58.300 --> 03:03.500
was then led to the boathouse to meet Jack Russell the boatman he was an odd

03:03.500 --> 03:08.820
guy who warned the group to never go out alone in a canoe on the brackish water

03:08.820 --> 03:14.200
of Lake calm the past doesn't seem nearly as fucked as the present I bet it

03:14.200 --> 03:19.560
definitely stays that way no way things get weirder and weirder and spin out of

03:19.560 --> 03:27.640
control nope so stay calm friends stay comfy turn yourselves down but turn up

03:27.640 --> 03:33.880
that radio it's dream girl with pretty sexual

03:44.200 --> 03:46.200
Oh

04:04.600 --> 04:11.440
hey Thomas Isaac so Bradley Cooper is standing with a key in hand it's just us

04:11.440 --> 04:15.480
you can call him Martin Cooper you're so right Martin Cupertino is standing

04:15.480 --> 04:19.960
key in hand to cottage number five and you're standing right in front of this

04:19.960 --> 04:24.880
beautiful little cottage you've walked down those same kind of a cobblestone

04:24.880 --> 04:31.480
path to get to your cottage and it is by itself secluded by all these trees and

04:31.480 --> 04:36.320
bushes and stuff and it's in a little opening space it's quite lovely and

04:36.320 --> 04:40.840
there's a front door with a window to the side and you are home for the

04:40.840 --> 04:47.840
weekend he eyes it all up and kind of huffs and says cozy and goes in yeah and

04:47.840 --> 04:54.480
when you walk in it is equally cozy inside there is a fireplace and it's

04:54.480 --> 05:01.600
fully decorated in a sort of like not quite lake house kind of decorations a

05:01.600 --> 05:08.600
little bit higher level but it's still rust yeah yeah and so your bags are up

05:08.680 --> 05:14.960
in your room which is on the second level and it's a loft by itself up a

05:14.960 --> 05:18.480
staircase and there's a bathroom attached and then downstairs there's

05:18.480 --> 05:22.600
like a living room there's a little study and there's a kitchen I prepare a

05:22.600 --> 05:27.640
small meal of fresh fruits and vegetables that I bought at a local

05:27.640 --> 05:32.680
market before I came here and while those are simmering I'm meditating on

05:32.680 --> 05:37.000
the floor but not very well because I'm paying attention to the cooking

05:37.000 --> 05:41.080
vegetables what is your mind keep wandering to when you're trying to

05:41.080 --> 05:49.120
meditate I told him I told him it had to be white but I think it should be ivory

05:49.120 --> 05:55.080
it's got to be ivory god damn it that and the smell of the cooking vegetables

05:55.080 --> 06:01.080
but he's trying to just focus on breathe just breathe Martin breathe in and out

06:01.320 --> 06:10.920
just focus on your breathing ivory would be revolutionary and after he eats the

06:10.920 --> 06:17.100
meal he's going to take out a biography of Hannibal Barca the general across the

06:17.100 --> 06:22.480
Alps to invade Rome and he's gonna read that for a while and after some time

06:22.480 --> 06:26.240
he's gonna kind of look around and see if it doesn't look like things have

06:26.240 --> 06:30.520
quieted down outside and if they have he's gonna make his way down to the

06:30.520 --> 06:35.080
boathouse and take a canoe out to the middle of the lake cool so as you're

06:35.080 --> 06:39.960
walking around the cottage you come down the stairs after doing a little bit of

06:39.960 --> 06:45.160
reading and as you're making your way out to the front door you step on this

06:45.160 --> 06:50.240
wood panel beneath you and it is extremely loose to the point to where it

06:50.240 --> 06:55.640
almost slides out completely god damn I almost slipped on this slidey and loose

06:55.640 --> 07:01.240
panel I could sue anyway I guess I'll take a look at it though what's

07:01.240 --> 07:04.760
underneath the panel what's underneath the panel who knows but it is definitely

07:04.760 --> 07:09.600
a gym bag there's a gym bag hidden underneath this panel you have to grab

07:09.600 --> 07:14.440
another panel and move it to the side in order to get the bag up out of there I

07:14.440 --> 07:18.440
get the bag up out of there when you get the bag up out of there you open it up

07:18.440 --> 07:27.320
and inside it is filled with cash money there's also a passport there are many

07:27.320 --> 07:33.720
cassette tapes and there is a map it's a map of the calm comfy campground with

07:33.720 --> 07:38.640
Lake calm and then all of the wilderness around it and the map leads to a spot

07:38.640 --> 07:45.560
far away from here in the wilderness and it is circled and it says the door

07:45.560 --> 07:52.720
there's also bottled water snacks and a syringe that is filled with a clear

07:52.720 --> 07:58.160
substance I am going to pocket the map and with a quick visual estimation how

07:58.160 --> 08:01.760
much money do I think is in here at least 10 grand okay I look at the

08:01.760 --> 08:09.880
passport the passport is for a man named Jack Russell and you'd recognize the

08:09.880 --> 08:17.160
picture as the man who is the boat man I'd recognize those fuzzy cheeks anyway

08:17.160 --> 08:25.080
fuzzy cheeks fluffy bags mmm full eyes clear heart of the eyes can't lose looks

08:25.080 --> 08:28.920
like Jack was ready to get out of here in a hurry do the tapes the cassettes

08:28.920 --> 08:33.640
have any kind of markings on them any like side a of Jack explains the

08:33.640 --> 08:42.640
mystery they're all labeled with like Jack Russell number 532 Jack Russell

08:42.640 --> 08:50.860
number 533 Jack Russell 534 Jack Russell 535 was there a stereo a cassette

08:50.860 --> 08:55.520
player in my room there's not hmm how many tapes are there how many did I just

08:55.520 --> 09:02.560
say it's 64 for four okay pocketable amount yeah I pocket them okay I guess I

09:02.760 --> 09:07.440
take the passport to have leverage he doesn't care about the money he just

09:07.440 --> 09:12.080
covers that back up there's also the bottled water snacks and syringe filled

09:12.080 --> 09:21.040
with a clear substance what kind of snacks rollos combos bugles and a bunch

09:21.040 --> 09:26.280
of nuts and some hard meat okay he takes the nuts and starts snacking on them as

09:26.280 --> 09:32.520
he considers his next move yeah they're pistachios without the shell it's kind

09:32.520 --> 09:38.000
of thing that's gonna make our country lazy Zach loves pistachios without the

09:38.000 --> 09:43.360
show it hurts my hands X lazy Zach's the kind of thing that's gonna make our

09:43.360 --> 09:50.680
country is that is accurate is there an employee parking lot you've seen no cars

09:50.680 --> 10:01.160
how did I get here roll sanity uh-huh I figured it was something like that 51

10:01.160 --> 10:08.520
huck on a 50 god damn it oh okay yeah so go ahead and lose one sanity okay as

10:08.520 --> 10:16.000
you cannot for the life of you remember getting here you can like vaguely

10:16.160 --> 10:21.720
remember being in your car but then like you don't even remember taking a boat to

10:21.720 --> 10:26.760
get on the island you were just standing there at six o'clock not the time the

10:26.760 --> 10:33.600
position and you don't have any memory of coming to this island if I say gaze

10:33.600 --> 10:38.480
out at the far shore of the lake say it this is maybe look like we're moving oh

10:38.480 --> 10:45.040
interesting role some sort of science or survival or anything that you can think

10:45.080 --> 10:50.080
of that would be helpful to produce this just intelligence yeah you can roll

10:50.080 --> 10:58.840
intelligence okay 31 on a 70 the island does not seem to be moving okay okay

10:58.840 --> 11:04.320
there was I didn't notice any stereo or anything at the boathouse no and you

11:04.320 --> 11:07.800
didn't see anything when you're in the lobby or in the meeting room either but

11:07.800 --> 11:11.200
you also haven't been up to Jack Russell's apartment and you haven't been

11:11.200 --> 11:15.560
in the rest of the main house hmm I think I need to go find that Metallica

11:15.560 --> 11:21.560
kid maybe he had a Walkman hell yeah do you remember where he was staying no

11:21.560 --> 11:26.480
absolutely not no he got his room assignment and left went straight there

11:26.480 --> 11:30.200
okay what would you like to do I put everything back well I take the tapes

11:30.200 --> 11:34.240
out I keep the tapes in the map but I put everything else back in the hiding

11:34.240 --> 11:40.680
spot okay I go and unlock my luggage and lock the tapes back up inside it and

11:40.680 --> 11:46.200
then he's gonna go back down to the boathouse and take his canoe okay sounds

11:46.200 --> 11:50.720
good he's still like he's like this place is weird but I've really got a

11:50.720 --> 11:55.280
focus for the launch of cube so I'm sorry for the what the launch of cube

11:55.280 --> 12:02.560
voice in my head cube cube cube it's gonna be huge I've got a launch cube

12:02.560 --> 12:10.560
cube Martin Cupertino as you make your way out to the boathouse you are

12:10.680 --> 12:16.480
unmolested I'm gonna say something else you do not see anyone on your way out

12:16.480 --> 12:22.080
and about and you get to the boathouse and it seems that Jack Russell is up in

12:22.080 --> 12:27.200
his apartment and these six canoes are all looking you dead in the face I look

12:27.200 --> 12:31.880
I'm dead back what are you looking at and I grab a life vest and a paddle and

12:31.880 --> 12:37.680
I go out on a canoe and you just hear this echo and your back of your head

12:37.800 --> 12:43.240
that's why we always sticked it to you in a canoe he actually doesn't hear that

12:43.240 --> 12:50.280
echo the the listener might but as soon as he actually heard that the first time

12:50.280 --> 12:53.840
he was like very specifically just thinking about like how it did not apply

12:53.840 --> 12:59.840
to him are you comfortable on the water he is actually he was a high school

12:59.840 --> 13:06.480
swimmer he grew up in California and did did some nature things he really grew up

13:06.480 --> 13:11.000
with an appreciation of California's natural spaces and so yeah you know he

13:11.000 --> 13:14.760
knows his way around a canoe all right sounds good so you go out on the water

13:14.760 --> 13:21.720
oh god I should have asked for a joint from that girl anyway all I want to do

13:21.720 --> 13:28.000
now is row out there's not necessarily a middle of this ring like lake but I'm

13:28.000 --> 13:32.080
gonna go it's a lifesaver it's a lifesaver donut I'm gonna go to the

13:32.080 --> 13:37.520
middle part of the ring okay you know the thick of the lifesaver yeah as far

13:37.520 --> 13:45.400
from either shore as I can get and I'm gonna paddle out there lean back in my

13:45.400 --> 13:51.320
canoe and meditate on cube do you come up with anything I'm starting to second

13:51.320 --> 14:01.440
guess the whole ivory thing I don't know well I'm coming back to cream bone is

14:01.440 --> 14:07.280
also an option but that's really close to ivory roll alertness for me yes okay

14:07.280 --> 14:17.160
that's not that's a d20 36 39 on a I think I gave myself a little bit here

14:17.160 --> 14:24.240
45 oh nice so when you're out there you decide on cream and at that exact moment

14:24.640 --> 14:34.040
you hear and looking over you see the tail end of something dip down into the

14:34.040 --> 14:42.040
inky black water of Lake calm and you see ripples slowly moving toward you he

14:42.040 --> 14:52.480
assumes a karate stance he stands up in the boat which is it's it's kind of

14:52.480 --> 14:56.760
feasible because he's only like five foot seven so yeah it doesn't move it

14:56.760 --> 15:01.080
around too much when he stands up there but he's yeah any I'd like to have you

15:01.080 --> 15:05.640
rolling athletics yeah honestly it looks like he knows what he's doing what is

15:05.640 --> 15:09.700
your athletics I think it's pretty if it's good enough you don't after all 65

15:09.700 --> 15:15.200
oh yeah then you are good okay he gets into like an Elvis karate pose and he's

15:15.200 --> 15:20.160
like what is this industrial espionage and the lake does not reply he keeps an

15:20.160 --> 15:29.480
eye out for a while and then anything nothing cream won't do any respect you

15:29.480 --> 15:33.760
get back there and it's still quiet on all fronts so you can put everything

15:33.760 --> 15:40.600
back in peace and he does do I see a light on in any of the other cabin we

15:40.600 --> 15:49.480
can't really I was like you don't see anyone I hope

15:50.240 --> 15:57.160
well and if I leave right after this I hope no one sees me go ahead and roll

15:57.160 --> 16:00.560
stealth for me if you're trying to be sneaky that way I have it for oh he's

16:00.560 --> 16:08.040
not honestly he's not no no no he's paying a lot to be here that is yes and

16:08.040 --> 16:13.040
it's a goddamn lake trip and he is very confident it's gonna use the lake he

16:13.040 --> 16:18.960
knows how to canoe he knows karate he's fine yeah he's gonna go back to the

16:18.960 --> 16:22.880
cabin and I'm gonna study that map a little bit does it look like what I

16:22.880 --> 16:26.360
think this place should look like it looks exactly like what you think this

16:26.360 --> 16:31.680
place should look like and you see that the trail that was pointed out to you

16:31.680 --> 16:36.240
earlier by Jack Russell if you took that trail you would only need to dip off

16:36.240 --> 16:41.600
about halfway through the trail to go off trail to get to where it is marked

16:41.600 --> 16:48.520
the door okay what are the odds that I brought a Walkman I want to say zero

16:48.760 --> 16:53.840
so I'm gonna okay you have a CD player but you don't have any you know that's

16:53.840 --> 16:58.280
that player so true yeah yeah you do have a walk with yeah but not the kind I

16:58.280 --> 17:03.880
want he gets really annoyed at other people for not being early enough

17:03.880 --> 17:12.760
adapters it's 26 years ago give up the times that was a terrible laugh I'd

17:12.760 --> 17:20.200
liked it I was really scared fine I'm kind of getting invested in this

17:20.200 --> 17:26.640
mystery I guess I do have to find the Metallica kid but but not tonight and

17:26.640 --> 17:33.320
right as he says that a little beeper goes off on his on his watch on a

17:33.320 --> 17:40.800

I can't do that you got me Roger and Angela Fairfield are standing in front

18:19.120 --> 18:23.720
of cottage number nine you've got the key in your hand with the little keychain

18:23.720 --> 18:26.720
hanging down that says number nine right on it and you're staring at this

18:26.720 --> 18:31.040
beautiful little cozy little cottage it's in its own little clearing so

18:31.040 --> 18:35.080
there's trees all over but yeah there there's an opening for this cottage to

18:35.080 --> 18:39.840
be and you've got a front door and a window in the front seems to be a

18:39.840 --> 18:44.880
two-story with loft as the second story from what you can tell outside you said

18:44.880 --> 18:49.120
just a window it's not like a nice glass or anything like that it's a nice glass

18:49.120 --> 18:53.400
little bay window sure okay I got you I'm getting a picture yeah yeah it's got

18:53.400 --> 18:58.800
a chimney brick chimney and when you go in it's equally as like rustic and

18:58.800 --> 19:05.240
charming and modern as the main big house was and you see that there is a

19:05.240 --> 19:09.680
living room there's a study and there's a kitchen and then when you go up the

19:09.680 --> 19:15.120
stairs there's the lofted bedroom with a bathroom attached is the kitchen a fully

19:15.120 --> 19:19.600
fully equipped kitchen it is fully stocked and as you guys are in there

19:19.600 --> 19:24.880
actually Angela starts cooking like immediately she's like I'm just like a

19:25.040 --> 19:31.760
little hungry and you notice that as she's moving around the kitchen she

19:31.760 --> 19:35.240
seems to know where everything is she's just like opening up drawers and

19:35.240 --> 19:38.920
grabbing what she needs honey have you ever have you ever stayed here before

19:38.920 --> 19:43.880
have you been to the common comfy campground without me no you seem to know

19:43.880 --> 19:48.320
your way around that kitchen pretty dang well oh yeah well it's like this kitchen

19:48.320 --> 19:53.120
is set up so intuitively it's like everything is where you expect it to be

19:53.120 --> 19:58.880
that's that's handy yeah yeah it's wild what do you want what do they got well

19:58.880 --> 20:04.600
I'm making just like an omelet with some bacon and I figured maybe maybe some

20:04.600 --> 20:10.080
biscuits make it too all right we'll do I'm gonna go and put on my pajamas and

20:10.080 --> 20:14.560
you head off and she continues cooking you can hear kind of humming to herself

20:14.560 --> 20:19.520
from upstairs and looking around the bedroom it's just nicely decorated

20:19.520 --> 20:24.240
everything is there for you there's I was gonna say there's phone chargers

20:24.240 --> 20:29.640
like ready to go but that's silly I was like what's the nicest amenity I can

20:29.640 --> 20:34.720

20:34.720 --> 20:42.200

20:42.200 --> 20:46.360
attached Roger is changing into some really nice silk pajamas oh hell yeah

20:46.360 --> 20:56.080

20:56.080 --> 21:02.000

21:02.000 --> 21:06.080

what you want me to do I'm willing to work on whatever you need me to work on

22:02.680 --> 22:09.760

25:59.280 --> 26:04.040
and as I set it down on the nightstand I'm gonna see what they have to read

26:04.040 --> 26:08.800

26:08.800 --> 26:14.960

26:24.240 --> 26:32.120

26:32.120 --> 26:37.960
gonna let her let the sick sick wife sleep maybe talk about that later

26:38.800 --> 26:44.080
fucking boom dear but I do want to go downstairs and see if they like you said

26:44.080 --> 26:46.880
there was a study right there's a study what kind of what kind of literature

26:46.880 --> 26:52.800
that they have in on the bookshelves there's a vast array of different styles

26:52.800 --> 26:59.720
of literature in this study and you can find really maybe anything that you're

26:59.720 --> 27:05.240
looking for if it's vague enough I would like the history of the calm comfy

27:05.240 --> 27:11.840
campground that's for sure not there yeah no no so Roger audience if you

27:11.840 --> 27:15.240
haven't been able to tell by my actions so far he wasn't exactly the one who

27:15.240 --> 27:18.960
decided to go on this trip but now that he's here and he really wants to work on

27:18.960 --> 27:23.600
this with his wife he's gonna start to embrace this forestry lifestyle like

27:23.600 --> 27:29.760
half of it is self-help well right well yeah I was gonna say that he gets he

27:29.760 --> 27:34.120
wants to pull down like a local flora and fauna like textbook you can start

27:34.120 --> 27:39.200
reading about the trees and the plants all around this neck of the woods and

27:39.200 --> 27:45.400
he's he's kind of settling into an armchair and trying to put himself in

27:45.400 --> 27:49.760
the mindset of a guy who's at a campground and he's reading about trees

27:49.760 --> 27:57.960
and you're 15 pages in before you fucking falls there's a chance Roger

27:58.080 --> 28:10.480
would be really into it he gets 30 pages in and then with that you nod off with

28:10.480 --> 28:14.520
the book just kind of slumping onto your belly as you're sitting in this nice

28:14.520 --> 28:18.160
comfy chair I like it

28:18.160 --> 28:28.680
hey Luke Kingson oh god thank you that's what yeah I'm sure yes so Walter Grimes

28:28.680 --> 28:34.640
is standing outside of cottage number three with his father Alan Grimes who is

28:34.640 --> 28:39.200
standing right behind you and the two of you are in this clearing where your

28:39.200 --> 28:46.640
cottage is surrounded by all this lush forest green and yeah Alan grabs the key

28:46.640 --> 28:51.440
up out of his pocket and is like okay let's go on in and probably call it a

28:51.440 --> 28:56.120
night walking in you see a living room there's a study on this floor and

28:56.120 --> 29:00.480
there's a kitchen and then there's stairs that go up to a lofted bedroom

29:00.480 --> 29:06.720
that has two queen-size beds and a bathroom attached but where does Alan

29:06.720 --> 29:13.320
go Alan immediately heads to the kitchen and just grabs some tea and puts on a

29:13.320 --> 29:19.080
kettle I walk over to the refrigerator and I open it up is there anything it is

29:19.080 --> 29:24.520
fully stocked as I open the refrigerator I look at Alan and I go father would you

29:24.520 --> 29:30.520
like me to prepare you any food that would be fantastic what would you like

29:30.520 --> 29:37.120
there's pretty much everything you could ask for in here breakfast eggs and bacon

29:37.120 --> 29:41.680
yeah sounds good to me so I pull out three eggs some bacon

29:41.760 --> 29:47.360
pour them a glass of milk make an omelet and cook up some bacon yeah and he's

29:47.360 --> 29:50.480
gonna go into the other room and you hear him flick on the TV and start

29:50.480 --> 29:55.800
changing channels with his tea while you do that curiously I break off a little

29:55.800 --> 30:01.720
piece of the bacon very crisp by the way I was curious yeah I break off a little

30:01.720 --> 30:08.440
piece of the bacon and I put it in my mouth and I chew it I masticate yuck and

30:08.440 --> 30:14.160
I attempt to swallow sure and when I swallow it is immediately rejected out

30:14.160 --> 30:19.640
of my body not puke but like just sent back into my mouth and I spit it out and

30:19.640 --> 30:26.720
in my mind I I think I wish that I could enjoy this like he does and then I bring

30:26.720 --> 30:34.160
him his breakfast for dinner as you walk into the room you see that the channels

30:34.160 --> 30:38.000
are flipping from channel to channel to channel to channel at a rapid pace at

30:38.040 --> 30:45.760
one point Wheel of Fortune comes up sure I see the clue is just things and there's

30:45.760 --> 30:52.440
no letters on the board and I immediately guess beer battered rock

30:52.440 --> 30:59.640
shrimp and then they spin the wheel and they guess B oh my oh my god that was

30:59.640 --> 31:05.680
incredible I wish that this was fun for me as well here you go and he flips to

31:05.720 --> 31:10.480
another channel and when it flips to the next channel the picture is a square

31:10.480 --> 31:15.920
instead of a rectangle like is the shape of the TV and the square picture is in

31:15.920 --> 31:21.600
black and white and it is the living room entryway of a cottage that looks

31:21.600 --> 31:27.280
identical to the cottage that you are in so it looks like like video like

31:27.280 --> 31:33.320
surveillance surveillance videos what what what is going on I stand there and

31:33.320 --> 31:38.800
I just continue looking at the video you see that Bradley Cooper makes his

31:38.800 --> 31:44.480
way into frame and seems to step on something on his way to the front door

31:44.480 --> 31:49.640
so in the entryway in between the stairs in the front door Bradley Cooper steps

31:49.640 --> 31:54.320
on something and immediately looks down and then you see him get down on his

31:54.320 --> 31:59.780
knees and he pulls a wooden plank off of the floor looks into it and then he

31:59.780 --> 32:03.980
grabs another wood plank and moves it and then he grabs a black duffel bag

32:03.980 --> 32:10.340
out of the floorboards and when he opens it you can't quite see what is inside

32:10.340 --> 32:15.940
but then he pulls out this piece of paper that is folded up that he kind of

32:15.940 --> 32:19.540
looks at for a second refolds it and puts it back and then he grabs four

32:19.540 --> 32:25.580
cassette tapes while he does that make me roll something for this but I zoom

32:25.580 --> 32:34.400
and enhance with my eyeballs well you get my eyeballs in quotation marks my

32:34.400 --> 32:40.340
cameras okay go ahead and roll search

32:40.340 --> 32:47.780
seven whole shit okay roll a d10 for okay so add four to that skill so take

32:47.780 --> 32:54.220
the time right now to explain to the listeners what the deal is with Walter

32:54.220 --> 33:02.820
Grimes I gave Walter Grimes 30 skill points on almost everything almost every

33:02.820 --> 33:08.780
skill except everything except like unnatural firearms and unarmed combat

33:08.780 --> 33:12.500
yeah and like heavy artillery and shit like that the yeah but besides that has

33:12.500 --> 33:16.340
got 30% and everything and I've told you that every time you roll whether you

33:16.340 --> 33:22.480
succeed or fail you learn something and you gain a d10 so right now I've got 30

33:22.480 --> 33:32.160
on everything except search I now have 34 and surgery I have a 33 fantastic

33:32.160 --> 33:37.360
surgery of all things I think when I was like oh I've got a 30 in surgery they

33:37.360 --> 33:40.880
were like yeah Thomas was looking at your character she like what the fuck

33:40.880 --> 33:45.400
and then I think he saw that you have 30 on everything yeah that's not right

33:45.400 --> 33:51.120
because I don't want to give away I'm a freaking robot I leaned into it a little

33:51.120 --> 33:56.840
bit but I'm hoping that they haven't I did say something along the lines of

33:56.840 --> 34:03.560
like I have the same hit hips that I was made yeah you definitely made and Joe

34:03.560 --> 34:09.200
gave me a look of like God like kind of like oh interest and I was like damn it

34:09.200 --> 34:15.800
well we'll see if you wrote it down yeah so you zoom in with your eyes onto this

34:15.800 --> 34:21.840
TV screen and somehow the picture clears up enough and where you're looking for

34:21.840 --> 34:28.320
you to see that the map that he pulled out is of calm comfy campground and he

34:28.320 --> 34:33.660
kind of ran his face the island over the island and the the greenery around the

34:33.660 --> 34:38.280
island of the lake and he kind of pointed at a point at the top there can

34:38.280 --> 34:42.520
I make a mental note for my character of where he pointed to yeah sure it's in

34:42.520 --> 34:49.640
the northeast quadrant of the map you also see him pull out four cassettes and

34:49.640 --> 34:56.120
you just see a name on all of them and then a number afterward and it says Jack

34:56.120 --> 35:02.040
Russell number three hundred and and then something now all four of them are

35:02.040 --> 35:06.800
three hundred and something Alan looks at you and he's like we got up I guess

35:06.800 --> 35:11.640
we should look around to see if there's cameras like that and and this in this

35:11.640 --> 35:19.640
cottage I think you might need to look for cameras and I'm going to look

35:19.640 --> 35:24.680
underneath the floorboards by the entrance smart so go ahead and roll

35:24.680 --> 35:32.680
search 16 oh you pry up some of the floorboards they're not easy to get up

35:32.680 --> 35:40.760
but you well I shove my fingers there's like I find one little spot that the

35:40.800 --> 35:45.400
floorboards aren't completely touching each other and I shove my entire hand

35:45.400 --> 35:54.760
down into it some of my silicone skin rips a bit and blood comes out but then

35:54.760 --> 36:01.880
I have enough grip underneath the floorboard and I pull it up and looking

36:01.880 --> 36:06.400
down there you see absolutely nothing and Alan comes up behind you and he's

36:06.400 --> 36:12.160
like okay thankfully there are no cameras in this cottage it must just be

36:12.160 --> 36:17.320
in that one band-aid oh god oh yes of course and he goes and grabs a band-aid

36:17.320 --> 36:20.960
throws it on you and then it's like okay enough of all this nonsense I'm going to

36:20.960 --> 36:25.960
bed for the night you did a great job today Walter and I think that you'll do

36:25.960 --> 36:29.560
even better moving forward I think we're definitely I think you've convinced them

36:29.560 --> 36:33.320
so far and if you can make it through this thing we're on to the next step do

36:33.360 --> 36:40.280
you need me to tuck you in yes please I follow Alan to the bedroom he lays in

36:40.280 --> 36:50.000
bed and I very mechanically like tuck him in to bed and I place my hand on his

36:50.000 --> 36:55.520
forehead good night father I will discontinue soon good night Walter you

36:55.520 --> 37:02.240
can just say you're going to sleep I will go to sleep soon and he is out like

37:02.240 --> 37:08.040
a light pretty quick Walter stands there watching him until he goes to

37:08.040 --> 37:14.720
sleep he walks out of the bedroom he takes up the floorboard that he had

37:14.720 --> 37:20.440
ripped out earlier places it back where it came from kind of like stomps on it

37:20.440 --> 37:26.520
to like put it in place yeah and then does a little tour of the house just

37:26.520 --> 37:33.960
walking around looking at every little piece of each room he goes next to the

37:33.960 --> 37:41.400
door where Alan is sleeping he looks down at his shoes he reaches behind his

37:41.400 --> 37:48.560
head and presses on a pressure point shirt on his head the matrix spot and

37:48.560 --> 37:57.800
his piercing blue eyes turn to completely black and he's out perfect

38:01.280 --> 38:07.640
hey Justin hello so Charles Digby is standing outside of cottage number seven

38:07.640 --> 38:11.560
he's got the key in hand with the nice little keychain rubber with the number

38:11.560 --> 38:17.040
seven on it says calm comfy campground and looking at this cottage it's quaint

38:17.080 --> 38:22.280
cute it's got a little brick chimney and a front door with a window right next to

38:22.280 --> 38:26.280
it and the front door is painted red because that's nice how calm is it oh

38:26.280 --> 38:31.480
dude it's calm as shit you can't hear anything the only thing that you hear is

38:31.480 --> 38:35.720
the wind and looking up you see the beautiful stars above you mildly

38:35.720 --> 38:40.160
off-putting there's no sounds out here pretty weird to be honest can you hear

38:40.160 --> 38:46.800
crickets no you cannot unsettled so when you go into the cottage you are going to

38:46.800 --> 38:51.360
find a living room and that's in the entryway and then back there's a study

38:51.360 --> 38:55.240
and there's also a kitchen on the main floor and then up the stairs there's a

38:55.240 --> 38:59.440
lofted bedroom with a bathroom attached I'm gonna go to the kitchen and make

38:59.440 --> 39:04.720
myself a little cup of coffee for sure anything in it no just black absolutely

39:04.720 --> 39:11.400
sad coffee sad coffee my favorite kind personally sad coffee for a sad boy

39:11.400 --> 39:16.720
what's Charles thinking about as he's going through here Charles is thinking

39:16.720 --> 39:21.640
about just how how he got here he's wondering if this is all a mistake he's

39:21.640 --> 39:26.000
not used to opening up to anybody he's thinking about his past relationship and

39:26.000 --> 39:30.840
how she would have enjoyed being at this kind of outdoorsy place and how he being

39:30.840 --> 39:35.240
from the city does not particularly enjoy it although he's trying his best

39:35.240 --> 39:39.560
with your cup of coffee are you going straight to bed are you the type to take

39:39.560 --> 39:44.480
caffeine right before sleep yes this is this is like kind of his nightly ritual

39:44.480 --> 39:49.240
gotcha he does the whole like slug down some coffee and then lay down and try to

39:49.240 --> 39:54.560
fall asleep let your brain just go yeah it's weird so as you're laying there

39:54.560 --> 40:00.400
staring up at the ceiling ceiling fan going around and round and round five

40:00.400 --> 40:05.800
blades on the ceiling fan you kind of like focus your eye on one of them as it

40:05.800 --> 40:16.680
goes and then you hear from underneath the bed hello is it like someone the

40:16.680 --> 40:20.360
floor below me it does not sound like it's on the floor below you it sounds

40:20.360 --> 40:24.840
like it is under the bed I like immediately like like I just like get

40:24.840 --> 40:29.420
out of bed like freak out cover like fling covers off like like you know how

40:29.420 --> 40:32.720
sometimes you waking dream where a spider is coming down onto your face I

40:32.720 --> 40:36.040
don't know if I'm the only person who has this all the time you could ask Joe

40:36.040 --> 40:40.080

40:40.080 --> 40:44.080
before I wake up it looks like a spider is like from its web like coming down

40:44.080 --> 40:49.280
onto my face and I will spring out of my bed and throw my covers off the bed holy

40:49.280 --> 40:54.320

40:54.320 --> 41:04.880
bed just like like a knee-jerk reaction of like what the fuck and like look

41:04.880 --> 41:07.760
under under look under the bed immediately yeah under the bed there is

41:07.760 --> 41:15.760
a little walkie-talkie down there and it goes hello oh fuck okay and then he

41:15.760 --> 41:21.400
grabs it relieved that it is not yeah a little creepy person or something yeah

41:21.400 --> 41:28.120
that would be worse activates it and like hi oh oh hello sir who is this oh

41:28.120 --> 41:35.640

41:35.640 --> 41:40.600
if you figured it out yet what what am I supposed to be figuring out the reason

41:40.600 --> 41:50.560
why you're here I mean that's it's kind of private why I'm here okay sleep well

41:50.560 --> 41:54.400
we'll talk later Charles gets like a shiver up his spine and it's like what

41:54.400 --> 41:59.760
the fuck wait wait and tries to talk again this is a walkie-talkie so you can

41:59.760 --> 42:02.840
talk all you want who are you what's going on here how did you know I was

42:02.840 --> 42:10.000
gonna be here and there's nothing but he puts it on the nightstand next to him

42:10.000 --> 42:16.120
anyway nice and lays back down but he's like staring fucking just dead eyes

42:16.120 --> 42:21.240
staring at it just waiting kind of you don't turn it off you leave it on yes

42:21.240 --> 42:25.240
yeah I'm just gonna leave it on for a while at least until nothing happens and

42:25.240 --> 42:29.960
then maybe I'll turn it off to try and get some sleepies eventually but he's

42:29.960 --> 42:37.440
very perturbed yeah seemingly was this a young girl's voice maybe it was a young

42:37.440 --> 42:43.200
girl's voice interesting is there anything else I could it you can ask

42:43.200 --> 42:47.080
anything you want baby welcome to the show did I hear the girl's voice earlier

42:47.080 --> 42:51.000

42:51.000 --> 42:54.960
a walkie-talkie earlier which we did not sing with okay say I might I would I

42:54.960 --> 43:00.240
would assume that this is that I also take my notebook out of the night drawer

43:00.240 --> 43:06.360
absolutely take a couple notes of some spooks and then put that back in lay

43:06.360 --> 43:12.480

43:12.480 --> 43:19.320

43:45.800 --> 43:50.840
restless get out of bed look out the window oh and try and look out see if he

43:50.840 --> 43:55.600
