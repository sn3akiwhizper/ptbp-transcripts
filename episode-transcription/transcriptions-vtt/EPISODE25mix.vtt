00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Hello my hungry babies, it's your chef Wolf the dog, and I'm here to serve you up some real tasty news grub cooked up right here in contention.

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
Now don't let the local health inspector know that I cook all my grub with a microwave here at 694.2 PTBP.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
A microwave is the only way to get that real good flavor from the rats I catch down here in the basement.

00:28.000 --> 00:43.000
This week Wolf is here to reiterate to y'all that we are going to have a special presentation in a few weeks here on 694.2 PTBP, contention's newest and only radio station.

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
We're going to broadcast a recap episode with listener Q&A from a podcast called Pretending to be People.

00:53.000 --> 01:02.000
If you have questions for any of the fine people on that show, act quickly, deadline is May 7th at noon Central Time y'all.

01:02.000 --> 01:14.000
And send them to at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram, or post them on our Facebook page or the subreddit, or email them to pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

01:14.000 --> 01:22.000
Or go all out, record that audio of you asking your question and send that so they can use it in the episode my babies.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
But enough with that which is fictional, it is time for the news.

01:28.000 --> 01:42.000
The officers met back at the contention police station early in the morning of December 5th along with Drew and their new partner in crime Rosemary, an actual member of the Glass crime family.

01:43.000 --> 01:56.000
In the station, an FBI agent named Trent Chad was sorting through contention's paperwork, Clark shot him with a dart and agent Trent Chad became very very impressionable.

01:56.000 --> 02:08.000
With agent Trent Chad's newfound pliability, the officers worked out ways in order to convince the public as well as the feds that the local authorities have everything under control in contention.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
But of course y'all, nothing could be further from the truth.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
The officers found the cells holding Dr. Marie Jacobs and her cat man to be empty.

02:18.000 --> 02:29.000
Upon checking the security footage, they confirmed the black ooze slammed the two jailbirds into the ground of their cells before disappearing entirely.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Keith blurted out that the camera will be ready to use at 1pm.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
They checked the evidence room and saw a single green light beaming from the old glass tube covered radio.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Seems like a pretty shitty radio to me.

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
Wolf the dog always has the green light and it's always go go go with kudzu's no backbone.

03:04.000 --> 03:17.000
Luke, do you remember the time that me you and Thomas were at **** and he told our server?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
There was a logic behind it.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
What did you say? I don't remember.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I said you're fat.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Oh, because she was pregnant.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Because she was pregnant. It was an attempted twist on the thing and it didn't work.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah, I immediately felt very weird.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
You looked like you wanted to be anywhere else in the world.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
I still remember the look of just like as your face fell and her face fell.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
And I was just like, oh, fuck.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, God, that was horrible.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
In your defense, I can see the train of thought.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I can hear it coming out also.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
It was so funny because I used to bet it didn't work.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, right.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
It didn't work because I used to **** with her.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
What's her name?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't know her name. Thank God.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
I would come in there all the time and then I was just like, I just wanted to be like, I am so sorry.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
What?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Anyway, just remembering one of my favorite moments.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I just don't speak in public anymore.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
That was hilarious, dude.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Okay, let's play this game.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Let's play this game.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Okay, so what we're going to do is because it is, I wrote December 4th.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It's December 5th.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Baby shark.

04:32.000 --> 04:41.000
So because it's a new day, I have personally forgotten many of the rules set up for this campaign when it comes to hit points and willpower.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
So what we're going to do is we're going to roll constitution for more hit points.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Cool.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
So you guys all get to roll con right now.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, yeah, I'm way low on hit points.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
You guys have been fucked up by a lot of different stuff, but mostly that fight with a big robot man.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, so I've failed.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Okay.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I passed.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Okay.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Do I have to do it for my max or for my current?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Current con.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Oh, sorry.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I did not do current.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah, I got a nine, so yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Why is your constitution different now than-

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
It's not.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Your con should never-

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh, yeah, it doesn't change.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I was looking at current hit points.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
It doesn't change.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Right, right.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
But no, I got a nine on a 70, so.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Okay.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
And Thomas failed.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Can I go to the doctor or something?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
So John gets one hit point back.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Keith gets one D4.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
So you want to roll a D4 if you pass.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Clark, pass or fail?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
He passed.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
All right.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
So you guys both get a D4 hit points.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Fuck.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I just got one.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
And I rolled a D4.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Clark gets one.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And Keith gets-

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Two.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
What's your max, Joe?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Max hit points is 26.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
My current is 12.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Oh, word.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
You were worse than me.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I'm at eight.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Shit.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I thought I was doing that at 12.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Now I'm at 13.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah, because somebody fell on my face.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm the tank now.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Someone fell on my face.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Well, some idiot hadn't been lying in the road.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
That's true.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
You guys also all had a really rough night.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
And when you don't get a full night's sleep, you automatically get reduced to two willpower

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
points.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Are you kidding me?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Two, two or by two?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
To two.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So all of you are now at two willpower.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
That's actually not that big a deal for me.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
I was at five.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
What if my current is one?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Do I go up to two?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
So with you-

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
What the fuck?

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
We've been playing fast and loose with these willpower points because you're all fucking

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
addicted to cocaine now.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Oh, yeah.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Mostly, Keith.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
But after this morning, me too.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
So you're all at two willpower.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Keith, I'm going to go ahead and give you two willpower.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
So I'm at two total.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So how this works is you are all-

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Sleepy.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
Sleepy and completely having basically an emotional breakdown, physical as well.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
So you're all going to take a negative 20% to all roles until you either fix your willpower

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
or do an upper.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
How long do we have to sleep to fix our willpower?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Full night's rest.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Not even a cat nap or whatever won't bump it up a few points.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
That does make sense because when I'm feeling down and I get even an hour, I do feel better.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
You get two or three more hours after that.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Cool.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Let's take a nap.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Would we still be rolling minus 20%?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I don't understand.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
No.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
So basically you roll at minus 20% on all roles when you either have one or two willpower.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Oh, cool.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Okay.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
So if you gain any willpower, you won't be at that negative anymore.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Cool.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Okay.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
How's that sound?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Are you sleeping in drugs to gain willpower back?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Different drugs?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Different drugs?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
No.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I don't think so.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Okay.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Well, okay.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
So I'm going to do some cocaine.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
So it is 6 a.m. on December 5th and all three of you are reeling from the events of last night.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
The dreams you cannot quite understand and the revelations of the morning.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
You all stand in the evidence locker looking at the camera, gun, radio, and helmet all

08:11.000 --> 08:16.520
with strange glass tubes making them look like they came from a weird old-timey steampunk

08:16.520 --> 08:17.520
laboratory.

08:17.520 --> 08:24.120
The camera, gun, and helmet each has a glowing red light giving this small room an eerie

08:24.120 --> 08:25.300
tent.

08:25.300 --> 08:28.800
The radio's green light is lit.

08:28.800 --> 08:34.560
Keith, you feel something press against the back of your leg and then the back of your

08:34.560 --> 08:42.160
thigh climbing and then you hear a meow and notice Doug, the cat previously called Salem,

08:42.160 --> 08:44.800
has walked into the room and is pawing at you.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.800
Oh my God.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.440
This poor dude is fucking trapped in a cat's body.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.440
What was it?

08:49.440 --> 08:50.440
How did we communicate with him?

08:50.440 --> 08:51.440
One meow for yes.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.440
Two for no.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.440
Yeah.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.440
What should we ask him?

08:54.440 --> 08:57.820
It looks like he wants to talk to Clark.

08:57.820 --> 08:58.820
Was it me?

08:58.820 --> 08:59.820
That was me.

08:59.820 --> 09:00.820
Oh.

09:00.820 --> 09:01.820
It looks like he wants to talk to Keith.

09:01.820 --> 09:02.820
Hey.

09:02.820 --> 09:03.820
Meow?

09:03.820 --> 09:04.820
Meow.

09:04.820 --> 09:05.820
I am there.

09:05.820 --> 09:06.820
Hey, what?

09:06.820 --> 09:07.820
Shit.

09:07.820 --> 09:08.820
It's yes or no questions.

09:08.820 --> 09:09.820
How you doing?

09:09.820 --> 09:10.820
Meow.

09:10.820 --> 09:11.820
Meow.

09:11.820 --> 09:12.820
Help me out here, guys.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.820
The cat jumps up onto-

09:13.820 --> 09:14.820
Wait.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.820
I've got to.

09:15.820 --> 09:16.820
Okay.

09:16.820 --> 09:17.820
Wait.

09:17.820 --> 09:18.820
Not wait.

09:18.820 --> 09:19.820
I mean, wait.

09:19.820 --> 09:20.820
Me.

09:20.820 --> 09:21.820
Stop talking, Thomas.

09:21.820 --> 09:22.820
You go.

09:23.820 --> 09:24.820
Shut up, Thomas.

09:24.820 --> 09:25.820
Shut up, Thomas.

09:25.820 --> 09:26.820
Stupid piece of shit.

09:26.820 --> 09:33.820
The cat jumps up onto the shelf and immediately starts rubbing against the radio.

09:33.820 --> 09:34.820
Oh, dude.

09:34.820 --> 09:35.820
I'm running out of the room.

09:35.820 --> 09:36.820
Clark is running out of the room.

09:36.820 --> 09:37.820
Get out of there, boys.

09:37.820 --> 09:38.820
You're going to switch a body.

09:38.820 --> 09:41.820
Clark, when you run out, you see Agent Tramp.

09:41.820 --> 09:42.820
He's like, what?

09:42.820 --> 09:43.820
What's going on?

09:43.820 --> 09:44.820
What's going on?

09:44.820 --> 09:45.820
What's going on?

09:45.820 --> 09:46.820
What's going on?

09:46.820 --> 09:47.820
What's going on?

09:47.820 --> 09:48.820
What's going on?

09:48.820 --> 09:49.820
What's going on?

09:49.820 --> 09:50.820
What's going on?

09:50.820 --> 09:51.820
What's going on?

09:51.820 --> 10:00.220
You see Agent Trent Chad still mopping up his Red Bull spill and Drew is sorting through

10:00.220 --> 10:06.660
all these different files and Rosemary, whose name you now know, the Fonzie lady, she is

10:06.660 --> 10:11.980
just standing in the middle with her arms crossed and tapping her foot.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.940
I want to grab the cat by the scruff and get it away from the radio.

10:14.940 --> 10:15.940
You do so.

10:15.940 --> 10:19.100
Doug, are you trying to body swap with us?

10:19.100 --> 10:26.700
When the cat looks at you and you're holding it, I need you to roll a dexterity real quick

10:26.700 --> 10:30.300
because Doug freaks the fuck out when you grab him.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.300
Oh, I pass.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.300
Eight.

10:32.300 --> 10:37.580
Okay, then you can describe as he is looking at you and meowing and losing it.

10:37.580 --> 10:42.640
Yeah, there's just an intricate cat juggle as he tries to get away and then an arm reaches

10:42.640 --> 10:46.420
out blind and just grabs him and brings him out and then the same thing happens again

10:46.420 --> 10:50.660
and then finally I just press him tight to my chest and I look him dead in his little cat eyes.

10:50.660 --> 10:51.660
He looks horrified.

10:51.660 --> 10:52.660
What do you say?

10:52.660 --> 10:58.780
I say, Doug, we're going to do everything we can to get you back to your body, but you

10:58.780 --> 11:00.620
can't be trying to steal ours.

11:00.620 --> 11:04.520
Maybe Chad's later, but not right now.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.900
We kind of need you to just, well, actually maybe right now.

11:07.900 --> 11:08.900
I don't know.

11:08.900 --> 11:14.940
We could get a lot out of you, but hey guys, let's, let's do you want to swap with, yes,

11:14.940 --> 11:15.940
with Chad and Doug?

11:16.460 --> 11:17.460
Yeah, yeah.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.460
I was thinking Rosemary, but she has knowledge that we need.

11:19.460 --> 11:20.460
We need Rosemary, yeah.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.460
Yeah.

11:21.460 --> 11:22.460
Let's do it with FBI guy.

11:22.460 --> 11:23.460
Okay.

11:23.460 --> 11:24.460
All right.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.460
Do you want to be in a presumably hunky FBI agent's body, Doug?

11:26.460 --> 11:29.580
How are we going to do this though?

11:29.580 --> 11:31.940
I don't want to be in that room when that radio goes off.

11:31.940 --> 11:38.500
Doug, if we put a incapacitated Chad in that room with you, could you swap bodies using

11:38.500 --> 11:39.500
that radio?

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
Meow.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.060
Let's do it, boys.

11:43.060 --> 11:44.060
All in favor, say aye.

11:44.060 --> 11:45.060
Clark is out of the evidence.

11:45.060 --> 11:46.780
Clark is out of the evidence room right now.

11:46.780 --> 11:47.780
That's true.

11:47.780 --> 11:48.780
Okay.

11:48.780 --> 11:49.780
Let's just do it.

11:49.780 --> 11:50.780
Let's just do it.

11:50.780 --> 11:51.780
I'll go grab Chad.

11:51.780 --> 11:52.780
Okay.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.780
I walk out into...

11:53.780 --> 11:56.700
Keith, is it, is it you?

11:56.700 --> 11:57.700
It's me.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.180
I'm not, I am me.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.180
We've got a plan though.

12:00.180 --> 12:01.180
Bubblegum tree.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.180
I'm going to walk out too.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.180
Bubblegum tree.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.180
Wait.

12:04.180 --> 12:05.180
Yeah.

12:05.180 --> 12:06.180
So you didn't switch bodies with him?

12:06.180 --> 12:07.300
No, but we got a plan.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.300
Is John?

12:08.300 --> 12:09.300
No, John is still John.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.300
He's Bubblegum tree.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.300
But here, come here.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.300
I got to whisper something to you.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.300
Okay.

12:14.540 --> 12:18.540
We're going to switch Chad's body with Doug's body.

12:18.540 --> 12:21.540
We're going to put Chad in the cat.

12:21.540 --> 12:25.540
Don't, don't tell him though.

12:25.540 --> 12:26.540
Okay.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.260
I mean, does Doug, is Doug okay with that?

12:29.260 --> 12:30.260
He meowed.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.260
He meowed.

12:31.260 --> 12:32.260
He meowed for yes.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.260
What is?

12:33.260 --> 12:34.260
Okay.

12:34.260 --> 12:37.880
I really, I really liked the idea, but he, Doug doesn't know the FBI.

12:37.880 --> 12:41.060
Like we have to have somebody tell the FBI not to come back here.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.060
Uh, we'll just text it from his phone.

12:44.820 --> 12:45.820
Yeah.

12:45.820 --> 12:46.980
That's not too bad, fellas.

12:46.980 --> 12:49.340
So he texts the main office, right?

12:49.340 --> 12:53.700
Says, Hey, listen, I'm not, I'm heading up to the city for the afternoon to do a little

12:53.700 --> 12:55.740
sightseeing and I'll be back tomorrow.

12:55.740 --> 12:59.580
Cause the contention situation is locked down and we can keep them distracted for a little

12:59.580 --> 13:03.340
while because we can just tell Doug what to say cause he'll have Chad's voice.

13:03.340 --> 13:04.340
Oh shit.

13:04.340 --> 13:05.340
Yeah.

13:05.340 --> 13:06.340
We just use Doug.

13:06.340 --> 13:08.840
Hey, can we fight Chad right now?

13:08.840 --> 13:09.840
I don't think we need to.

13:09.840 --> 13:10.840
No, no, no.

13:10.960 --> 13:17.120
Do you think we could take Chad just in case Doug really goes, uh, loose cannon on us?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.120
Oh, that's agent.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.640
Agent Chad looks up.

13:19.640 --> 13:23.160
Would you guys like to fight?

13:23.160 --> 13:29.280
Maybe maybe ladder Chad, buddy, uh, ladder, maybe ladder, mama, ladder, mama, ladder,

13:29.280 --> 13:30.280
big and sign.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.160
Uh, maybe later, Chad, you just go close your little eyes.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.000
Now you just take a little nap immediately.

13:36.120 --> 13:41.920
Chad, while mopping up his red bull spill, which he's been doing for like 10 minutes

13:41.920 --> 13:45.720
now, he just closes his eyes and lays down on the ground.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.320
All right, let's drag him into the room.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.660
He's a better cat than Doug.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.560
We could just, I mean, we can drag him.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
Sure.

13:51.560 --> 13:52.560
I helped.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.560
I helped the dragon.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.560
I mean, we could have just asked him to walk in there with the cat.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.560
Yeah.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.380
But if he's, we drag him into the room with the radio as you drag him in, you notice he's

14:00.380 --> 14:07.860
like squeezing his eyes closed to make sure that he like is staying consistent with your

14:07.860 --> 14:08.860
hopes and dreams.

14:08.860 --> 14:09.860
Yeah.

14:09.860 --> 14:10.860
Hell yeah.

14:10.860 --> 14:13.820
We probably just have Chad press the button then immediately Doug.

14:13.820 --> 14:19.540
This cat is just like walking back and forth meowing just like Doug, we're going to leave

14:19.540 --> 14:22.620
you in the room, do your thing.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.340
We'll be back in a moment.

14:24.340 --> 14:25.340
I'm yeah.

14:25.340 --> 14:29.260
As soon as I'm like across the threshold with the body as far into the door as I can, I'm

14:29.260 --> 14:30.580
stepping over it and out of the door.

14:30.580 --> 14:31.580
Yep.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.580
Say, Hey guys, real quick.

14:32.580 --> 14:36.360
Do you think that, well, I guess it would only be beneficial to us if Doug was still

14:36.360 --> 14:40.460
under the influence of the, Oh, cause it's still in his body.

14:40.460 --> 14:41.460
Yeah.

14:41.460 --> 14:45.460
I was going to think that could be a hindrance, but it'd actually be a great on hindrance

14:45.460 --> 14:46.460
for sure.

14:46.460 --> 14:50.460
We could, we could, uh, we could ask him whatever we need to about how he got that way and all

14:50.460 --> 14:51.460
that stuff.

14:51.460 --> 14:52.460
Yeah.

14:52.460 --> 14:53.460
Okay.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.220
Uh, I, you know, all the boys out, the door shuts.

14:57.220 --> 14:59.140
I put my ear to the door.

14:59.140 --> 15:02.220
I'm looking like under the door for like a flash of light or something.

15:02.220 --> 15:06.980
Clarkie, what do you see, what do you hear?

15:06.980 --> 15:08.980
What do we hear?

15:08.980 --> 15:14.980
You hear some pong about as Doug enjoys his cat body.

15:14.980 --> 15:18.940
One last time.

15:18.940 --> 15:19.940
You hear

15:19.940 --> 15:28.420
he turned on the radio boys.

15:28.420 --> 15:34.660
And then you hear a click, a song start to play from inside the evidence locker of the

15:34.660 --> 15:37.800
police department of contention.

15:37.800 --> 15:46.780
And then you hear the song start to change and you overhear audio that does not make

15:46.780 --> 15:54.460
any sense to you that gets louder until it becomes a jumble and there is a high pitched

15:54.460 --> 15:58.140
noise just screeching in all of your ears.

15:58.140 --> 16:07.820
As you hear a massive, massive noise and a light flashes brightly from all crevices of

16:07.820 --> 16:08.820
the door.

16:08.820 --> 16:14.900
And then there is silence.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.300
And you hear from inside the evidence locker

16:17.300 --> 16:24.980
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

16:24.980 --> 16:25.980
All right.

16:25.980 --> 16:28.180
Oh, all right.

16:28.180 --> 16:29.180
Whoa.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.740
Oh shit.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.740
I knock on the door.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.740
Oh fuck.

16:32.740 --> 16:35.740
Doug, is that you?

16:35.740 --> 16:36.740
Yeah.

16:36.740 --> 16:37.740
Yeah.

16:37.740 --> 16:38.740
Oh man.

16:38.740 --> 16:39.740
Oh man.

16:39.740 --> 16:40.740
Oh, Doug.

16:40.740 --> 16:49.220
Why don't you get up and get on out here?

16:49.220 --> 16:54.620
Whoa, guys, do you know what, can you open up the door?

16:54.620 --> 16:58.820
You hear like, uh, the, the, the handle is moving and he says, can you, can you guys

16:58.820 --> 17:00.460
open up the door for me?

17:00.460 --> 17:07.300
I opened the door for him standing before you is the body of agent Trent Chad.

17:07.300 --> 17:10.280
Also inside is a cat laying on the ground.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.580
Is the cat alive?

17:11.580 --> 17:20.420
The cat wakes up, seemingly opens its eyes, looks around, looks at itself, starts freaking

17:20.420 --> 17:23.020
out and makes a run for the door.

17:23.020 --> 17:24.020
Close the door.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.020
I'm going to try to do a decks check.

17:25.020 --> 17:26.020
Well, yeah.

17:26.020 --> 17:27.020
Close the door.

17:27.020 --> 17:28.020
And also who's got the best decks.

17:28.020 --> 17:30.020
I have 60, 65, 60.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.020
All right.

17:31.020 --> 17:35.100
What do you, what can we do a twofer where he tries to close the door and a cat duty

17:35.100 --> 17:36.100
cat patrol.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.100
All right.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.100
Uh, yeah.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.100
Go ahead and roll first.

17:39.100 --> 17:43.020
Keith to give, uh, to give John a plus 20.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.380
I got a 33.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.540
All right.

17:45.540 --> 17:46.540
That's a Chris success.

17:46.540 --> 17:52.280
You automatically, you guys automatically slam the door in Doug's face immediately upon

17:52.280 --> 17:54.140
the door slamming from inside.

17:54.140 --> 17:57.640
You hear a, Oh, is that what you guys want?

17:57.640 --> 17:58.860
You want it?

17:58.860 --> 17:59.860
Should I be in here?

17:59.860 --> 18:00.860
And Oh God.

18:00.860 --> 18:01.860
Oh no.

18:01.860 --> 18:02.860
Oh fuck.

18:02.860 --> 18:22.620
Why is this not a visual medium?

18:22.620 --> 18:24.620
Your face was amazing.

18:24.620 --> 18:25.620
Yeah.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.620
That was awesome.

18:27.620 --> 18:32.260
Doug subdue the cat.

18:32.660 --> 18:33.660
I've got it.

18:33.660 --> 18:34.660
Okay.

18:34.660 --> 18:41.380
I'm, I'm going to go to the front door of the police department and walk it and make

18:41.380 --> 18:45.220
sure there's no way anybody's living here until we want them to, Hey, Hey, what's going

18:45.220 --> 18:46.220
on in there?

18:46.220 --> 18:48.920
Hey, uh, can I get the gun now please?

18:48.920 --> 18:49.920
In a minute.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.920
Rosemary.

18:50.920 --> 18:51.920
Yeah.

18:51.920 --> 18:52.920
We're dealing with some others.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.580
Hey drew, can you run to the store across the way?

18:55.580 --> 18:56.580
What do you need?

18:56.580 --> 18:57.580
We need a cat carrier.

18:57.580 --> 18:58.580
Okay.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.780
Um, ASAP cat carrier.

19:00.780 --> 19:08.020
Uh, I can go pick one of those up, uh, uh, ASAP Doug, as soon as fucking possible.

19:08.020 --> 19:12.100
Oh, drew, it's been a long night.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.100
My dude.

19:13.100 --> 19:14.100
Yeah.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.100
No, no, no.

19:15.100 --> 19:22.900
I, it's been a long night and uh, drew, uh, drew kind of looks at everyone and looks at

19:22.900 --> 19:28.500
his keys and turns around and runs out of the police station.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.500
Cool.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.500
Oh.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.860
I locked the door behind him.

19:32.860 --> 19:33.980
Let's get Doug in here.

19:33.980 --> 19:38.380
Where's the gun, John Rosemary, you give us one fucking minute.

19:38.380 --> 19:41.220
We're dealing with some body switching shit here.

19:41.220 --> 19:42.220
More crazy.

19:42.220 --> 19:46.260
The kind of stuff your boss is interested in, but like right now you're not necessarily

19:46.260 --> 19:47.620
our number one priority.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.580
It's the guy who just switched bodies with the cat.

19:49.580 --> 19:50.580
Okay.

19:50.580 --> 19:51.860
Well, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

19:51.860 --> 19:52.860
Well, it's related.

19:52.860 --> 19:56.180
You're going to know more later if you just have some fucking patients and hold those

19:56.180 --> 19:57.700
goddamn horses here.

19:57.700 --> 20:00.940
Open the door up and let's Rosemary, you can see all this.

20:00.940 --> 20:01.940
You're about to.

20:01.940 --> 20:03.020
Yeah, you'll see it.

20:03.020 --> 20:04.220
You're like a mob enforcer.

20:04.220 --> 20:06.580
We're just letting hang out in our police station.

20:06.580 --> 20:19.260
So could you just like chill, chill, uh, go ahead and roll, uh, persuade.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.260
No.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.260
Okay.

20:21.260 --> 20:26.060
And just, uh, walked, unlocked the door of the police station and walks out.

20:26.060 --> 20:28.900
That's probably good for us in the long run.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.420
I mean, where's she going to go?

20:30.420 --> 20:31.720
She doesn't have a car here.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.340
She also doesn't have a gun.

20:33.340 --> 20:34.340
Yeah.

20:34.340 --> 20:36.480
Let's deal with Doug real quick.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.060
Or should we try to stop her?

20:38.060 --> 20:39.060
Yeah.

20:39.060 --> 20:40.060
I don't know.

20:40.060 --> 20:41.740
Doug, Rick, we might have to deal with something real quick.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.260
Uh, just to double check.

20:43.260 --> 20:46.220
Do you feel compelled to acquiesce to our desires?

20:46.220 --> 20:48.020
Is that what you would like me to do?

20:48.020 --> 20:49.020
Cool, cool, cool.

20:49.020 --> 20:50.020
Hold on to that cat.

20:50.020 --> 20:51.020
We'll be right back.

20:51.020 --> 20:52.340
And I run out after Rosemary.

20:52.340 --> 20:53.340
Okay.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.300
What are the two of you doing, Clark and Keith?

20:55.300 --> 20:59.540
I'm going to stand by inside the police department just to make sure he stays in here.

20:59.540 --> 21:01.420
I'm back in full uniform, right?

21:01.420 --> 21:02.420
Yeah.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.420
I'll follow John out.

21:03.420 --> 21:04.420
Okay.

21:04.420 --> 21:05.420
Rosemary.

21:05.420 --> 21:06.420
Rosemary, wait.

21:06.420 --> 21:15.460
When you run outside, you actually see Drew is in his car and he's about to back up and

21:15.460 --> 21:19.220
Rosemary is standing behind, banging on the trunk.

21:19.220 --> 21:21.820
Rosemary, that's a very nice...

21:21.820 --> 21:23.780
I pull my gun and point it at her.

21:23.780 --> 21:24.780
All right.

21:24.780 --> 21:27.100
Rosemary, hold on, hold on.

21:27.100 --> 21:31.780
Get your man to open up the trunk door and then he can go get your cat carrier and I'll

21:31.780 --> 21:33.200
come right back inside.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.200
It's all fine.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.200
Okay.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.200
Everything's fine.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.100
I'm going to come right back inside.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.820
Just open up the trunk, Drew.

21:40.820 --> 21:42.220
I drew all my gun too.

21:42.220 --> 21:43.860
What's what's in the trunk, Rosemary?

21:43.860 --> 21:45.860
I'm going to roll a...

21:45.860 --> 21:46.860
All right.

21:46.860 --> 21:51.540
Drew pops open the trunk and she says, thank you.

21:51.540 --> 21:57.500
She reaches in and pulls out a briefcase, closes the door, hits the back of the trunk

21:57.500 --> 21:59.340
and says, all right, Drew, you can go.

21:59.340 --> 22:01.460
And then starts walking back toward you guys.

22:01.460 --> 22:03.900
The gun lowered a little bit, but still out.

22:03.900 --> 22:04.900
Same.

22:04.900 --> 22:08.980
And she's just holding a metal briefcase and walking toward you.

22:08.980 --> 22:11.180
Rosemary, what's in the briefcase there?

22:11.180 --> 22:13.180
Five million dollars.

22:13.180 --> 22:14.740
Interesting.

22:14.740 --> 22:17.300
Why?

22:17.300 --> 22:18.540
It's not yours.

22:18.540 --> 22:19.540
Is it yours?

22:19.540 --> 22:20.540
It is now.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.860
Want to go have these?

22:23.860 --> 22:24.860
No, thank you.

22:24.860 --> 22:30.260
And she walks past you and heads to the door of the police station.

22:30.260 --> 22:33.940
I turned to John, do you have any idea what the...

22:33.940 --> 22:35.820
I've got no fucking clue what's going on.

22:35.820 --> 22:37.580
Five million is?

22:37.580 --> 22:39.700
She opens up the door and walks into the police station.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.580
I guess she's back where we wanted her.

22:42.580 --> 22:48.700
I assume so, though much wealthier than all of us, which I think means she's our boss

22:48.740 --> 22:53.140
by American rules.

22:53.140 --> 22:54.420
Is she our new chief?

22:54.420 --> 22:59.060
There's only one rule here in America.

22:59.060 --> 23:02.380
The almighty dollar.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.580
Whoever has the most money is the chief of police.

23:05.580 --> 23:09.260
Yeah, that's kind of how it works.

23:09.260 --> 23:13.860
Dude, if either one of us win the Mega Millions tonight, we're going to have the best podcast

23:13.860 --> 23:17.900
of all time.

23:18.100 --> 23:20.100
Welcome to Pretend to Be People.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.980
Oh man, we can finally get that.

23:21.980 --> 23:23.820
We can buy the Nat soundboard.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.620
That Thomas soundboard we've all been wanting.

23:26.620 --> 23:27.620
We can hire...

23:27.620 --> 23:28.620
Nice.

23:28.620 --> 23:29.620
Nice.

23:29.620 --> 23:30.620
No, no, no, no, no.

23:30.620 --> 23:31.620
Nice.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.820
We just have professional voice actors that we dictate everything we speak of.

23:34.820 --> 23:39.100
I mean, yeah, that's the plan for this actual podcast, right?

23:39.100 --> 23:40.340
That's where we're headed.

23:40.340 --> 23:41.340
Yeah, this is...

23:41.340 --> 23:42.820
What we've been doing is a rough draft.

23:42.820 --> 23:43.820
It's a rough script.

23:43.820 --> 23:45.540
Yeah, we're going to have...

23:45.540 --> 23:47.340
It's the pilot season.

23:47.780 --> 23:53.420
Sam Rockwell and Jake as Keith Vigna on a podcast for whatever reason.

23:53.420 --> 23:56.780
Idris Elba is playing Maggie Cook.

23:56.780 --> 23:57.780
Nice.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.620
Makes lots of sense.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.260
Clark goes back inside.

24:01.260 --> 24:03.300
John also goes back inside.

24:03.300 --> 24:09.340
I see them come back inside and I open up the door and I let Doug in to the main room.

24:09.340 --> 24:16.420
He kind of throws the cat back into the evidence room as you shut the door and he walks out

24:16.420 --> 24:22.500
and he looks at his hands and he's like, wow, everything is very weird.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.860
Doug, do you remember who you are?

24:25.860 --> 24:37.780
Yeah, I remember that and then he looks past you and his eyes widen and he says, oh my

24:37.780 --> 24:39.860
God, oh my God.

24:39.860 --> 24:44.580
And he starts freaking out and he backs up back against the wall and then he just starts

24:44.580 --> 24:48.620
moving and just dodging and trying to run away.

24:48.620 --> 24:49.620
There's the ooze.

24:49.620 --> 24:50.620
Get it back.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.620
The ooze is here, guys.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.620
The fucking ooze.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.620
Water, water, water.

24:53.620 --> 25:00.140
I run into the sink that's in the police department.

25:00.140 --> 25:02.300
You run into the sink.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.300
Is it there?

25:03.300 --> 25:04.300
You actually bump into it.

25:04.300 --> 25:09.200
I grab the biggest container I can find, probably a bowl, but if not a cup, fill it with water

25:09.200 --> 25:13.140
and I'm throwing it over my shoulders close to Doug as I can.

25:13.140 --> 25:20.340
I go to the other sink and I just smash the faucet off so water is spraying everywhere.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.780
I asked, Doug, can you see the ooze right now?

25:22.780 --> 25:24.660
Yes, it's right there.

25:24.660 --> 25:25.660
It's right there.

25:25.660 --> 25:26.660
Don't let it touch you.

25:26.660 --> 25:27.660
Don't let it touch you.

25:27.660 --> 25:28.660
Where's he pointing to?

25:28.660 --> 25:31.500
He's just pointing on the ground in the middle of the room.

25:31.500 --> 25:35.340
So is water spraying, is water spraying everywhere?

25:35.340 --> 25:36.340
Are we getting close?

25:36.340 --> 25:37.340
Am I hitting it with water?

25:37.340 --> 25:38.340
Am I?

25:38.340 --> 25:39.340
Uh, I'm sorry.

25:39.340 --> 25:40.340
Cause there's no way I would know.

25:40.340 --> 25:41.860
Am I hitting them where he's pointing with water?

25:41.860 --> 25:46.340
So in your mind, where is the sink in the police station?

25:46.340 --> 25:51.340
I was picturing in my head just now like a firehouse kitchen to where it's like just

25:51.340 --> 25:53.580
the, the side of the half of a room.

25:53.580 --> 25:54.580
Sure.

25:54.580 --> 25:55.580
Yeah.

25:55.580 --> 25:56.580
Like that's kind of what I was like.

25:56.580 --> 25:57.580
No real separation.

25:57.580 --> 25:58.580
Yeah.

25:58.580 --> 25:59.580
Just like a break room.

25:59.580 --> 26:00.580
Microwave sink.

26:00.580 --> 26:01.580
Right.

26:01.580 --> 26:02.580
Toaster.

26:02.580 --> 26:03.580
You know what I can picture?

26:03.580 --> 26:04.580
That.

26:04.580 --> 26:05.580
Cool.

26:05.580 --> 26:06.580
So I smashed a bathroom.

26:06.580 --> 26:07.580
I smashed a bathroom fixture.

26:08.060 --> 26:10.860
Open the cabinet doors up and break the pipe off.

26:10.860 --> 26:11.860
Yeah.

26:11.860 --> 26:19.200
So you've got water flowing out from that side of the very open floor plan of the contention

26:19.200 --> 26:21.180
police department.

26:21.180 --> 26:27.860
Doug is still freaking out and sprinting about and Drew does not know or Drew's not there.

26:27.860 --> 26:30.940
Rosemary has absolutely no idea what's going on.

26:30.940 --> 26:36.980
She has walked over to Drew's desk and is like sitting up on top of the desk, just Indian

26:36.980 --> 26:38.700
style holding the briefcase.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.180
It's called crisscross applesauce now.

26:40.180 --> 26:42.180
I am so sorry.

26:42.180 --> 26:44.180
Sitting crisscross applesauce.

26:44.180 --> 26:45.180
Fuck.

26:45.180 --> 26:48.180
We got him.

26:48.180 --> 26:49.740
Boom.

26:49.740 --> 26:54.220
I guess I run over to where the water's flowing out and stand there just to be safe.

26:54.220 --> 26:55.220
Yeah.

26:55.220 --> 26:56.220
Doug get, get to the water.

26:56.220 --> 26:59.100
He runs over and joins you and stays calm.

26:59.100 --> 27:02.780
Doug, how big is the Zeus?

27:02.780 --> 27:07.920
And his eyes get bigger than they were even a second ago.

27:07.920 --> 27:14.060
The water is not stopping it.

27:14.060 --> 27:20.580
And he sprints around the outside of the room and heads for the front door of the police

27:20.580 --> 27:21.580
station.

27:21.580 --> 27:26.220
Doug, if you head outside, please just remain right there and wait for further instruction.

27:26.220 --> 27:27.900
I think I run after him.

27:27.900 --> 27:28.900
I think I do too.

27:28.900 --> 27:29.900
Like out of scare.

27:29.900 --> 27:30.900
Yeah.

27:30.900 --> 27:34.820
I'm going to try to find a vacuum, like a little dust devil, like handheld.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.820
Okay.

27:35.820 --> 27:41.500
So you're going to try to find your little vacuum and Keith and Clark are running after

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
Doug.

27:42.500 --> 27:48.620
I abandoned my fireman's bucket line of water over my shoulder and yeah, it's hightailing

27:48.620 --> 27:49.620
it.

27:49.620 --> 27:50.620
Following the same path that he took.

27:50.620 --> 27:51.620
Same.

27:51.620 --> 27:52.620
Yeah.

27:52.620 --> 27:53.620
Following the same path.

27:53.620 --> 27:59.580
As you get to the front door, you see him standing in the parking lot and I need whoever

27:59.580 --> 28:03.140
has the worst luck to roll luck right now for me.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.140
What do you guys have?

28:05.140 --> 28:06.140
75.

28:06.140 --> 28:07.140
45.

28:07.140 --> 28:08.140
65.

28:08.140 --> 28:09.140
They're the ones outside though.

28:09.140 --> 28:10.140
Did you mean of all of us?

28:10.140 --> 28:11.140
I said what I meant.

28:11.140 --> 28:12.140
I know what you meant.

28:12.140 --> 28:14.740
I didn't hear you say oh.

28:14.740 --> 28:15.740
I pass.

28:15.740 --> 28:16.740
Crit pass.

28:16.740 --> 28:17.740
Motherfucker.

28:17.740 --> 28:18.740
33.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.740
33 baby.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.740
That's two 33s tonight.

28:20.740 --> 28:21.740
Yeah, that is.

28:21.740 --> 28:24.260
I hope that's on my mega millions ticket.

28:24.260 --> 28:32.020
Clark, Keith, you run out the front door of the police station and see Doug standing in

28:32.020 --> 28:35.220
the middle of the parking lot of the police and contention.

28:35.220 --> 28:36.220
The fuck.

28:36.220 --> 28:45.460
You see him standing in the middle of the parking lot and he is on his hands and knees

28:45.460 --> 28:47.420
and he is weeping.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.700
I yell at Doug.

28:49.700 --> 28:50.980
You still see it.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.660
Doug, come on buddy.

28:52.660 --> 28:53.660
Come on.

28:53.660 --> 28:56.100
I don't know what I see.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.100
I don't see anything.

28:58.100 --> 29:05.380
I go up to him and I slap him in the face and I say snap out of it, man.

29:05.380 --> 29:06.580
Doug, we can't see it.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.380
We need you to tell us if it's here.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.380
I can't.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.940
I can't see anything.

29:11.940 --> 29:14.660
I don't know what's going on anymore.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.660
It's just real.

29:17.660 --> 29:25.780
And he just throws up onto the parking lot and he's now, I mean, completely bent over.

29:25.780 --> 29:28.620
Snot is just pouring out of his nose.

29:28.620 --> 29:33.060
He's like kind of spitting on the ground and he's like, I just don't know.

29:33.060 --> 29:36.100
Is Keith's car in the lot with us?

29:36.100 --> 29:37.100
The Cruiser is indeed.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.100
Yes.

29:38.100 --> 29:39.100
Okay.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.380
Hey Keith, let's get him up into your car, man.

29:41.380 --> 29:45.020
I put an arm under his arm.

29:45.020 --> 29:46.020
I'll take the other?

29:46.900 --> 29:47.900
Let's put him in the back.

29:47.900 --> 29:53.740
I'm trying to give reassuring words, but I'm also, Clark needs him to shape up.

29:53.740 --> 29:56.900
I want to know for sure what he sees.

29:56.900 --> 30:02.900
I cast zone of truth.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.540
Mage Hand.

30:05.540 --> 30:07.620
He's weeping as you get him to the police cruiser.

30:07.620 --> 30:09.500
I would like to persuade him not to weep.

30:09.500 --> 30:10.500
I'm kidding.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.500
I'm not even in.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.580
Let's cut back to John in the police department.

30:13.580 --> 30:14.580
You find a vacuum.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.580
What are you doing with it?

30:15.660 --> 30:20.940
Well, so not being able to see anything, I'm just like dancing from side to side, like

30:20.940 --> 30:26.700
jumping back and forth and just like stabbing out in the air with this little dust devil.

30:26.700 --> 30:31.700
What do you think, music wise, what's set to this?

30:31.700 --> 30:32.940
I think it's totally silent.

30:32.940 --> 30:43.180
I think you just hear his foot falls in wet wet squeaky feet and like Rosemary faintly

30:43.180 --> 30:50.780
chuckling shut up, Rosemary, John, you look stupid.

30:50.780 --> 30:51.780
Damn it.

30:51.780 --> 30:58.540
I know cutting back, you get him into the police cruiser and he immediately just folds

30:58.540 --> 31:01.380
a head into hands and he's breaking down.

31:01.380 --> 31:05.260
When he looks at you guys, you see a ghost of a man.

31:05.260 --> 31:12.660
I want to say, Hey, Hey, Hey Doug, will you, will you wipe your brow with your right hand?

31:13.140 --> 31:14.140
He does so.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.140
Okay.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.460
I wanted to make sure he was still under the influence.

31:17.460 --> 31:18.460
Okay.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.500
That's, this is all understandable.

31:20.500 --> 31:24.300
He's a man who became a cat who became a different man.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.620
Very hard to process.

31:26.620 --> 31:38.620
I uh, he starts coughing.

31:38.620 --> 31:39.880
I start petting him on the back.

31:39.880 --> 31:40.880
Get it out bud.

31:40.880 --> 31:41.880
Get it out.

31:43.660 --> 31:47.940
And no fur comes up cause he's in a human body now that didn't eat any hair.

31:47.940 --> 31:53.060
Uh, but he just throws up a little bile onto the floor of the police cruiser.

31:53.060 --> 31:54.060
Old habits die hard.

31:54.060 --> 31:57.660
I know, but how long were you in that body?

31:57.660 --> 31:58.660
I don't know.

31:58.660 --> 32:02.980
Time, time isn't, isn't real.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.260
And I was so cold.

32:05.260 --> 32:10.460
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, we don't have any idea where your wife is.

32:10.460 --> 32:22.260
Just kidding.

32:22.260 --> 32:23.260
That's not true.

32:23.260 --> 32:26.980
I think we have a pretty good idea where she is.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.400
The upside down.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.100
He looks up at you guys.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.460
What's happening?

32:32.460 --> 32:34.160
Why is this happening?

32:34.160 --> 32:39.620
Do you remember anything before you change, changed bodies with that cat?

32:39.620 --> 32:42.540
Yeah, I, what led up to that happening?

32:42.540 --> 32:55.360
I was, uh, I was sick and uh, Marie was, uh, taking care of me and she brought, she brought

32:55.360 --> 33:05.340
in this radio is that radio, that fucking radio and she turned it on and I, I don't

33:05.340 --> 33:06.340
know.

33:06.340 --> 33:07.340
Then it's just flashes.

33:07.340 --> 33:08.460
I was cold.

33:08.460 --> 33:09.460
I was in the water.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.180
I mean, I was running away from this.

33:12.180 --> 33:13.340
It felt like a dream.

33:13.340 --> 33:19.940
I think I was dreaming and then he, uh, he looks up and he, he catches a glimpse of himself

33:19.940 --> 33:25.860
in the rear view mirror of the cruiser and he's like, this is a dream.

33:25.860 --> 33:26.980
This is a dream.

33:26.980 --> 33:27.980
This is a dream.

33:27.980 --> 33:28.980
This is a dream.

33:28.980 --> 33:29.980
I'm going to dream.

33:29.980 --> 33:30.980
You're in a dream.

33:30.980 --> 33:34.040
You're in my dream and uh, we're all in this dream and it's fine.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.040
Everything's fine.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.580
I'm just going to wake up and everything's going to be fine.

33:36.580 --> 33:37.580
You're fine.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.580
It's fine.

33:38.580 --> 33:39.580
Everything's going to be fine.

33:39.580 --> 33:40.580
You're not dreaming, Doug.

33:40.580 --> 33:41.580
I look at Keith.

33:41.580 --> 33:42.580
I mean, sure.

33:42.580 --> 33:44.460
Hey Doug, you're right.

33:44.460 --> 33:50.860
This is, this is just a crazy dream and as soon as it's run its course, you'll wake up

33:50.860 --> 33:54.540
next to Marie and everything's going to be all right.

33:54.540 --> 33:58.700
But for now, why not give us as much help as you can?

33:58.700 --> 33:59.700
What's the worst that could happen?

33:59.700 --> 34:00.700
It's just a dream.

34:00.700 --> 34:01.700
No Dougie, no cry.

34:01.700 --> 34:02.700
All right.

34:02.700 --> 34:03.700
What do we do?

34:04.420 --> 34:05.420
What do we do?

34:05.420 --> 34:08.700
Well, I got, I got, I got a question for you, Doug.

34:08.700 --> 34:12.300
When we, when you were in that cat body, you seemed real confident when we asked you if

34:12.300 --> 34:16.020
you knew how to use the radio to switch bodies back.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.660
How did you know how to do it so well?

34:18.660 --> 34:19.980
She just turned it on.

34:19.980 --> 34:24.300
So you, you, is there a chance we, you could have switched bodies with any of us as far

34:24.300 --> 34:28.460
as you know, or did you know that you were going to go into the detective's body somehow?

34:28.460 --> 34:29.460
The detective?

34:29.460 --> 34:30.460
I'm sorry.

34:30.460 --> 34:31.740
Uh, the body that you're in right now.

34:31.780 --> 34:37.700
I just knew that I, there was a great chance that I wasn't going to be a cat anymore.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.700
Okay.

34:38.700 --> 34:43.540
So you didn't like think real hard about wanting to be that body on the floor or anything

34:43.540 --> 34:44.540
like that?

34:44.540 --> 34:48.980
No, I was just thinking about being, I mean, when I was in there, sure.

34:48.980 --> 34:55.220
I was just thinking like, be a human, be a human, be a human, but like, you know, like,

34:55.220 --> 34:56.460
what's that even mean?

34:56.460 --> 34:57.460
You know?

34:57.460 --> 34:58.460
Sure.

34:58.940 --> 35:00.740
It's a dream.

35:00.740 --> 35:10.860
Doesn't have to make any sense over his head at Keith and roll my eyes.

35:10.860 --> 35:16.220
Cutting back to in the police department, John, you're, you're vacuuming around and

35:16.220 --> 35:20.820
just like sprinting all over the place, leaping from side to side.

35:20.820 --> 35:27.300
As you do, you see there is a briefcase that is like a leather briefcase that you haven't

35:27.340 --> 35:31.140
seen before ever in the police department.

35:31.140 --> 35:38.060
And it has a little plaque on it, placard that just says, uh, agent Chad on it.

35:38.060 --> 35:42.480
And as you're going about your business, uh, you notice that on one of the desks.

35:42.480 --> 35:47.020
So I'm going to stop in my tracks for just a moment.

35:47.020 --> 35:51.020
Does a goo monster eat me roll now?

35:51.020 --> 35:52.020
You're good.

35:52.020 --> 35:53.020
Okay.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.580
I take a breath.

35:55.580 --> 35:59.620
I'm standing there for maybe like 15, 20 seconds.

35:59.620 --> 36:03.260
And then I go over to the, once I'm sure the coast is clear, I go over to the case.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.940
Uh, why'd you stop dancing?

36:05.940 --> 36:10.100
I think that might've been some kind of illusory goo monster, but I'm not really sure.

36:10.100 --> 36:11.460
Oh yeah, totally.

36:11.460 --> 36:16.300
We're dealing with a man who had his brain transferred into a cat.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.300
Yeah, that all adds up.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.300
More like his consciousness.

36:18.300 --> 36:19.300
Sure.

36:19.300 --> 36:21.020
You're such a dick, Rosemary.

36:21.020 --> 36:24.500
Well, you're a fucking idiot and you're talking nonsense.

36:25.500 --> 36:31.020
Smarter than you says under his breath.

36:31.020 --> 36:32.780
That is actually true for the listeners.

36:32.780 --> 36:38.260
Uh, John has a 75 intelligence and Rosemary has a 45.

36:38.260 --> 36:42.140
I'm way smarter than you.

36:42.140 --> 36:45.380
So I go over to the case and see if I can, is it locked or anything?

36:45.380 --> 36:46.760
No, it's not locked.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.740
What has Chad been up to?

36:48.740 --> 36:52.740
When you open it, you notice there are a lot of things inside this briefcase.

36:52.980 --> 36:55.340
There's a lot of things inside this briefcase.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.340
Four specifically.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.660
Well, I mean, several.

36:59.660 --> 37:02.220
But the first thing is a bunch of signs.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.420
Rosemary, I think it's a sign.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.940
It's a bunch of these signs.

37:06.940 --> 37:15.620
There is also a list that is right here and there is also a map that is right here and

37:15.620 --> 37:21.580
there's also a little device in there that you would recognize as a cell phone jammer

37:21.580 --> 37:23.540
and it is turned on.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.540
It's strawberry.

37:24.540 --> 37:26.900
Cutting back into the parking lot.

37:26.900 --> 37:29.660
Oh shit, Keith, John.

37:29.660 --> 37:34.060
Oh, Doug, we need you to come tell us if you see any of that goo.

37:34.060 --> 37:36.780
I don't know.

37:36.780 --> 37:40.340
You know, honestly, I'm pretty sure I was just seeing that stuff.

37:40.340 --> 37:43.820
Well, why don't you just come in with us and just double check.

37:43.820 --> 37:44.820
Okay.

37:44.820 --> 37:49.020
And so he gets out and he's, you know, he's still trying to get it together.

37:49.020 --> 37:51.420
He's crying a bit.

37:51.420 --> 37:53.980
He's crying a bit, but you guys get him in.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.180
What do you see, Doug?

37:55.180 --> 37:56.180
Looks around.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.180
It must be gone now.

37:58.180 --> 37:59.780
No goo.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.660
Got a wet floor though, seemingly.

38:01.660 --> 38:05.820
And then he kind of walks over to where you guys just were in the mirror above the sink

38:05.820 --> 38:10.620
and he just stares in it and he starts feeling his face.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.660
I walk over to John.

38:12.660 --> 38:14.260
What you looking at there?

38:14.260 --> 38:15.260
Hey guys.

38:15.300 --> 38:20.260
So, Agent Chad had some weird stuff in his briefcase.

38:20.260 --> 38:23.220
You should probably take a look at this.

38:23.220 --> 38:27.740
I was just going to say we might be careful though in case he had some like, since the

38:27.740 --> 38:33.120
animals seem to have been able to see the goo and maybe he just had some residuals from

38:33.120 --> 38:35.380
being a cat, that goo might still be in here.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.780
Hey Doug, you think the goo is still in here?

38:37.780 --> 38:44.180
I don't, honestly, I just, um, I don't know what you're talking about.

38:45.180 --> 38:48.300
You think the scary thing, the thing that scared you?

38:48.300 --> 38:54.820
Yeah, I, you know, I've been through a lot and I just, um, you know, I think I just freaked

38:54.820 --> 39:01.580
out but everything seems to be fine, uh, now, you know, I don't, I think my head is clear.

39:01.580 --> 39:06.860
It's, uh, I don't know if you were aware of this, but you're in my dream right now, where

39:06.860 --> 39:11.500
I'm another person, which is nuts, uh, so, you know.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.660
That seems like pretty standard dream stuff for me.

39:13.660 --> 39:18.380
No, I don't think I've ever had a dream where I wasn't myself, but, uh, here is a little

39:18.380 --> 39:23.740
dust devil in case you get the wheelies again and then you can scoop, you can scoop it up.

39:23.740 --> 39:25.900
You can scoop up the, with the dust devil?

39:25.900 --> 39:26.900
Yeah.

39:26.900 --> 39:27.900
Yeah.

39:27.900 --> 39:28.900
All right.

39:28.900 --> 39:29.900
And then he grabs it.

39:29.900 --> 39:30.900
All right.

39:30.900 --> 39:31.900
He just kind of rubs it, keeps looking in the mirror.

39:31.900 --> 39:37.740
He's, he's really, you know, as one might be when in a different body, he is fascinated

39:37.740 --> 39:38.740
by his reflection.

39:38.740 --> 39:39.740
Sure.

39:39.740 --> 39:40.740
Yeah.

39:40.820 --> 39:45.900
As you guys probably saw, Chad had this, these signs to put up all over town, uh, saying

39:45.900 --> 39:49.660
attention a chemical spill from the unincorporated land.

39:49.660 --> 39:56.100
Once the town perdition just west of contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.580
Don't forget your pets.

39:57.580 --> 40:01.140
There's this list of all the places he was going to post the signage at.

40:01.140 --> 40:04.420
It's all, it's all the main hotspots in town here.

40:04.420 --> 40:08.780
You talk, talk about that one for an equal opportunity podcast.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.740
Everybody gets to read a little something.

40:10.740 --> 40:14.180
Uh, yeah, he's also, uh, got this map here.

40:14.180 --> 40:18.900
It's it's color coded showing all the missing persons and the days that they all left.

40:18.900 --> 40:22.020
And it would have been nice to have had drew tell us about that.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.240
It would have been, he had a lot on his mind.

40:24.240 --> 40:28.220
It's over the dates of December 1st, December 2nd and December 3rd.

40:28.220 --> 40:32.700
There's a couple of dots on December 1st, three on the second and then an explosion

40:32.700 --> 40:33.700
on the third.

40:33.700 --> 40:34.700
That's correct.

40:34.700 --> 40:35.700
Dots all over the town.

40:35.700 --> 40:36.700
Okay.

40:36.700 --> 40:37.700
Yeah.

40:37.700 --> 40:40.580
So if you get a chance to study that list, is there anything out of the ordinary?

40:40.580 --> 40:44.180
That list is just a list of the places that exist in contention.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.180
Okay.

40:45.180 --> 40:46.180
Okay.

40:46.180 --> 40:47.180
Yeah.

40:47.180 --> 40:48.980
I don't think there's anything further to examine in that list.

40:48.980 --> 40:53.580
Rosemary says, well, didn't he, uh, didn't he get there this morning before any place

40:53.580 --> 40:54.580
opened?

40:54.580 --> 40:56.740
Probably didn't have a chance yet to go to any of them.

40:56.740 --> 41:00.900
That's why there's so many posters in the whatever you guys are.

41:00.900 --> 41:01.900
Yeah.

41:01.900 --> 41:05.740
I mean, what are you Rosemary?

41:05.740 --> 41:06.740
Rosemary.

41:06.780 --> 41:09.020
Clearly he hadn't put the signs up yet.

41:09.020 --> 41:12.580
I don't know what you're trying to tell us yet.

41:12.580 --> 41:14.980
He didn't put the signs up yet.

41:14.980 --> 41:17.260
That's why they're in the briefcase.

41:17.260 --> 41:21.820
And it looks like there's a little squares for him to make a check mark where he went

41:21.820 --> 41:22.820
and there are no checkmarks.

41:22.820 --> 41:23.820
I'm sorry.

41:23.820 --> 41:24.820
I cut you off.

41:24.820 --> 41:25.820
I said what I needed to say.

41:25.820 --> 41:29.900
Rosemary, do you think you're telling us something new?

41:29.900 --> 41:31.180
We all got that pretty quick.

41:31.180 --> 41:32.180
Yeah.

41:32.180 --> 41:34.460
It's just been a while since I talked to him.

41:34.460 --> 41:37.580
I just want to remind you that my intelligence is 45.

41:37.580 --> 41:39.380
All right.

41:39.380 --> 41:44.940
What a weird way to quantify your own intelligence, but, uh, out of 50 in my mom's eyes.

41:44.940 --> 41:45.940
Yeah.

41:45.940 --> 41:47.340
Mama's love us all.

41:47.340 --> 41:48.340
What do we do now guys?

41:48.340 --> 41:54.500
Well, I would still like to talk to the, uh, the big guy in the city with Rosemary here.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.020
Well, what should we do with Doug?

41:56.020 --> 41:57.980
Well, Doug is a very useful tool.

41:57.980 --> 41:58.980
Yeah.

41:58.980 --> 42:01.580
We want him to stick with us for as long as possible at this point.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.940
Also seems like we could probably get more information out of them.

42:03.940 --> 42:08.060
Well, I think if you want to go by yourself, you want to come with, I mean, you are going

42:08.060 --> 42:14.360
to go talk to a mob boss, so maybe it's not the safest for one police officer to go kind

42:14.360 --> 42:18.300
of seems safer than being in a town with a goo monster, but Clark or Clark.

42:18.300 --> 42:19.300
Hey Clark.

42:19.300 --> 42:20.300
Yes.

42:20.300 --> 42:21.300
Joe.

42:21.300 --> 42:27.980
Oh, it's fun to watch someone break mentally in person.

42:27.980 --> 42:32.980
Hey John, can you remind me why did the, the Bob want the gun?

42:33.020 --> 42:42.860
All right, so John Peters owed money, gambling debts, we assume to the mob, uh, to the glass

42:42.860 --> 42:44.780
crime family.

42:44.780 --> 42:49.620
He sent his two boys down there, Marvin glass, sent his two boys to go collect that money

42:49.620 --> 42:57.580
after Peters had already come in to possession of the artifacts and some magic fuckery happened.

42:57.580 --> 43:01.420
One of the boys disappeared, Jermaine Jermaine.

43:01.460 --> 43:06.580
The other one is a babbling idiot just talking about that gun now, Alfred, gun boy.

43:06.580 --> 43:10.740
So that's really all Rosemary knows is that she's supposed to come down here and get this

43:10.740 --> 43:15.180
gun gun and take it back to, uh, the Marvin glass boss.

43:15.180 --> 43:16.180
Yeah.

43:16.180 --> 43:19.980
And after we got to talking, I was thinking that, you know, perhaps we could recruit this

43:19.980 --> 43:26.620
Marvin glass and his army of games to help us out down here in exchange for maybe getting

43:26.620 --> 43:30.540
his boy back from the upside down.

43:30.540 --> 43:36.500
So you're hoping that this gun means that much to him, but that's your big, that's your

43:36.500 --> 43:37.500
bargaining chip, right?

43:37.500 --> 43:42.180
I'm hoping, well, I'm hoping his bullet means that much to him, but yeah, the gun is the

43:42.180 --> 43:43.660
bridge to the boy.

43:43.660 --> 43:46.260
I pulled John far away from Rosemary.

43:46.260 --> 43:48.000
I mean, that's what we're bluffing, right?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.020
We don't know where the gun works.

43:50.020 --> 43:54.780
I don't know fucking shit about how the gun works, but we fucking like, that's kind of

43:54.780 --> 43:57.260
my whole pitch to Mr. Glass.

43:57.260 --> 44:01.380
It's like, Hey man, there's some weird supernatural shit happening.

44:01.380 --> 44:06.940
And uh, if you want your boy back, we could really use any operational assistance your

44:06.940 --> 44:14.080
organization could provide that comes without the pesky oversight of say the FBI.

44:14.080 --> 44:17.860
So I thought maybe he could pitch in and would have a strong motivation to do so.

44:17.860 --> 44:19.420
I E it's child.

44:19.420 --> 44:20.420
Yeah.

44:20.420 --> 44:21.420
I don't know.

44:21.420 --> 44:26.020
It sounds risky, but if you think you can do it, the manpower would be helpful.

44:26.060 --> 44:27.060
Yeah.

44:27.060 --> 44:31.860
And just, you know, more minds on this thing, crime boys thinking crime ways, it's a criminal

44:31.860 --> 44:32.860
goo.

44:32.860 --> 44:34.100
It's already taken so many people.

44:34.100 --> 44:41.860
So it's a criminal goo.

44:41.860 --> 44:42.860
Yeah.

44:42.860 --> 44:43.860
Okay.

44:43.860 --> 44:51.420
Well, so one thing I think we should definitely do is, is there any truth to this?

44:51.420 --> 44:53.260
Was this talk of the chemical spill?

44:53.260 --> 44:54.760
That's probably just a cover up.

44:54.760 --> 44:57.000
Is it a cover up or is there some truth to it?

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Yeah.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Something happened in Perdition.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.640
That could be that they think that there's something moving this way either way.

45:02.640 --> 45:03.640
Exactly.

45:03.640 --> 45:07.280
I also think maybe it's not a bad idea to just go ahead and post those around town to

45:07.280 --> 45:08.640
save more people.

45:08.640 --> 45:09.640
I'm with you.

45:09.640 --> 45:10.640
Yeah.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.000
Uh, but maybe we go check out Perdition.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.840
Also get some of these protesters out of our hair.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.000
Yeah, for sure.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.480
Do we, do we need to edit our radio message to adhere to the attention signs that we've

45:22.480 --> 45:23.640
just now gotten?

45:23.640 --> 45:24.640
That would not be a bad idea.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.520
We could have Doug do that right now.

45:26.520 --> 45:27.520
Hopefully.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.520
Yeah.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.520
Hey Doug.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.520
Yeah.

45:30.520 --> 45:31.520
Come over here for a second.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.520
Sure.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.520
Can you, uh, here, let me, let me just write it down and I write down exactly what I want

45:34.520 --> 45:35.520
him to say.

45:35.520 --> 45:36.520
Okay.

45:36.520 --> 45:40.240
Would you mind reading this into this recorder here for us and just, just read it as naturally

45:40.240 --> 45:41.240
as you can.

45:41.240 --> 45:42.240
But hit me with it.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.240
I don't know what it's going to say.

45:43.240 --> 45:48.320
It says, attention, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land once the town Perdition

45:48.320 --> 45:51.840
just west of contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.120
Do not forget your bets.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.120
Okay.

45:54.120 --> 45:55.880
Let me give that a go.

45:55.880 --> 45:59.600
And the contention PD are on your side.

45:59.600 --> 46:00.600
Once again.

46:00.600 --> 46:01.600
Yeah.

46:01.600 --> 46:11.020
Uh, tension, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land once the town Perdition just west of

46:11.020 --> 46:16.560
contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately.

46:16.560 --> 46:18.480
Don't forget your pets.

46:18.480 --> 46:19.760
And say the boys in blue are here for you.

46:19.760 --> 46:23.200
The boys in blue are here for you.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.200
That's right.

46:24.200 --> 46:33.920
The contention PD is your B F D, which stands for best friends and dependable.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.840
You know, Doug, you, you went a little off script at the end, but you really got the

46:36.840 --> 46:40.520
message across and I think that was, it was good at lip and it's great how much you sound

46:40.520 --> 46:41.520
like Chad.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.520
That's awesome.

46:42.520 --> 46:43.520
Thank you.

46:43.520 --> 46:48.200
Voices come from the body, not the person.

46:48.200 --> 46:53.120
I didn't think you were, it doesn't make sense to me either.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.120
This does make sense.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.120
Yeah.

46:55.120 --> 47:01.320
It's just very convenient that we can still have Chad's body as well.

47:01.320 --> 47:05.920
Uh, okay.

47:05.920 --> 47:11.380
So a couple, I was going to say a couple of things are going to happen.

47:11.380 --> 47:16.560
That's not our podcast.

47:16.560 --> 47:27.120
There are other role playing podcasts.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.620
Have you met anyone?

47:28.620 --> 47:32.160
They also have a role playing podcast.

47:32.160 --> 47:33.160
I hate everyone.

47:33.160 --> 47:34.160
Yeah.

47:34.160 --> 47:35.160
Okay.

47:35.160 --> 47:43.120
So you have Doug record that message and pretty immediately you see Rosemary is getting a

47:43.120 --> 47:52.260
pretty tired of this shit and she's a stood up now, John gun now, or I'm going to go find

47:52.260 --> 47:53.260
your briefcase.

47:53.260 --> 47:58.140
I don't know what that means, but well, listen, let me talk with the boys for just a second

47:58.140 --> 48:00.780
and I think we're going to move things towards getting you that gun.

48:00.780 --> 48:03.140
Can you hold on real quick while I confer five minutes?

48:03.140 --> 48:04.140
All right.

48:04.140 --> 48:06.140
Oh, I thought she was going to start counting.

48:06.140 --> 48:07.140
Yeah, me too.

48:07.140 --> 48:09.020
That would not have been enough for minutes.

48:09.020 --> 48:11.060
Oh, you don't know what a minute is.

48:11.060 --> 48:12.060
You're real dumb.

48:12.060 --> 48:13.060
Three minutes.

48:13.060 --> 48:14.140
Oh no.

48:14.140 --> 48:18.160
Why did Marvin glass and trust you with this last few minutes?

48:18.160 --> 48:20.640
Let's go start back at 60 then you're good.

48:20.640 --> 48:22.360
All right boys.

48:22.360 --> 48:26.080
John Stossel.

48:26.080 --> 48:28.360
I'm not aware of the reference.

48:28.360 --> 48:31.720
He's on 60 minutes.

48:31.720 --> 48:37.480
Good one Rosemary.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.480
Now I get it.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.480
Yeah.

48:39.480 --> 48:40.480
Yeah.

48:40.900 --> 48:44.300
Boys, she's getting pretty antsy about this gun and getting back to the city.

48:44.300 --> 48:46.740
I don't know that we have any other leads other than this.

48:46.740 --> 48:50.740
Well, we've got unincorporated land in perdition, but that might be a pretty dangerous place

48:50.740 --> 48:51.740
to go to.

48:51.740 --> 48:55.340
Also, it could just be a thing that the FBI said.

48:55.340 --> 48:59.920
Would we know, would you be able to swing by the unincorporated land quite easily on

48:59.920 --> 49:02.020
your way to the city from contention?

49:02.020 --> 49:04.180
Couldn't be more in the opposite direction.

49:04.180 --> 49:06.260
Guys, that couldn't be more in the opposite direction.

49:06.260 --> 49:08.020
I mean, contingent is not that big.

49:08.020 --> 49:10.600
That's not going to add more than an hour or so, I don't think.

49:10.600 --> 49:13.240
That well, yeah, but I mean, I think Tom is of the essence.

49:13.240 --> 49:16.240
What is she going to do if we like, we'll get there eventually.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.960
She's not going to like kill us.

49:17.960 --> 49:20.920
And if she does, she'll only kill one of us.

49:20.920 --> 49:21.920
You can't hear this Rosemary.

49:21.920 --> 49:22.920
We're talking.

49:22.920 --> 49:23.920
Out of your shot.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.160
She just overheard laughter.

49:25.160 --> 49:29.060
She's on Instagram.

49:29.060 --> 49:30.840
She just follows shit posters.

49:30.840 --> 49:31.920
She's watching puppy cuts.

49:31.920 --> 49:32.920
Yeah.

49:32.920 --> 49:33.920
What do you think?

49:33.920 --> 49:34.920
Well, I'd like to go.

49:35.180 --> 49:39.380
You boys don't have to come with me, but, uh, it might be more convenient for recording

49:39.380 --> 49:40.380
purposes.

49:40.380 --> 49:41.380
Yeah.

49:41.380 --> 49:42.380
Yeah.

49:42.380 --> 49:43.620
Uh, Joe's at a pickle there.

49:43.620 --> 49:45.300
I don't think Clark would go at all.

49:45.300 --> 49:48.940
He'd be afraid of the mob and feel like we have to take care of shit here, but I also

49:48.940 --> 49:51.100
don't want to be away from them for a long time.

49:51.100 --> 49:55.100
It could be if you guys go to the city and all that shit.

49:55.100 --> 49:56.100
I don't know.

49:56.100 --> 50:01.520
Hey John, how about can we, can we, can we ask Rosemary to give us the morning to put

50:01.520 --> 50:07.120
up these signs and get in touch with dog and get the radio broadcast out and then maybe

50:07.120 --> 50:09.620
we could run up there and run up to city.

50:09.620 --> 50:14.900
We can leave Ray in charge for, she's testy, but I don't know if she has a real strong

50:14.900 --> 50:16.980
bargaining position here.

50:16.980 --> 50:17.980
Right.

50:17.980 --> 50:20.900
Cause it's three men in this office with guns.

50:20.900 --> 50:23.780
So and we have the one thing that she wants.

50:23.780 --> 50:25.300
Yeah, that's exactly right.

50:25.300 --> 50:30.300
And we can stop by here first or no, maybe we'll decide on the way.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.720
We could always just have Drew do the signs.

50:32.720 --> 50:33.720
Oh fuck.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.720
Joe didn't think of that.

50:34.720 --> 50:36.880
Clark probably would have cause that's a very good idea.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.520
There's no reason that we need to do that personally.

50:38.520 --> 50:39.520
Grunt work.

50:39.520 --> 50:40.520
Who has the best alertness?

50:40.520 --> 50:41.520
Got a 70.

50:41.520 --> 50:46.400
Do you want to roll alertness Clark?

50:46.400 --> 50:53.720
I helipass a three on a, it would be a 50 since a minus 20% but yeah, three.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.320
Which we forgot about all podcasts.

50:55.320 --> 50:57.080
I don't think anybody's rolled.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.080
What did we forget?

50:58.080 --> 50:59.080
Sorry.

50:59.080 --> 51:00.080
The minus 20.

51:00.860 --> 51:01.860
But you guys crit.

51:01.860 --> 51:02.860
Yeah.

51:02.860 --> 51:03.860
Succeeded.

51:03.860 --> 51:04.860
So that's true.

51:04.860 --> 51:05.860
Oh man.

51:05.860 --> 51:08.100
I need to be a better handler.

51:08.100 --> 51:11.860
Also my, like it wouldn't have affected, I think I've done two roles because it rolled

51:11.860 --> 51:13.900
like super low on all your roles.

51:13.900 --> 51:14.900
Okay.

51:14.900 --> 51:15.900
That makes me feel better.

51:15.900 --> 51:21.580
So you pass, you notice very clearly Rosemary is listening in on the conversation.

51:21.580 --> 51:24.700
Hey, get out of here.

51:24.700 --> 51:26.700
Get on out.

51:26.700 --> 51:29.500
Cause she's just still sitting where she is, right?

51:29.500 --> 51:30.880
She didn't walk over to us.

51:30.880 --> 51:37.320
If you are in the same room still, yeah, no, she's just intently listening to your conversation.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.920
I just pulled John in a little closer.

51:38.920 --> 51:40.960
I think she can hear us.

51:40.960 --> 51:43.800
It's not ideal, but she's also not the brightest bulb.

51:43.800 --> 51:47.200
Rosemary, did you hear any of that?

51:47.200 --> 51:48.200
No.

51:48.200 --> 51:49.200
All right.

51:49.200 --> 51:54.200
She heard.

51:54.200 --> 51:55.320
Did you like any of it?

51:55.320 --> 51:56.320
Yeah.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.800
Rosemary, we need an hour in contention before we can leave.

51:58.800 --> 52:01.340
Is that all right?

52:01.340 --> 52:05.260
Keep in mind we all have pistols and the one thing you want in the world and the one thing

52:05.260 --> 52:07.340
your boss wants in the world.

52:07.340 --> 52:09.020
Your boss is a pretty scary dude.

52:09.020 --> 52:12.700
So consider this hour your entire fucking life.

52:12.700 --> 52:20.020
Like I'll give you an hour for a hundred thousand dollars.

52:20.020 --> 52:21.020
We'll get it to you later.

52:21.020 --> 52:22.020
Yeah.

52:22.020 --> 52:23.780
I mean you've got $5 million in your hand.

52:23.780 --> 52:24.780
I don't know.

52:24.780 --> 52:25.780
John deal.

52:25.780 --> 52:27.260
No, no deal.

52:27.260 --> 52:28.600
Why would that be a deal?

52:28.600 --> 52:29.600
Okay.

52:29.600 --> 52:34.800
And she gets up and has a briefcase and she walks toward the front door of the police

52:34.800 --> 52:35.800
station.

52:35.800 --> 52:36.880
I've moved a blocker.

52:36.880 --> 52:37.880
What do you want to do?

52:37.880 --> 52:42.880
I want you to wait a fucking hour while we take care of some shit and then get that gun

52:42.880 --> 52:47.400
for your boss.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.400
Quick question.

52:48.400 --> 52:49.800
Are we going to bring her with us?

52:49.800 --> 52:50.800
Yeah.

52:50.800 --> 52:51.800
Yeah.

52:51.800 --> 52:52.800
One hour.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.800
That's fine.

52:53.800 --> 52:54.800
One hour.

52:54.800 --> 52:55.800
All right.

52:55.800 --> 52:56.800
God damn it.

52:57.340 --> 52:59.460
Is Drew, is Drew going to put up the signs for us?

52:59.460 --> 53:00.460
Yeah.

53:00.460 --> 53:04.580
Are we going to go here or are we going to, oh, yeah, we might not need that hour.

53:04.580 --> 53:05.820
What are we doing with her hour?

53:05.820 --> 53:06.820
So fucked.

53:06.820 --> 53:07.820
Shit.

53:07.820 --> 53:08.820
That's it.

53:08.820 --> 53:09.820
We're going to go put the signs.

53:09.820 --> 53:10.820
How far away is Perdition?

53:10.820 --> 53:11.820
Hour.

53:11.820 --> 53:12.820
One hour away.

53:12.820 --> 53:14.320
Damn it.

53:14.320 --> 53:15.320
She's stupid.

53:15.320 --> 53:16.320
She doesn't know how long an hour is.

53:16.320 --> 53:17.320
Well, that's what I'm saying.

53:17.320 --> 53:22.040
Once we're in the car, like we can just drive somewhere and then she's still captive with

53:22.040 --> 53:23.040
us.

53:23.280 --> 53:30.200
Did you hear that Rosemary?

53:30.200 --> 53:32.120
She looks up from her phone.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.120
What?

53:33.120 --> 53:37.160
I mean, our two options are either go to the city or go here.

53:37.160 --> 53:39.760
I think we should have Drew put up the signs.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.760
Yeah.

53:40.760 --> 53:41.760
That'll make Clark feel better.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.080
And then I think we should just go to the city.

53:43.080 --> 53:44.080
Yeah.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.560
And if we need to, we can stop here on the way back.

53:45.560 --> 53:46.560
Okay.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.560
Let's do it.

53:47.560 --> 53:50.660
I want to call Drew and tell him, Drew, forget the cat carrier.

53:50.660 --> 53:52.460
Would you come on back to the office?

53:52.460 --> 53:53.460
Don't forget the cat carrier.

53:53.460 --> 53:54.460
I've already got it.

53:54.460 --> 53:55.460
Perfect.

53:55.460 --> 53:56.460
Don't worry.

53:56.460 --> 53:57.460
Then let's bring that on in.

53:57.460 --> 54:02.820
When you get into the office on your desk, there's going to be a pile of flyers and a

54:02.820 --> 54:03.820
list next to it.

54:03.820 --> 54:06.780
And I want you to go and put a flyer at every place on that list.

54:06.780 --> 54:07.780
Oh, okay.

54:07.780 --> 54:08.780
Just tape it to the door.

54:08.780 --> 54:13.700
Don't even, if somebody tries to stop you, just say the police are in control, turn on

54:13.700 --> 54:15.860
your radio and listen to the message from dog.

54:15.860 --> 54:16.860
Yeah.

54:16.860 --> 54:18.580
Clark, I don't think anyone's going to stop me.

54:18.580 --> 54:20.400
There's like nobody here.

54:20.400 --> 54:22.360
This place is a ghost town.

54:22.360 --> 54:23.360
What?

54:23.360 --> 54:25.360
Like there's just nobody around.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.360
Like I've been driving around.

54:26.360 --> 54:31.360
I went to the, I went to the store and there's like no shoppers.

54:31.360 --> 54:32.520
There's no cars driving around.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.520
This is crazy.

54:33.520 --> 54:37.280
I just like came in and grabbed the cat grabber.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.280
What was it that I have?

54:38.280 --> 54:39.280
Cat carrier.

54:39.280 --> 54:40.280
A cat carrier.

54:40.280 --> 54:41.280
Yeah.

54:41.280 --> 54:42.280
That's what I grabbed.

54:42.280 --> 54:47.320
And yeah, I just, uh, I waited at the checkout for a while, but, uh, nobody's, uh, you stole

54:47.320 --> 54:48.320
it, Drew.

54:48.320 --> 54:49.320
No, I didn't steal it.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.320
I'm still waiting.

54:51.240 --> 54:54.400
Oh, I give you permission to come on and come on back to the office.

54:54.400 --> 54:55.880
Don't worry about putting cash down.

54:55.880 --> 54:57.760
We'll, we'll get, we'll settle up with them later.

54:57.760 --> 54:58.760
Oh, okay.

54:58.760 --> 55:00.040
I'll just leave cash though.

55:00.040 --> 55:01.040
Okay.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.040
If it makes you feel better.

55:02.040 --> 55:03.040
Okay.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.040
And don't worry.

55:04.040 --> 55:06.040
We're on it.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.040
Yeah.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.040
Same.

55:08.040 --> 55:09.040
Cool.

55:09.040 --> 55:13.840
We're all on it.

55:13.840 --> 55:14.840
Shit.

55:14.840 --> 55:18.720
The entire town disappearing does add a wrench to our plans.

55:18.720 --> 55:21.660
Do we need to leave Drew around if there's nobody here?

55:21.660 --> 55:22.660
Should he come with us?

55:22.660 --> 55:29.240
You guys hear a car pull up in the parking lot of the police department and, uh, there's

55:29.240 --> 55:30.240
a knock at the door.

55:30.240 --> 55:33.960
You guys are standing kind of in the entryway and you look over and you see a woman.

55:33.960 --> 55:38.440
Uh, she's an older woman with a big glasses, bigger hair.

55:38.440 --> 55:39.440
She's knocking on the door.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.960
Do I recognize her?

55:40.960 --> 55:42.520
Yeah, I think you would.

55:42.520 --> 55:46.860
Uh, this is Jan Manstein, Jan Manstein.

55:46.860 --> 55:49.620
She is Ari's mother.

55:49.620 --> 55:54.580
Ari is a, your co-worker, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:54.580 --> 55:55.580
Woman.

55:55.580 --> 55:56.580
Fuck.

55:56.580 --> 56:02.180
Who works in the police department and does a lot of stuff around town for you guys.

56:02.180 --> 56:03.880
And this is her mom, Jan.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.900
I wave at her through the glass.

56:05.900 --> 56:06.900
Hey, Jan.

56:06.900 --> 56:07.900
Hey, Jan.

56:07.900 --> 56:08.900
What's going on?

56:08.900 --> 56:09.900
Oh, hi.

56:09.900 --> 56:10.900
Yeah.

56:10.900 --> 56:16.820
Um, yeah, no, uh, I'm just here to, uh, I mean, I'm here to pick up.

56:16.820 --> 56:21.600
Her things, uh, you know, she, she, she would have wanted that.

56:21.600 --> 56:25.220
Maybe she wouldn't have, I don't know, but I got to get the stuff.

56:25.220 --> 56:26.220
Maybe.

56:26.220 --> 56:28.700
I don't know, but probably I should probably get it.

56:28.700 --> 56:29.700
She'll need it.

56:29.700 --> 56:33.380
So, uh, I just need to come inside, come inside.

56:33.380 --> 56:34.380
So have a seat.

56:34.380 --> 56:35.380
Yeah.

56:35.380 --> 56:40.140
She walks in and she's like just completely scattered and she's like, Oh gosh, you know,

56:40.140 --> 56:46.420
I, I just, I thought that, you know, uh, she would want me to, to have her, which desk

56:46.420 --> 56:48.180
was, was Ari's.

56:48.180 --> 56:54.940
What do you mean was, what do you mean was the fire in the city?

56:54.940 --> 56:57.620
Ari's dead.

56:57.620 --> 56:58.620
What fire?

56:58.620 --> 57:00.300
The hospital fire?

57:00.300 --> 57:01.460
Yes.

57:01.460 --> 57:04.660
Is Clark saying who's Ari or is Clark totally aware who Ari is?

57:04.660 --> 57:05.660
Ari's Ray.

57:05.660 --> 57:08.220
I know we outside know that.

57:08.220 --> 57:09.220
What's Clark doing right now?

57:09.220 --> 57:10.460
Oh, that's a good point.

57:10.460 --> 57:14.780
What are we doing every time we hear that Ray has a different name, you're immediately

57:14.780 --> 57:19.340
confused and then you have a flood of memories with Ari.

57:19.340 --> 57:20.340
Perfect.

57:20.340 --> 57:21.340
Okay.

57:21.340 --> 57:22.900
Did we send Ray to the hospital?

57:22.900 --> 57:23.900
Yes.

57:23.900 --> 57:24.900
Woof.

57:24.900 --> 57:33.260
You sent Florence to the hospital in the ambulance with Rosemary after the skirmish, after we

57:33.260 --> 57:35.500
shot hotel, hotel, right, right, right, right.

57:35.500 --> 57:44.060
You sent Ari to keep an eye or Florence or Ray or Tim to keep an eye on Rosemary.

57:44.060 --> 57:45.060
That's weird.

57:45.060 --> 57:46.540
We forgot about that until just now.

57:46.540 --> 57:48.660
Rosemary, can I talk to you for a minute?

57:48.660 --> 57:49.660
Yeah.

57:49.660 --> 57:54.460
And Clark, do you show her where Ari's desk was and so she begins collecting the belongings

57:54.460 --> 57:55.460
of her daughter.

57:55.460 --> 57:56.460
I'm very somber.

57:56.460 --> 57:59.980
Jana, I'm, I can't tell you how sorry I am.

57:59.980 --> 58:05.900
You know, you sign up for this life and you know, she, she always, she always knew that,

58:05.900 --> 58:12.180
you know, go, gosh, maybe there would, you know, but you know, as a mother, you know,

58:12.180 --> 58:19.380
you always think, you know, the, maybe everything will be all right, but maybe it won't, I,

58:19.380 --> 58:25.740
it's just, it's hard, but, uh, I'm sure you'll all, you'll all be there tomorrow, right?

58:25.740 --> 58:27.420
For the funeral, obviously.

58:27.420 --> 58:28.420
Of course.

58:28.420 --> 58:29.420
What, what time is that?

58:29.420 --> 58:32.260
Uh, it's at, uh, it's, it's at 11 or 10.

58:32.260 --> 58:35.180
I think it's, we're doing at 11, 10 30.

58:35.180 --> 58:36.180
It's a 10 30.

58:36.180 --> 58:37.180
No, no, no, no.

58:37.180 --> 58:38.180
I decided on 11.

58:38.180 --> 58:39.620
Yeah, no, it's 11.

58:39.620 --> 58:40.620
It's all right.

58:40.620 --> 58:41.620
We'll sign up for sure.

58:41.620 --> 58:42.620
And we'll be there.

58:42.620 --> 58:45.020
Did Rosemary burn down the hospital?

58:45.020 --> 58:46.700
That's what I'm asking her.

58:46.700 --> 58:53.420
Cut to John and Rosemary in the back room and she eyes the evidence locker door.

58:53.420 --> 58:55.100
Are you going to give me the gun now?

58:55.100 --> 58:58.340
Hey, first of all, Rosemary, you're never fucking getting that gun.

58:58.340 --> 59:00.420
It's going directly into Marvin Glass's hands.

59:00.420 --> 59:05.420
If it goes anywhere, you can escort it with us, but I'm not giving you the gun.

59:05.420 --> 59:06.780
We clear on that.

59:06.780 --> 59:11.220
First of all, uh, did you fucking burn down the hospital in the city and kill one of our

59:11.220 --> 59:12.220
officers?

59:12.220 --> 59:13.220
No.

59:13.220 --> 59:14.220
Rosemary.

59:14.220 --> 59:15.220
Come on.

59:15.220 --> 59:16.220
No.

59:16.220 --> 59:17.220
Rosemary.

59:17.220 --> 59:18.220
Yeah.

59:18.220 --> 59:26.220
Did you burn down the hospital?

59:26.220 --> 59:27.220
Yeah.

59:27.220 --> 59:28.220
Rosemary.

59:28.220 --> 59:30.260
You know, mobsters go to the hospital.

59:30.260 --> 59:31.260
The city needs a hospital.

59:31.260 --> 59:33.740
Mobsters get hurt all the time.

59:33.740 --> 59:34.740
They put me in.

59:34.740 --> 59:36.140
I don't like handcuffs.

59:36.140 --> 59:37.140
They put me in handcuffs.

59:37.140 --> 59:38.140
I don't like handcuffs.

59:38.140 --> 59:39.140
Well, you shot it, please.

59:39.140 --> 59:40.140
Or, well, I guess we shot it.

59:40.140 --> 59:41.460
You tried to stab Keith.

59:41.460 --> 59:43.020
He tried to fucking shoot me.

59:43.020 --> 59:44.980
Cause you were trying to stab Rosemary.

59:44.980 --> 59:46.980
He came at me with a knife.

59:46.980 --> 59:47.980
Okay.

59:47.980 --> 59:51.380
Well, listen, that's not ideal.

59:51.380 --> 59:52.820
That's not really cool.

59:52.820 --> 59:55.140
Fully fucking aware, John.

59:55.140 --> 59:57.020
All right.

59:57.020 --> 01:00:03.940
Well, uh, can you just play it cool for like five fucking minutes because the mother of

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:07.420
the fucking cop you burned to death along with, what was it?

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.420
40 other people.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.420
Yeah.

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.540
I didn't put that together, but she's out there right now.

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.400
I'm always cool, John.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.900
That is literally never true.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.340
So you guys walk back out into the station.

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:25.580
Jan is, uh, finishing packing up everything and oh gosh, I just, you know, I, Stan is

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.620
gonna, he's, he's gonna fall apart.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.620
I just don't know.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.420
I don't know what to tell him.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.340
I, maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.340
Should I tell him?

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.340
What do you think?

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.340
Should I?

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.340
Would you like one of us to tell him?

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.340
Yes.

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.340
Yes.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.340
No, no, no, no.

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.340
Yes.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.340
Yes.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.340
Yes.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.340
Yeah.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.340
Yes.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.340
Please.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:50.140
And then real quick, remind me where he lives and his exact relation to you so there's no

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.140
faux pas.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.140
Oh yeah.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.140
No.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:59.140
Stan is, uh, my ex husband, Ari's father, uh, he's been in the city asylum for 28 years.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:02.500
Oh, well as it just so happens, we're about to go up to the city.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.580
So that might be pretty convenient.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:08.060
If you could let him know, that would be, no, no, you shouldn't.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.480
No, I should be the one to tell, no, you do it.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480
You do it.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.480
No, I should be the one.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480
Okay.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480
Bye.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480
Okay.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480
Before you go.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.620
Hey, do you see anybody else out in town when you came over here?

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.860
Well, contention is a small town, right?

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:26.420
I am never around here, but traffic on the roads, any people walking about, a bunch of

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.420
green lights.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:31.860
I, well, I think I ran into one red maybe on the way in perhaps.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:32.860
Yeah.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.860
Um, have a good day.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.860
Animals.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:39.340
Wait, wait, wait, Jan, when we, when we talked to Stan, do you want us to tell him anything

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.560
for you?

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.980
Maybe like the last time you talked to Ari, maybe something she said then, do you remember

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.380
the last time you talked to her?

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.380
Yes.

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.380
Yeah.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.380
It was, uh, it was just the other night.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.380
What did she say?

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:54.620
She said, uh, her last words were, I'm going to bed now.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:55.780
No, they were, I love you.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.540
No, it was just that she'd just eaten Mac and cheese.

01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.540
No, no, no.

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:00.860
She said, I love you.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:01.860
And I said, I love you.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:02.860
I can't.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:03.860
That's fine.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.580
We'll tell Stan that she, she said, I love you.

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.580
And then one last thing.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.980
Does the name Ray mean anything to you?

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.980
No.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:12.980
Florence?

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:13.980
No.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:14.980
Okay.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:15.980
Are those Ari's friends?

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.980
Yeah, those were Ari's friends.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:18.980
Okay.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:19.980
Um, okay.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.980
I'll go.

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:21.980
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.980
It's in the city.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.940
It's at the city cemetery.

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.500
She's going to be buried with her family.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.020
So yeah, we'll definitely be there.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.380
And she collects the things and leaves.

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:36.420
I turned to John, do you, you remember array and a Florence?

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.420
Yeah, man.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.420
Yeah.

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:41.580
This is the first fucking time I've heard of Ari, but I feel like I've known her for

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.580
years.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.580
Clark gets a chill.

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.700
I just got a chill.

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:56.700
Can you guys roll sanity, uh, fail, fail, say one on a 27.

01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.700
Holy shit.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.900
65 on an 18, 78 on a 27.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.900
Wow.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.740
You guys all lose one sanity.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:11.740
All these different iterations of your coworkers start flooding into your brain and you can't

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.740
keep them separated.

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:19.940
They're all starting to combine into this strange amalgamation of this person that now

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.880
you can't remember any of what their faces look like.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:31.160
You vaguely remember some names, some stories, but you never necessarily got close to this

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.560
person, but you remember their last name was Manstein.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560
Yeah.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.560
Losers.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560
All of them.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.560
I mean, they didn't really stick in your mind, but they were all Manstein.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560
Yeah.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.560
Whoa.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:53.800
Is that what close as he stumbles back?

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.440
Yeah.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:03.840
And then you guys decide to, we're going to have drew put up those flyers and go to the

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.840
city.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.840
Was that the last thing we settled on?

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.840
Yeah, I think so.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.560
I would like a moment alone with Rosemary.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.560
John and Rose.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.680
Do you want to describe it?

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.600
Uh, well, first of all, um, does she still have the briefcase on her?

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600
Oh yeah.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.600
Okay.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.600
She's not letting go of that.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600
Yeah.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.600
So, uh, I take her into the back.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.600
I'm like, Hey Rosemary.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.400
Can we talk for a second real quick?

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.400
Yeah.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.400
Okay.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.400
Uh, just let's go into this room here.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.360
So, uh, out at your shot of the boys.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.360
You're there.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.280
Um, and I slam her against the fucking wall and put a gun on her head.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.280
She starts laughing.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.280
Okay.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.800
Well I cocked the trigger and I said, let go of the fucking briefcase and give drew

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:46.680
his money back right fucking now or what or I'll fucking kill you and talk to Marvin

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.680
Glass myself.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.800
You think I care about some dumb ass like soldier.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.000
You're nothing to me.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.120
You want to get your job done and live to see the end of this day and give me that fucking

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120
money.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.120
Yeah.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.400
All right, John.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:10.680
And she drops the briefcase on to your hand and then she turns like she slowly turns.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.000
You've got it pressed against her temple.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:19.680
I'm guessing she slowly turns and puts it with the barrel right in between her eyes.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:30.720
It's hilarious that you think that you can kill me.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:36.360
And then she just walks away back into the room without the briefcase.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.520
Okay.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.000
John lets out a huge breath.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.440
So yeah, John picks up the briefcase and I guess dashes it somewhere secure in the station

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.280
because I don't want the boys to see me with it.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.280
For sure.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.720
There's got to be a like a random evidence locker.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.120
Like I just put it in a locker.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120
Okay.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.600
You go into the evidence locker and put it in.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.640
That's a good cover anyway.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:08.000
It's evidence.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.920
You hear a ding from the computer at the secretary's desk and there's a fresh email from both the

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.920
dog.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.160
It says the PSA is about to play.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.720
So this is what plays on the radio.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:26.360
I'll do it in post but just so you guys fucking know.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.360
Okay.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.360
Not that.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.360
Wrong station.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.360
Yeah.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.360
I click over.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.360
And we're not using a spooky radio are we?

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.360
No.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360
We sure ain't.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.360
Oh shit.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.360
I'm sorry.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.360
I'm sorry.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.360
I'm sorry.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.360
I'm sorry.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.360
I'm sorry.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.360
I'm sorry.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360
I'm sorry.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360
I'm sorry.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360
I'm sorry.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.040
You're all flying through a vortex and your faces are melting and contorting and going

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:57.000
into one game over.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.480
Hey, my babies.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.280
It's both the dog hitting you with the weather on December 5th.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.640
Now y'all know what's been really nice outside, but prepare for a cold freeze tonight.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:15.000
Keep those sinks a dripping for your old buddy Wolf.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.900
And Wolf got some breaking news for y'all today.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.680
Straight from the mouth of the FBI.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:31.520
Tension, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land, once the town Perdition, just west of

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.960
contention is heading this way.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.080
Please evacuate immediately.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.240
Don't forget your pets.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.700
The boys in blue are here for you.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.700
That's right.

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:53.960
The contention PD is your BFD, which stands for best friends and dependable.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:59.040
Now Wolf the dog got some serious news on the wire from the city.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:03.880
Ferguson beans and Joan Robin, the mother of Ferguson's business partner were found

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.660
dead in beans home early this morning.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.400
Nothing confirmed.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:14.040
But inside sources say Joan shot Ferguson multiple times with his own firearm before

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:17.280
turning the gun on herself.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:29.920
Holy shit.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.280
Look at Keith.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280
You told it.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.300
Didn't you tell us one time you're part of the bean family?

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.300
Those bean boys.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:37.300
You haven't told us yet, right?

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:38.300
That you're a bean?

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.300
Yeah.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:43.340
And based on the way that we've been playing it, it's kind of this well known, it's an

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:47.760
open secret and you guys don't bring it up because you have to work with him and he clearly

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.620
fucking hates it.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:51.940
That's why he changed his name to avoid it.

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:58.380
You've brought it up like once or twice and then he's ignored it and it's kind of gone

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:06.140
over, especially when you're ordering beans from beans on beans, your family's business.

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.980
And so it is an open secret.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:13.780
So you do know that he is related to the beans, but you've never really discussed it.

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.780
Okay.

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:16.780
So I just want to look at him.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.620
What do I see on his face?

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:25.460
I hear that news and I just, I am just looking down at the ground like blank expression.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:29.660
Keith, we know you're a bean.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.660
Yeah.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:32.660
I knew you knew.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.620
Who were they to you?

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.620
That was my brother.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:36.620
God damn.

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:37.620
Keith.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:38.620
I'm so, I'm so sorry.

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:39.620
Keith.

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.820
I haven't seen him in a while.

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:41.820
A long time.

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:48.060
We never really got along that well, but would you say it's been a while?

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:55.340
Oh no.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.780
I kicked John.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.740
I wouldn't have wished that upon him though.

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.620
But yeah, that was my brother.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.620
Huh?

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:05.820
Well, it's, we're heading to the city.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.780
We can take a look by the crime scene.

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.780
I mean, maybe.

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.780
Yeah.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.420
Ask the local PD what they know.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.420
Yeah.

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:15.740
I'd like to find out what they know and we'll do that.

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.740
Yeah.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.740
Okay.

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:18.740
Let's do first things first though.

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.460
Let's there's goo.

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.460
There's goo to do.

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:22.460
There's goo to do.

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.700
If one beans died, I don't need to die from goo.

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.820
We got to figure out that after, after all this.

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:28.820
Yeah.

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.700
And again, just real sorry your brother got murdered, suicided.

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:31.700
Yeah.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.580
I wish I could have, I don't know.

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.580
Been there.

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.580
The boys in the air.

01:10:35.580 --> 01:11:04.580
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you know I'm the only one trying to

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:32.580
pull over How can you know I'm the only one trying to pull over
