00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
Bless this mess, my babies.

00:02.560 --> 00:05.380
Damn, y'all are stinky.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.560
Uh-oh.

00:06.560 --> 00:10.240
It's your scent-spraying stepdad, Wolf the dog.

00:10.240 --> 00:15.240
And I'm here stinking up the joint live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:16.940 --> 00:19.800
the only radio station that offered

00:19.800 --> 00:22.920
smell-o-listen for a time.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.800
But we had to stop.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.520
People died, man.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.240
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf

00:28.240 --> 00:31.760
is from at Sergeant Boondock on Twitter.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.760
He tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

00:34.760 --> 00:39.160
which really puts the hell yeah in hell yeah, dude.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.480
Mr. Sergeant Boondock would like me

00:41.480 --> 00:46.480
to dedicate a big old smooch to Mrs. Sergeant Boondock.

00:47.640 --> 00:51.200
Well, I guess I can cook up a little romance.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.380
Prepare for a smooch.

00:54.340 --> 00:57.300
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.760
Mwah.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.660
Sorry, I don't know what came over me,

01:00.660 --> 01:02.640
Sergeant Boondock on Twitter.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.940
I was overcome with a strong passion.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.900
I haven't given an auditory smooch in many a millennia,

01:09.900 --> 01:12.960
according to my smooch calendar.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.480
If you wanna make a saucy request of your stinky wolf,

01:16.480 --> 01:19.140
tag the show at pretending pod on the internet.

01:19.140 --> 01:23.660
And if you're interested in trading $6.66

01:23.660 --> 01:27.860

and purchase your own personal Splashylvania Fastpass.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.780
As always, the links are all up in the show notes

01:35.780 --> 01:39.280
and I am all up in the news.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.100
Last time, the little twins recognized

01:42.100 --> 01:45.860
and stared down Clark Bishop from a horrifying vessel

01:45.860 --> 01:48.860
floating across the shimmering steel sea,

01:48.860 --> 01:51.580
aboard this defaced bay boat,

01:51.580 --> 01:55.660
the rabid ball holding Julie Maxwell's corpse

01:55.660 --> 01:59.900
ripped at the bridge connecting the two stilted bunkers.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.900
Keith, Don, and Jack leapt for the railing

02:02.900 --> 02:05.020
of the little balcony outside

02:05.020 --> 02:07.180
the second bunker's hatch door,

02:07.180 --> 02:09.220
but Keith couldn't hold on.

02:09.220 --> 02:11.540
He fell into the molten ocean

02:11.540 --> 02:15.000
and became engulfed in the sea made of solder.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.760
But Don D. Pettymore chanted some sort

02:17.760 --> 02:20.720
of cancellation incantation

02:20.720 --> 02:24.280
and each action by person, object, or ball

02:24.280 --> 02:26.880
played out perfectly in reverse.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.800
As the rope bridge came crashing down a second time,

02:30.800 --> 02:33.520
Keith leapt for the railing of the little balcony

02:33.520 --> 02:36.440
outside the second bunker's hatch door.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.540
But this time, with a little hindsight,

02:39.540 --> 02:44.160
to everyone's delight, he held on with all his might.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.800
So make like a beans and Keith holding on tight.

02:47.800 --> 02:52.300
It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In.

02:52.300 --> 02:57.300
["What Kind of World Are You Living In"]

03:22.300 --> 03:27.300
["What Kind of World Are You Living In"]

03:32.300 --> 03:34.300
How many apples can you fit in your butt, Thomas?

03:37.300 --> 03:40.300
I don't have numbers like you and Luke.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.300
So, Taylor and I started saying ditto a lot.

03:45.300 --> 03:50.300
I don't know who started it, but then we were, like, kind of playing with the word

03:50.300 --> 03:53.300
and saying different iterations.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.300
So, there for a minute it was just, like, ditty, ditty, dits.

03:58.300 --> 04:02.300
And now, if we agree with each other, we just go, big dits.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.300
Big dits.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.300
Big dits.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.300
But then...

04:06.300 --> 04:07.300
Big ol' ditties.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.300
Big ol' ditties.

04:10.300 --> 04:15.300
So then I said, big ol' ditties, and she was like, no. Too far.

04:16.300 --> 04:19.300
Yeah, that's why I'm really the one for you.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.300
Yeah, dude. Diddy Kong.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.300
And Luke's our sub, who we call Diddy Kong.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.300
I want bananas.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.300
Cause they're your peanuts.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.300
Oh, Diddy.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.300
Diddy Dong.

04:40.300 --> 04:41.300
Diddy Dong.

04:42.300 --> 04:46.300
Well, this is really funny, but we probably can't use that.

04:46.300 --> 04:47.300
Diddy Dong.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.300
Why?

04:48.300 --> 04:52.300
I don't know, can we say that we're gonna have a three-way sub-relationship

04:52.300 --> 04:57.300
with Luke where he sucks our penises and calls them bananas cause he's Diddy Dong?

04:58.300 --> 05:01.300
I think we can, and I think you summed it up pretty well.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.300
Yeah, that's what I thought we were doing.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.300
Okay, well, if that's not, you know, insensitive...

05:06.300 --> 05:07.300
To Luke?

05:08.300 --> 05:10.300
To Nintendo fans.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.300
To N-

05:11.300 --> 05:13.300
Yeah, to Nintendo fans.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.300
Sorry, everybody.

05:20.300 --> 05:25.300
I just don't want to cross the line of joking into, like, fetishization or even, like, otherization.

05:25.300 --> 05:29.300
Right. Well, then the listeners can know that you feel that way.

05:31.300 --> 05:32.300
God damn it.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.300
And I'll keep calling Luke Diddy Dong for the whole episode.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.300
Oh, God.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.300
I rolled a 48.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.300
Diddy Dong!

05:45.300 --> 05:46.300
Oh, fuck yeah.

05:49.300 --> 05:54.300
You did this, Thomas. You forced my hand. Now it's all in.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.300
You can take the part out where I'm a little bitch about it.

05:59.300 --> 06:06.300
But that's our new intro, like, thing, is that we say fucked up stuff until Thomas goes,

06:06.300 --> 06:10.300
I don't think we can put this in there, and then we start the episode.

06:11.300 --> 06:15.300
I'll cut you saying the word bitch, though, you sexist fuck.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.300
Keith Vidner grabs onto the railing.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.300
You gendered, slur-using son of a bitch.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.300
All right, so Keith grabs onto the railing.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.300
Zach, are you okay?

06:38.300 --> 06:40.300
Keith grabs onto the railing.

06:40.300 --> 06:47.300
And this time, all the sweat got wiped off my hands the last time I grabbed it,

06:47.300 --> 06:51.300
and somehow the reverse, you know, didn't put the sweat back on my hands,

06:51.300 --> 06:57.300
so I go slightly to the left of where I jumped last time to avoid the puddle of sweat,

06:57.300 --> 06:59.300
and I grab on with all my strength.

06:59.300 --> 07:04.300
In the distance, you just hear what sounds like a door hitting the inside of a metal wall.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.300
Don't.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.300
Echoes.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.300
I hear, but I don't even have time to think about it.

07:18.300 --> 07:23.300
Can I try to pull myself up this round or, I guess, probably not?

07:23.300 --> 07:25.300
You guessed right. Clark, it's your turn.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.300
I mean, there's nothing to do.

07:29.300 --> 07:40.300
Clark and Jon both brush their hands and say, mission accomplished.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.300
It looks like Keith made it this time.

07:46.300 --> 07:51.300
This time, I'm saying this time because we went back in time.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.300
Did that happen to you, Jon?

07:52.300 --> 07:55.300
Yeah, it felt like we did a little rewind, a little Prince of Persia there.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.300
Or do we have any recollection of that handler?

07:58.300 --> 08:02.300
You absolutely remember it, and you absolutely need to roll a sanity.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.300
Oh, hell yeah, I fail.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.300
I fail too, but not over my power.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.300
Oh, I failed over my power.

08:14.300 --> 08:18.300
I critically failed and over my power.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.300
It's a 66.

08:20.300 --> 08:24.300
Oh, wow. Well, now I'm not locked in here with you.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.300
I'm locked in here with you.

08:28.300 --> 08:35.300
Fool me twice.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.300
You can't fool me again.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.300
You ain't going to Rorschach me again.

08:39.300 --> 08:44.300
All right, so with that, you all lose one sanity.

08:44.300 --> 08:49.300
This was a zero slash one, so Clark, you still only lose one.

08:49.300 --> 08:52.300
We're in a room of junk, and I'm frustrated.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.300
I would just start chucking things against walls.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.300
I just threw a door. You saw me do that.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.300
I'm going to just keep on chucking shit.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.300
Where the fuck are we? Get out of here.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.300
God damn it.

09:02.300 --> 09:06.300
And as you're chucking junk across the room,

09:06.300 --> 09:09.300
you pick up the golf club you found earlier,

09:09.300 --> 09:13.300
and you fling it, and as it leaves your hands,

09:13.300 --> 09:15.300
you think you're throwing it at the wall,

09:15.300 --> 09:18.300
but it just kind of flips out of control.

09:18.300 --> 09:23.300
Putter head over handle flies toward Leo piston,

09:23.300 --> 09:31.300
and the putter part just sinks directly into the bullet hole in him,

09:31.300 --> 09:35.300
and he's just like, yay!

09:35.300 --> 09:40.300
No, Clark! Clark!

09:40.300 --> 09:43.300
And he leans back over, and you're still,

09:43.300 --> 09:45.300
I mean, you're just not even paying attention.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.300
You're just throwing shit. Don V. Pettymore, you're up.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.300
I'm assuming I also went back,

09:50.300 --> 09:53.300
so I need to re-grab onto the thing.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.300
Yeah. Okay.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.300
My ding-dang dexterity.

09:56.300 --> 09:59.300
Oh, I didn't even think about what if we save Keith,

09:59.300 --> 10:03.300
and then lose both Don and Jack.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.300
Two for one deal.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.300
I'm willing to take that risk.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.300
36 on a 55 for my dexterity.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.300
Nice. Yep.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.300
Don grabs some steady footing

10:15.300 --> 10:18.300
as this rope bridge is crumbling beneath him,

10:18.300 --> 10:21.300
and he, not crumbling, just moving, just falling.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.300
I feel like Don D. in this moment would be like,

10:23.300 --> 10:27.300
oh, shit, knowing that he has to complete that jump again.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.300
He's like, oh, son of a bitch.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.300
It went back further than you expected.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.300
Yeah, I thought I was just going to be hanging out,

10:32.300 --> 10:34.300
and I'm like, oh, fuck.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.300
But you oh, fuck your way right across

10:36.300 --> 10:42.300
and grab onto the railing that is right outside the hatch

10:42.300 --> 10:50.300
on this stilted room above the shiny, shimmering silver sea.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.300
John, it's your turn.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.300
Keith, Don, are you okay?

10:54.300 --> 10:56.300
I am now.

10:56.300 --> 11:00.300
About melted in half, it felt horrible.

11:00.300 --> 11:03.300
Yeah, I saw. That looked very unpleasant.

11:03.300 --> 11:06.300
It's okay. I have no residual pain from it,

11:06.300 --> 11:08.300
no lasting effects at all,

11:08.300 --> 11:10.300
and my hands aren't sweaty anymore.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.300
You didn't feel it mature you at all,

11:12.300 --> 11:14.300
like you passed through a crucible,

11:14.300 --> 11:18.300
came out maybe a little mentally tougher, older?

11:18.300 --> 11:22.300
I don't know. I'd say maybe I have lost enough sanity

11:22.300 --> 11:26.300
and rolled over my power and am at a breaking point,

11:26.300 --> 11:28.300
past my breaking point.

11:28.300 --> 11:31.300
Oh, hell, that's one hell of a way to put it.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.300
I think Clark's at that point, too.

11:33.300 --> 11:37.300
And you see a folding table fly over John's shoulder

11:37.300 --> 11:39.300
and crash into the sea.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.300
Well, I guess we'll probably explore that with you

11:43.300 --> 11:45.300
pretty soon here.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.300
I'm going to go check on Clark.

11:48.300 --> 11:51.300
Can I calm him down at all with persuade or...

11:51.300 --> 11:53.300
Yeah, if you have psychotherapy,

11:53.300 --> 11:55.300
that is what it is meant for,

11:55.300 --> 11:57.300
so if you need to roll persuade,

11:57.300 --> 11:59.300
then you'd take a negative 20.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.300
Okay, I'll try a negative 20 on my persuade,

12:02.300 --> 12:04.300
which is a 60.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.300
Fuck.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.300
59, that would have been excellent.

12:08.300 --> 12:11.300
So very ineffectively...

12:11.300 --> 12:15.300
Clark, I know we've seen a lot of fucked-up shit,

12:15.300 --> 12:17.300
and now your whole chronology...

12:17.300 --> 12:20.300
Yeah, he's got a little folding chair

12:20.300 --> 12:22.300
that he's using as a shield,

12:22.300 --> 12:25.300
and he's deflecting some incoming shots.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.300
Please!

12:30.300 --> 12:32.300
I don't like shots.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.300
Please!

12:35.300 --> 12:37.300
But, like, basically, just don't, like...

12:37.300 --> 12:39.300
I guess just don't worry about it,

12:39.300 --> 12:41.300
and your life will always be like this now,

12:41.300 --> 12:44.300
so why even, you know, don't stress out?

12:45.300 --> 12:49.300
Jack Russell is running and making a jump.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.300
Fails.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.300
Oh, no!

12:53.300 --> 12:55.300
Bye-bye, Jackie.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.300
He grabs...

12:56.300 --> 12:59.300
You can't take Jack from me!

13:00.300 --> 13:02.300
He grabs Keith by the legs

13:02.300 --> 13:05.300
and takes him down with him.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.300
Takes his huge pants down.

13:07.300 --> 13:10.300
But the shorts make for a huge parachute,

13:10.300 --> 13:13.300
and he's floating up and away.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.300
And then he's gone.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.300
The twinkle star in the sky,

13:23.300 --> 13:26.300
he just disappears like Team Rocket.

13:26.300 --> 13:32.300
Okay, so Jack Russell is going to begin falling,

13:32.300 --> 13:34.300
and as he makes the jump for it,

13:34.300 --> 13:36.300
he hits his head.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.300
He, like, grabs on to the railing,

13:38.300 --> 13:41.300
but then his head kind of slams into the room,

13:41.300 --> 13:43.300
and he immediately just lets go,

13:43.300 --> 13:45.300
and he starts falling,

13:45.300 --> 13:47.300
and he's falling on his back,

13:47.300 --> 13:49.300
and he's kind of, like, rotating backwards,

13:49.300 --> 13:52.300
so you think his neck is probably gonna land first.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.300
It's the ball's turn.

13:56.300 --> 14:00.300
It shrieked.

14:00.300 --> 14:04.300
The moment that it reversed all of its actions

14:04.300 --> 14:07.300
back to where it was in time...

14:13.300 --> 14:15.300
All of that got noise.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.300
Yeah, all of that got blocked by Discord.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.300
It was like, there must be a wild animal in Zach's apartment.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.300
Aiden and Alice Little are looking at their hands

14:29.300 --> 14:32.300
where they just held lollipops,

14:32.300 --> 14:34.300
but then, for some reason,

14:34.300 --> 14:38.300
we're forced to put the lollipops back into their overalls.

14:38.300 --> 14:41.300
Jon standing at the open door is just, like, pointing at Don,

14:41.300 --> 14:43.300
like, he did it, he did that to you.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.300
I just didn't want them to put a missing, like,

14:48.300 --> 14:49.300
taking our candy away from them

14:49.300 --> 14:51.300
on top of everything else that had happened.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.300
Holy shit.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.300
Okay.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.300
Ooh, 69.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.300
Uh-oh.

15:05.300 --> 15:10.300
Jack Russell does not hit the ocean, so that's good.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.300
However, the reason he doesn't hit the ocean

15:12.300 --> 15:14.300
is because one long metal tendril

15:14.300 --> 15:17.300
flies out towards him and skewers his neck

15:17.300 --> 15:20.300
right in between his head and his shoulders.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.300
It goes all the way through,

15:23.300 --> 15:26.300
about five yards past him as well,

15:26.300 --> 15:30.300
and so as the long, long metal limb

15:30.300 --> 15:36.300
is just horizontal above, parallel with the ocean,

15:36.300 --> 15:40.300
the body of Jack Russell is, like, hanging from it

15:40.300 --> 15:42.300
like a foosball player,

15:42.300 --> 15:47.300
but the stake is going through his neck.

15:47.300 --> 15:51.300
Because of his, like, rotation as he was falling,

15:51.300 --> 15:53.300
he is like a foosball player,

15:53.300 --> 15:57.300
kind of spinning around by his neck.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.300
The metal tendril rips backwards

16:00.300 --> 16:04.300
and brings the body of Jack Russell with it,

16:04.300 --> 16:08.300
and so now two of its tendrils are holding up bodies,

16:08.300 --> 16:12.300
one being Julie Maxwell, the other Jack Russell,

16:12.300 --> 16:16.300
as two of the other tendrils are in the melting,

16:16.300 --> 16:19.300
shimmering silver sea.

16:19.300 --> 16:22.300
They've kind of climbed out to find purchase

16:22.300 --> 16:26.300
within the waters, made of the same texture

16:26.300 --> 16:30.300
but in a different state than itself.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.300
Keith, it is your turn.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.300
Keith is pulling himself up to get up

16:34.300 --> 16:36.300
and get on, like, level ground,

16:36.300 --> 16:38.300
and as he's saying it, he looks over at Don

16:38.300 --> 16:43.300
and is like, thanks, don't use that on him.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.300
And with a 12, I pull myself up.

16:47.300 --> 16:51.300
I think Don gives, like, a menacing glare back to him,

16:51.300 --> 16:52.300
but doesn't say anything.

16:52.300 --> 16:55.300
You pull yourself up and can stand on this balcony

16:55.300 --> 16:58.300
that is outside of this stilted room

16:58.300 --> 17:00.300
with the hatch door right next to you.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.300
Yeah, as soon as I actually get up on there,

17:02.300 --> 17:04.300
I think about what just happened to me,

17:04.300 --> 17:08.300
and it's not computing.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.300
With that, I need Joe, Thomas, and Justin

17:10.300 --> 17:12.300
to take off their headphones.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.300
Ooh.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.300
Luke, Luke, Luke?

17:14.300 --> 17:17.300
Yeah, I'm a crazy guy.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.300
You fuck so good, though.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.300
Did he, Don?

17:22.300 --> 17:23.300
I'm on top of it.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.300
I need you to...

17:25.300 --> 17:26.300
You hit a breaking point, you said?

17:26.300 --> 17:30.300
Yeah, over my power, loss of sanity, breaking point.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.300
All the...

17:31.300 --> 17:32.300
All right.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.300
Hitting them all.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.300
All the things.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.300
So I need you to roll three times.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.300
A D100, right?

17:37.300 --> 17:39.300
Yes, please.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.300
A 61.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.300
A 3.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.300
And 80.

17:45.300 --> 17:49.300
61 is kleptomania,

17:49.300 --> 17:51.300
irrational compulsion for stealing.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.300
Okay.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.300
3 is acluomania,

17:56.300 --> 17:59.300
an excessive liking for darkness.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.300
Okay.

18:00.300 --> 18:03.300
And 80 is phasmomania,

18:03.300 --> 18:06.300
an obsession with ghosts.

18:06.300 --> 18:09.300
I'm gonna say because of where I am

18:09.300 --> 18:10.300
when this happened,

18:10.300 --> 18:13.300
and it's, you know, dark and gooey

18:13.300 --> 18:16.300
and all the colors and also other stuff, right?

18:16.300 --> 18:17.300
Yep.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.300
The second one, compulsion for the dark.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.300
Yeah, okay.

18:20.300 --> 18:25.300
So you are going to have acluo, acluo, acluo.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.300
Acluomania.

18:26.300 --> 18:30.300
An excessive liking for darkness.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.300
I like it.

18:32.300 --> 18:36.300
And then you are now extremely paranoid.

18:36.300 --> 18:39.300
I know what this is gonna manifest as.

18:39.300 --> 18:43.300
All right, let's get him back.

18:43.300 --> 18:52.300
Birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.300
I feel birded.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.300
Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird, oran.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.300
You know that one, classic one.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.300
My favorite bird too.

19:01.300 --> 19:04.300
Yeah, I kind of like look off in the distance for a second,

19:04.300 --> 19:06.300
and then I look at Don.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.300
Yeah, he's hanging there off the railing,

19:09.300 --> 19:15.300
I walk over to where he is and I start stepping on one of his fingers.

19:15.300 --> 19:19.300
Oh, shit.

19:19.300 --> 19:22.300
Okay, roll against each other.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.300
Oh, I hope I lose.

19:24.300 --> 19:27.300
What am I rolling, strength or?

19:27.300 --> 19:30.300
You can either like try to hold on tight,

19:30.300 --> 19:33.300
or you can try to like move your hands away from where he's stepping.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.300
What am I rolling?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.300
What am I rolling?

19:37.300 --> 19:39.300
This is a very important number.

19:39.300 --> 19:43.300
I guess unarmed combat, I guess is technically what it is.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.300
I crit, succeed.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.300
No.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.300
Jesus Christ.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.300
Can I just like tough it out, or is that like not really an option?

19:54.300 --> 19:55.300
Should I try and move?

19:55.300 --> 19:56.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:56.300 --> 20:00.300
So you could roll like constitution to tough it out, yeah.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.300
That's what I think I'd do because I don't want to move.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.300
Wait, wait, I lied, I lied.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.300
I was looking at the wrong sheet.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.300
Did you crit fail?

20:06.300 --> 20:09.300
I only have a 40, so I crit fail.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.300
Oh.

20:10.300 --> 20:12.300
I was looking at Clark's.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.300
Should I still roll?

20:14.300 --> 20:16.300
Whoa, sneaky.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.300
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.300
What if I crit fail worse?

20:21.300 --> 20:24.300
I didn't, I got a 35 on a 60.

20:24.300 --> 20:29.300
You're like, you go to step, you go to step on Don's fingers,

20:29.300 --> 20:33.300
and a critical fail, huh?

20:33.300 --> 20:34.300
Throw him back into the sea.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.300
I know, right?

20:35.300 --> 20:37.300
Yeah, he just slips and falls over the railing.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.300
Undo everything.

20:38.300 --> 20:46.300
And Don won't save him that time because he tried to step on his fucking fingers.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.300
I don't have to die.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.300
I don't think it's that.

20:50.300 --> 20:58.300
My parachute pants open up and it slows me down so much that I can't even touch his fingers with my foot.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.300
Oh my God.

21:02.300 --> 21:04.300
There's an updraft in here.

21:04.300 --> 21:05.300
What's updraft?

21:05.300 --> 21:06.300
Nice.

21:06.300 --> 21:09.300
Nice.

21:09.300 --> 21:15.300
I slip on the puddle of sweat that's like dripped off of me.

21:15.300 --> 21:20.300
Yeah, you slip on the sweat from your wet hands.

21:20.300 --> 21:23.300
Oh, Keith Vigna, old wet hands.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.300
What'd you do to my ankle?

21:25.300 --> 21:27.300
I scream at Don.

21:27.300 --> 21:28.300
That's right.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.300
That's perfect.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.300
Yes.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.300
You like getting his face too.

21:31.300 --> 21:35.300
Well, I'm on the ground, so I'm like face to face with him.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.300
Screaming right in his face.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.300
What'd you do to my ankle?

21:38.300 --> 21:43.300
And I'm like grabbing my ankle and I'm like angry and very scared.

21:45.300 --> 21:46.300
Clark, your turn.

21:46.300 --> 21:47.300
Am I snapped out of it?

21:47.300 --> 21:48.300
Yeah.

21:48.300 --> 21:54.300
He starts to get his wits about him and he stops throwing things with his much vigor

21:54.300 --> 21:57.300
and then slowly stops throwing things at all.

21:57.300 --> 21:58.300
Oh, God.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.300
Leo, I'm so sorry.

21:59.300 --> 22:00.300
Oh, fuck.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.300
Leo, I didn't mean it.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.300
You were caught in the crossfire.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.300
I'm sorry.

22:05.300 --> 22:06.300
I didn't mean to do that.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.300
It just happens sometimes.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.300
I'm sorry.

22:09.300 --> 22:14.300
And I try and help him get the putter out of the bullet hole.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.300
Shit.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.300
I'm sorry.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.300
I'm sorry, Leo.

22:17.300 --> 22:18.300
I didn't mean to do that.

22:18.300 --> 22:22.300
Leo, you have to admit it was one hell of a throw.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.300
That was one in a million.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.300
Got you right in the hole, did I?

22:25.300 --> 22:26.300
Dang it.

22:26.300 --> 22:27.300
Dang it.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.300
Dang my perfect throwing arm.

22:28.300 --> 22:33.300
This hole is so big now you can fit like two apples in here.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.300
Hole or sliced up?

22:36.300 --> 22:37.300
Two.

22:37.300 --> 22:38.300
Okay, rookie numbers.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.300
John, we got to get out of here.

22:40.300 --> 22:42.300
It's driving us mad.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.300
We can't be staying here.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.300
We got to – that ball's out there.

22:46.300 --> 22:50.300
We got to – what are we going to do?

22:50.300 --> 22:52.300
That's my turn.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.300
Don, you're up.

22:56.300 --> 23:00.300
Does Don know that he was about to get stepped on or did he just see –

23:00.300 --> 23:01.300
I guess not.

23:01.300 --> 23:06.300
– Vigna take one step and then tweak his ankle and fall over and start yelling at me?

23:06.300 --> 23:09.300
And then he panic screams at you.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.300
You guys are like face to face.

23:15.300 --> 23:18.300
I'm going to pull myself up and I'm like, what happened to you, boy?

23:18.300 --> 23:20.300
I shrink away from him in total fear.

23:21.300 --> 23:26.300
I want to slap him in the face to like snap him back into reality.

23:26.300 --> 23:27.300
That seems like Don.

23:30.300 --> 23:33.300
Can I roll to resist getting slapped?

23:33.300 --> 23:39.300
No, I think that with how panicked and freaked out Keith is, he's just going to take it.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.300
I do a backhand too.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.300
Front and back or just backhand?

23:43.300 --> 23:45.300
Oh, both would be good though.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.300
Let's say both.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.300
Thanks for the recommendation, Luke.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.300
Yeah, yeah, anything.

23:51.300 --> 23:58.300
Yeah, I like pull up the shirt collar since he's on the ground and like holding his head in front of me just like whack, whack.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.300
It's a big coral polo.

24:00.300 --> 24:04.300
It's actually a little too tight on me so it pulls me right to him.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.300
Not anymore. Not after this.

24:06.300 --> 24:07.300
Yeah.

24:07.300 --> 24:10.300
It's going to be a huge awkward neckline just hanging down.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.300
Oh, God.

24:11.300 --> 24:12.300
So unfortunate.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.300
Snap out of it, boy.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.300
Jon, your turn.

24:22.300 --> 24:28.300
Jon hears the trademark shrieking whimper of someone who's just been slapped.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.300
Snapped out of it?

24:29.300 --> 24:31.300
Yeah, by a petty more uncle.

24:34.300 --> 24:44.300
He takes inspiration and slaps Clark who has just screamed, what are we going to do?

24:44.300 --> 24:51.300
And Jon smacks him twice across the face, grabs him by the shoulders and says, I don't know.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.300
What kind of sound does Clark make?

24:58.300 --> 25:04.300
Don D. Pettymore hears the echo of slaps happening.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.300
A tear runs down his eye.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.300
Ouchie, ouchie.

25:12.300 --> 25:13.300
Oh, my God.

25:13.300 --> 25:15.300
That boy might be a ball.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.300
But he's a petty ball.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.300
A petty ball.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.300
Jon Lee petty ball.

25:21.300 --> 25:22.300
Holy shit.

25:22.300 --> 25:24.300
Ouchie, ouchie.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.300
Ouchie, ouchie.

25:31.300 --> 25:34.300
It's Jack Russell's turn and he's dead.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.300
That's one less thing on your plate, Zach.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.300
I didn't get to say two to a canoe.

25:42.300 --> 25:48.300
I thought you were going to say as he got pulled away and he was dying, he'd be like, two to a canoe.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.300
Two to a canoe, bro.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.300
Oh, well, now's a good time for that.

25:52.300 --> 26:03.300
So, yeah, he's still hanging there and his vocal cords are pushing against the metal tendril that's going through his neck sideways.

26:03.300 --> 26:13.300
And so as he's talking, it reverberates through the metallic arm of this ball and it's like, two to a canoe.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.300
Truly horrible.

26:17.300 --> 26:21.300
Jon's just like, I don't get that reference personally.

26:24.300 --> 26:26.300
None of us did, boy.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.300
And then it's the ball's turn.

26:33.300 --> 26:37.300
Just make him be nice. Just make him do a nice thing for us.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.300
Yeah.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.300
Yeah.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.300
Yeah, Zach, you ever think of that?

26:40.300 --> 26:41.300
Yeah, Zach.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.300
The ball is coming for...

26:46.300 --> 26:48.300
It's definitely Don. It's coming for Don.

26:49.300 --> 26:57.300
He's the only one who's like, out of one of the rooms and he's standing above Keith, so Keith wouldn't be a target.

26:57.300 --> 27:06.300
So the biggest target is Don D. Pettymore and this thing is flinging a metal tendril at you. What do you do?

27:06.300 --> 27:10.300
Is the hatch near me the door to get into?

27:10.300 --> 27:16.300
Yeah, in fact, you're in kind of a spot where you could slam open the door and use it as a shield.

27:16.300 --> 27:26.300
I imagine it like if we were standing in the middle of the rope bridge, if the rope bridge was still attached to this second stilted bunker

27:26.300 --> 27:35.300
and we were staring at the hatch, you would be with Keith holding him just to the left of this hatch

27:35.300 --> 27:46.300
and you'd have to reach across this hatch door in order to pull it open, putting the door in between you and the metal tendril flinging toward you

27:46.300 --> 27:53.300
but also putting the entrance to this bunker on the other side of the hatch from where you were standing.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.300
Yeah, I think I'd try and get some kind of cover, basically.

27:55.300 --> 27:58.300
If you slam the door open, it'll be between you and the arm.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.300
Yeah.

27:59.300 --> 28:09.300
Okay, so go ahead and roll either athletics, dexterity, strength maybe, I guess, or dodge doors.

28:09.300 --> 28:12.300
If I got a good dodge, we'll see. Nope, dexterity it is.

28:17.300 --> 28:23.300
Wait, hold on. Oh, 47 on a 55. I've never rolled this well in my entire fucking life.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.300
What's going on there? What was that?

28:26.300 --> 28:27.300
It was gross.

28:27.300 --> 28:28.300
He's making kissy faces.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.300
That's weird.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.300
He made a kissy face, then he made a...

28:31.300 --> 28:33.300
There's a ghost, a sexy ghost in his house.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.300
Kind of linguist's face.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.300
What are you guys talking about?

28:37.300 --> 28:38.300
Taylor brought me food.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.300
Oh.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.300
Is it Taco Bell?

28:42.300 --> 28:44.300
No, it's Subway, actually. I'm very confused.

28:44.300 --> 28:45.300
Wow.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.300
You gotta eat fresh.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.300
Mm-hmm. Blimpies eat fresh.

28:48.300 --> 28:51.300
It's called Blimpie. There's no S on the end.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.300
It's not all B's.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.300
Wait, really?

28:54.300 --> 28:56.300
They rebooted it with a Z.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.300
I didn't know that about Blimpie.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.300
It's called Arby.

28:58.300 --> 29:04.300
It's just one of my mini pet peeves. Specifically Blimpies. That's the only one that gets me for some reason.

29:05.300 --> 29:06.300
So...

29:06.300 --> 29:07.300
What about Arby?

29:08.300 --> 29:09.300
That's what Thomas said.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.300
We're going to Arby.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.300
Yeah, that's what Thomas said.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.300
Oh, sorry.

29:14.300 --> 29:15.300
All right.

29:15.300 --> 29:16.300
Back to your roll.

29:16.300 --> 29:18.300
What about Arby?

29:18.300 --> 29:19.300
Dude!

29:19.300 --> 29:20.300
Dude!

29:24.300 --> 29:25.300
Nice. Good one.

29:25.300 --> 29:26.300
Because that one's plural.

29:26.300 --> 29:27.300
Windy.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.300
Possessive.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.300
It's plural.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.300
There are two Arby.

29:37.300 --> 29:38.300
I passed.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.300
With a 40.

29:42.300 --> 29:43.300
Which is lower.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.300
Which is...

29:44.300 --> 29:45.300
Wait, is that good or bad?

29:45.300 --> 29:46.300
I don't know.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.300
That's good for you.

29:47.300 --> 29:48.300
Yay!

29:48.300 --> 29:49.300
Wait, what did you roll?

29:50.300 --> 29:51.300
I rolled a 47.

29:52.300 --> 29:53.300
Cool.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.300
Hell yeah.

29:54.300 --> 29:57.300
So you slam open this hatch door.

29:57.300 --> 30:01.300
You just rip it open and it's blocking you and Keith.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.300
You can't see the boat at all anymore.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.300
You can't see this metal tendril coming toward you.

30:05.300 --> 30:17.300
And then all of a sudden, the hatch door, which is made out of the same black, colorful, inky darkness, warps toward you.

30:17.300 --> 30:21.300
Like something is pushing into it from the other side.

30:21.300 --> 30:30.300
And it's almost as if a stretched out piece of cotton or a canvas is being pushed by a hand.

30:30.300 --> 30:35.300
But it's this metal tendril trying to push and break through this hatch.

30:35.300 --> 30:36.300
And it cannot.

30:36.300 --> 30:39.300
And it kind of rubbery bounces back.

30:39.300 --> 30:43.300
You can't see anything, but you seem to be safe.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.300
You feel...

30:44.300 --> 30:46.300
There's not a metal tendril inside of you.

30:46.300 --> 30:47.300
So you did good.

30:47.300 --> 30:48.300
Good job.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.300
Yeah, thanks.

30:52.300 --> 30:53.300
Jon, your turn.

30:53.300 --> 30:56.300
Seeing that, Jon wants to quickly...

30:56.300 --> 30:57.300
Hey, Jon.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.300
Sorry.

30:58.300 --> 31:13.300
When he flings open the hatch through the doorway, you do not see the inside of a room like the junkyard bunker that you are in.

31:13.300 --> 31:17.300
You see a vast world.

31:17.300 --> 31:24.300
The sky is the same inky darkness that is extremely, extremely...

31:24.300 --> 31:25.300
Oh, wait.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.300
No, it's not.

31:26.300 --> 31:29.300
There's no color in it at all.

31:29.300 --> 31:32.300
It's just darkness.

31:32.300 --> 31:37.300
And the ground is made of pure light.

31:37.300 --> 31:42.300
It seems kind of like we got screwed on the bunker lottery, Clark.

31:42.300 --> 31:46.300
Looks like there's a world of pure light over on the other side.

31:46.300 --> 31:52.300
That might be nice, instead of this junkyard fucking dying-ass Leo piston.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.300
The cat fucker.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.300
It may not be nice, actually.

31:56.300 --> 31:59.300
I've seen a place like that before.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.300
The Circle of Knowledge showed me that.

32:01.300 --> 32:06.300
That's where that creature I saw that I'm so frightened of, that's where it lived.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.300
That's where they were trying to keep it.

32:08.300 --> 32:11.300
They were trying to keep it in that place.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.300
Well, Don just opened a door.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.300
I don't think that's...

32:13.300 --> 32:14.300
That's probably not good.

32:14.300 --> 32:18.300
I don't think it'd fit through that door, but that's probably not good that that door is open.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.300
Shit.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.300
I don't know.

32:21.300 --> 32:24.300
Maybe it is best if we just stay here with the cat fucker.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.300
But we probably should go get Keith.

32:26.300 --> 32:29.300
I guess we gotta take Jack Russell's boat.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.300
Is that how we get over there?

32:30.300 --> 32:31.300
How are we gonna...

32:31.300 --> 32:32.300
What are we gonna...

32:32.300 --> 32:40.300
What if I just spent months in here, Bruce Wayne-ing myself in the ways of the ooze and learning how to manipulate it.

32:40.300 --> 32:44.300
And then once I'm like a master, then we go outside and rescue everybody.

32:44.300 --> 32:47.300
I forgot that you're doing that kind of thing with the ooze stuff now.

32:47.300 --> 32:51.300
Do you feel like you have control over it in an effective way?

32:51.300 --> 32:53.300
Can we use that to our advantage here?

32:53.300 --> 32:57.300
It really does seem like the rules are stacked in my favor, so to speak.

32:57.300 --> 33:02.300
But in another manner speaking, I don't want to break the game by being super powerful.

33:02.300 --> 33:07.300
And just manipulating literally everything in the world.

33:07.300 --> 33:10.300
This ball is one-shotting people.

33:10.300 --> 33:18.300
I think now is the time to use any resource that you have available in order to not die or not let your friends die.

33:18.300 --> 33:25.300
You know how when we went out the Marie Jacobs door and then we came around and we were at the same door again, we did like a loop-de-loop somehow?

33:25.300 --> 33:26.300
Yeah.

33:26.300 --> 33:30.300
Can you create a door that does that for us to get over there?

33:30.300 --> 33:33.300
Let me think about that.

33:33.300 --> 33:40.300
John walks over to the wall and puts his hands on his hips and kind of considers for a moment.

33:40.300 --> 33:44.300
And he touches the top and he touches the bottom.

33:44.300 --> 33:47.300
And he closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.300
And I roll unnatural.

33:49.300 --> 33:53.300
And he passes with a 37.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.300
Whoa.

33:55.300 --> 34:08.300
Looking through this portal that you've just created, John Lee, Kevin Moore III, and Clark Bishop see a metal tendril pulling back away from this portal.

34:08.300 --> 34:17.300
And the view that you're looking through seems to be from the side of the hatch that was just penetrated by this metal tendril.

34:17.300 --> 34:22.300
You're like looking out of that hatch somehow.

34:23.300 --> 34:27.300
So if you walk through, then you'd be on the other side from Don and Keith.

34:27.300 --> 34:31.300
So it's about to come flying through this portal at us?

34:31.300 --> 34:33.300
It's pulling away right now.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.300
Right. But it's probably going to hit again, right?

34:35.300 --> 34:37.300
In two turns? Yeah, probably.

34:37.300 --> 34:41.300
One of those is Jack Russell, though, and he's dead.

34:41.300 --> 34:45.300
Oh. Two turns, not two rounds. Okay.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.300
You don't know that to be true.

34:47.300 --> 34:49.300
Right. Of course not.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.300
You did it, John. You did it.

34:50.300 --> 34:52.300
Yeah, on the wrong side of the door, though, I think.

34:52.300 --> 34:58.300
I mean, John, I was just warning you that that thing is in there, but at this point, maybe getting in there, maybe the ball can't get in there?

34:58.300 --> 35:01.300
I mean, any place is better than this if the ball's going to kill us.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.300
Can I hear this conversation?

35:03.300 --> 35:07.300
You're kind of, yeah.

35:07.300 --> 35:13.300
Strangely enough, you're hearing it from the other side of the hatch door.

35:13.300 --> 35:16.300
You can hear Clark and John having this conversation.

35:16.300 --> 35:19.300
Clark? Is that you?

35:19.300 --> 35:21.300
John? Oh, shit.

35:21.300 --> 35:22.300
And I'm still laying on the ground?

35:22.300 --> 35:24.300
Well, now that gives me an idea.

35:24.300 --> 35:27.300
John closes the portal.

35:27.300 --> 35:31.300
I just realized your turn was opening the portal.

35:31.300 --> 35:35.300
Okay. Oh, no. That's fair.

35:35.300 --> 35:40.300
The ball.

35:40.300 --> 35:42.300
Crit fail.

35:42.300 --> 35:45.300
So this ball is, like, so freaked out.

35:45.300 --> 35:52.300
I mean, this thing is just making these noises, these, like,

35:52.300 --> 35:59.300
just like aggressively poking at things, you know, trying to just, like, catch bodies, seemingly trying to collect.

35:59.300 --> 36:01.300
But it's like out of control.

36:01.300 --> 36:09.300
As you open this portal, you see one of these long metal tendrils just flies up through into the portal.

36:09.300 --> 36:17.300
It's like trying to, like, get one of you, but it just completely misses as John closes the portal.

36:17.300 --> 36:25.300
And this metal tendril just falls in this Leo piston junk bunk yard bunker stilted room.

36:25.300 --> 36:28.300
And it wriggles for, like, half a second.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.300
And then it just stops.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.300
You were right, John.

36:32.300 --> 36:35.300
It doesn't, it can't, or, I don't know.

36:35.300 --> 36:41.300
I don't know. I don't know what that means to us.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.300
You injured it. You injured it. That's a good thing.

36:43.300 --> 36:44.300
Yeah.

36:44.300 --> 36:59.300
And through the John made hole in this, in the side of this room that's still there, you hear this thing, like,

36:59.300 --> 37:02.300
Keith, it's your turn.

37:02.300 --> 37:08.300
Keith heard Jack Russell kind of, like, yell something as he was being taken away.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.300
And it sounded like a spell to Keith.

37:10.300 --> 37:13.300
And he knew that Don just cast a spell.

37:13.300 --> 37:16.300
So Keith is thinking that he was trying to cast a spell.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.300
So Keith starts saying,

37:18.300 --> 37:34.300
That's so good.

37:34.300 --> 37:36.300
Amazing. Clark, it's your turn.

37:36.300 --> 37:40.300
He wants to kick the metal tendril that is now on the ground.

37:40.300 --> 37:44.300
What kind of texture and material sensation do I get from it?

37:44.300 --> 37:45.300
Is it solid metal?

37:45.300 --> 37:48.300
It's like a hard, hard, solid, shiny metal.

37:48.300 --> 37:53.300
That was good work, John. I mean, that's, you created a portal.

37:53.300 --> 37:57.300
It just was kind of an inopportune time, but that's the kind of thing we need now.

37:57.300 --> 38:02.300
If we can time it right, we could either us go over there or just bring them back to our side.

38:02.300 --> 38:08.300
Yeah, I just don't think it ever works out with the turn order.

38:08.300 --> 38:10.300
I just don't think this happens while we're in combat.

38:10.300 --> 38:11.300
You can wait.

38:11.300 --> 38:16.300
What if I waited a moment and chose the time I would strike?

38:16.300 --> 38:19.300
Yeah, I think that's probably for the best.

38:19.300 --> 38:23.300
I'll trigger it to set off right after your turn.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.300
I'll skip this turn, wait till the end of your turn,

38:26.300 --> 38:34.300
and so the portal will open right before Don's turn in a manner of speaking.

38:34.300 --> 38:37.300
I guess we can talk about turn order out of character.

38:37.300 --> 38:40.300
That's fine. That's part of our plan.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.300
Yeah, I will trigger this. Yeah, I'll do all that.

38:42.300 --> 38:46.300
I'll trigger this action to go off after your next turn, Joe,

38:46.300 --> 38:50.300
so that it'll open up and Don can run through it on his turn and bring Keith with him.

38:50.300 --> 38:55.300
So that just means that they have to survive whatever the ball does on this round, right?

38:55.300 --> 38:56.300
Yeah.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.300
Yep, and it's Don's turn.

38:58.300 --> 39:04.300
So I saw the tendril whiz into the door and then get cut off, basically.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.300
You heard it freaking out.

39:06.300 --> 39:11.300
Yeah, if you poke your head around the door, then you would see it's not the whole tendril.

39:11.300 --> 39:15.300
Half the tendril is recoiling, and it's losing its mind.

39:15.300 --> 39:18.300
Or mind. It's losing its ball.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.300
It's marbles.

39:20.300 --> 39:26.300
I think I'd just stay in a good defensive spot, preparing for another strike.

39:26.300 --> 39:31.300
Keith's like, chant this spell with me, to do hakanu.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.300
Does Don know what that does?

39:33.300 --> 39:39.300
You would recognize it as a mispronounced phrase that your old buddy Jack Russell used to say all the time

39:39.300 --> 39:41.300
when two of you were on the boat together.

39:41.300 --> 39:43.300
Oh, he said two? Oh my god.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.300
Oh, it's absolutely perfect. Oh, he just got it.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.300
Oh, it's so good that it's just me and you, because we've got two to a canoe here.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.300
Two to a canoe.

39:51.300 --> 39:53.300
Two to a canoe. Two to a canoe.

39:53.300 --> 39:56.300
Oh my god, I can't believe I didn't realize what that was.

39:56.300 --> 40:00.300
Yeah, I had no idea. I thought it was a reference I wasn't getting, which it was.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.300
Yeah, I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?

40:06.300 --> 40:09.300
I'm like, I feel like I'd just be like, now stay close to me, boy.

40:09.300 --> 40:13.300
We gotta survive this, and I'll like, is he near me, or were you like, scooting away from me?

40:13.300 --> 40:15.300
You're like, standing over me.

40:15.300 --> 40:17.300
You still got him like, by the shirt collar.

40:17.300 --> 40:22.300
Yeah, I'm holding him, I have him by the shirt collar, and I'm like, taking a defensive position.

40:22.300 --> 40:23.300
Perfect.

40:23.300 --> 40:27.300
John is pushing his turn, Jack Russell is dead, and the ball goes again.

40:28.300 --> 40:42.300
Don, Keith, the two of you see the ball put its long, long limbs into this shining, shimmering, silver sea, and begin moving.

40:42.300 --> 40:52.300
It drops the body of Jack Russell onto the boat right behind the little twins, still holding onto the body of Julie Maxwell,

40:52.300 --> 41:01.300
but it moves and makes its way toward the John made hole in the side of the original piston bunker yard,

41:01.300 --> 41:11.300
and John and Clark, you both see, just rising from below, right outside that John made hole,

41:11.300 --> 41:20.300
a one inch in diameter, silver sphere pop up with the tendrils coming out below it and above it.

41:20.300 --> 41:23.300
It's made its way to the John made hole.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.300
Keith, your turn.

41:24.300 --> 41:26.300
I stand up.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.300
Fuck.

41:28.300 --> 41:32.300
I look on the other side of the door to see what could have happened to this spider.

41:32.300 --> 41:37.300
When you look on the other side of the door, you just see it's a hatch door, it's kind of made out of the same material,

41:37.300 --> 41:45.300
but then you see through the door this entirely new world, the sky completely dark.

41:45.300 --> 41:51.300
It's almost tension relieving when you look into it because it is just one thing.

41:51.300 --> 41:58.300
When you look into the sky and you look at materials that are in this plane of existence where you are currently,

41:58.300 --> 42:03.300
it wrinkles your brain, it like tenses your shoulders.

42:03.300 --> 42:07.300
You haven't been able to really relax even though you feel completely content here.

42:07.300 --> 42:14.300
There, on the other side, it is just darkness above and just light below.

42:14.300 --> 42:18.300
I want to walk in looking straight above me like trying not to look at the ground at all

42:18.300 --> 42:25.300
and trying to not have the ground in my eyesight at all, staring straight up and just walk in.

42:25.300 --> 42:37.300
Past the ball and in the foreground of your view, Clark and Jon both see Keith in the background walking through the door.

42:37.300 --> 42:39.300
Clark, it's your turn.

42:39.300 --> 42:47.300
Clark is going to try and get low and put junk piles between him and the ball at the door.

42:47.300 --> 42:53.300
Yes. Jon, his eyes get big as he sees the ball floating there.

42:53.300 --> 42:59.300
He kicks himself for closing the portal in the first place and hastily tries to make it again.

42:59.300 --> 43:02.300
43.

43:02.300 --> 43:11.300
With his experienced hand, he opens the door into the ivory endlessness of the terrain in the other bunker.

43:11.300 --> 43:15.300
They see Keith just in front of them walking into it.

43:15.300 --> 43:17.300
Jon yells at Clark,

43:17.300 --> 43:20.300
Come on, buddy. We got to get fucking through this portal.

43:20.300 --> 43:27.300
And kind of assumes, I guess, that the ball will choose Leo instead of Clark.

43:27.300 --> 43:33.300
He just grabs onto whatever part of Clark is closest to him and drags him through the portal with him.

43:33.300 --> 43:35.300
Dope. Amazing.

43:35.300 --> 43:37.300
All right, Don, your turn.

43:37.300 --> 43:41.300
I see Keith walk away from me, right?

43:41.300 --> 43:43.300
Yeah, Keith goes to the other side of the hatch.

43:43.300 --> 43:45.300
Do I see, like, Jon coming through?

43:45.300 --> 43:52.300
Yeah, when you turn and go around the hatch to your left immediately on the inside of this hatch door,

43:52.300 --> 43:58.300
you see Jon dragging Clark through and they pass you as you're standing there.

43:58.300 --> 44:02.300
They pass you and walk right behind Keith into this new world.

44:02.300 --> 44:07.300
I think Don just slams the fucking door and turns to go with them.

44:07.300 --> 44:08.300
Fuck yeah.

44:08.300 --> 44:15.300
So you come through the door, slam the door behind you, and the four of you have entered a new world.

44:15.300 --> 44:17.300
It is Jon's turn right behind you.

44:17.300 --> 44:21.300
The inside of this hatch is still a portal to the world that you were just in.

44:21.300 --> 44:25.300
Anybody forget anything? Car keys? Cell phones?

44:25.300 --> 44:27.300
Leo!

44:27.300 --> 44:31.300
No, no, no, no. No. God damn.

44:31.300 --> 44:34.300
I promised him we wouldn't forget him.

44:34.300 --> 44:36.300
Yeah!

44:36.300 --> 44:38.300
You hear a violent cry.

44:38.300 --> 44:40.300
We gotta help if we did this to him.

44:40.300 --> 44:44.300
Did they forget the goat they fed to the Tyrannosaurus in Jurassic Park?

44:44.300 --> 44:46.300
No, it played an important role.

44:46.300 --> 44:48.300
And I'm gonna try to...

44:48.300 --> 44:50.300
I'm gonna try to close that portal.

44:50.300 --> 44:52.300
Forty-five.

44:52.300 --> 44:56.300
I mean, yay!

44:56.300 --> 44:58.300
No, that's rad.

44:58.300 --> 45:10.300
The fact that Jon Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth is just so in tune with this ability makes so much sense.

45:10.300 --> 45:12.300
Because you're home, baby.

45:12.300 --> 45:23.300
Jon moves his experienced hands across this strange inky doorway, removes the portal, and the hatch dissipates into nothingness as well.

45:23.300 --> 45:27.300
The ground you all stand on is made of light.

45:27.300 --> 45:32.300
It's a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below.

45:32.300 --> 45:38.300
In every direction surrounding you, what could be called the ground meets what could be called the sky.

45:38.300 --> 45:43.300
And it's this blacker than black opaque darkness.

45:43.300 --> 45:52.300
And there's nothing on the horizon except for a single imposing building way off in the distance.

45:52.300 --> 46:00.300
Dimly lit from below, you can see that it's a slightly shiny pitch black.

46:00.300 --> 46:06.300
But Keith doesn't notice that because Keith is staring straight up.

46:06.300 --> 46:16.300
And each of you understand why he hasn't stopped staring when you follow his gaze up into a tube of pure light hanging above.

46:16.300 --> 46:24.300
The interior wall of this incandescent pipe is made of the same light you currently stand on.

46:24.300 --> 46:31.300
And there seems to be only complete darkness beyond its well-lit passage.

46:31.300 --> 46:39.300
And there's something in this immense, resplendent cylinder, consistently plodding the glowing terrain,

46:39.300 --> 46:45.300
somehow simultaneously moving toward you and staying at a uniform range.

46:45.300 --> 46:55.300
It is a towering, lumbering beast, seemingly made of the darkness that surrounds everything in this place.

46:55.300 --> 47:00.300
It walks on two massive legs the size of trees.

47:00.300 --> 47:06.300
Its broad shoulders swing back and forth high above the glossy ground.

47:06.300 --> 47:15.300
And as you all stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible little glitches.

47:15.300 --> 47:21.300
And you cannot fully make sense of its shape. And then it roars.

47:26.300 --> 47:34.300
Every muscle in your body stiffens and every breath abandons your lungs.

47:36.300 --> 47:44.300
Bad girls on top of the water

47:44.300 --> 47:48.300
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

47:48.300 --> 47:52.300
Leaving my mind at your altar

47:52.300 --> 47:56.300
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

47:56.300 --> 48:02.300
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

48:03.300 --> 48:10.300
What kind of world are you living in?

48:10.300 --> 48:14.300
What kind of world are you living in?

48:30.300 --> 48:36.300
What kind of world are you living in?

48:36.300 --> 48:44.300
What kind of world are you living in?
