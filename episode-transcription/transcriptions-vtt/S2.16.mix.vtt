00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
Hello, my little weirdos.

00:03.040 --> 00:05.920
It's your giant father, Wolf the Dog.

00:05.920 --> 00:09.680
And I'm here to embrace you freaky little dudes.

00:09.680 --> 00:15.440
Society may reject you, but your great mother wolf never shall.

00:15.440 --> 00:21.120
You provide your ears, your minds, your energies.

00:21.120 --> 00:26.240
And I provide you with the greatest radio show this side of the Polaris.

00:26.240 --> 00:33.840
And I am shipping out auditory waves live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:33.840 --> 00:38.720
The only radio station that lets little weirdos like you

00:38.720 --> 00:43.360
write in things that I am contractually obligated to read.

00:43.360 --> 00:48.240
Speaking of, this edition of Howlin' with Wolf comes from Liddy in the City,

00:48.240 --> 00:52.160
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.000
The third best thing you can do with them thumbs.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.160
Liddy in the City writes,

00:58.160 --> 01:01.680
Hey Wolf, thanks for all the rippin' songs.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.840
Altagirl is keepin' my grip strong as I move along.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.240
Swiftly through this shitty city.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.320
But I long to be strong.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.680
To no longer be a pawn who keeps calm.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.600
I want the full throttle.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.960
No doddle logical like Aristotle.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.040
Light the rag in this bottle.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.400
Fuck Fred Godel.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.760
Well, thanks, Liddy in the City.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.840
There was an awful lot of rhymin' in this Howlin' with Wolf.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.800
Is this that slam poetry I've heard so much about?

01:34.800 --> 01:37.680
Now you did a good job, Liddy in the City.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.960
I would snap my fingers in appreciation.

01:40.960 --> 01:48.240
But unfortunately, the grease prevents any friction between any of my body parts.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.080
If you want to write up something for your loving wolf to howl,

01:52.080 --> 01:55.280
tag at Pretending Pod on your social media accounts

01:55.360 --> 01:59.120
and let your friends know that you're an absolute weirdo.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.880
If they're your friends, they're probably pretty strange too.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.240
And if you want to have that sort of conversation in public,

02:06.240 --> 02:08.400
go to PretendingPod.shop

02:08.400 --> 02:11.440
and grab a hat that says PTBP

02:11.440 --> 02:14.080
or a super rad fanny pack

02:14.080 --> 02:19.360
with a four-panel cartoon of What Went Down at Splashylvania on it.

02:19.360 --> 02:23.520
You'll have a new group of freaks to hang out with in no time.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.640
Don't go out?

02:24.640 --> 02:28.000
You can take this game to a high score situation

02:28.000 --> 02:32.880
by posting pics of your hot new PTBP merch online

02:32.880 --> 02:37.040
from the comfort and safety of your mobile device.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.040
The options are endless.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.000
And the links are in the show notes.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.800
S-E-G-U-E

02:44.800 --> 02:46.720
S-E-G-U-E

02:46.720 --> 02:48.480
S-E-G-U-E

02:48.480 --> 02:50.640
And yes, this is a segue.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.320
It's time for the news.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.520
Last time,

02:53.520 --> 02:56.160
Julius ran back into Grover's Gorge

02:56.160 --> 02:58.800
to get away from the wet energy

02:58.800 --> 03:01.920
that erupted out of Chuck Bidwell's body

03:01.920 --> 03:04.800
when it landed in the unnatural chasm,

03:04.800 --> 03:08.240
exploded through the stained glass of the church

03:08.240 --> 03:11.760
that stuck upside down in the smooth crevasse,

03:11.760 --> 03:14.960
and everyone else was knocked unconscious.

03:14.960 --> 03:19.360
The conscious can field producer found Fox Gottel

03:19.360 --> 03:23.280
and brought him back to the rest of the can crew with a plan.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.640
As they came to, Julius asked Stevie,

03:26.640 --> 03:29.280
as the eldest Gottel in the area,

03:29.280 --> 03:33.040
to declare Fox the new mayor of Grover's Gorge.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.440
No one expected it to work,

03:35.440 --> 03:38.880
but that sloppy god came bursting back out

03:38.880 --> 03:41.040
through the colorful church windows

03:41.040 --> 03:46.160
and launched Fox Gottel into the air like a video game KO.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.360
Let's have a toon take us to the action.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.840
Here's an oldie, but a goodie.

03:51.840 --> 03:57.520
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

04:21.840 --> 04:34.560
High School Musical.

04:34.560 --> 04:34.800
Yeah.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.560
High School Musical 2.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.640
Is there a second one?

04:38.640 --> 04:40.480
Oh, aren't there like five or six?

04:40.480 --> 04:41.920
What would the second one be called?

04:41.920 --> 04:42.960
College Musical.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.280
College.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.000
And the third one?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.120
30-Year-Old Musical.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.160
Internship Musical.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.640
And they're now making a fourth one.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.600
I think that's the only series that happens in high school.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.400
Yeah.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.120
If I said Pleasantville was the scene.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.080
Orgasm.

04:59.280 --> 04:59.680
Yeah.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.960
I haven't seen Pleasantville since...

05:02.160 --> 05:02.960
Maybe ever.

05:02.960 --> 05:03.760
Since I was a kid.

05:03.760 --> 05:04.320
That scene?

05:05.040 --> 05:05.760
Yeah.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.840
Is that the one where things become color?

05:07.840 --> 05:08.160
Yeah.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.360
Nice.

05:10.240 --> 05:10.880
Sinful.

05:10.880 --> 05:11.680
Because of it.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.880
Because of cum-een.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.160
The scene where they drive into the park

05:16.160 --> 05:18.560
and the cherry blossoms are floating over the car

05:18.560 --> 05:20.880
and Edda James, at last, is playing is like...

05:21.520 --> 05:22.240
I didn't jerk off to that one.

05:22.240 --> 05:22.800
Cinema bliss.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.200
You were saying though, it's...

05:27.920 --> 05:29.120
It's a good scene.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.120
There's also...

05:31.120 --> 05:34.160
He's describing what the world outside of Pleasantville is like

05:34.160 --> 05:36.240
and Dave Brubeck's Take 5

05:38.400 --> 05:40.800
starts just kind of slowly coming in in the background.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.760
It's such a cool scene.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.800
Y'all watching Andor?

05:43.360 --> 05:44.320
You watch that Andor?

05:44.320 --> 05:46.480
I'm not caught up, but I've seen...

05:46.480 --> 05:48.080
I think I'm just like one behind.

05:48.160 --> 05:48.640
Cool.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.560
If you're out there and you can hear my voice

05:51.280 --> 05:52.960
and you have Disney Plus.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.760
Or a friend you can rope in to giving you their login.

05:55.760 --> 05:56.080
Yep.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.200
Just rope them.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.720
Just rope them right on up to their homestead.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.840
Just rope them.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.800
Lasso them and don't let them go until they tell you that Disney logo.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.000
Hoe time.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.760
And then watch Andor.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.240
Yeah.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.640
It's so good.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.240
It's so good.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.200
It's real good.

06:13.200 --> 06:13.760
It's good.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.400
It's good.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.200
Like watch it.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.560
If you're listening, watch it.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.160
Because I want more of it.

06:20.960 --> 06:21.600
Me too.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.560
But I've tried to have this conversation a few times in real life.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.760
Oh, well don't do that.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.280
Just say it where people can't talk back.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.200
No, no, no.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.880
Nobody ever talks back.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.840
It's just that they're like,

06:31.840 --> 06:32.960
Oh, yeah, that sounds nice for you.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.560
No one ever talks back.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.200
Exactly.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.360
I'm glad, nerd.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.200
Good for you.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.440
You have a gritty Star Wars.

06:41.440 --> 06:41.760
Wow.

06:41.760 --> 06:45.120
Now a gritty Star Wars.

06:45.120 --> 06:45.920
I'd be interested.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.240
It's set on Kashyyyk.

06:54.240 --> 06:54.880
Yes.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.160
Philadelphia Kashyyyk.

06:58.560 --> 06:59.360
Oh, my God.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.400
I don't know.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.840
Watch the shit out of that.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.960
The day it came out.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.480
Gritty is probably the kind of thing that might get old for other people,

07:06.480 --> 07:08.560
but I will enjoy until the day I die.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.280
I think it's just the right time for me to grow old and always be delighted for it.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.160
And my kids will be like,

07:14.160 --> 07:15.120
Yeah, everything's a gritty.

07:15.120 --> 07:21.120
Like there's mascots that kill each other now and say the F word.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.440
Gritty fucking sucks.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.960
And I'm like, nah, gritty is delightful.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.400
Everything's a gritty is incredible.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.760
I like when he wiggles his tummy.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.200
It's pretty good.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.320
Speaking of gritty, we all look a little grittier now, don't we, boys?

07:39.360 --> 07:40.640
Do you mean the can crew?

07:40.640 --> 07:44.240
No, I mean, well, the king crew definitely fucking works pretty gritty.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.840
Or do you mean us after two and a half years of a pandemic?

07:48.080 --> 07:49.520
What else did we do that might make us like different women?

07:49.520 --> 07:51.120
We were all gritty for Halloween.

07:51.120 --> 07:51.680
That's right.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.200
We were all gritty for Halloween.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.640
No, but we should have done that.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.440
Gritty gang.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.960
Oh, oh, yeah.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.360
Aren't we a little bit more gritty guys?

07:59.360 --> 08:00.080
You're right.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.280
We got tat week.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.800
We all got sick tats.

08:02.800 --> 08:03.680
Sick tats.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.160
Dude, we got sick tats.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.880
I was sick tat like best ever.

08:13.040 --> 08:13.840
Hey, can you believe it?

08:13.840 --> 08:16.480
Four white guys got a tattoo to commemorate their podcast.

08:19.360 --> 08:23.600
Four guys who like would have never had skulls tattooed on them.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.480
Likely.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.000
No, no.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.960
That was kind of the beauty for me is that I think I would have gotten a skull.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.560
It just happened to be our podcast logo.

08:30.560 --> 08:31.440
Oh, hell yeah.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.640
I might get more skulls of different styles.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.080
Not in like a crazy.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.800
You should just get the same skull all over.

08:39.840 --> 08:40.400
I should know.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.840
I'm just, yeah, Luke's right.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.600
I'm just going to get the PTPB skull.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.760
One for every man you've killed.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.000
Yeah.

08:46.000 --> 08:46.880
Perhaps.

08:46.880 --> 08:47.120
Three.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.600
Said that really quick.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.800
He said that really quick.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.760
You don't forget them.

08:51.760 --> 08:52.640
Well, I never do.

08:52.640 --> 08:53.280
It's good.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.440
I think if you don't, I guess.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.320
Is that better?

08:56.320 --> 08:56.960
What do you think?

08:56.960 --> 08:59.360
Is it better to remember those that you've murdered?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.400
You gotta leave the past behind.

09:04.800 --> 09:10.000
Oh, well, I would like to get into this episode by asking you guys how you feel.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.320
We're on episode 16 of season two.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.280
We're like getting into the weeds of this thing.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.280
Shit is popping off.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.120
Shit is popping off.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.880
What is going through your mind?

09:20.880 --> 09:24.480
What were we doing in episode 16 of season one?

09:24.480 --> 09:25.600
That's a good question.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.400
Just for some, like, you know, some sort of reference.

09:28.400 --> 09:34.240
Episode 16 of season one was titled like father, like surrogate son.

09:34.320 --> 09:37.920
So it was the second of three flashback episodes.

09:37.920 --> 09:38.480
Oh yeah.

09:38.480 --> 09:43.440
This is the one where John Lee Pettymore's racing past and injury is explored.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.600
The episode notes say John Lee Pettymore's past is explored.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.000
Rules are ignored.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.680
The officers check out the house of the Lord.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.280
So we go to the church and you eat their pasta salad or whatever it was?

09:57.280 --> 10:00.080
Yeah, no, I eat some of it and then I put it back.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.280
It's so weird.

10:01.280 --> 10:05.120
The time dilation that makes me think that that was so much later in the season and it's

10:05.120 --> 10:06.400
only episode 16.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.800
See, so now do you, how do you feel about being in episode 16 of season two?

10:11.760 --> 10:14.320
I think we can do this one faster.

10:14.320 --> 10:19.680
It feels like it's moving faster to me, but I don't know how it feels to you guys.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.720
Yeah, I think so.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.600
Listening back to the first season, I guess I know everything, but it's like...

10:25.600 --> 10:27.680
Let's try to go into spoilers on season one.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.280
I know we talked about eating food and that's pretty intense, but...

10:31.280 --> 10:31.920
You're right.

10:31.920 --> 10:37.600
So without any spoilers, without any spoilers, I'm just like...

10:37.600 --> 10:38.480
With no incident.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.440
I was just like, oh, we should have, we should have figured out some more of this.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.960
This time around, how do you feel?

10:44.960 --> 10:48.080
Do you feel like you're getting the information, the lore?

10:48.080 --> 10:50.720
Do you feel like you have an understanding of what's going on?

10:50.720 --> 10:52.160
We nailed that God total shit.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.400
Yeah, we're all over this.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.720
So you're saying there's no need to theorize?

10:58.720 --> 11:00.320
No, I know exactly what's happening.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.720
We can skip to the end and summarize the mystery if you want us to.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.320
It's real easy.

11:04.320 --> 11:08.720
There was a God turtle and through the decades, it became Godel.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.880
And it wants to...

11:14.880 --> 11:17.680
Turn everyone into a church.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.840
So like we said, Zach, we're all over it.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.220
Perfect.

11:28.880 --> 11:33.360
Well, then I think it's time to hop on in and we're going to start with Thomas.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.400
Dive on in.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.000
You, I believe, broke yourself.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.320
Sorry, I am doing a season one re-listen.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.920
We're also, we just played.

11:45.920 --> 11:46.800
Oh yeah, we just played.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.200
The last thing we played was our character, our season one character.

11:49.200 --> 11:49.440
Yeah.

11:49.440 --> 11:54.560
And by the time you hear this episode, you can go to patreon.com slash pretending pod

11:55.200 --> 11:56.480
and check out.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.120
Well, maybe by the time you listen to this episode,

11:59.120 --> 12:00.880
It's not this Friday, but next Friday.

12:00.880 --> 12:06.240
During this month, the month that this episode comes out, you'll be able to hear John Lee

12:06.240 --> 12:09.440
Pettymore, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.360
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.160
Doing what?

12:12.160 --> 12:13.280
We trick or treated.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.680
We smell my feet.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.360
We got us something good to eat it.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.320
Perfect.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.640
So you can go to patreon.com slash pretending.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.400
And listen to it's the butter finger bandit, Keith beans.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.200
But for now I need Mr. Jotaro.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.560
Mation motion picture.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.280
Dr. Luke Kinteman, please remove your headphones.

12:37.280 --> 12:41.120
I brought my Bluetooth headphones like Thomas did last episode.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.600
Now I don't have to wiggle my fingers in my ears.

12:45.040 --> 12:45.540
Thomas.

12:46.160 --> 12:52.000
This season, season two, we are choosing our own, so it's kind of up to us to decide

12:52.000 --> 12:56.320
whatever your mania phobia weird character hiccup is.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.360
So what was it that happened when you broke?

12:59.360 --> 13:00.400
What did you see?

13:00.400 --> 13:01.520
Well, that's the deal, Zach.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.320
I don't really know.

13:02.320 --> 13:07.760
You told me it was an Olympic pool sized fluid amount of wet energy.

13:07.760 --> 13:08.320
Yeah.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.120
Wet energy.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.520
Big wet energy or a little wet energy?

13:11.520 --> 13:13.440
I clearly yeah.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.080
Olympic.

13:14.080 --> 13:14.400
Okay.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.600
So are you afraid of people who look like they might be Olympians?

13:18.240 --> 13:18.560
Yeah.

13:18.560 --> 13:22.400
My only, the only way this affects me is that I have a distaste from Michael Phelps.

13:23.040 --> 13:27.360
You're really, you want to become a swimmer more than anything in the world.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.400
That's quite a coincidence.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.440
You would notice, of course, the cow is pretty fit for his age.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.000
And one of the ways he keeps that up, what?

13:34.000 --> 13:34.880
I saw that dance.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.440
Oh, right.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.080
Exactly.

13:36.080 --> 13:40.880
So he couldn't run anymore because of his bad left knee, but he took up swimming and

13:40.880 --> 13:47.120
every year for the past 20 years, he has done, um, whatever, whatever a healthy amount of

13:47.120 --> 13:47.520
laps.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.680
I don't know what a good amount of laps across an Olympic swimming pool is.

13:51.680 --> 13:56.320
I would say like for me, one, one and a half, if I could get to the second side, that'd

13:56.320 --> 13:58.080
be best for living.

13:58.080 --> 13:58.720
Yeah.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.320
You don't want to stop halfway through.

14:00.320 --> 14:00.800
Nope.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.080
Unless you're close to the edge.

14:02.080 --> 14:02.640
That's right.

14:02.640 --> 14:08.000
Cal Colorado does a more than healthy amount of laps for a man of his age for a man of

14:08.000 --> 14:09.200
10 or 15 years younger.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.040
Perhaps.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.800
And he may not realize it standing here right now looking at this thing.

14:14.800 --> 14:19.600
Well, it's already like past and in Fox Godel who is like splayed out on the ground over

14:19.600 --> 14:22.080
by the plant wall, seemingly wet.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.800
He doesn't like it that he doesn't like it at all.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.760
And the next time he might, who knows if he stops himself as he walks out the door, go

14:29.760 --> 14:34.160
into the pool or if he gets to the edge and reaches in and like starts to dive in.

14:34.160 --> 14:34.720
Sure.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.800
So we're going to say that it's specifically because you noticed that it was the size of

14:38.800 --> 14:42.720
the pool and I think it's, I think it's going to be large bodies, large bodies of water.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.520
And maybe, maybe some, maybe some water in general, but mostly large masses.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.320
Whatever you do, man.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.520
All right, let's bird them boys.

14:53.200 --> 14:58.400
The last thing you guys saw, the last thing I saw was God.

14:58.400 --> 15:02.640
So the end of the last episode, it's hairy as far as what we can listen to, but I think

15:02.640 --> 15:05.680
I'm frozen in shock at my moment in time.

15:05.680 --> 15:12.560
Absolutely frozen in shock as you're looking down, which means that you see first

15:12.560 --> 15:22.640
this energy, this enormous wet energy that you've seen before, almost pouring out of

15:22.640 --> 15:28.560
this church building that you see in the bottom of this unnatural chasm in this valley.

15:28.560 --> 15:35.680
It is filling it up in the bottom and then it is flying up out toward you over the cliff.

15:35.680 --> 15:42.480
Luke, Julia Summers sees the same sort of wet energy you've noticed before fling itself

15:42.480 --> 15:48.480
and the two of you see this time exactly like last time, just crashes.

15:48.480 --> 15:58.720
This time into Fox Godel, throwing her backwards, flying out towards the plant wall and he lands

15:58.720 --> 15:59.760
with a thud.

15:59.760 --> 16:06.560
The wet that has been surrounding and around and just pushes itself in and around him almost

16:06.560 --> 16:13.920
seems to dissipate into nothingness as you see a soaking wet Fox Godel laying unconscious

16:13.920 --> 16:15.280
on the ground.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.400
I need Beck Wilder and Julia Summers to roll grip.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.400
Thomas, you rolled last time.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.080
At the end of the last episode.

16:24.080 --> 16:24.640
I pass.

16:25.200 --> 16:25.600
I don't.

16:28.160 --> 16:34.480
When you pass, you're still going to lose one grip due to the enormity of this situation

16:34.480 --> 16:40.400
and because you've seen it before, this kind of impacts your opinion of the last time you

16:40.400 --> 16:41.920
saw this happen, right?

16:43.120 --> 16:47.440
You almost expected it halfway through, but then it's all of a sudden over.

16:47.440 --> 16:52.160
You slightly see the same result and Julia Summers, I need you to roll a d4 and add one.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.360
That's a three plus one, which gets me to my breaking point.

16:57.440 --> 17:02.560
Oh, second breaking point of season two.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.560
Julia Summers, where are you at grip wise?

17:04.560 --> 17:05.440
I'm at 36.

17:06.320 --> 17:07.360
What did you start with?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.120
What's your power power?

17:09.120 --> 17:09.680
60.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.160
Dang.

17:10.160 --> 17:15.600
You're almost halfway through the grip that you had the tethered to the world in which

17:15.600 --> 17:17.840
you lived is almost halfway gone.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.600
That's not great.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.880
You roll with what you get and you roll what you get.

17:22.880 --> 17:26.240
In that case, let's hit you with this breaking point right now.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.320
Joe Thomas, headphones babies.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.760
I'm going back to Katy Perry.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.360
Is that what you're guitar soloing to?

17:35.200 --> 17:38.320
Was my last one that I don't like running water?

17:38.320 --> 17:39.120
Yeah, that's right.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.640
So what are we going to do this time?

17:40.640 --> 17:44.560
We have a similar situation that brought you to this point, but you've seen a lot.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.400
You've had a lot happen to you.

17:46.400 --> 17:53.600
You're currently like face half broken, barely like the bones barely holding themselves

17:53.600 --> 17:54.240
together.

17:54.240 --> 18:00.240
Every time you like move quickly, you kind of feel the ajarness within the skeleton of

18:00.240 --> 18:00.960
your face.

18:00.960 --> 18:01.680
Owie.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.720
Owie, owie, dude.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.560
That is not good.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.840
I'm trying to think what would make sense here.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.160
Okay.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.120
So we've got heights as a situation here.

18:13.120 --> 18:19.040
We have the cane that hit your face repeatedly that brought you to this point.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.080
It's the most physical pain you've ever been in your life, I would assume.

18:22.080 --> 18:22.320
Yeah.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.480
Closest he's ever been to dying for sure.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.040
Yeah.

18:25.040 --> 18:29.040
So I think maybe doing something with your face is a fine idea.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.040
Doing something with heights is a fine idea.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.440
Doing something else with water is a fine idea.

18:33.440 --> 18:38.800
What if because of this injury, I don't recognize my face?

18:38.800 --> 18:39.300
Whoa.

18:40.400 --> 18:46.560
But it's like, not feel somehow trapped in a body that is not my own.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.520
Fascinating.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.520
Do you feel comfortable playing that?

18:49.520 --> 18:50.000
Sure.

18:50.000 --> 18:50.640
Fuck yeah.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.520
That's scary.

18:51.520 --> 18:51.840
Right.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.120
I think not until he sees his reflection.

18:55.120 --> 18:55.680
That's right.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.320
That's right.

18:56.320 --> 18:56.720
Okay.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.760
Sounds good, man.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.320
All right, cool.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.280
Let's burn him back.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.160
Okay, cool.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.600
Thomas, what were you listening to?

19:01.600 --> 19:02.720
The new Beths album.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.800
Ooh, love them.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.440
Me too.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.320
The new Beths.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.200
Frozen solid.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.880
Beck Wilder cannot even move his face.

19:12.880 --> 19:19.760
You just hear the thrust and out of the corner of your eye, you see Fox Gottel flying out

19:19.760 --> 19:20.880
of eye shot.

19:20.880 --> 19:21.360
Nailed it.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.440
What?

19:24.800 --> 19:25.120
Why?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.720
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

19:27.680 --> 19:32.880
And Stevie is trying to hold back the vomit that seems to be coming.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.400
Oh, and she cannot hold.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.880
She starts blowing.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.480
Oh no, you're going to make me throw up now.

19:51.840 --> 19:58.320
I swallowed it.

19:59.600 --> 20:05.120
Falls to her hands and knees and Fox Gottel laying on his back completely unconscious,

20:05.120 --> 20:11.600
wearing a monochromatic gray scale jumpsuit leisure wear with green accents like he's

20:11.600 --> 20:18.240
been dancing in the AR goggles have literally landed in the place where he was just standing

20:18.240 --> 20:24.960
at least, god, I don't even know, like 36.8 feet away.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.400
He's just like vanished?

20:26.400 --> 20:32.320
No, he is on the ground over by the plant wall on his back, unconscious and wet.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.480
And you see him wearing those clothes.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.400
I want to, I guess, pick up the goggles.

20:36.400 --> 20:41.200
Yeah, when you pick them up, you see that he's been kicking Julius Summers' ass

20:43.040 --> 20:44.880
in a ring collecting game.

20:44.880 --> 20:49.120
Julius, what have you been engaging in leisurely video games on working hours?

20:49.120 --> 20:57.280
Julius is like just with his goggles still on, just staring down at his feet and like

20:57.280 --> 21:01.040
finally just pulls the headset off and you can see he's been like sobbing.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.360
Well, I was going to joke about you losing, but now

21:03.360 --> 21:06.160
the headset just kind of falls to the ground and he's like,

21:06.160 --> 21:09.040
when you look at it on the ground, what do you see?

21:09.040 --> 21:14.560
Julius sees his own reflection in the visor, the visor goggles.

21:14.560 --> 21:20.000
And he just starts kind of like looking and like squeezing his face and like scratching his face.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.920
When the two of you see him scratching in his face and feeling it away,

21:23.920 --> 21:30.720
like you see some of the cartilage is like pushing out of his skin as he's playing with it.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.080
Cow Colorado vomits.

21:32.080 --> 21:32.580
Gross.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.760
Oh, Thomas, you're going to make me.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.260
Oh no.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.320
People are going to complain that they actually vomited.

21:42.320 --> 21:45.200
I was going to say that is a trigger for some people pretty hard.

21:47.360 --> 21:48.960
Am I jumping out of freeze mode?

21:48.960 --> 21:49.680
Yeah. Where do you want to?

21:50.240 --> 21:50.720
Not yet.

21:50.720 --> 21:55.360
The two of you look over and see Beck Wilder has not moved a muscle.

21:55.360 --> 21:59.840
Stevie has run over at this point and crawled over on her hands and knees.

21:59.840 --> 22:05.040
And they're just like over their brother's body, touching the face, holding the head up.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.240
Fox, Fox.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.880
Stevie, what the hell was that?

22:08.880 --> 22:10.720
I guess it worked.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.600
It worked.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.360
She's just nodding to Julius.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.720
What, what happened?

22:14.720 --> 22:21.920
Well, we've Fox, uh, became the mayor and now he holds God.

22:21.920 --> 22:27.040
We it let's try to maintain some journalistic, uh, standards here.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.760
We cannot confirm or deny that that is God.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.360
Well, the, the turtle spirit isn't right.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.720
Let's hope Beck got that.

22:34.720 --> 22:41.520
You look over and you see the camera is pointed directly at the opening in the stained glass.

22:42.080 --> 22:46.160
Of this church upside down in Godel's feet.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.840
Canyon crevasse.

22:47.840 --> 22:53.680
As, as we walk over Cal and maybe a rare moment of like opportunistic solidarity with Julius

22:53.680 --> 22:56.400
is like, it looks like you might've got a pretty good angle with that.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.560
I sure hope so.

22:58.560 --> 22:59.200
Fingers crossed.

22:59.200 --> 22:59.600
Right.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.040
And we get over there and I'm,

23:01.040 --> 23:07.200
I want to get an alertness check real quick from both Julius Summers and Cal Colorado.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.280
Pass 32 on a 40.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.360
Pass nine on whatever.

23:14.640 --> 23:15.440
11.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.600
It's not the sound of dogs.

23:18.480 --> 23:18.960
Oh, good.

23:23.360 --> 23:35.440
You know, from the door, but it is the sound of doors opening large doors, not ones that

23:35.440 --> 23:39.120
need to be dogged, but not dog doors.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.280
Undog doors are opening train doors.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.240
Large large creaking doors.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.760
Church doors.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.040
Oh, that's a church door.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.280
That is the creepiest kind of door you can open.

23:50.720 --> 23:58.080
And the sound echoes through this area plant wall on either side.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.440
It's the sound just kind of bounces back and forth.

24:01.440 --> 24:06.000
You all see figures exiting the church going up.

24:06.080 --> 24:13.120
Seemingly that fog that rose and formed the penetrable wall previously has dissipated.

24:13.120 --> 24:19.920
There must be like steps coming up from the church because these bobbing people is this

24:19.920 --> 24:26.080
massive folk that you see just very, very tiny off in the distance are making their

24:26.080 --> 24:29.360
way up the unnaturally smooth wall.

24:29.360 --> 24:32.640
Somehow maybe steps, maybe some sort of pathway.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.160
Must be steps or a pathway.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.440
Are they on our side?

24:35.440 --> 24:42.960
They're climbing up your side out of the deep alien crevasse and toward the shelf that

24:42.960 --> 24:44.400
you all stand on.

24:44.400 --> 24:49.520
Uh, back back, back.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.960
Are you seeing, are you seeing this buddy?

24:50.960 --> 24:53.920
We got a frozen.

24:53.920 --> 24:54.960
The camera won't move.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.000
Cal is alarm.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.760
He starts shaking you, but like by the shoulder back back, snap out of it.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.120
Cal, Cal.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.240
He slaps you.

25:10.480 --> 25:10.720
Sorry.

25:10.720 --> 25:11.920
Delayed reaction.

25:11.920 --> 25:12.560
My dad.

25:18.400 --> 25:18.960
Oh God.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.720
Oh, Cal dude.

25:21.280 --> 25:21.920
I saw it.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.240
It's I saw it.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.960
Who, who, who, who are they?

25:29.600 --> 25:31.120
And I'm pointing at the figures.

25:31.120 --> 25:35.520
I mean, when Beck sees figures, he points the camera at figures.

25:35.520 --> 25:42.480
And as he zooms in on this roving gang heading up, you see how many figures are we talking

25:42.480 --> 25:42.800
here?

25:42.800 --> 25:44.640
We are talking nine figures.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.040
Okay.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.000
Oh, 10 figures.

25:46.000 --> 25:52.800
One is just nope to 11, but two are just closer to the ground.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.640
Seemingly a billion.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.040
And as you zoom in, you see a gaggle.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.080
That's 10 figures.

25:58.080 --> 25:58.640
Nice.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.040
Don't worry.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.160
They're just geese.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.280
They're school children.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.880
Do they look ghosty or like, are they like ethereal?

26:04.880 --> 26:07.360
No, they're wearing school uniforms.

26:07.360 --> 26:13.120
And as you guys are looking into the viewfinder of Beck's camera to watch and see these people

26:13.120 --> 26:18.800
head up in the back of the group, you see the last school child wearing the same uniform

26:18.800 --> 26:26.560
is like on all fours, like on their knuckles and their toes.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.440
The next boy, he is just a normal kid.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.040
Let's see if that's even stranger for some reason.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.680
I don't like that one.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.360
He gives me the creeps in particular.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.480
There's like seemingly six normal looking ones.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.000
It's still quite from a distance.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.560
You can't zoom in that far, but they seem to be wearing school uniforms.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.160
However, in the back you see, it's like they've got red.

26:52.160 --> 26:52.400
Yeah.

26:52.400 --> 26:57.840
There's like a bit too much red around on all of them as they come closer to the top.

26:57.840 --> 26:58.640
Stevie, what do you think of this?

26:58.640 --> 26:59.680
Toward your shelf.

26:59.680 --> 27:00.720
Red just around them?

27:00.720 --> 27:00.880
Yeah.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.040
You're not just going to keep talking about it while they keep climbing.

27:03.040 --> 27:03.280
On their clothes.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.200
We get to do something about this.

27:05.200 --> 27:09.680
And as they all freeze, I'll continue to describe the rest of them.

27:10.960 --> 27:19.760
No one makes a step, but in the back you see this human body with a face of a pug dog.

27:19.760 --> 27:25.200
As you look down, it's got sharpened claws that are holding onto a leash.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.920
And this human body is wearing a school uniform.

27:27.920 --> 27:31.280
And on the leash, there is just a jaguar.

27:31.280 --> 27:31.920
Cool.

27:31.920 --> 27:32.400
The cat.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.000
The cat.

27:34.000 --> 27:43.280
And in the back is a kangaroo walking up on its hind legs with a very human gait to its walk.

27:43.280 --> 27:49.440
It is wearing the school uniform as it follows up the rear as they make it closer to the top.

27:49.760 --> 27:50.880
And you zoom in.

27:50.880 --> 27:56.720
You see that they have blood on their hands, on their faces, and on their uniforms.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.200
Jesus.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.800
Stevie, are these the 20s?

27:58.800 --> 28:00.880
I need you all to roll grip.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.280
Damn.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.800
Glad I had that in my notes.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.800
I do not pass.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.920
I do not pass.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.680
I do pass with a 14.

28:11.680 --> 28:16.160
In order to decide whether you lose zero grip or one grip, I want you to explain this to me.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.080
Why I don't lose sanity?

28:18.080 --> 28:18.320
Yeah.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.120
I got nothing.

28:21.120 --> 28:21.360
I don't...

28:21.920 --> 28:22.240
Okay.

28:22.240 --> 28:22.880
Lose one grip.

28:22.880 --> 28:23.600
I'll lose one, yeah.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.240
How much if you fail?

28:26.240 --> 28:30.320
The frame wobbles just a minute as it loses a little composure and gets it right back.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.320
Let's hit it with a D4 plus one for the two of you.

28:34.320 --> 28:36.000
That is four more for me.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.240
Oh, shit.

28:39.040 --> 28:46.240
Four grip down for Julius, and you are now halfway between your starting power and zero grip.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.120
Not quite.

28:47.120 --> 28:47.680
Oh, no?

28:47.680 --> 28:48.240
32.

28:48.240 --> 28:48.720
Oh, damn.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.200
My bad.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.840
That is five more for Cal Colorado.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.280
Whoa.

28:53.280 --> 28:53.780
Damn.

28:54.800 --> 28:55.360
God damn.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.600
Is that a flight, flight or freeze?

28:57.600 --> 28:58.720
That's a flying, flying ring.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.520
You guys are acting like you've never seen animal children before.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.840
It's like Kangaroo Jack.

29:06.400 --> 29:09.360
Beck, I don't know what's going on with me, but I'd ask you to shut the fuck up.

29:11.280 --> 29:18.960
Stevie also failed the grip, and they're freaking out, but not because of what you see.

29:19.200 --> 29:26.000
You just hear sobs and wailing from behind you as kind of the realization of what this

29:26.000 --> 29:27.760
all means sets in.

29:27.760 --> 29:28.640
Stevie's sobs?

29:28.640 --> 29:30.720
Stevie is sobbing from behind you.

29:30.720 --> 29:34.320
Their brother probably basically isn't really real anymore.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.760
Yeah, I don't know what to make of that.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.120
Is he still unconscious?

29:39.120 --> 29:39.760
He is, yeah.

29:40.400 --> 29:44.320
If you can look back for even half a second and take your eyes off the situation at hand,

29:44.320 --> 29:46.000
you would see that he's still on the ground.

29:46.880 --> 29:51.280
Julius, he sees the animals and stuff and is just like, nope.

29:51.280 --> 29:56.960
And he just goes over and just is like looking at Fox.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.120
He's like, I got to look at something that's not going to be that.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.400
No, it's just not fair.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.800
It's just not fair.

30:07.440 --> 30:13.920
Julius bends down and ties Fox's shoes together and then looks at Stevie in case he tries

30:13.920 --> 30:15.920
to walk off the ledge like Chuck.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.720
As she's just sobbing and nods.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.360
Thomas, let's go to you.

30:25.360 --> 30:30.240
Cal just lost five grip and so he had to roll for fight, flight, or freeze.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.040
Nice.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.440
I chose a fight as the least likely.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.640
It doesn't even make sense in this situation.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.960
I would be that horrified.

30:39.040 --> 30:44.160
Followed by flight, followed by freeze, and I rolled flight.

30:44.160 --> 30:50.240
So Cal also just turns his back on this and he's like, you're filming this, you got this.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.360
Looks like you got a good frame there.

30:54.800 --> 31:01.600
I'm going to go see how Julius and the others are doing.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.440
Just shout if you need anything.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.560
You've already been way far away from me at this point.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.800
He's slowly walking and talking.

31:12.560 --> 31:18.480
Beck, you see in the background, the single simple steel train car and the single simple

31:18.480 --> 31:23.760
steel train car sized simple steel car train station.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.080
Say that five times fast.

31:26.080 --> 31:32.800
And you see Fox got on the ground and Stevie hands and knees over him and Julius standing

31:32.800 --> 31:37.680
kind of hunched over next to Stevie and Cal backing up toward them.

31:37.680 --> 31:43.120
I want to zoom in on a face or two of these animal people walking up the stairs.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.480
What are they focused on?

31:44.480 --> 31:45.760
Are they looking at us?

31:45.760 --> 31:47.840
Are they maybe zombie-like?

31:47.840 --> 31:49.120
They are not zombie-like.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.480
And they're not walking up stairs.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.480
What do you think is happening, Thomas?

31:56.480 --> 31:58.960
Oh, I thought they were just like climbing the wall, right?

31:58.960 --> 32:02.240
I thought it was like ghost stairs that they were walking up.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.920
I thought, yeah, I don't know.

32:03.920 --> 32:07.280
I think it's ghost stairs because you said the kangaroo had a human walk.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.720
It did have a gate, yeah.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.640
As it goes straight up the wall.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.160
So what do they seem to be focused on?

32:15.040 --> 32:15.540
You.

32:16.160 --> 32:24.800
Dudes, I don't know like the protocol with like meeting a new species and like how we're

32:24.800 --> 32:29.040
supposed to like do that from like a scientific perspective, but they've got blood on their

32:29.040 --> 32:31.600
hands and I think we got to get the fuck out of here, dudes.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.100
Zoinks.

32:32.340 --> 32:37.780
Um, hearing Beck freak out, but then also describe basically what he's seeing.

32:37.780 --> 32:41.460
Julius snaps back in and he knows that we have to get this on film.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.620
I mean, that's the one thing that's being handled.

32:48.340 --> 32:51.780
Julius whips around and just goes, Beck, don't stop filming.

32:53.940 --> 32:55.380
Oh yeah, I'm filming, dude.

32:56.020 --> 32:57.860
We got to, we got to talk to him.

32:57.860 --> 32:58.660
No, no, no, no.

32:58.660 --> 32:59.940
I agree with Beck.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.660
We need to get back to our mystery machine immediately.

33:02.660 --> 33:06.340
And I think we need to take Stevie and God.

33:06.340 --> 33:07.300
Let's fucking go.

33:08.260 --> 33:08.580
Yeah.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.900
Stevie, we got to take your God brother in our van with us.

33:10.900 --> 33:11.300
Fine.

33:11.300 --> 33:12.100
Let's go.

33:12.100 --> 33:12.660
Into the train.

33:12.660 --> 33:13.460
Into the train, dudes.

33:13.460 --> 33:18.740
Uh, I, Julius helps Stevie, I guess just carry Fox into the train.

33:18.740 --> 33:26.340
Your hands as the, uh, as you grab on to the, uh, the legs of Fox Godel.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.540
And I need you to roll grip.

33:28.180 --> 33:28.740
Is it like.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.140
It's wet enough to where water runs.

33:31.140 --> 33:33.460
But I'm not like squishing into his body.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.460
You're not squishing into his body like Jell-O.

33:35.460 --> 33:41.380
No, but the water that is coming out of his clothing squishes and rolls over your hands.

33:42.180 --> 33:50.340
And as you don't pass, you drop Fox Godel as you lose one grip and you cannot pick him back up.

33:50.340 --> 33:52.180
That makes a pretty good sound.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.260
Oh, yeah.

33:54.260 --> 33:58.980
Julius catches a glimpse of himself and some of the water that's like reflecting

33:58.980 --> 34:02.420
up and just starts picking at his face again and runs to the train.

34:02.420 --> 34:03.140
Boom.

34:03.140 --> 34:04.500
First one in.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.700
Julius Summers.

34:06.580 --> 34:10.580
Cal Cal looks at what he must now do, which is pick up this wet Fox.

34:11.620 --> 34:14.900
And he is terrified.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.940
He, he kind of like, he looks at the wet pant leg.

34:17.940 --> 34:20.340
He looks back at the twenties.

34:20.340 --> 34:23.620
He looks back at the pant leg and he completely shutters.

34:23.620 --> 34:26.340
And he goes, and he picks it.

34:26.340 --> 34:30.980
He picks the leg up or tries to go ahead and roll.

34:32.660 --> 34:33.700
I pass seven.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.380
It takes a huge sigh and like, let's go out.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.220
He feels the water running out.

34:39.220 --> 34:40.180
He knows where it's from.

34:42.740 --> 34:48.260
And he just, he sighs and closes his eyes and he's like, Stevie, if you could just lead the way,

34:48.260 --> 34:52.100
I'm going to look over to the side here and just let's walk straight.

34:52.100 --> 34:52.740
Walk straight.

34:52.740 --> 34:53.060
Okay.

34:53.060 --> 34:53.860
Quickly, quickly.

34:53.860 --> 34:54.100
All right.

34:54.100 --> 34:54.500
Yes.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.220
Yes.

34:55.220 --> 34:55.620
Beck.

34:55.620 --> 34:56.420
Come on Beckworth.

34:56.420 --> 34:58.260
The news mate waits for no one.

34:58.260 --> 35:02.740
Beck is trying to keep the camera focused on the animal creature.

35:02.740 --> 35:06.500
People coming up the stairs, but he is backing it into the train.

35:06.500 --> 35:13.140
As you back up into the train, you see them crest over the shelf, over this cliff side.

35:13.220 --> 35:17.460
And they are on the same plane as the can crew.

35:17.460 --> 35:23.300
And they are staring barrel down, eyes straight into the camera.

35:24.100 --> 35:27.460
All of them as they begin running.

35:29.700 --> 35:30.900
Oh no, fast zombies.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.420
I was going to give them a friendly way of hoping,

35:34.420 --> 35:36.100
hoping maybe they would just kind of give me a nice wave back.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.620
What do you do as you're halfway,

35:37.620 --> 35:42.100
like halfway into a friendly wave as they start sprinting towards you?

35:42.100 --> 35:45.700
Yeah, his arm is up about to give like a very hardy,

35:45.700 --> 35:47.620
hello there kind of wave.

35:47.620 --> 35:49.540
And when he sees them start sprinting,

35:50.100 --> 35:54.900
he uses the wave to grab the top doorframe of the train car

35:54.900 --> 35:57.220
and throw himself backwards into the train car

35:57.220 --> 35:59.060
and hope that the door closes behind him.

35:59.060 --> 35:59.860
Good job Beck.

35:59.860 --> 36:00.660
Keep filming.

36:00.660 --> 36:04.100
Julius says as he's looking out the window, but also at his reflection.

36:06.260 --> 36:07.540
Beck is yelling,

36:07.940 --> 36:08.980
Train, train, go.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.420
Make train, make train move.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.260
Move train, train, train move.

36:14.260 --> 36:14.980
Oh, oh, oh.

36:14.980 --> 36:17.780
Cal throws the last of the lasagna out of his pocket.

36:20.580 --> 36:22.020
Oh, those animals are going to love that.

36:23.220 --> 36:24.100
Yeah, hopefully.

36:24.100 --> 36:24.600
Yes.

36:26.180 --> 36:27.140
Hopefully one's a cat.

36:27.780 --> 36:31.700
The TV screens mounted on both the front and the rear of this train car,

36:31.700 --> 36:34.580
these modern flat screens flicker to life.

36:34.580 --> 36:37.940
You see a blank white soundstage with a white stool

36:37.940 --> 36:42.340
and a man walks into frame, sits on the stool and smiles at you all, the viewers.

36:42.340 --> 36:44.260
Hello, I'm Fred Gaudel.

36:44.260 --> 36:49.140
He's a soft looking man in his later 60s with a loose plumpness and glasses

36:49.140 --> 36:53.220
that consistently look like they're about to fall off his nose.

36:53.220 --> 37:01.220
And the group of bloody school children with animal compatriots runs closer to you all.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.980
Has the door closed?

37:02.980 --> 37:03.460
Nope.

37:03.460 --> 37:06.420
Beck runs up to the screen, is trying to tap the edge like it's a touch screen.

37:06.420 --> 37:08.100
Fast forward, fast forward, fast forward, fast forward.

37:08.100 --> 37:08.420
We got it.

37:08.420 --> 37:08.660
We got it.

37:08.660 --> 37:08.980
Hi, Fred.

37:08.980 --> 37:09.460
Hey, Fred.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.020
We're going.

37:10.020 --> 37:10.980
We're finally Fred.

37:10.980 --> 37:11.940
Can we do anything here?

37:12.820 --> 37:18.420
Let's go ahead and get a roll for like electronics from Beck Wilder.

37:19.140 --> 37:20.020
Do you have some sort of...

37:20.020 --> 37:21.220
I think I got some.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.860
I got computer science.

37:23.860 --> 37:24.500
Yeah, there we go.

37:26.500 --> 37:28.180
The look you just gave me.

37:28.180 --> 37:28.740
What is it?

37:28.740 --> 37:29.860
You want to see what I rolled?

37:31.140 --> 37:32.260
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

37:32.260 --> 37:33.700
That's a critical fail.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.540
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:35.540 --> 37:36.100
99.

37:36.100 --> 37:37.780
That's a 99.

37:37.780 --> 37:40.660
Hey, Beck, what do you do to the TV, man?

37:40.660 --> 37:41.940
I guess I'd smash it.

37:44.420 --> 37:50.500
In my frantic tappings, tappings turn to fist pounding, fist pounding turns to all outrage

37:50.500 --> 37:53.060
to try and get this fucking train going.

37:53.060 --> 37:54.660
Like David Ortiz at a telephone.

37:56.740 --> 38:00.980
Can any of you come up with a reason why I should get this train going?

38:03.220 --> 38:04.580
No, but I'm hoping you can.

38:04.580 --> 38:16.100
Stevie, what do we do?

38:21.940 --> 38:25.380
We have to get out and we have to run across the tracks, I guess.

38:25.380 --> 38:28.420
Some of us might not make it and we might not be able to get Fox across.

38:28.420 --> 38:30.660
That's going to be our most important task, okay?

38:30.900 --> 38:32.660
Thank God I'm not afraid of heights.

38:32.660 --> 38:43.060
Yes, we have to make sure that Fox doesn't fall to his death because that'll unleash

38:43.060 --> 38:45.380
it again and we have to get him across.

38:45.380 --> 38:50.100
But I guess this thing isn't going to start, so we need to get the fuck over across right

38:50.100 --> 38:50.260
now.

38:50.260 --> 38:52.740
What happens if you just try to like pull the door shut?

38:52.740 --> 38:55.780
I guess try to pull the door shut and we'll see what happens here.

38:55.780 --> 38:58.500
Do you have some sort of mechanical engineering?

38:58.820 --> 39:01.780
Anyone with mechanical engineering?

39:01.780 --> 39:02.740
Strength?

39:02.740 --> 39:04.340
I mean, yeah, I was just going to use strength.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.260
I don't have anything.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.500
Okay, I could persuade the doors to close.

39:09.300 --> 39:09.860
It could work.

39:09.860 --> 39:13.060
It's a smart train kind of past 21 on a 50.

39:13.060 --> 39:22.100
Okay, you pull these doors and as you pull them, you're able to get both sides shut.

39:22.100 --> 39:27.620
Now we're going to have to roll a very important luck check here to see if that actually gets

39:27.620 --> 39:28.740
the train moving.

39:28.740 --> 39:30.820
Can I spend my luck on a luck roll?

39:30.820 --> 39:32.180
I guess if you lose it.

39:32.180 --> 39:34.580
If you need to on this luck roll.

39:36.260 --> 39:37.220
I don't.

39:37.220 --> 39:37.780
40.

39:37.780 --> 39:39.460
Oh, you don't need to spend it.

39:39.460 --> 39:43.940
Ah, that is a much better situation.

39:43.940 --> 39:48.020
Should we cut out the part where I came up with a super cool idea to run across the train

39:48.020 --> 39:48.340
tracks?

39:48.980 --> 39:51.860
Maybe because Beck was going to say they got a fucking jaguar with him.

39:51.860 --> 39:53.780
We're not going to outrun these animals.

39:53.780 --> 39:54.580
There was no way.

39:54.900 --> 40:01.460
That's another full episode of us being picked off one by one by monsters.

40:01.460 --> 40:07.300
One by one survival horror across train tracks above a massive 80 story gulch.

40:07.300 --> 40:11.220
Yeah, that sounds like a good concept for the board game maybe.

40:13.300 --> 40:19.140
As the doors shut, Julius wants to address the train as if it is Frank Godel.

40:19.140 --> 40:21.540
Wait, is that their dad or grandpa?

40:21.540 --> 40:22.820
I rolled luck and succeeded.

40:22.900 --> 40:27.300
Yeah, but you know, he's talking to the train while you're getting it to work.

40:27.300 --> 40:27.540
Right.

40:28.580 --> 40:29.460
Gotcha.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.860
Is this their grandpa or their dad talking?

40:31.860 --> 40:33.300
The TV is Fred.

40:33.300 --> 40:33.780
Fred.

40:33.780 --> 40:35.060
Which is their dad.

40:35.060 --> 40:35.700
That is correct.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.460
And Frank is the grandpa?

40:37.460 --> 40:38.340
Also correct.

40:38.340 --> 40:39.620
And was there only one TV?

40:40.180 --> 40:42.180
There's one in the front and one in the back.

40:42.180 --> 40:45.060
So yeah, the other one continues to play.

40:45.060 --> 40:46.500
He's a soft looking man.

40:46.500 --> 40:52.500
His guy says, thank you for coming and experiencing my pride and joy.

40:52.580 --> 40:53.700
Grover's gorge.

40:53.700 --> 40:56.660
I'm thrilled that you came and joined me on a tour of the future.

40:56.660 --> 41:02.260
While you leave, please think very seriously about if you'd like the outside world to mirror

41:02.260 --> 41:04.740
this gorge, this little town.

41:04.740 --> 41:09.860
Julius looks at the TV and just says, Fred, your children are on board.

41:09.860 --> 41:10.420
Please go.

41:14.660 --> 41:17.940
Do you want to roll to feel good about this?

41:20.900 --> 41:21.700
Can I say no?

41:22.500 --> 41:26.500
I got a 99.

41:27.460 --> 41:27.960
What?

41:28.660 --> 41:30.340
You said roll to feel good about this.

41:30.340 --> 41:32.660
So all that happens is that he rolls.

41:32.660 --> 41:35.300
Thankfully, either way, it doesn't do anything, you know?

41:35.300 --> 41:37.780
I got a 96, but yeah.

41:37.780 --> 41:39.460
Don't try to reason with the machine.

41:39.460 --> 41:43.540
Fred Godel points his finger into the air and a green light comes on.

41:43.540 --> 41:50.100
This one means I'm really looking forward to shaping the world and making it a much

41:50.100 --> 41:51.140
better place.

41:51.140 --> 41:56.500
And the single simple steel train car begins moving.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.580
Hey Julius, are you filming?

41:58.580 --> 42:03.700
And Kal, like as those things like start slapping like against the wall while we're slowly

42:03.700 --> 42:06.900
pulling away, Kal starts doing the TikTok dance like in their faces.

42:08.020 --> 42:11.140
I mean, of course Julius pulls his phone out and films that.

42:11.140 --> 42:18.820
As soon as you start filming, the bottom of a jaguar slams onto the side of the window.

42:18.820 --> 42:25.460
You see the bottom of its legs scraping as it suddenly disappears and it is on top of

42:25.460 --> 42:28.180
this simple single steel train car.

42:29.060 --> 42:30.660
We are in dexterity order.

42:32.020 --> 42:34.020
Luke, what does Julius Summers do?

42:34.020 --> 42:35.140
He continues to film.

42:35.140 --> 42:40.820
You hear purring coming from above you and the footsteps traipsing across.

42:40.820 --> 42:46.500
And as you get further away from the shore, you can look and see the group waiting on

42:46.580 --> 42:48.900
the other side, standing on the shore.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.260
The shore of the cliff.

42:51.620 --> 42:52.100
Nailed it.

42:54.740 --> 42:55.780
Wait, on the other side?

42:56.500 --> 42:57.780
The side we just left?

42:57.780 --> 42:59.300
Yeah, the side that you just left.

42:59.300 --> 43:00.100
I'm with you, Thomas.

43:00.100 --> 43:05.860
I thought maybe there was like another group that we were heading towards.

43:05.860 --> 43:08.660
Well, I thought there was maybe a spatial switcheroo.

43:08.660 --> 43:09.860
There's no spatial switcheroo.

43:09.860 --> 43:11.060
Everything is the same on both sides.

43:11.060 --> 43:13.140
There's just a leopard on top.

43:13.140 --> 43:16.020
Okay, there's just a jaguar on top.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.140
Or is it a leopard?

43:17.140 --> 43:19.940
Roll biology to know if you can tell the difference.

43:22.180 --> 43:23.380
Oh, that's not one of our skills.

43:24.980 --> 43:25.940
Science.

43:25.940 --> 43:26.420
Bitch.

43:26.420 --> 43:27.860
Intelligence at a negative 20.

43:31.300 --> 43:32.180
Critical success.

43:32.180 --> 43:32.500
Oh!

43:34.420 --> 43:34.660
Fail.

43:35.220 --> 43:37.620
Julius, Julius, are you getting that jaguar?

43:37.620 --> 43:39.940
I'm not going to roll because Julius would have no...

43:40.580 --> 43:45.460
He definitely wouldn't be able to distinguish between these two things.

43:45.460 --> 43:46.580
Yeah, it's really difficult.

43:46.580 --> 43:52.180
However, Cal Colorado confidently says that into your camera.

43:52.180 --> 43:56.900
I'm still filming him dance until the TikTok's over.

43:56.900 --> 44:01.220
It starts playing that same animation and the voiceover is coming over

44:01.220 --> 44:04.500
as Dexterity Order hits Beck Wilder, you're up.

44:04.500 --> 44:08.500
Beck is now like a horror movie just filming the ceiling of the train car

44:08.500 --> 44:13.620
as he follows the sound of the steps of the paws of the claws of the jaguar.

44:13.620 --> 44:16.420
It's seemingly just prowling on top.

44:16.420 --> 44:17.380
Back and forth.

44:17.380 --> 44:18.180
Back and forth.

44:18.740 --> 44:22.740
Dudes, like, when the train stops, we gotta like hold the door closed.

44:22.740 --> 44:24.580
Hold on, that gives me an idea.

44:24.580 --> 44:26.180
And Cal thinks with all his might,

44:26.180 --> 44:30.500
oh, I want to use that critical success biology rule about jaguars

44:30.500 --> 44:33.220
to interpret some feline behavior here.

44:33.220 --> 44:34.900
Now we're role-playing, baby.

44:34.900 --> 44:37.380
Let's interpret some feline behavior.

44:37.380 --> 44:39.140
Do these windows open at all?

44:39.140 --> 44:39.540
Yes.

44:39.540 --> 44:42.900
Quick, everyone, anything shiny you have, gather it all up.

44:42.900 --> 44:44.500
I mean, you guys have a ton of equipment,

44:44.500 --> 44:46.820
so there's got to be something shiny in that bag.

44:46.820 --> 44:50.100
Got the keys to the van, and Beck probably has a huge key ring of bullshit.

44:50.100 --> 44:51.140
The keys to the van.

44:51.140 --> 44:54.260
Well, I mean, like, we save the key to the van and throw the other key.

44:54.260 --> 44:58.020
We don't have a lot of that stuff because we left it in the lockers when we came here.

44:58.020 --> 44:58.580
Oh, fuck.

44:59.140 --> 45:00.980
But it's where we're going to.

45:00.980 --> 45:05.300
I'll use like a lens of a lens I'm not using on my camera,

45:05.300 --> 45:07.380
and it can probably reflect some.

45:07.380 --> 45:08.420
Yes, that's brilliant.

45:08.420 --> 45:10.100
We'll use it as a giant laser pointer.

45:10.100 --> 45:12.580
Oh, yeah, dude, I could focus the light through the sun.

45:12.580 --> 45:14.500
Through this, and I could point it.

45:14.500 --> 45:15.060
Where do you want me to open it?

45:15.060 --> 45:16.740
We don't even need to open a window to do that.

45:16.740 --> 45:19.060
Just point it near the tracks and see if it jumps off.

45:19.060 --> 45:19.540
I do that.

45:19.540 --> 45:20.260
I kind of aim it.

45:21.060 --> 45:22.740
I'm going to aim it like where we're headed.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.260
In front of it, and then, yeah.

45:24.260 --> 45:25.780
To see if it'll run it over.

45:32.100 --> 45:34.100
Beck is saying, here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

45:35.060 --> 45:41.620
Okay, and I'd like you to roll your, like, I think you're using the same skill that you use

45:41.620 --> 45:42.580
to film.

45:42.580 --> 45:43.300
Yeah, I agree.

45:44.260 --> 45:45.140
I thought you might.

45:46.260 --> 45:47.140
That's a pass.

45:47.140 --> 45:49.940
That's a six on a 80.

45:49.940 --> 45:50.500
I failed.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.220
Is it critical?

45:51.220 --> 45:53.300
It is not critical, but it is a failure.

45:53.300 --> 45:54.020
Catacle?

45:54.020 --> 45:55.220
That cat loves this.

45:55.220 --> 45:56.340
Wait, is that a 96?

45:56.340 --> 45:57.300
No, it's a 36.

45:57.300 --> 45:57.860
Oh.

45:57.860 --> 45:58.740
Cat's not very smart.

46:00.340 --> 46:01.940
And loves lasers.

46:01.940 --> 46:06.980
And loves lasers at a massive negative percent here because of the lasers.

46:06.980 --> 46:14.500
This jaguar jumps in front of the single simple steel train car that you are riding in.

46:14.500 --> 46:20.980
And as the single simple steel train car continues on the tracks away from the single

46:20.980 --> 46:24.900
simple steel train car, walking nimbly across the tracks.

46:24.900 --> 46:26.420
And as it tries to make it.

46:29.940 --> 46:31.540
This is not going to be good for the cat.

46:31.540 --> 46:32.180
I'll tell you that.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.140
What was it?

46:35.780 --> 46:36.500
An 88.

46:37.700 --> 46:44.020
As it just like crosses right in front of our path, Cal's like, I suddenly feel very

46:44.020 --> 46:44.820
bad about this.

46:46.020 --> 46:52.740
Julius looks at both of them and is like, I mean, that was probably a human at one point.

46:52.740 --> 47:00.100
As you say that, this jaguar makes a jump as it's nimbly walking across the train tracks

47:00.100 --> 47:02.420
with you all approaching it.

47:02.420 --> 47:05.540
It sees, it must make the leap now.

47:05.540 --> 47:07.460
You're coming up right behind it.

47:07.460 --> 47:13.700
It jumps for the edge knowing about how far a cliff side might be away from it.

47:13.700 --> 47:20.900
However, its claws can normally sink in much easier to maybe a normal cliff or typical

47:20.900 --> 47:21.780
mountain side.

47:21.780 --> 47:27.700
However, this is an unnaturally smooth cliff side Mufasa.

47:27.700 --> 47:28.900
I was about to say Mufasa.

47:28.900 --> 47:41.300
And the single simple steeled train car lands on the other seed.

47:44.420 --> 47:50.340
Um, I kind of wish we hadn't Mufasa'd that guy, but good, good work, Beck.

47:50.340 --> 47:51.220
Well pointed.

47:51.220 --> 47:52.180
It was us or him.

47:52.180 --> 47:53.940
Maybe he just wanted to talk.

47:53.940 --> 48:04.420
The screen, the screen quickly cuts back to for Donald sitting in his green shirt and

48:04.420 --> 48:09.220
the Godel company has continued that practice into these modern times.

48:09.220 --> 48:16.340
So thank you for opening your eyes, opening your heart and opening your mind to a future

48:16.340 --> 48:18.420
without hunger, without pain.

48:19.140 --> 48:22.340
Thank you for visiting Grover's gorge.

48:22.340 --> 48:24.900
And the doors try to open.

48:24.900 --> 48:31.700
You hear this like noise and then they kind of stopped trying to open.

48:32.340 --> 48:35.380
And you all remember that they've been like jammed shut.

48:35.380 --> 48:35.860
Currently.

48:40.580 --> 48:41.940
Are you trying to move quickly?

48:41.940 --> 48:45.220
Like what's the, what is the feel within this train car right now?

48:45.220 --> 48:47.860
So are those people walking across the bridge or running across it?

48:47.860 --> 48:49.540
Or are they just standing on the other platform?

48:49.540 --> 48:51.380
Yeah, that's a, what do we see behind us?

48:51.380 --> 48:57.940
So you have windows on either side, but there's just a TV screen on the short sides.

48:57.940 --> 49:00.100
So then I think we're probably moving quickly.

49:00.100 --> 49:00.340
Yeah.

49:00.340 --> 49:03.620
Cause you can't see, you can't see, you could lean your head out the window and you see

49:03.620 --> 49:06.660
they're not, they're not trying to walk across the train tracks.

49:06.660 --> 49:09.380
They're uh, guys, they're just kind of standing there.

49:09.380 --> 49:10.260
It's pretty creepy.

49:10.260 --> 49:11.540
Actually, Beck, get a shot of this.

49:11.540 --> 49:14.500
I stick the camera out the window to get a good angle on it.

49:14.500 --> 49:21.140
They are all just staring at you standing in a line wearing their school uniforms.

49:21.140 --> 49:22.020
Bloodied.

49:22.020 --> 49:25.700
We're sorry about your friend, the Jaguar guy.

49:25.700 --> 49:26.660
He slipped.

49:26.660 --> 49:28.580
Julius is going to try to open the doors.

49:30.180 --> 49:30.980
Yeah, real strength.

49:31.540 --> 49:32.340
I'll help him out.

49:34.020 --> 49:34.660
I need help.

49:36.180 --> 49:36.420
Okay.

49:36.420 --> 49:39.860
Everybody Beck, you keep filming, but uh, Stevie, if you could give us a hand here.

49:41.380 --> 49:42.340
Oh, pass for me.

49:42.340 --> 49:42.740
Pass.

49:42.740 --> 49:43.060
Easy.

49:45.300 --> 49:47.620
And you're open back up to this other side.

49:47.620 --> 49:48.660
You see the big sign.

49:48.660 --> 49:50.740
Welcome to Godel's gate to Grover's gorge.

49:50.740 --> 49:56.420
You see the lockers and looking across at the other side, you see this group continuing

49:56.420 --> 49:58.980
to just stand and stare.

49:58.980 --> 50:02.500
If they're not coming for us, we should probably film a little pickup here.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.460
Julius also flips them off as he's going at the locker.

50:07.860 --> 50:13.860
Beck sets up the tripod and has Cal in frame with them in the background on the other side.

50:13.860 --> 50:15.780
Can you get the Godel's gorge sign in there too?

50:15.780 --> 50:16.180
Can I?

50:16.180 --> 50:16.580
Yeah.

50:16.580 --> 50:22.340
And Stevie is dragging Fox Godel from the underarms through the shot and then out of

50:22.340 --> 50:27.620
frame coming up on your like stage left on as you're looking out at this picturesque

50:27.620 --> 50:28.820
is not the right word, huh?

50:29.540 --> 50:30.820
Indelible site.

50:30.820 --> 50:33.460
Something you'll probably have a hard time forgetting.

50:33.460 --> 50:39.620
I give the five, four, and then a sign that three, two, one.

50:39.620 --> 50:41.380
Terror in our own backyards.

50:41.380 --> 50:46.900
A news crew kidnapped, brutalized, and the story of our fantastic escape.

50:46.900 --> 50:49.460
Tonight on city action news.

50:49.460 --> 50:51.940
I'm Cal Colorado signing off.

50:52.980 --> 50:53.780
Julius.

50:53.780 --> 50:56.660
Julius screams in just joy.

50:58.180 --> 50:58.660
Yes!

51:11.380 --> 51:17.620
Let's dog those doors.

51:17.620 --> 51:18.820
Let's dog those doors.

51:18.820 --> 51:21.300
Julius, uh, texts his uncle, we're on the way.

51:24.260 --> 51:25.700
As we're like loading up the van.

51:25.700 --> 51:28.980
I'm like, Julius, could you, uh, could you show me how to use TikTok?

51:28.980 --> 51:33.060
Julius just smiles and like motions for Cal's phone.

51:35.540 --> 51:36.900
Cal hands it over with a big grin.

51:38.580 --> 51:39.620
He shows you the background.

51:39.620 --> 51:40.260
That's my daughter.

51:41.380 --> 52:03.860
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
