00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Shhh, listen, do y'all hear that?

00:04.000 --> 00:07.880
The skittering of many greasy limbs?

00:07.880 --> 00:16.180
It's almost like dozens of giant fingers gently slipping around on a bowling lane, and yet

00:16.180 --> 00:18.180
so fast.

00:18.180 --> 00:24.640
I'm sure it's nothing, but listen here, what ain't nothing is me saying howdy and hello

00:24.640 --> 00:29.380
and welcome to 694.2 PTBP.

00:29.380 --> 00:38.120
It is I, the one, the only, probably, DJ Wolf the dog, and if this many-limbed being doesn't

00:38.120 --> 00:42.620
snatch me up, I think we got a banger of a show for y'all.

00:42.620 --> 00:50.740
I howl, you howl, we all howl for howlin' with Wolf, and this particular howlin' with

00:50.740 --> 00:57.740
Wolf is from Sneaky Whisper, and they have requested their location to be broadcast as

00:57.740 --> 00:59.240
the internet.

00:59.240 --> 01:05.740
Sneaky Whisper from the internet tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod, a thing

01:05.740 --> 01:08.440
that internet folks should do.

01:08.440 --> 01:11.400
Are you on the internet, dear listener?

01:11.400 --> 01:15.960
You could also tweet about the show, whoa.

01:15.960 --> 01:22.440
Sneaky Whisper writes, Dear Wolf, I was able to break through the interdimensional firewall

01:22.440 --> 01:25.680
to get you this limited character message.

01:25.680 --> 01:31.560
I've been stuck in this dimension they call cyberspace and heard your dimension may be

01:31.560 --> 01:36.000
having a similar polymorphic virus problem as mine.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
Whatever you do, do not feed them the 0x dead beef, and for the rest of your radio listeners,

01:44.000 --> 01:50.920
the cow has red spots, the cat broke the fiddle, and the spoon did not go willingly with the

01:50.920 --> 01:51.920
dish.

01:51.920 --> 01:58.720
Be excellent to each other out there in meatspace, meatspace you say?

01:58.720 --> 02:06.440
Now I've been all over the place exploring different space time things or whatever, but

02:06.440 --> 02:09.200
I ain't never been to a meatspace.

02:09.200 --> 02:15.300
Damn, I need to book me a space B&B in this meatspace dimension.

02:15.300 --> 02:20.480
If you want to write up something for your vigilant Wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod

02:20.480 --> 02:26.520
on the Instagram or the Twitter, or tag pretending to be people on the Facebook.

02:26.520 --> 02:31.760
Or you can do us a favor and write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice

02:31.760 --> 02:35.280
and holler at me about it so I know.

02:35.280 --> 02:41.480
And by the by, fuck Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg too.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.600
Now for some links.

02:43.600 --> 02:48.920
Bonus content on Patreon, merch at the merch store.

02:48.920 --> 02:56.220
Picks of the boys on Instagram, retweets of Luke's Twitter on Twitter, harsh criticisms

02:56.220 --> 03:04.880
of early 2000s collectible memorabilia on Facebook, horny shipping on Discord, lost

03:04.880 --> 03:14.340
Redditors on the subreddit, tracks from the PTBPOST on YouTube, and places to jam and

03:14.340 --> 03:16.480
support Alter Girl.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.520
Do you know where all these links are?

03:19.520 --> 03:20.560
You do?

03:20.560 --> 03:24.680
Then fucking get in there and get clicky with it.

03:24.680 --> 03:31.000
Then pull a switch and come on down to the Wicky Wicky Wild Wild West and slap a rock

03:31.000 --> 03:34.560
Big Willy style and I don't know man.

03:34.560 --> 03:41.180
This run isn't super fresh, but fuck Will Smith and keep my wife's links in your motherfucking

03:41.180 --> 03:47.680
show notes.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.180
Bienvenidos a venus.

03:51.180 --> 03:55.600
Last time, Julius Summers told Cal and Beck everything.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.660
He gave them the full rundown including a flashback to his high school days.

04:00.660 --> 04:05.100
And then he realized Stevie and Jeremy were there too.

04:05.100 --> 04:09.060
Also Joe made an incredible DMX joke.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.860
Taking us now to the first day of the rest of the can crew's lives.

04:13.860 --> 04:18.620
Now that they know what they know and it's not what they thought.

04:18.620 --> 04:24.740
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

04:39.060 --> 05:02.940
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

05:02.940 --> 05:05.060
What kind of world are we living in?

05:05.060 --> 05:09.780
What kind of world are we living in?

05:09.780 --> 05:10.780
Us or you?

05:10.780 --> 05:11.780
You.

05:11.780 --> 05:12.780
Got em.

05:12.780 --> 05:13.780
Dude.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.940
Your reality is not the same as my reality.

05:14.940 --> 05:18.060
I reject your reality and substitute my own.

05:18.060 --> 05:22.900
I watched a skater darkly last night.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.940
So.

05:24.940 --> 05:31.380
I watched the Mario movie last night and dude it opened my eyes.

05:31.380 --> 05:35.420
Okay, what's the deal with the Mario movie being unwoke?

05:35.420 --> 05:36.420
Or like anti-woke?

05:36.420 --> 05:37.420
What?

05:37.420 --> 05:42.540
I just heard it was actually funny.

05:42.540 --> 05:48.300
Same thing right?

05:48.300 --> 05:49.300
I don't know.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.940
I just watched it yesterday and there's nothing that sticks out.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.820
Did you look it up on Focus on the Family?

05:54.820 --> 05:55.940
No I did not.

05:55.940 --> 05:56.940
What does it get?

05:56.940 --> 05:57.940
Do you know what that means?

05:57.940 --> 05:58.940
Yes.

05:58.940 --> 05:59.940
Do you remember that?

05:59.940 --> 06:00.940
Did you guys have that?

06:01.500 --> 06:07.980
I never had it but it's occasionally an internet stir every now and then.

06:07.980 --> 06:12.500
I mean it was every movie that came out my mom would look up on that website.

06:12.500 --> 06:17.900
Is it the one that listed every single, it would be an R-rated movie and the list would

06:17.900 --> 06:25.540
be a hundred things and it's like they said the F word, they said damn, they showed someone's

06:25.540 --> 06:26.540
midriff.

06:27.140 --> 06:32.180
Sometimes they would get into really, I don't know who's writing some of these, but really

06:32.180 --> 06:38.660
hot and heavy descriptions of what went down in the film and your boy would just get going

06:38.660 --> 06:40.660
off the line, you know?

06:40.660 --> 06:44.660
Oh no, little Zach can't see this, oh my.

06:44.660 --> 06:47.640
I read Super- Nothing gets me going like stuff that my son

06:47.640 --> 06:48.640
shouldn't see.

06:48.640 --> 06:52.300
Hey you said what kind of world are you living in?

06:52.300 --> 06:54.700
Is there anything else you wanted to say about that Luke?

06:54.860 --> 06:59.780
Well if you have listened to this podcast you might be familiar with the band Dragon

06:59.780 --> 07:03.500
in 3 and Zach was just giving us a little sample.

07:03.500 --> 07:11.660
They got new music, depending on when this comes out their new music is out or their

07:11.660 --> 07:20.420
new music is so close to coming out, so go on Spotify or whatever streaming app that

07:20.420 --> 07:25.500
you use, go to band camp and buy the new Dragon in 3 album.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.140
They have two singles out right now and they're very good.

07:27.140 --> 07:30.540
I just got the new shirt, it rips, it just came in the mail, it's really rad.

07:30.540 --> 07:31.540
Oh that's a bummer.

07:31.540 --> 07:32.540
It rips.

07:32.540 --> 07:33.540
It rips.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.540
It rips.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.540
Yeah, it's a shitty shirt.

07:35.540 --> 07:39.860
It's a bad shirt, but all the best shirts are bad shirts.

07:39.860 --> 07:44.980
Go listen to that and buy their stuff and then there's the other bands too.

07:44.980 --> 07:45.980
Go buy so much stuff.

07:45.980 --> 07:46.980
There's other bands.

07:46.980 --> 07:47.980
There are other bands.

07:47.980 --> 07:50.700
Yeah, support what you like or don't.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.760
Yeah, there's local music around you.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.260
Don't support musicians, support podcasters.

07:54.260 --> 07:58.220
I've heard that it's like, there's loco music around me dude.

07:58.220 --> 08:04.980
There's loco music out there and they don't put out music but like once a year and we're

08:04.980 --> 08:09.340
giving you content every other week here pretending to be people.

08:09.340 --> 08:10.740
Patreon.com slash pretending pod.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.740
We do it.

08:11.740 --> 08:12.740
Albums worth of work.

08:12.740 --> 08:13.740
Every month.

08:14.500 --> 08:20.380
Do not buy another album until you're a Patreon subscriber.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.380
In fact, don't even listen to music.

08:22.380 --> 08:24.380
Don't listen to any music.

08:24.380 --> 08:29.420
Cancel your Spotify subscription.

08:29.420 --> 08:34.340
Every time you think you should listen to music, like you're about to be intimate with

08:34.340 --> 08:35.340
your partner.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.340
Throw on season one again.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.340
Yeah.

08:37.340 --> 08:38.340
Just do another re-listen.

08:38.340 --> 08:39.340
Oh my God.

08:39.340 --> 08:42.140
Luke talks about us all being covered in honey at the very beginning.

08:42.540 --> 08:45.260
It's a very sexy podcast.

08:45.260 --> 08:50.900
We're very sexy boys.

08:50.900 --> 08:55.140
I've got a story I've been meaning to tell you guys for two and a half months.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.140
Whoa.

08:56.140 --> 08:59.380
Part of the problem is that we mostly hang out on the pod now.

08:59.380 --> 09:00.380
Unfortunately.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.380
Unfortunately.

09:01.380 --> 09:04.500
Part of the problem is that the times we have hung out, I've been saving this story for

09:04.500 --> 09:06.500
the pod.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.960
And I kept forgetting.

09:09.960 --> 09:14.040
So when we were at the batting cages, you were like, I just want to tell them about

09:14.040 --> 09:16.800
when we were the other day.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.040
See we fucking hang out.

09:18.040 --> 09:23.400
Let's bleep that out so people can't stalk us in our imaginary town.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.080
We only go to two places.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.160
What was I going to say?

09:28.160 --> 09:29.160
Oh no.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.160
We forgot the story.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.160
All right.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.160
Let's get into the app.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.160
It has been two months.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.160
Okay.

09:35.400 --> 09:40.520
My name is, my name is Thomas Cox and I am in a Cox family group chat with my family

09:40.520 --> 09:43.280
and I'm glad this wasn't a confession.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.880
No, it's an anecdote.

09:45.880 --> 09:52.600
Um, the group chat is talking about the time we killed that guy.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.980
I'm like, so yeah, all kinds of things.

09:54.980 --> 10:01.240
Whatever we have to talk about when we killed that guy, succession style on a plane.

10:01.240 --> 10:08.740
This chat gets made in WhatsApp and I realize from day one that you can make the icon anything

10:08.740 --> 10:10.260
you want.

10:10.260 --> 10:16.360
And I think about that for months until I finally pulled the trigger and made it an

10:16.360 --> 10:18.240
eggplant emoji.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.440
Yeah, it's very fitting.

10:21.440 --> 10:26.160
Two mixed, two positive reactions in the group.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.380
Some people thought it was funny.

10:27.380 --> 10:29.380
Some people didn't get it.

10:29.380 --> 10:35.760
One person who really didn't think it was funny was no, in the, in the group chat, one

10:35.760 --> 10:42.000
person who really didn't think it was funny was my dad who got angrier than I've ever

10:42.000 --> 10:45.800
seen him about anything fascinating.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.760
I would have not expected that at all.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.260
I got a text.

10:50.260 --> 10:55.420
He was like, change it back immediately in a text message to me.

10:55.420 --> 11:03.280
And I was, and he was like, people are talking and I go and I go to the group chat and that's

11:03.280 --> 11:12.920
like literally true, but not in the way that is text implied.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.160
They're sending memes.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.560
They're asking about each other's weekends.

11:16.560 --> 11:22.840
And it's at this point I'm still like, I don't realize how upset he is and I'm just like,

11:22.840 --> 11:24.880
I mean, anybody can change it.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.420
You can change it back.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.660
And he's like, I don't know how do it.

11:29.660 --> 11:31.860
Do it now.

11:31.860 --> 11:36.660
For those listening, this is uncharacteristic of his father.

11:36.660 --> 11:38.820
It's pornographic.

11:38.820 --> 11:40.940
No wow.

11:40.940 --> 11:46.500
And I started like after one of his first texts, I started to pull like the chat.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.820
I was like, should we keep it?

11:49.820 --> 11:50.820
Get rid of it.

11:50.820 --> 11:51.820
I don't get it.

11:51.820 --> 11:57.400
That got like about straight evens, like all down.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
So what is it now?

11:58.400 --> 12:11.520
Oh, I changed it to a rooster welcome to episode 28 of pretending to be people we've been waiting

12:11.520 --> 12:16.880
two and a half months unwittingly to hear that incredible story.

12:16.880 --> 12:26.300
I'm glad that it got sold though.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.300
God damn.

12:27.300 --> 12:31.660
We told you it was a sexy podcast.

12:31.660 --> 12:32.660
You knew it.

12:32.660 --> 12:33.660
You knew it when you see it.

12:33.660 --> 12:34.660
He knows it.

12:34.660 --> 12:35.660
Yeah.

12:35.660 --> 12:38.020
He knew it cause he saw it.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.900
So we left off with the ex.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.380
My step mom didn't get it.

12:41.380 --> 12:45.980
And then when it got explained to her, she said, all I can say is rude.

12:45.980 --> 12:46.980
Wow.

12:46.980 --> 12:56.800
And then having to get it explained to you though, you're like, that is very vulgar.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
It's a wiener joke.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.800
I think my mom would laugh.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.800
Oh, well Mike.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.800
Okay.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.320
My aunt, my cool aunt, she was like, yeah, when I first started at a law firm, uh, this

13:05.320 --> 13:09.420
is like in the late seventies or early eighties, she's like, they put me in the only other

13:09.420 --> 13:13.080
woman together and her last name was Peters.

13:13.580 --> 13:16.140
So their name tag said Cox and Peters.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.140
Nice.

13:17.140 --> 13:18.140
Incredible.

13:18.140 --> 13:19.140
Holy shit.

13:19.140 --> 13:22.020
They should have renamed the firm.

13:22.020 --> 13:23.700
Did they make them partners immediately?

13:23.700 --> 13:25.860
No, this was when they're a very junior.

13:25.860 --> 13:28.380
It was just outside their like office store.

13:28.380 --> 13:32.140
Can we have two characters named butts and craps?

13:32.140 --> 13:33.760
Why?

13:33.760 --> 13:38.020
Two funny words, you know?

13:38.020 --> 13:39.080
Ask an answer.

13:39.080 --> 13:46.100
We left last episode with Beck making an ex going to give it to you, Joe.

13:46.100 --> 13:54.740
Seemingly, but then we realized we hadn't recorded nearly long enough.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.380
We had to come back after we recorded the first time.

13:57.380 --> 14:00.140
It's like, it's not going to do it.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.580
No, we had had a big revelation from your side of the table.

14:03.580 --> 14:04.580
Yeah.

14:04.640 --> 14:09.880
For this episode, a new revelation for everyone.

14:09.880 --> 14:18.400
Luke is actually going to be your handler for this episode and I am going to be playing

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
Julia Summers.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.400
Stevie.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.400
Joe, do you consent to that?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.000
I don't know if I consent to that.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Please don't.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
How prepped are you?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Yeah.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Don't consent.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Please don't.

14:29.420 --> 14:33.780
Now, so you guys are in the Mercedes C class.

14:33.780 --> 14:41.220
You're on a FaceTime with Julia Summers as he wraps up this story about his childhood

14:41.220 --> 14:51.060
and then his future involvement, very vaguely, with a governmental entity of some sort that

14:51.060 --> 14:58.740
exchanges money for jobs with Julia Summers.

14:58.740 --> 14:59.740
An employer?

14:59.740 --> 15:00.740
An employer.

15:00.740 --> 15:05.240
Do you pay taxes?

15:05.240 --> 15:06.240
It's the government.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.240
They take it out already.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.720
Julius, what kind of house do you pull up to?

15:11.720 --> 15:19.640
We're out in one of the suburbs just outside the city and it is like every single house

15:19.640 --> 15:27.640
looks the same, just four colors that change every time and it's like robin egg blue, like

15:27.780 --> 15:34.780
the really light, creamy yellow pink, which it sucks if you got to get the pink one.

15:34.780 --> 15:35.780
Why?

15:35.780 --> 15:36.780
Yeah.

15:36.780 --> 15:37.780
Why?

15:37.780 --> 15:38.780
What kind of pink?

15:38.780 --> 15:39.780
It's hot pink.

15:39.780 --> 15:40.780
It's hot pink.

15:40.780 --> 15:41.780
The others are a nice pastel.

15:41.780 --> 15:42.780
That sounds rad.

15:42.780 --> 15:43.780
Yeah.

15:43.780 --> 15:49.960
And then the fourth one is all those colors stripes.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.400
That's the prized one.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.460
And you pull up in- The Harlequin house.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.620
You pull up to a striped house.

15:56.620 --> 15:57.620
Oh shit.

15:57.620 --> 15:58.620
Nice.

15:58.620 --> 16:04.100
And Julius shuts the FaceTime off and gets out of the car and he's like, sorry, it's

16:04.100 --> 16:07.000
the one they had.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.440
Two car garage, two story house, nothing special about it.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.720
Except it's striped.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.280
Except it's striped, which is yeah, special.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.640
And yeah, you walk in and it's just like white carpet.

16:19.640 --> 16:24.520
Hey Julius, can I bother you for a towel and maybe like some soapy water or something?

16:24.520 --> 16:28.260
I got double sicked on.

16:28.260 --> 16:29.260
Yeah.

16:29.260 --> 16:30.260
Sorry.

16:30.260 --> 16:33.220
Sorry for my role in that, Beck.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.220
It's understandable.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.220
I just want to rinse off.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.660
You threw up on him too?

16:37.660 --> 16:38.660
Damn dude.

16:38.660 --> 16:43.160
And there's like right next to the entrance is like a little half bathroom and he grabs

16:43.160 --> 16:45.620
a towel and some soap.

16:45.620 --> 16:48.220
I go in there and just kind of clean up a little.

16:48.220 --> 16:54.140
Cal is looking at just the bloody footprints that Julius has left on the white carpet.

16:54.140 --> 16:57.520
And when he comes back in, he's like, maybe you should clean up as well.

16:57.520 --> 17:03.440
And I think I got some, I got some of my vomit on me too when I, when I found out you were

17:03.440 --> 17:07.960
actually an ex file and that faced me as an inescapable truth.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.480
My body revolted all over Beck.

17:11.480 --> 17:16.120
If you want to clean up, I think there's another bathroom upstairs and you look around and

17:16.120 --> 17:22.040
there's like furniture, but there's nothing on the walls that's like not decorated at

17:22.040 --> 17:23.040
all.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.040
It hardly looks lived in.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.300
Do you have a change of clothes here, buddy?

17:26.300 --> 17:27.300
Yeah, plenty.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.660
Um, you try to fit.

17:28.660 --> 17:30.580
Oh no, Cal's like, no, no, no.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.940
I have several spare suits in my trunk.

17:32.940 --> 17:37.060
I just, Julius, he's like, you meant me.

17:37.060 --> 17:38.060
Okay.

17:38.060 --> 17:39.380
Um, are you, are you good?

17:39.380 --> 17:40.820
I'm going to go change.

17:40.820 --> 17:41.820
I'm good.

17:41.820 --> 17:43.140
You should definitely go clean up.

17:43.140 --> 17:49.020
Julius runs upstairs to his closet filled with monochromatic suits and he puts on a blue

17:49.020 --> 17:51.260
one and runs back downstairs.

17:51.260 --> 17:54.580
What is Cal Colorado up to?

17:54.580 --> 18:01.500
Cal is Ask Jeevesing, uh, X-Files.

18:01.500 --> 18:08.320
Cal is Ask Jeevesing, X-Files.

18:08.320 --> 18:13.520
If that was the one that won, would you say Ask Jeevesing or Asking Jeeves?

18:13.520 --> 18:14.520
Ask Jeevesing.

18:14.520 --> 18:27.840
That's what I thought too.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.840
What does he see?

18:28.840 --> 18:29.840
Ask Jeeves.

18:29.840 --> 18:37.200
Um, he gets taken to an IMDB page, but, uh, instantly accepts the prompt to like download

18:37.200 --> 18:40.560
the app and he's waiting on that to happen.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.560
Okay.

18:41.560 --> 18:45.040
So are you heading outside to grab an extra suit to change into?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.040
I know.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.320
I think he's just at the kitchen sink, like kind of brushing himself off.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.420
He just thought he might have to give one to Julius and was preparing himself for that,

18:53.420 --> 18:54.420
that reality.

18:54.420 --> 18:55.420
And back.

18:55.420 --> 18:56.420
What are you up to?

18:56.420 --> 18:59.440
Uh, he has dampened a towel and is just wiping his clothes down.

18:59.440 --> 19:04.860
So he's got wet spots all over his shorts and shirt, but it's a, it's as clean as it's

19:04.860 --> 19:06.480
going to get without being laundered.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.480
Okey dokey.

19:07.480 --> 19:15.680
Uh, I'm going to need Joe and Luke to leave the room for a moment.

19:15.680 --> 19:16.760
Don't go.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.040
Don't leave me here with him.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.040
Good luck.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.040
You're in the kitchen.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.040
Yeah.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.040
Which I assume.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.040
I, okay.

19:23.040 --> 19:27.240
So I was assuming is this like a small living room, kitchen open kind of thing?

19:27.240 --> 19:28.240
Yeah.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.240
Yeah.

19:29.240 --> 19:35.320
And you hear, uh, someone coming down the stairs and assume it's probably Julius as

19:35.320 --> 19:39.360
he was the one who went up there and Julius, that was fast.

19:39.360 --> 19:47.960
And as you look over your shoulder, you turn and see a woman in a black suit, the white

19:47.960 --> 19:55.720
shirt, and you recognize her immediately by the tattoo that is running out of her sleeve

19:55.720 --> 20:03.280
down her hand of a tail of some sort, like a scaly tail.

20:03.280 --> 20:10.480
And you flash back to a moment the other night on the bridge, the city bridge, when you ran

20:10.480 --> 20:19.080
into a very powerful woman who told you that you needed to get off the bridge and get back

20:19.080 --> 20:20.360
where I once belonged.

20:20.360 --> 20:25.320
Where you once belonged.

20:25.320 --> 20:33.400
But you remember the feeling of being smitten and it is mixed with surprise.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.680
Oh, hello.

20:36.680 --> 20:37.680
Hello there.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.040
I, I thought you were Julius.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.600
No, I am very much not.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.680
Oh, hello.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.480
Um, you may not remember me.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.800
I'm Cal Colorado.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.800
We met on the bridge.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.560
Yes, of course, Mr. Colorado.

20:52.560 --> 20:55.080
I know exactly who you are.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.520
Um, yeah.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.720
I don't think I caught your name.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.800
No, you didn't.

21:00.800 --> 21:09.880
And she turns and she walks to the bar next to you and swiftly makes a Manhattan.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.380
What time is it?

21:11.380 --> 21:14.160
It's night tool time.

21:14.160 --> 21:17.160
Cool.

21:17.160 --> 21:21.640
Famous mugshot.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.840
Are you, are you X?

21:23.880 --> 21:26.480
I am Santa Claus.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.880
I'm X.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.920
I'm I am who you say I am.

21:31.920 --> 21:36.860
Cal kind of gets over his initial like shock and confusion and, um, remembers what they're

21:36.860 --> 21:37.860
there for.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.640
And he's like, do you have the footage?

21:39.640 --> 21:40.640
Yes.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.640
That's wonderful.

21:41.640 --> 21:42.640
I'll take that.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.680
Yes, you will.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.440
After a bit of a conversation.

21:48.440 --> 21:54.520
And at that moment you hear back coming out of the bathroom and joyous popping downstairs.

21:54.520 --> 21:59.680
Oh boys, lover boy.

21:59.680 --> 22:06.480
And if he still doesn't answer, it was easier to bird him.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.480
Dude.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.480
It's so scary.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.480
He didn't find that at red racks.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.480
He made that for you.

22:10.480 --> 22:18.040
I actually just woke up and it was like, and I can just tell you, it was like, it was like,

22:18.040 --> 22:19.720
and I can just hear the words in my mind.

22:19.720 --> 22:20.840
Give me this.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.600
We're going to post a picture of the president.

22:24.600 --> 22:31.880
Luke got me for my birthday on the social media, which is at pretending pod on Instagram

22:31.880 --> 22:34.080
and Twitter and pretending to be people on Facebook.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.080
Wow.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.760
I couldn't have said that less emotion.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.760
Thank you.

22:38.760 --> 22:39.760
Tell me.

22:39.760 --> 22:45.080
Well, it's because you're actively having your soul sucked out of you while you stare

22:45.080 --> 22:47.760
at this crazy rabbit.

22:47.760 --> 22:54.960
You got me a rabbit and the longer you look at it, the broader it's smile becomes growing

22:54.960 --> 22:55.960
more power.

22:55.960 --> 22:56.960
Oh God.

22:56.960 --> 23:04.080
You didn't tell me you already have one of those.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.080
So it's a rabbit.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.840
It's standing up right on two legs.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.040
It's very humanoid.

23:09.040 --> 23:16.080
But it does not, it has three toe pot pot toes and it's got three paw fingers, but it

23:16.080 --> 23:21.920
is wearing pants and an overcoat and a scarf and it's sinister.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.400
Is it sinister looking?

23:23.400 --> 23:30.760
Let me see the scarf as an untied tie, like wide and 30 style, but it may be a scarf.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.020
They're both very creepy.

23:32.020 --> 23:34.100
Also he moves head.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.520
He moves a little bit.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.520
That's not okay.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.600
Do it back and forth.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.880
He's pretty bendy back and forth.

23:41.880 --> 23:47.480
He can do anything.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.480
Wait, hold on.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.480
Does that mean he can do?

23:49.480 --> 23:50.480
Oh, okay.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.480
Wow.

23:51.480 --> 23:57.240
He was behind the laptop, so I thought you were making him type and then I looked.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.240
He wasn't making him type.

23:59.240 --> 24:02.520
Nope, but apparently he's Zach's type.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.960
What's his name?

24:04.960 --> 24:05.960
Jack.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.360
Jack.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.540
His name is Jack.

24:09.540 --> 24:14.040
For sure his name is Jack based on literally everything about him.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.880
That's the Jackalope that Beck fell on.

24:16.880 --> 24:17.880
His horns came off.

24:17.880 --> 24:18.880
I'm having flashbacks.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.960
Just looking into his eyes.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.320
He is looking right at us.

24:22.320 --> 24:28.560
Flashing back into the home of Julius Summers and his roommate.

24:28.560 --> 24:33.920
Beck, you're popping out of the bathroom, a little refreshed.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.920
Half bath refreshed.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.320
It's a specific type of refreshment.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.880
Julius is coming down in equal parts time.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.520
And half bath?

24:43.520 --> 24:45.800
I think you meant without a toilet, right?

24:45.800 --> 24:53.960
That is without a toilet, yes, just a shower.

24:53.960 --> 24:54.960
You walk in.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.960
There's a four-

24:55.960 --> 24:57.560
Oh yeah, go wash off in the tub room.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.040
There's a four foot tub.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.960
The whole room is a shower, but there's also a bathtub and a sink in there.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.020
It's wild, man.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.900
When my grandma was like 93, she was like, yeah, I've been taking a lot of airplane showers.

25:07.900 --> 25:08.900
Do you know what that is?

25:08.900 --> 25:09.900
And I was like, no.

25:09.900 --> 25:14.860
And she goes, just wings and tail section.

25:14.860 --> 25:16.140
That's awful.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.100
It's also pretty practical.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.740
Oh no.

25:19.740 --> 25:26.600
Yeah, Julius is, you see him coming down the stairs, fresh clean suit, still covered in

25:26.600 --> 25:29.060
blood on his skin.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.320
Why?

25:30.320 --> 25:32.980
He did not wash his face off.

25:33.980 --> 25:38.740
Beck, when you pop out of the bathroom, Joyce is coming down the stairs at the exact same

25:38.740 --> 25:39.740
time.

25:39.740 --> 25:40.740
Please roll grip.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.500
It's a fail.

25:44.500 --> 25:50.700
I believe that you are just going to lose one grip here, as this has happened before

25:50.700 --> 25:53.820
and you have found a way to deal with it.

25:53.820 --> 25:56.700
You've learned, but it's still going to grab you for a moment.

25:56.700 --> 26:00.220
I come around the corner and kind of almost bump into you.

26:00.220 --> 26:01.220
Oh, Julius.

26:01.220 --> 26:02.220
Hey.

26:02.460 --> 26:06.100
And Beck is suddenly kind of looking down at his feet.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.900
Hey man, uh, why don't we go like no coats today?

26:09.900 --> 26:12.740
Like that'd be like, uh, like it's nice out.

26:12.740 --> 26:15.020
Would that be, that'd be cool?

26:15.020 --> 26:16.020
Sure.

26:16.020 --> 26:17.020
Yeah.

26:17.020 --> 26:23.020
I, uh, he takes his jacket off and he's wearing like a, just a short sleeve t-shirt under

26:23.020 --> 26:24.020
that.

26:24.020 --> 26:27.940
And he sees blood all over him and he's like, oh yeah, sorry, I'm going to go wash up.

26:27.940 --> 26:28.940
Cool, cool, cool.

26:28.940 --> 26:29.940
Right on man.

26:29.940 --> 26:30.940
Right on.

26:30.980 --> 26:35.980
Into the half bath and turns the water on.

26:35.980 --> 26:40.540
Luke, leave the room.

26:40.540 --> 26:43.540
This is hilarious.

26:43.540 --> 26:48.220
It's a cleaning episode.

26:48.220 --> 26:53.860
We couldn't just cut to the next fucking scene because the way we've always role played.

26:53.860 --> 26:58.940
Not enough role playing podcasts place proper emphasis on hygiene.

26:58.940 --> 27:00.540
We shit on this podcast.

27:00.540 --> 27:02.140
We eat on this podcast.

27:02.140 --> 27:03.860
We love on this podcast.

27:03.860 --> 27:05.860
God damn it.

27:05.860 --> 27:11.700
Um, uh, uh, Beck, uh, this is, this is X.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.020
Oh hello.

27:13.020 --> 27:20.780
And you see a woman, uh, in a black suit and white shirt and you recognize the tattoo running

27:20.780 --> 27:22.300
out of her sleeve.

27:22.300 --> 27:23.300
Oh shit.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.940
You might remember her from the bridge.

27:24.940 --> 27:25.940
Oh yeah.

27:25.940 --> 27:28.260
You were, you were at the hole.

27:28.260 --> 27:29.260
Yes.

27:29.260 --> 27:30.260
That was.

27:30.260 --> 27:31.260
You remember us?

27:31.260 --> 27:32.260
We were there too.

27:32.260 --> 27:33.260
Shh.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.260
Did you see it?

27:34.260 --> 27:35.260
Incredible.

27:35.260 --> 27:36.260
Wow.

27:36.260 --> 27:42.540
It was, it was, um, well you kind of ran us out of there before we got to see much.

27:42.540 --> 27:43.580
What did you see?

27:43.580 --> 27:46.060
Did you see the whole thing?

27:46.060 --> 27:47.060
No pun intended.

27:47.060 --> 27:48.140
It was a good one though.

27:48.140 --> 27:49.140
She smiles.

27:49.140 --> 27:50.140
Yeah.

27:50.140 --> 27:51.140
We saw.

27:51.140 --> 27:52.140
Hmm.

27:52.140 --> 27:55.140
Did you see how smooth it was?

27:55.140 --> 27:56.140
Yeah.

27:56.140 --> 27:59.180
It was, it was pretty smooth where it was weird.

27:59.180 --> 28:00.180
Yeah.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.700
It was very weird.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.140
Have you been in this line of work a long time?

28:05.140 --> 28:06.140
Yes.

28:06.140 --> 28:07.900
Yes I have.

28:07.900 --> 28:11.940
Did you become Julius's mom after you guys abducted him?

28:11.940 --> 28:12.940
No.

28:12.940 --> 28:14.880
How would you like describe your relationship with him?

28:14.880 --> 28:15.880
Are you like his boss?

28:15.880 --> 28:16.880
Yeah.

28:16.880 --> 28:17.880
Are you like his boss?

28:17.880 --> 28:22.100
That's the exact question I wanted to ask because can you talk to him about like the

28:22.100 --> 28:23.100
blood thing?

28:23.100 --> 28:24.100
Oh yes.

28:24.100 --> 28:29.020
Well it seemed like he was going to go clean off so hopefully he does.

28:29.020 --> 28:32.140
What do you make of the fact that he didn't?

28:32.140 --> 28:40.860
In our line of work people often end up in situations where they don't enjoy certain

28:40.860 --> 28:42.060
things.

28:42.060 --> 28:44.060
Normal activities.

28:44.060 --> 28:50.220
For instance, I don't know if you noticed but when your camera man here was walking

28:50.220 --> 28:57.260
up he got super fucking weird about Mr. Summers wearing a coat.

28:57.260 --> 28:58.260
Is that right?

28:58.500 --> 29:00.580
No, he got weird because he was covered in blood.

29:00.580 --> 29:01.980
And he was wearing a coat too.

29:01.980 --> 29:05.700
He's always had the coat thing as long as I've known back he's had that coat thing

29:05.700 --> 29:06.700
I think.

29:06.700 --> 29:10.660
So I'm just saying that's- Wait you don't think he's taking a bath in

29:10.660 --> 29:11.660
there do you?

29:11.660 --> 29:13.660
I hope not.

29:13.660 --> 29:16.320
Me too.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.300
So you kind of did avoid our question though.

29:18.300 --> 29:19.300
Are you his boss?

29:19.300 --> 29:20.840
Or like his partner maybe?

29:20.840 --> 29:22.460
Like what is your like hierarchy?

29:22.460 --> 29:24.820
Uh yeah boss sure.

29:24.820 --> 29:27.020
Did you put him on cam?

29:27.020 --> 29:28.020
Yeah.

29:28.780 --> 29:33.340
Well that that was why we utilized Agent Summers yeah.

29:33.340 --> 29:35.980
Did you mean to get us involved or was that like an accident?

29:35.980 --> 29:37.620
Oh total accident.

29:37.620 --> 29:44.020
I did not know that things were going to progress so quickly and she looks over her shoulder

29:44.020 --> 29:51.740
and the very very quiet quiet the very very quiet Stevie and Jeremy who are sitting on

29:51.740 --> 29:57.660
the couch over in the living room and she kind of pees at them and she's like yes I

29:57.660 --> 30:05.660
didn't know that certain people would be involved and I didn't know that more people

30:05.660 --> 30:06.660
would be involved.

30:06.660 --> 30:11.140
Yeah no I had no idea that things would things would get out of hand this fast.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.940
Did you send us the pin that told us where to go?

30:13.940 --> 30:14.940
Real quick.

30:14.940 --> 30:17.940
Roll human for me.

30:17.940 --> 30:21.300
Twenty four on a seventy.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.240
Eighty six on a forty.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.460
Joe go la la.

30:27.460 --> 30:31.380
Thomas she's smiling super fucking big when she says that things got out of hand really

30:31.380 --> 30:35.860
fast like this is exactly what she wants.

30:35.860 --> 30:36.860
You're back Joe.

30:36.860 --> 30:37.860
Hello.

30:37.860 --> 30:38.860
Hello.

30:38.860 --> 30:41.340
I uh I lean over and whisper in Bec's ear.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.340
Nice.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.340
Watch your back with this one.

30:43.340 --> 30:47.140
I don't know if she's a friend of journalism.

30:47.140 --> 30:49.340
Okay okay.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.900
So what's the plan?

30:51.900 --> 30:54.100
How do we roll it out?

30:54.100 --> 30:58.980
Well uh you said you would give us the footage.

30:58.980 --> 31:00.740
Sure but we need a game plan.

31:00.740 --> 31:05.400
Are you going to put it all out there at once or are we going to slowly kind of you know

31:05.400 --> 31:10.620
divvy it out to the people that way we can kind of move you up uh I heard that there

31:10.620 --> 31:17.380
have been some openings at City Action News we can probably get you wherever you need

31:17.380 --> 31:22.820
to be to make sure this story is out there in the open and getting the traction it deserves.

31:22.820 --> 31:27.140
I turned down a very similar offer from a dead man not hours ago.

31:27.140 --> 31:36.820
Was the offer to tell the story that you want to tell or was it to cover the ass of the

31:36.820 --> 31:37.820
Godel company?

31:37.820 --> 31:45.780
So here's how I see it a three-night event Cal Colorado trapped in the it bit.

31:45.780 --> 31:47.340
Bec is nodding vigorously.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.340
She's loving it.

31:48.340 --> 31:52.740
And then I think you know like well obviously type's position is open and uh in the dead

31:52.740 --> 31:57.200
ball days back in the 20s and such it wasn't uncommon for there to be a player manager

31:57.200 --> 32:03.400
of sorts so I could I could I could steer the direction of canoes towards towards the

32:03.400 --> 32:06.340
truth towards telling people what's really good.

32:06.340 --> 32:11.380
Not lead perhaps I think I'd still do my uh little Cal stories I kind of like these.

32:11.380 --> 32:13.100
Oh growth.

32:13.100 --> 32:18.260
We had an incident with our editor where like they kind of like went a little crazy after

32:18.260 --> 32:21.140
seeing the footage so we all kind of talked about that we would kind of drip feed the

32:21.140 --> 32:23.980
footage a little slowly.

32:23.980 --> 32:26.900
Yes we have uh nab terror.

32:26.900 --> 32:27.900
You've pardon?

32:27.900 --> 32:28.900
Yes.

32:28.900 --> 32:40.860
Like uh in a pp or in a bb bb okay as in boy boy yeah um that one's still pretty concerning

32:40.860 --> 32:41.860
though.

32:41.860 --> 32:47.140
Great yeah yeah obviously if I step into this kind of position I will be sort of you know

32:47.140 --> 32:52.340
I'm all I would need to report these sort of things to HR and I have a therapy consult

32:52.340 --> 33:05.140
with someone who understands human role six which is of course easily contested yeah no

33:05.140 --> 33:11.420
you're on board she's she's telling the truth why wouldn't they want to get someone that

33:11.420 --> 33:16.780
understands and that they can keep the secret yeah we just need them to like get it out

33:16.780 --> 33:21.660
right they blurt it out and then uh they've told someone they feel good about it and then

33:21.660 --> 33:26.520
they can go back to their lives and kind of we help set them straight so they can go back

33:26.520 --> 33:33.780
to their lives this isn't like a you're not sending them off to Siberia no no not Siberia

33:33.780 --> 33:34.780
no.

33:35.140 --> 33:41.700
Hold on though I mean after the story gets out the full story on day three everybody

33:41.700 --> 33:50.580
will know yes absolutely so what's the point that's my question yes so we agree uh no no

33:50.580 --> 33:55.460
I don't think we do what's the point of uh until we get this thing out there do you want

33:55.460 --> 34:02.100
her to just be grieving this loss of reality she should be speaking to someone and getting

34:02.100 --> 34:06.700
the treatment that she needs I guess we do need to keep a lid on her until the story

34:06.700 --> 34:10.860
fully breaks but once it fully breaks like everybody's gonna be able to talk to each

34:10.860 --> 34:16.900
other about it like it's not right so then they'll be able to go on 72 hours of pain

34:16.900 --> 34:24.660
is that not mean anything to you yeah yeah that sounds pretty fucking significant from

34:24.660 --> 34:31.140
a story perspective I would like to human that and see how significantly uh Cal takes

34:31.140 --> 34:36.820
it I mean or whatever she's talking about Vivica like being in pain for 72 hours before

34:36.820 --> 34:43.500
the story breaks oh I thought you meant inflicting 72 hours of like psychic torture on the people

34:43.500 --> 34:50.900
of the world with this new story you have you have this whole thing so wrong well Julius'

34:50.900 --> 34:55.980
story was pretty disturbing of how he came into your organization oh well that was the

34:55.980 --> 35:02.300
fucking 90s or whatever right like how old is he not that old oh right he's only like

35:02.300 --> 35:10.080
29 so that was like the oh that was the tens that was those were worse than the 90s everyone

35:10.080 --> 35:15.240
was listening to arcade fire I'll have to take your word for it have you heard the blues

35:15.240 --> 35:20.260
brothers soundtracks I feel like I should go check on Julius he's been out there for

35:20.260 --> 35:31.260
a while yeah let's all weird that he's doing check on them I just got really into it it

35:31.260 --> 35:37.620

35:37.620 --> 35:52.940

35:52.940 --> 35:58.460

35:58.460 --> 36:08.620
he said God I was like what happened back loss is fucking mine see you so soon oh I won't forget

36:08.620 --> 36:15.060
this time I promise sorry Luke I totally forgot about what you I was just in the roleplay and I

36:15.060 --> 36:21.660
feel yeah you were cleaning yourself for a good long while I wonder why it took so long roll grip

36:21.660 --> 36:31.420
roll grip motherfucker all eight I pass oh shit so he turns on the water you you look at it and

36:31.420 --> 36:41.100
as you look at it you start smelling sailing can you almost start hearing this is that a voice in

36:41.100 --> 36:48.660
your head and then it just what do you think about to just like push this away clean up clean up

36:48.700 --> 36:54.100
everybody do you share clean up and he starts washing his hands and like washing the blood

36:54.100 --> 37:01.540
off his arms and face eyes closed yeah and he Luke is currently at washing his body washing

37:01.540 --> 37:07.380
his face washing everywhere where blood got on it and then he wipes his eyes and looks at himself

37:07.580 --> 37:20.940
in the mirror and that does not pass that's a 60 on a 23 for those of you who are averse to bodily

37:20.940 --> 37:34.740
mutilation I would advise skip a little bit skip for it a little bit here as Julius looks into the

37:34.740 --> 37:42.900
mirror the scent of sailing has just kind of passed and he looks and the blood's gone but

37:42.900 --> 37:53.180
that's not your face that's not Julius no what face is it not Julius is okay so Julius sees

37:53.180 --> 38:00.380
Julius but like to him it's just off it's not really not him it's like if you saw like a really

38:00.380 --> 38:10.340
good wax figure of yourself oh fuck that no and so he's like trends like and he's like kind of

38:10.340 --> 38:15.460
wiping at his face you know that you're feeling like this but you're looking at yourself in the

38:15.460 --> 38:22.340
mirror and you are smiling back at yourself at Julius wipes harder and harder and harder and

38:22.340 --> 38:28.300
nothing's coming off and he smiles getting bigger he looks underneath the sink that he's using and

38:28.300 --> 38:38.900
he opens it up and he grabs out like a bristle brush for cleaning and he just keeps scrubbing

38:38.900 --> 38:43.860
and scrubbing all over and he's he throws it down and he's trying to like get his fingernail

38:43.860 --> 38:49.540
underneath the skin on his jaw and just trying to get under there and start peeling and at that

38:49.540 --> 39:00.540
moment you hear and Julius starts scrubbing behind the ears and then he puts the brush

39:00.540 --> 39:12.260
down and just leaves the bathroom damn dude that was intense how fucked up is he so fucked up man

39:12.260 --> 39:18.980
like literally I mean imagine that you took did that yeah dude those bristles like it's not a big

39:18.980 --> 39:26.220
thing but if you rub hard skin over and over and over for minutes like for your face skin pretty

39:26.220 --> 39:34.780
deep scratches yeah it looks like you got clawed by one of those like light up toys that they give

39:34.780 --> 39:42.180
kids at amusement parks that has like all of those long strands that come together at the end it's

39:42.180 --> 39:49.660
just like one of those came alive was very angry and fucked you up or a toilet brush or toilet

39:49.660 --> 40:10.100
brush bird bird bird bird you holler something about the ears you get behind the ears water still

40:10.300 --> 40:18.940
running shuts off and then turning the corner you see Julius Summers with scratches all over

40:18.940 --> 40:27.380
one side of his face oh shit how deep well you see in his hand like scrubby brush that uses a clean

40:27.380 --> 40:34.380
like the sink or you know similar to a toilet brush but it's not the toilet brush and there's

40:34.940 --> 40:42.420
bloody oh you really did get like really hard behind the ears man Beck wants to grab a towel

40:42.420 --> 40:47.540
and maybe are they bleeding are you bleeding actively bleeding from just a little bit maybe

40:47.540 --> 40:52.380
just like a little trickles here and there yeah beating up but there's scratches all over a tiny

40:52.380 --> 40:58.420
little scratches out like takes the scrubby from your hand if you're like if you're just holding it

40:58.420 --> 41:04.820
oh yeah sorry Cal whips around at X and he's like this isn't just the fucking jacket thing oh

41:04.820 --> 41:12.140
hey he sees X isn't you know this isn't like if I saw you know this isn't this isn't just some

41:12.140 --> 41:21.040
little deal he's hurting himself she turns around and grabs a glass off the counter and turns on the

41:21.040 --> 41:26.580
faucet to pour herself a glass of water I'm cool with that it's just a little glass it's not like

41:26.580 --> 41:34.420
the tub or anything oh good 20 he's fine it's just a little glass she turns around takes a big

41:34.420 --> 41:49.740
oh 65 not not a pass and Julius just is frozen staring off into space lose one Beck you're

41:49.740 --> 42:01.020
noticing as Cal is in this confrontation with this suited woman she takes a big gulp we all do

42:01.020 --> 42:10.260
what we do in the service of making this world a better place by shining a light of truth out into

42:10.260 --> 42:15.460
the world is that not correct mr. Colorado that's what I do I don't know what the hell this is

42:15.660 --> 42:23.660
unfortunately for everyone there are things in this world that do not act according to the

42:23.660 --> 42:30.660
nature that we were once taught they are happening more frequently and they are affecting our world

42:30.660 --> 42:38.660
at large I need you to understand this before we move forward I need you to understand this

42:38.660 --> 42:51.180
now she's a cat lady my experience those things are mostly people you seem like one of them I am

42:51.180 --> 43:07.620
on your side we are on your side human pass for cow not pass for Beck 67 on a 40 yeah I mean it's

43:07.620 --> 43:16.300
pretty straightforward here she is absolutely lying to you however for this project this

43:16.300 --> 43:27.180
situation my current objective is to out the truth on the Godel company to show the world that things

43:27.180 --> 43:38.180
unnatural to our world are happening at their behest I want that to be known do you want that

43:38.180 --> 43:43.500
to be known as well for the first time Cal is questioning that when he hears the way she's

43:43.500 --> 43:58.180
talking about it okay so give us our footage and we'll take our friend and we'll get out of here

43:58.180 --> 44:05.940
and run the story I also want that to happen and good that's great so let's just do that it's going

44:05.940 --> 44:16.540
to take a day or two to get things in order as far as she looks at Julius she looks back at the

44:16.540 --> 44:23.700
two of you you know the murder oh are you gonna nab him no no no no no oh right you killed type

44:23.700 --> 44:36.980
and two other people not people just cops that's right oh all cops are gaskards after we're done

44:36.980 --> 44:46.060
here can we talk about the promotion absolutely two of them two of them the footage is right there

44:46.060 --> 44:51.900
she points to the couch and you do see like on the other side of the couch there's a duffel bag

44:51.900 --> 44:58.460
that goes over to get it and grabs it yep the footage is inside it seems to all be there is

44:58.460 --> 45:04.180
it the stuff I mean it looks like it is it my hard drive is it the one that was stolen from my

45:04.180 --> 45:11.380
pocket or did is it copied no no it is yours yeah it's my it's my hard drive at least I have to plug

45:11.380 --> 45:20.540
it in see if it's there my drives hard hot damn back when you look down at your hand with the

45:20.580 --> 45:27.980
phone drive in it there's blood on your hand from where you grab the bag when you unzipped it oh

45:27.980 --> 45:36.140
gross this is he's holding up the hand this is this is one of the cops I assume real grip

45:36.140 --> 45:49.660
that's a hot one I looked I'm like is that 60 I can't tell if this is a one but it is a one

45:49.980 --> 45:58.380
dude I gained one grip how have your objectives changed in the world getting the footage back

45:58.380 --> 46:04.300
probably it feels probably really good to back like this was that's I mean that's his footage

46:04.300 --> 46:10.980
that's always been a thing now that we've got some it seems like backup in this whole thing with X I

46:10.980 --> 46:18.140
think that he feels like we're untouchable we're doing we're back on the right track when Beck is

46:18.140 --> 46:27.860
holding up his bloody hand this is like at any cost right Beck Beck cautiously nods yeah I mean

46:27.860 --> 46:34.300
yeah you gotta break a few eggs to make omelet right cow just kind of looks down at the ground

46:34.300 --> 46:43.180
yeah back and I think we can agree we got some bad eggs in the city yeah yeah bad eggs she reaches

46:43.180 --> 46:55.500
her hand out to Cal Colorado agent Diggory Cal Colorado go make some news mr. Colorado in 48

46:55.500 --> 47:02.660
hours okay yeah the producer job will be yours just walk on in as if it is that you mean mine

47:02.660 --> 47:11.820
and he's the anchor Oh Julius type said I could have it oh yeah I'm really sorry Julius but your

47:11.820 --> 47:18.300
boss here just promised it to me you could be you could be anchor I was just gonna do kind of

47:18.300 --> 47:23.620
a you want me to be the anchor whatever no no probably I don't actually since I'll be producer

47:23.620 --> 47:29.780
I've never heard you talk about wanting to be a producer before well I could direct the network

47:29.780 --> 47:35.620
to a more just and and and truthful vision of the world I could I could put what's really important

47:35.620 --> 47:47.020
on there okay Julius remembers that he's only cared about this literally for like a week

47:47.020 --> 48:08.620
then it settled we avoided potentially months of in real time Julius thinks about like about

48:08.620 --> 48:15.220
arguing and then things about killing goffs and how it was pretty sick to do that and he's like

48:15.580 --> 48:23.300
priorities but could we could we talk a minute just just you and me yeah what you got by the way

48:23.300 --> 48:28.900
congrats on the promotion well you know nothing's final yet I guess we'll know in 48 hours but it

48:28.900 --> 48:33.140
feels good right yeah I mean well it actually kind of feels real bad it's kind of a bummer

48:33.140 --> 48:40.500
that that's kind of what I want to talk well we just had a little scare yeah we thought we lost

48:40.500 --> 48:50.940
that whole episode which was we were the ones experiencing the horror podcast I lost so much

48:50.940 --> 49:00.540
grip my face turned white then we went into our handy friend the internet and the first thing we

49:00.540 --> 49:07.140
heard from a man on YouTube was this is why when and then he said the exact thing that happened to

49:07.140 --> 49:22.100
us happens I don't freak out and it made us all feel and then Thomas embraced yeah with fervor

49:22.100 --> 49:28.380
which was good because my girlfriend has been telling me I need to hug my friends because I

49:28.380 --> 49:36.220
want like you want too much yeah well you can squeeze me baby I need you need squeezes I'm

49:36.220 --> 49:45.300
gonna squeeze you all tonight I need Thomas so you were just pulling a sorry Cal Colorado

49:45.300 --> 49:52.100
was just pulling back wilder aside so we had Luke leave the room yeah congrats on the promotion

49:52.100 --> 50:00.740
dude it doesn't actually I was gonna start at a different spot okay that's kind of what I wanted

50:00.740 --> 50:06.420
to talk to you about so it doesn't really feel great like does it it's kind of it's bittersweet

50:06.420 --> 50:14.980
like you don't really film producers very often I don't know if we're gonna be like oh Beck you'll

50:14.980 --> 50:21.340
don't worry about that listen we have a lot of time to talk about where you'll be in this

50:21.340 --> 50:26.220
organization but doesn't it kind of seem weird what's going on here like does it seem like

50:26.980 --> 50:32.020
doesn't seem like me like it's kind of scary when she talks about how much she wants this stuff to

50:32.020 --> 50:35.740
happen and it doesn't really feel like it feels like maybe this is some sort of splinter group

50:35.740 --> 50:41.700
from the other group that abducted him is maybe the vibe I'm getting like I think she's rogue oh

50:41.700 --> 50:48.460
dude I did not even think about that I she is cold that's for sure but at the end of the day

50:48.460 --> 50:52.820
she wants to show the footage right and that's what we want what if it's what if it's too powerful

50:53.140 --> 50:59.660
I mean yeah for sure we I think we kind of did this conversation back with Vivica we just we

50:59.660 --> 51:04.300
were gonna try and do it slower this time you thinking we shouldn't do it at all dude we've

51:04.300 --> 51:12.420
got the footage now we can protect it we've got 48 hours to decide and and see what Julius and his

51:12.420 --> 51:19.500
people want from it if we can yeah we're investigative journalists let's investigate we play

51:19.500 --> 51:24.340
it close to the chest I'm good with that it's best but no it's like you hold your cards up

51:24.340 --> 51:29.220
really close to your chest so nobody can see Oh Beck people tell me I should correct less

51:29.220 --> 51:44.620
anyway yeah I think we're on the same page take it slow we'll take it slow that was fucking

51:44.620 --> 51:56.900
masterful yeah that was I'm really glad you dropped that holy shit okay let's play it cool

51:56.900 --> 52:05.220
and they I like Cal turns around and awkwardly winks at Julius whose face is just like dripping

52:05.220 --> 52:18.700
with blood next let's get him back on Ian hello hello is it me you're looking for no I've peed

52:18.700 --> 52:31.780
now several times I do not have to pee anymore tonight Julius Julius has been just looking off

52:31.780 --> 52:39.780
kind of not paying attention for a minute suddenly Cal Colorado turns back and looks at you and you

52:39.780 --> 52:48.900
kind of notice and then he gives you a wink yeah and Julius winks back Cal turns back he's like oh

52:48.900 --> 52:54.320
I think I think he thinks I'm flirting with him yeah it was kind of weird to return the

52:54.960 --> 53:07.240
yeah I kind of that's the vibe I got Julius hi no Julius says that to Cal oh yeah okay um I have

53:07.240 --> 53:20.800
a powerful natural charisma they can be mistaken anyway I'm just saying don't worry Julius it

53:20.800 --> 53:27.960
happens all the time I've seen it dozens of times what are we gonna do to until we can put it on the

53:27.960 --> 53:32.840
news there's the question well that's that's the good thing Julius now that we've secured the

53:32.840 --> 53:38.240
footage you can come with us to the hospital and nobody has to split up we'll stay right there with

53:38.240 --> 53:45.760
you in the room yeah I guess I mean I don't really don't really want to go back but two days in a

53:45.760 --> 53:51.160
hospital it's one night for your own good dude yeah you're kind of beat up right now it was

53:51.160 --> 53:57.880
pretty amazing what Stevie managed to do with a target first-aid kit and some old fast-food

53:57.880 --> 54:04.840
napkins but I think a doctor should look at that gunshot wound yeah and he like kind of touched it

54:04.840 --> 54:13.960
and it hurts yeah we can talk about how we want to edit it yeah we can talk about that I'm sleepy

54:13.960 --> 54:25.280
Zach just made a lot of rolls do you guys hear that it sounds like God's trying to make a

54:25.280 --> 54:35.720
decision now he's just rolling the psychos out I need everyone to roll alertness pass I pass

54:36.120 --> 54:43.480
without cow fails what do you pass with 15 52 Luke not a big deal you just see Stevie

54:43.480 --> 54:52.320
got a little walking out of the house nope and Julius pulls out a gun and aims it Adam

54:52.320 --> 54:58.640
and they hold their hands just like straight up in the air and they're like what do you think I'm

54:58.640 --> 55:04.680

55:18.240 --> 55:25.840
Thomas and I are both holding our hands and it's facing Stevie and he's like he looks really hard

55:25.840 --> 55:33.320
into her eyes it's like remember what we talked about Stevie it's up to you you don't have to

55:33.320 --> 55:41.680
