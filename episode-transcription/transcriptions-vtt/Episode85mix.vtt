WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
This is weird. Can y'all hear me? Because all I'm doin' right now is thinkin' real hard towards y'all soft gooey brains.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Ha ha ha ha. My powers are weird and ever-changin'.

00:17.000 --> 00:26.000
I am telepathin' live from 694.2 PTBP straight into your mind cavity.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
It's your Espa that's the besta. Wolf the dog. I wanna give a resoundin'

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
awwwwwwwwwww

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
to all of you who donated to the bail project. Y'all raised $6,654.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
And I got one final winner to announce.

00:48.000 --> 00:58.000
The fifth person to receive an official PTBP t-shirt is Roxy from Hamburg, Germany.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Congratulations, Roxy. Damn, I wish I coulda won one of them shirts.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
I kept mailin' that Zach idiot all kinds of dumpster treasure that was worth at least $5.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
Anywho, yesterday I was dippin' into a bucket of applesauce and it was somethin' special.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
You probably wanna know how ol' Wolfie makes his special sauce.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Applesauce is when I let all the apples I steal from dumpsters around town

01:29.000 --> 01:37.000
sit in a bucket until they change from a solid to a sort of delicious slurry of a sauce.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
You can dip all kinds of shit in it. Other less liquid apples, baby carrots,

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
tortilla chips, or like your whole body before goin' out on the town to find a new honey to love on.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
But I digress so that I may digest the news.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Last time, our three mentally exhausted anti-heroes?

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
Not quite heroes, though. Not yet fully villains, though either, I suppose.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Our broken protagonists raced through the tunnels under the town of contention.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
When they popped out at Bean's Pond, they saw a different reality than the real one.

02:22.000 --> 02:31.000
Asher and Avery Little gave it the best shot, but they were unable to grasp retribution for the missing children.

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
And with that, these boys erased the final two pieces in the Little family puzzle from this plane of existence.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
The veil was lifted. Bishop, Pettymore, and Vigna saw the truth of their situation.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Casey Kristoff is holding Carrie Page's body at gunpoint.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
Pastor Adam Kane is on the four-wheeler gunnin' it down into the former pond toward Keith with the helmet on.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
And a hell-bent black cat on the back atop the radio with its green light lit.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
And I have been given the green light to drop this brand new track on y'all's here in contention.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Get ready to add this smash of a banger to your apocalypse playlist.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
It's kudzu with no backbone.

03:29.000 --> 03:45.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to Pretending to be People.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
My name is Zach, and I am your handler, or your gum, as some might say.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Who says gum? Nobody.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Guys, why don't you do the intro we do?

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
I've always called you my handsome-ler, so I don't know what your gum thing is about.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
That's very sweet, but why aren't you guys doing the intro?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
This is the 85th episode. We've done the same intro every time.

04:07.000 --> 04:17.000
No, no, no. The intro of this show is that Chris the cat introduces a cool new song every once in a while when he feels like it.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Not every time.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Is it Chris? Is it Chris the cat?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Frank the parrot.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
That doesn't sound right.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I think it's Pete the parrot.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Craig the cow.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Craig the cow, that's right. That's it.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I can't believe we all forgot that.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Hey, guys, why didn't you think anything about Casey Kristoff?

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
We just improved a lot of work for Justin.

04:43.000 --> 04:52.000
I tried to think about Casey Kristoff, but we kept talking to other people in the room, and then we had to leave.

04:52.000 --> 05:02.000
I heard Craig's snarky little comment about how we just ignored him, but personally, I never noticed him in the first place.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
I internalized that he was not paying attention to the book he was reading, so I knew he was overhearing us as we spoke.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
I just thought that it was going to turn out that he had a bunch more information to give us, and then we never got to talk to him about it.

05:18.000 --> 05:27.000
I'm so mad at the people playing real playing games when I'm listening to their podcasts all in a row.

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm sorry, the dog. Cut this whole part out. The dog. Anyway, Craig the cow.

05:35.000 --> 05:43.000
Do you know what the best song of 2018 was? It's Again and Again by the Dave Matthews Band.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
What's your source on that?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Ultimateclassicrock.com.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Shouldn't they not keep us updated on current music?

05:52.000 --> 06:02.000
Guys, I was at the grocery store today, and I saw this dude in his mid-40s rocking a Dave Matthews Band O2 tour shirt.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
I've just never been more proud of somebody for being themselves.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
I got a minor in possession charge outside of a Dave Matthews Band show when I was 18 years old.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Who hasn't?

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
All of us except for Zach. This is the dog corner I was talking about. I'm sorry.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
Our audio is still far better than many other quarantine podcasts, so it should be fine.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Throw your dick down, babe. Go!

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
I put in work to make sure that that's true, motherfucker.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Hell yeah.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Luke, any issue with Casey Kristoff before you dive into another song from another list on the internet?

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
What do you mean, any issue? Fuck that guy. I have all issues with him. What do you mean, though?

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
Nobody did anything about what was clearly a character who was eavesdropping.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I think if you go back two episodes, maybe, I said something like,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
I want to talk to Kristoff, but if we're still talking to this girl, let's finish that up.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I think those exact words came out of my mouth.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
I don't think we were going to just completely dismiss him, but, you know, things happen.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
People explode a little bit and beat up an old lady. It happens.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
Something fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket. A piece of paper fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Did I pick it up? And it had some writing on it. You just looked at it. You didn't pick it up.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Did I read it? You did. What did it say again?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
It says, Iyinaha fersat sayiya.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
Oh yeah, because I wanted to make the joke of the time that I wanted to punch you saying that,

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
and then I remembered that it was just your DM voice saying it. It wasn't a character saying it out loud.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
I punch. I punch. I immediately punch. Throat punch.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And thankfully we're not in the same room, so. You would have had a smack coming.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Punch me through the phone. How about best lists of all time?

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Top dryers, go. Okay. I like a Kenmore, I like a Whirlpool.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Air. Most used dryer of all time.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
Best dryers of all time. Let's see.

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
Well, if we go under the assumption that they get better every year, then the best dryer of all time.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
There's literally no way that appliances get better every year.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah, I was about to say that's kind of the antithesis of appliances these days.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
But let's just go under the assumption that that is true.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
And the answer is the GE GTD84ECPNDG.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
What does that stand for? General Electric.

08:46.000 --> 08:56.000
Go to do 84 entire clothings pending not dry goods.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
They put that at number two?

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm personally fond of the LGDLE7300WE.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
I mean, if you like new ones, it's fine. It's all electric.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I like my gas powered dryer.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Dude, speaking of lists, that made me think...

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
No, no, no. Let's hang out on this dryer humid for a while.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
The dog break is longer than I thought it was going to be.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Should we stop recording this particular segment?

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Well, I mean, I don't even think I'll have to edit anything we've done so far.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It's so fucking funny.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah, sure.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Hi.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Hey.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay, I'm going to go pee real quick.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
So Murphy has a diarrhea or something. I'm really sorry.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Bummer.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh, I straight up thought that was a joke.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I do too.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
The diarrhea?

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
No, the Luke leaving to go pee like right when you came back.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Oh boy.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
We're doing it, man. 730.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
On the dot.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm going to go pee.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
You burned it.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I'm about to take a quiz. Which Queer Eye cast member are you?

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
While driving late one night, you hit a deer with your car.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
By the way, it is lying broken and bloody on the pavement.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
You can tell it is not going to live for long.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
The dying deer looks you in the eyes and yells,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I'm you. How would you kill the deer?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I would get back in my car and run it over to finish the job.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I would snap the deer's neck.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I would tape the deer to the hood of my car,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
drag it into my house and put its head in my microwave.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
I would make a sign that says I deserve this because I shoplifted

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and I would hang it around the deer's neck.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Then I would drive away and leave the deer to die in agony.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Do the microwave one so you get Anthony.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Okay.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Did I tell you guys I got addicted for a day or two

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
watching YouTube videos of flight towers talking inexperienced pilots

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
how to land a plane in emergencies?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
That sounds awesome.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
That sounds so good.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It was wildly fascinating.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Oh no.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Oh, I actually am still recording.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Good.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Everybody who role plays knows that sometimes you get everybody together

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
and then you don't role play.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Okay, should we just keep recording on this and start?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Okay.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I'm keeping all the below deck shit.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Good. Arguably the thing I know the most about right now.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Mine is Crusader Kings, Below Deck, and The Sopranos.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm rewatching Lost.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I never started it.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
I mean, Lost famously sucks at the end.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah, but I'm not there yet.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
It's not Michael Bay, is it?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Is it J.J. Abrams that did that?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
No, it's Michael Bay.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
What did Michael Bay do? Is he Transformers?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
No, he did Super 8.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
So last time, Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and John Lee Pettymore,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
you guys won your power contest

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
and you felt like the external forces grip on your perception was loosening.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
And the scene as you knew it in a single blink changed completely.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
Immediately, Bean's Pond was surrounded by this floating moat

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
that you saw the first time when you arrived in contention

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
and it was completely encircling the church.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
The church? Yes, the campus there.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
However, now it is surrounding you.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
And John and Clark, you guys are right next to it.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It's like right behind you.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
And Keith, I believe you have been shot in the ribs and shot in the hip.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Correct.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
And you are trying to make your way down the basin,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
this muddy, muddy basin where there used to be a pond.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Still no water in it.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
That wasn't a gag on your mind space.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Am I not in it already?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I think I made it down already.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Oh, you made your way down.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
You've yet to roll a dexterity check to not fall on your way down there.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Okay.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I think we'll start off with that.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
Okay, I was going down to check and see if it actually said about me, about Bean.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
That's right.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
So hold on to that roll for me as you roll it

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
and I will continue to explain that you saw...

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Fuck!

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
What was it?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
77.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh, no!

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I should have lied, but...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Oh, I'm super glad you didn't.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Don't ever lie.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
There's no point.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
The game lives and dies on us being truthful.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
77 on a 60.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Holy shit.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Okay, beautiful.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
So Keith is sliding face first down the side of the mud basin.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
You guys look up and you see Casey Kristoff, Van Halen t-shirt,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
cut off jeans, mullet, pencil-thin mustache.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
He's holding a pistol to the back of Kerry Page's head.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
The body thereof.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
The body thereof.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
And then right next to them, we've got Pastor Adam Kane,

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
Daddy Kane, wearing the strange-looking motorcycle helmet with all the tubes.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
The red light is lit and he's driving a four-wheeler.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Yeah.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
That's the part that hurt the most.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
That's the fucking part that hurt the most.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
When you last episode were like, THE four-wheeler.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
THE four-wheeler.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Damn it.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
And strapped to the back of this four-wheeler, you see the radio.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
Its green light is lit and holding on for dear life on top of this radio

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
is an extremely determined black cat that you recognize.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yes.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
It's the agent.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Agent Trent Chad is in that cat's body.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
That's the guy who showed up to the Contention PD with Red Bulls piled in his car

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
and sunglasses on the back of his head.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
And I think he was just coming down to investigate how we had fucked up so bad.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
So what was the timeline of the cat?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
The cat was a cat.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Then the cat and Doug Jacobs switched.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
And then Doug Jacobs and the cat's body got switched with Agent Trent Chad.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah, I believe that was your guys' doing in the police station inventory room.

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
Well, Agent Trent Chad shouldn't have showed up with such mysterious motives and purposes.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Yeah.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
He deserved it.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
If he had told us what the fuck they were doing there.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
Well, also Clark had just come back from a little visit out of town with some darts.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
I was able to make him do what I wanted and that was my goal.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Oh, no.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
I know that.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
I just mean we might have done it to somebody else if he hadn't gotten all in our business

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
for no goddamn good reason.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
No reason whatsoever.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
You mentioned something about ice crystals forming on the water wall.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Can you elaborate on that?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
It's really fucking cold outside.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
But they're not like impenetrable or anything like that.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
It's just frosty out.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
No, no.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
That is just some flavor.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Gotcha.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Just a reminder that it's December 6th.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Is the wall moving or is it just stationary water?

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
The wall is not like encroaching or growing away from you.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
However, the water is flowing.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
That's kind of what I meant.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
So is it like spinning around the circle?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Yes, it is.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Gotcha.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
And there are fish in it?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
There are shitloads of fish in it.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
And it smells vile.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
You remember the smell when John stuck his head in the back of the truck?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I remember that this thing smells.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I just want to...

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm looking, Zach, what does this smell like?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh, okay.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:54.000
So when I was in seventh grade...

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
My brother shed on my face and gave me pink eye.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
How did you...

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
No.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Tell this story every podcast.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
And then I edit it out because you guys don't laugh hard enough.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
I should just edit the laughter in.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Ooh.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
That's a good idea.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
I'll use that.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
That was genuine.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
We're going to get a good take.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Good cats.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
So my brother got fish food.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Do you know like the wet fish food?

17:31.000 --> 17:40.000
And he put it in the air ventilating system of our youth minister's truck.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
That wasn't very Christ-like of him.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Jesus made a bunch of fish, so it's kind of...

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Must have been a shitty youth minister.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
What does the wall smell like?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Oh, yeah.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
So when I was in seventh grade, it was a hot summer day, but bright and early in the morning

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
before the sun was out, my brother took that wet fish food and he put it in the air ventilation

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
system of our youth minister's truck.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
And then the truck just sat outside and baked in the heat all day.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
And I was running an errand with him later in the day and we got in there and he turned

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
the air conditioning all the way up and we both just like...

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
So it smells like if someone had put a rotting fish in your wheel well and you couldn't find

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
it for like four months.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
So stinky.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Just a little smelly.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Now what?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
I mean, that's the golden question.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
We're in a pickle.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Is it like, are we still doing turns or...

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Oh, yeah.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Are we in turn order still?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah, we are.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
So we're going to start with Casey Kristoff pulling the trigger.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
No, so...

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Because fuck you guys.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
We'll start with Clark as per usual and Keith's first turn will be his 77 roll.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
So Clark Bishop, it's on you.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Oh, fuck.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
You took that talent and immediately I was like, oh, you want to act first every time?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
You want to lead off every single...

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
You want to set the tone for every interaction?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
How fast is Adam Kane going and which direction is he going?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Is he aiming for like a person or is he aiming for the door?

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
He was literally aiming his gun at Keith, but was he driving in a particular direction?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
So he actually doesn't have a gun out.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
He's got both hands on the wheel.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
He's aiming the four wheeler at Keith.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Oh, gotcha.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
Who is actually right across the door from him.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Or as we said last time, the impossible metal plate.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
And is he on top of the ponder inside of it?

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
He is about to drop in like a skateboarder might.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah, very cool. Begrudgingly.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Are there any famous four wheeler people?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Travis Pastrana probably.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Anything with wheels, that guy can do cool stuff on.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
It's pronounced pastrami.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Pastrami.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Yeah.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Oh, I didn't know that this entire time.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Yeah, his dad was a deli.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
So fucking stupid.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Never mind, I'll find...

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Is that meatloaf?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
It's a deli.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Oh my God.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Is that meatloaf?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Oh no.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Fuck.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Clark is going to...

20:44.000 --> 20:52.000
Clark, I want to point my gun at Adam Kane and yell stop the vehicle while I'm aiming

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
at him.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
And I want to use my turn to use the aim action.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Oh yeah, absolutely.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
That gives me a bonus to my next round's shot.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Correct?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
It does indeed.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Plus 20 on your next shot.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Which will put your firearms at what?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Like 100.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Oh, it is 100, yeah.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Can't miss, baby.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Triple zeroes is a fail though.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah, 100 will still be a crit fail.

21:17.000 --> 21:24.000
I want to use that mechanic to impress upon in the world that Adam Kane knows that I'm

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
aiming for him.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Oh, hell yeah.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Okay, sick.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
And he knows I'm not going to miss.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
So as you're just following him, you see down the...

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Do pistols have an aimer?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Iron sights?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Do pistols have an aimer?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Hey, you got your episode title.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah, buddy.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
That's you.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
You did it, bud.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
You're the pistols aimer.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
It's you.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
It's been inside you the whole time.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Yeah.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Isn't that wonderful?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Hey there, buddy.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
Why don't you just, you know, just point the gun and then you'll pull the trigger.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
So it's one drawn gun.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
No, that actually plays here.

22:10.000 --> 22:17.000
You are looking down and right back over the top of your sights, you see the bridge

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
of Adam Kane's nose and both of his eyes are staring straight back at you and they are

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
massive.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
He looks scared.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
He looks scared or he has massive eyes like that fucking John Peters video.

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
He does have very, very pitch black eyes and a weird balloon shaped head.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Did he always have those things?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
He did.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Yeah.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
Those are the two descriptors of Pastor Adam Kane currently known as Daddy.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Oh yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
I would also like to, uh, I'd like to aim at Adam and I'm going to say you're going

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
to have to stop right there, buddy.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
Cause there's only one daddy in this town.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
I like wink over it at Clark.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
I'm like, it's him.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Okay.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Luke, do you tell me what happens?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Oh, okay.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Oh no, don't do that.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
I mean, I rolled a crit fail on my getting down.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Oh, I forgot about that.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Gotcha.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
Your left side is just rocked by a couple bullets that hit some pretty brutal spots,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
your hip and your ribs.

23:27.000 --> 23:35.000
And as your left foot lands on the mud, it hits a rock and you just feel your whole leg

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
stiffens.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
It does that thing where you kind of hyper extend your knee on it, but that just shoots

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
your, your thigh bone directly up into this hip.

23:44.000 --> 23:51.000
That's just been shattered and you feel a crack as you just immediately crumble forward.

23:51.000 --> 23:58.000
But seeing as how you're on a pretty steep incline, it makes a belly flop noise as your

23:58.000 --> 24:04.000
face just hits the mud and you start slowly sliding down this hill.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Yuck.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
I'm going to do drugs probably on my next turn.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
That'll do.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
It's a three and a seven.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Oh, pastor Adam Kane just leans forward.

24:19.000 --> 24:26.000
He's got just horror in his eyes as he makes direct eye contact with Clark Bishop, knowing

24:26.000 --> 24:36.000
full well that his shot will ring true and he just noses down in and guns the four wheeler

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
directly into this muddy base and whipping up just wet mud behind him as he just back

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
and forth, back and forth, his back end sliding around.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
And he goes right over the impassable metal plate over the top and then whips his back

24:52.000 --> 25:02.000
end, just spraying Keith Vigna's back with mud like a bad guy from an eighties ski movie.

25:02.000 --> 25:13.000
And this black cat turns on the radio, hops off and starts running away, leaving the radio

25:13.000 --> 25:20.000
directly in between pastor Adam Kane on this four wheeler and Keith Vigna face down in

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
the mud.

25:21.000 --> 25:29.000
The radio is on and Casey Kristoff hollers with his pistol pointed into the back of

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Carrie Page's body's head.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
She's blindfolded and she's on her knees with her hands behind her back.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
All right now, everybody, everybody come on down.

25:41.000 --> 25:48.000
Just so you know, Mr. Bishop, Mr. Pettymore, if either one of you fire those weapons, your

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
friend Drew Andrews here is dead.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
And if I fire my weapon, Adam's dead.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Does he have any reaction to that?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
He cocks the pistol.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I cock mine.

25:59.000 --> 26:07.000
Carrie pages blindfolded on her knees, hands behind her back, starts hollering.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Bubble gum tree.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Bubble gum tree.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Bubble gum tree.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Bubble gum tree.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
It's him.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
A giant smile goes across the face of Carrie pages.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Yay, it's Drewby.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Drew, babe.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
John's going to move his gun to Casey.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
Any, any he'll say, he won't say anything.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
John moves his gun to Casey and lets that do the talking for him.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Keith Vigna, what do you do?

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
As you're laying there, you hear this radio flip on and the noise starts kicking up.

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
That was a disturbingly good radio sound.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
Uh, I'm going to take another big bump from my finger.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yep.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Lose 10 luck for me there.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
And then I'm, how close is the pastor to me?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Uh, Oh, he's, he's right on the other side.

27:05.000 --> 27:12.000
So basically you could reach out with your hand and, and touch the back of the four wheeler

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
and then the radio is strapped on right there.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
And then pastor Adam Kane is right on the other side of the radio.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
The radio is in the, on the back of the four wheeler.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Yeah.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And he's whipped his tail in toward you.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
So he is facing.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
He has a tail.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Yeah, man.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
People are animals in this game.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Thomas fucking get over it.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Okay.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I want to try to get to the radio.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Oh yeah.

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
You would be prone normally, but with losing that 10 luck, taking a quick, what do you

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
do?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
How do you do it?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Tell me how your body moves.

27:49.000 --> 27:59.000
I, then I get on my hands and knees and look at the radio and pounce from that position.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Okay.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
What's the goal here to grab the radio and either smash it or turn it off.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Uh, do you want to hold it over your head?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Like John Cusack.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
It starts raining.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Once I get to it, I'll decide what I do.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
I'm allowing you to do your action on this turn because you've taken the luck damage.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
So what's your luck at now?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Uh, down to 35.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
Cause I was, I was at 45 then 35 then I gained luck back and now I'm down again.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
So, uh, this radio has been ratcheted to the back of this four wheeler as to not fall off.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
What do you do?

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
I want to take the butt of my gun and smash a tube on it.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Fuck yeah dude.

28:36.000 --> 28:49.080
As soon as you do that, this noise just, oh shit.

28:49.080 --> 28:56.560
And pastor Adam Kane reaches in the side bag of this four wheeler, grabs a fish out and

28:56.560 --> 29:03.900
squeezes it so hard that it completely busts into two separate halfs above his head.

29:03.900 --> 29:10.500
Tail end falls on one side, head falls on the other, and you see just guts and sin like

29:10.500 --> 29:12.700
all this like what's inside a fish guys?

29:12.700 --> 29:13.700
Guts.

29:13.700 --> 29:14.700
Oh bones.

29:14.700 --> 29:15.700
Tiny little bones.

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
Yeah.

29:16.700 --> 29:20.260
Guts and tiny little fish bones kind of fall onto the helmet and immediately the light

29:20.260 --> 29:23.060
on his helmet turns green.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.060
Everybody roll power.

29:24.060 --> 29:27.060
Oh yes little bitch.

29:27.100 --> 29:34.100
20 on 50.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.100
Six.

29:35.100 --> 29:38.100
I pass a 35 on a 60.

29:38.100 --> 29:41.100
I rolled a 57, which is a success.

29:41.100 --> 29:42.100
Oh shit.

29:42.100 --> 29:45.100
Oh god damn it.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.100
I hate contested rules.

29:47.100 --> 29:51.100
Damn it.

29:51.100 --> 29:56.860
Your perceptions begin to change, but this time you can literally watch it happen.

29:57.060 --> 30:09.860
Let's see, everybody take off your headphones except for Joe.

30:09.860 --> 30:13.740
What is the moment that Clark most regrets?

30:13.740 --> 30:15.400
Oh fuck dude.

30:15.400 --> 30:19.700
I've got three that I can think of.

30:19.700 --> 30:22.420
And that's just off the top of my head, I bet there's a lot.

30:22.420 --> 30:28.660
I mean recently it's for sure the revelation of how I fucked up getting the Cain family

30:28.660 --> 30:30.860
out of the van.

30:30.860 --> 30:34.140
That would 100% be the one that he latches onto.

30:34.140 --> 30:35.140
Okay.

30:35.140 --> 30:39.500
Yeah that's a recent one that has been newly opened in his mind, like he didn't regret

30:39.500 --> 30:40.840
that until recently.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.460
Now it's a big, big deal.

30:43.460 --> 30:49.560
Clark your gun is aimed at this four wheeler and immediately the four wheeler is a minivan

30:49.560 --> 30:54.080
and it's turned over and it's on fire and it's still in this mud basin.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.740
It's still right there.

30:55.740 --> 31:00.900
But then you hear these screams and you remember hearing these screams.

31:00.900 --> 31:06.600
The van explodes and you are rushing toward it and you're back on the concrete, you're

31:06.600 --> 31:10.800
on the main drag heading north out of contention.

31:10.800 --> 31:16.320
But there's nothing you can do to stop it and then you're watching this child being

31:16.320 --> 31:20.400
taken off on a stretcher into the back of an ambulance.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
Roll sanity.

31:22.400 --> 31:30.640
Oh my god, I fail 97 way the fuck over my power.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.640
Oh yeah, 100%.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.640
Oh no!

31:32.640 --> 31:33.640
Oh boy.

31:33.640 --> 31:52.680
So Thomas, what is the moment so far that John Lee Pettymore regrets most?

31:52.680 --> 32:02.400
Multiple images flash before him, but because of the recent slayings of the ashers, he pictures

32:02.400 --> 32:04.360
the vacuuming of their children.

32:04.360 --> 32:12.160
Yes, and literally floating above this four wheeler, two children holding on to each other

32:12.160 --> 32:14.640
and it's the exact scene that you remember.

32:14.640 --> 32:22.240
They're holding on to this man, unkempt hair, wearing these rubber waders.

32:22.240 --> 32:27.260
You know him as James the mill worker and they're trying to hold on to him and you're

32:27.260 --> 32:34.100
trying to hold on to them but they're floating away above Bean's Pond and they're just floating

32:34.100 --> 32:43.220
up and then all at once you see behind them the sky envelopes out and opens this massive

32:43.220 --> 32:50.340
hole and coming out of it is just like an oil spray of this ooze but it's coming at

32:50.340 --> 32:57.460
you horizontally and it grabs onto them and in this weird whirlwind slowly, slowly pulls

32:57.460 --> 33:01.860
them like they're in a balloon almost.

33:01.860 --> 33:07.340
Like if a person was in a balloon trying desperately to get out, you see their hands and their

33:07.340 --> 33:15.340
feet kicking, kicking and trying to get out and then they just out of existence.

33:15.340 --> 33:16.340
Roll sanity.

33:16.340 --> 33:18.900
Can I also roll deception?

33:18.940 --> 33:22.860
Well, it's not a skill but...

33:22.860 --> 33:24.140
Persuade.

33:24.140 --> 33:26.820
That's not John's biggest regret.

33:26.820 --> 33:29.140
What's John's biggest regret?

33:29.140 --> 33:31.140
It's fucking up his racing career.

33:31.140 --> 33:36.340
He doesn't give a shit about any of this.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.480
Like deeply.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.820
This is kind of just happening to him right now?

33:41.820 --> 33:42.820
Roll sanity motherfucker.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.820
We'll see what happens.

33:44.820 --> 33:45.820
Hold on.

33:45.820 --> 33:50.020
Oh, why do I even need... no, 56 doesn't pass.

33:50.020 --> 33:51.820
Of course not.

33:51.820 --> 33:57.840
And so as this blinks out, you kind of shake it off and then the four wheeler down below

33:57.840 --> 34:03.820
turns into your sprint car that you wrecked and you see across the way where there once

34:03.820 --> 34:13.400
was Casey Kristoff holding a gun to the back of Kerry Page's head, you see little Elvis

34:13.480 --> 34:21.480
Duncan's Jr. and his face is split wide open, there's blood running down it.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.480
Oh no.

34:24.480 --> 34:30.480
Oh fuck.

34:30.480 --> 34:31.480
And you know...

34:31.480 --> 34:34.280
Oh god.

34:34.280 --> 34:41.600
You know 100% that if your defective safety harness hadn't taken his eye from him, blood

34:41.600 --> 34:47.560
begins to kind of like continue to pour down, you see that where his eye should be, there's

34:47.560 --> 34:55.560
just a skin grave.

34:55.560 --> 35:01.440
Like if a melon baller was made of skin, you'd be looking into its scoop.

35:01.440 --> 35:07.880
A skin grave.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.600
You had me, but then you went too far.

35:10.600 --> 35:16.600
That's what I'm here for.

35:16.600 --> 35:26.600
Y'all were having a bunch of laughs for your worst regret.

35:26.600 --> 35:36.160
Luke, what's Keith Vigna's biggest regret?

35:36.160 --> 35:44.400
Keith Vigna's biggest regret is changing his name and moving towns and becoming a cop instead

35:44.400 --> 35:49.440
of just facing the embarrassment of being beans and going to work for his brother.

35:49.440 --> 35:57.280
So you're standing over this now defunct radio and you're looking at Pastor Adam Kane who

35:57.280 --> 36:02.160
has just smeared fish all over this old motorcycle helmet.

36:02.160 --> 36:08.320
The four wheeler is surrounded by children who are all wearing party hats and they're

36:08.320 --> 36:14.800
all chanting, beans, beans, Keith, beans his only friends are figurines, beans, beans,

36:14.800 --> 36:19.040
Keith, beans will blow your friends to smithereens.

36:19.040 --> 36:29.440
And you turn back and you see Ferguson standing where Clark and John just were and he's wearing

36:29.440 --> 36:35.920
his beautiful suit, it's got a rose on his lapel and you look back at these birthday

36:35.920 --> 36:44.560
party clad children and instead you see a life, a life at Bar Corp.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.200
What would that look like for Keith?

36:46.200 --> 36:54.920
It'd be upper management, failed up to upper management, nepotism, nice house with a dog

36:54.920 --> 37:03.280
that he sees and takes care of, a wife probably and spends the weekends barbecuing at Ferguson's

37:03.280 --> 37:05.880
house and our children play together.

37:05.880 --> 37:12.800
And you think about all that and then you just see the inside of a room at Hotel Motel

37:12.800 --> 37:17.200
and you're just sitting at the edge of the bed by yourself.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.200
Roll sanity.

37:18.200 --> 37:28.680
35 on a 8.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.280
Everybody roll a D4.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.680
Oh no.

37:31.680 --> 37:32.680
2.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.680
1.

37:33.680 --> 37:34.680
1.

37:34.680 --> 37:38.040
Alright, John loses 2, Clark and Keith both lose 1 sanity.

37:38.040 --> 37:42.360
I probably shouldn't bring this up but are we still doing the D4 plus 1?

37:42.360 --> 37:49.240
Alright, no, cause that was a 1 slash 1 D4 so if you would have, no fuck that was, yeah

37:49.240 --> 37:51.720
no that would make sense for that to be the thing.

37:51.720 --> 37:52.720
No.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.400
Just keep it in mind for the future.

37:54.400 --> 37:59.440
We didn't talk about that on the normal show.

37:59.440 --> 38:03.400
It was if you had passed sanity and you were supposed to take damage no matter what.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.480
This one would have been that.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.400
I just wasn't paying attention so you got off.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.400
Cool.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.240
Well but we all failed though, right?

38:11.240 --> 38:12.240
Yes.

38:12.240 --> 38:17.200
So we have it written down as 1 slash 1 D4 is the sanity damage.

38:17.200 --> 38:22.840
Which would mean 1 if you pass slash 1 D4 if you fail because that's 1 up to 4.

38:22.840 --> 38:27.480
So it should have been according to the Patreon rule that I made 1 D4 plus 1.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.360
Which thank you Luke and I will remember moving forward.

38:30.360 --> 38:31.360
It's very kind of you.

38:31.360 --> 38:39.920
So, I am about to roll a D4, pretty important D4, cause it's how many rounds this lasted.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.920
Oh wow.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
Roll a 1.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.080
Yeah roll a 1.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.440
Oh he just rolled it.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.640
It's a 1.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.560
It's our word against his.

38:47.560 --> 38:53.940
If everybody else says it right now that it's all him, it's my dudes.

38:53.940 --> 38:57.320
He's moved his camera into a perfect position.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.320
What is it?

38:58.320 --> 38:59.320
It's a 2.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.320
It's a 2.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.320
Could be worse.

39:01.320 --> 39:02.320
I'll take it.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.240
Even though we also saw him roll that 1.

39:04.240 --> 39:08.280
He rolled a 1 and then said no no no and then he cut that audio out.

39:08.280 --> 39:14.600
He's gonna have to do a lot of that this episode.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.400
I'm real sorry buddy.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.800
I hope you know how much I love you.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.080
I've been taking Prozac for 3 years.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.800
Does that make you love people?

39:23.800 --> 39:24.800
No Prozac.

39:24.800 --> 39:25.800
Guys he's pro me.

39:25.800 --> 39:26.800
Oh look at him.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.800
He really liked it.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.800
I really liked it too.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.800
It's so dumb.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.800
It was good.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.040
And I should have thought of it like years ago but I just thought of it when I was in

39:36.040 --> 39:37.720
the kitchen like 10 minutes ago.

39:37.720 --> 39:38.800
That was really good.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.680
It obviously took me a second but thumbs up.

39:42.680 --> 39:49.960
I wanted to wait until I could see you in person but I couldn't.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.600
None of my medications have any fun jokes.

39:52.600 --> 39:58.480
I have my friends names in them.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.480
Celexa.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.760
I don't know anyone named Alexa.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.240
Celexa wasn't good for me.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.960
It's working for me.

40:05.960 --> 40:06.960
Vitamin B.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.200
Your friend Tim.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.200
What?

40:10.200 --> 40:11.200
I know.

40:11.200 --> 40:15.200
It's not in there but it sounds like it could be.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.200
Vitatim.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.200
Vitimin.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.200
Wow.

40:18.200 --> 40:28.520
I'm a big fan of John Boyega's character from Star Wars because I be pro Finn.

40:28.520 --> 40:29.520
Wow.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.480
That's basically mine.

40:32.480 --> 40:35.480
I thought that's what we were doing.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Doxycycline.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
I want none more for anything.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Doxycycline.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
I just rolled not one.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Uh oh.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
I'm frozen.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Can you hear me?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
It's a contested roll.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Let's all roll higher than that.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Can you guys hear me?

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Oh no.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
No way.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Oh shit.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
I can hear you guys still.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
You're back.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
You're back.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Okay.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I could hear you the whole time.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
It was just frozen.

41:03.520 --> 41:04.520
Okay.

41:04.520 --> 41:05.520
Yay.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.520
That was scary.

41:06.520 --> 41:07.520
That was scary.

41:07.520 --> 41:08.520
Yeah.

41:08.520 --> 41:09.520
Thank goodness.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.520
Knock on wood.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.520
My internet hasn't been out in three days.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.520
So.

41:12.520 --> 41:13.520
Shit.

41:13.520 --> 41:14.520
I knock on that floor for you.

41:14.520 --> 41:15.520
Okay.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.520
I forgot what we're waiting on.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.520
Oh, two rounds.

41:17.520 --> 41:18.520
He rolled a one for something.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.520
Oh guys.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.520
That not one really changed this entire situation.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.520
As your realities begin flooding back and your senses match your actual surroundings,

41:21.520 --> 41:22.520
you can hear Carrie Andrews.

41:22.520 --> 41:23.520
Carrie Andrews.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.520
Carrie Andrews.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.520
Carrie Andrews.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.520
Carrie Andrews.

41:26.520 --> 41:27.520
Carrie Andrews.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.520
Carrie Andrews.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.520
Carrie Andrews.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.520
Carrie Andrews.

41:31.040 --> 41:36.720
You can hear Carrie Andrews still hollering across the muddy divide.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.400
Don't you give them shit, boys.

41:38.400 --> 41:39.460
You hear me?

41:39.460 --> 41:43.400
Don't you give them anything but the cold graves they deserve.

41:43.400 --> 41:49.240
Clark, you see Casey Kristoff is still in the same position, pistol to the back of the

41:49.240 --> 41:52.760
head of blindfolded inside out Drew Carey.

41:52.760 --> 41:58.560
John, you immediately realize you are no longer holding your gun.

41:58.600 --> 42:04.280
Looking down, you see agent Trent Catt has not only knocked your weapon from your hand,

42:04.280 --> 42:10.160
but also ejected the magazine and is trying to grab the ammo with his mouth.

42:10.160 --> 42:17.820
Keith, you are being held under your arms, behind your neck, feet dragging in the mud

42:17.820 --> 42:25.560
in front of you as pastor Adam Cain hauls you toward the impassable metal plate.

42:25.560 --> 42:32.640
And as these two men approach the partially buried door, you all see that it begins sliding

42:32.640 --> 42:34.640
open.

42:34.640 --> 42:39.920
Oh, in trouble.

42:55.560 --> 43:03.560
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

43:03.560 --> 43:14.560
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

43:14.560 --> 43:18.560
There's no time to go.

43:18.560 --> 43:26.560
No time to go.

43:26.560 --> 43:29.560
Time to fly, time to stream.
