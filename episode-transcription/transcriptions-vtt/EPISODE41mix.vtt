00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
Hello my loyal listeners, it's your radiotherapist wolf the dog and I'm here to dole out suspect

00:07.040 --> 00:11.880
advice to people I barely know anything about and soothe your worries when it concerns the

00:11.880 --> 00:15.960
goings on and contention and the world.

00:15.960 --> 00:20.640
Or uh making them worse sometimes, hell I don't know what I'm doing here but y'all keep

00:20.640 --> 00:21.800
listening.

00:21.800 --> 00:29.940
As always we are broadcasting from 694.2 PTBP, the only place your worried minds can go to

00:29.940 --> 00:37.300
be soothed when the galaxy is trying to swallow y'all up.

00:37.300 --> 00:43.140
Anyway this week's howlin with wolf comes from at 1983bit who tweeted about the show

00:43.140 --> 00:45.980
and tagged at pretending pod.

00:45.980 --> 00:51.060
Spreading the news about this show is the only thing that will keep it on the air y'all.

00:51.060 --> 00:54.820
Plus it makes my heart full of kissy kissy feelings.

00:54.820 --> 00:56.060
They right.

00:56.060 --> 01:00.660
Did the outstanding officers of contention notice the signs at the town's border that

01:00.660 --> 01:05.280
said it was twinned with a small town in England called Uddersfield?

01:05.280 --> 01:09.840
This is a message from Wolf's British cousin who has heard the news of the strange goings

01:09.840 --> 01:10.840
on.

01:10.840 --> 01:16.500
Uddersfield is safe y'all apart from the influx of top grade cocaine courtesy of the local

01:16.500 --> 01:21.380
church which is floodin the cobbled streets of this west Yorkshire town.

01:21.380 --> 01:24.820
Don't forget to send us a postcard from Contention Wolf.

01:24.820 --> 01:26.980
We await your next update.

01:26.980 --> 01:30.140
Tom from Uddersfield UK.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.700
Now listen here Tom the dog.

01:32.700 --> 01:36.180
I told you to never ride into the show.

01:36.180 --> 01:41.300
I told you what I'd do to you if I ever caught a whiff of you scurrying about.

01:41.300 --> 01:45.740
I'd throw your soul into a dimension from which you'd never return.

01:45.740 --> 01:51.140
You'd drift on slowly grasping at everything but touching nothing while you fade from

01:51.140 --> 01:54.380
existence over millennia.

01:54.380 --> 01:59.020
But nice to know things are good in jolly old London Thomas from Uddersby.

01:59.020 --> 02:01.000
Speaking of jolly times.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.860
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl tag at pretending pod on Instagram

02:05.860 --> 02:11.060
or Twitter tag pretending to be people on Facebook or write a 5 star review and email

02:11.060 --> 02:14.600
us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

02:14.600 --> 02:19.500
Also don't sleep on the contest happening over on the subreddit r slash pretending to

02:19.500 --> 02:20.900
be people.

02:20.900 --> 02:26.280
You could win your very own hardback slipcase set of Delta Green the Role Playing Game.

02:26.280 --> 02:31.320
So join up with the community there and get to stepping on that contest y'all.

02:31.320 --> 02:36.140
Sometimes when I hear about the horrors of the world I feel like stepping into a different

02:36.140 --> 02:37.140
reality.

02:37.140 --> 02:39.220
It's the news.

02:39.220 --> 02:44.260
Last time Francis Beans embedded a big ol' rusty fish hook into John Lee Pettymore's

02:44.260 --> 02:46.780
shoulder before Clark Bishop could step in.

02:46.780 --> 02:51.620
Clark gave her a boot to the gut and she fell into the massive aquarium hitting her head

02:51.620 --> 02:56.860
on the catwalk on the way down and they left her to float face down in the murky water

02:56.860 --> 03:00.220
for pretty much the entirety of the episode.

03:00.220 --> 03:05.020
Meanwhile Keith Vigna escaped from the creature that swallowed him and George Piston.

03:05.020 --> 03:11.640
He pulled it off by firing his small but powerful pistol into the wall of this beast planting

03:11.640 --> 03:17.080
a frag grenade into the newly made enclave and using George Piston as a shield from the

03:17.080 --> 03:18.080
blast.

03:18.080 --> 03:23.280
Keith hit the surface laughing and gibbering some nonsense about something being inside

03:23.280 --> 03:24.280
him.

03:24.280 --> 03:29.080
They tried to let Kathy Piston off the hook from which she hanged but they fucked up and

03:29.080 --> 03:31.320
dropped her to the bottom of the tank.

03:31.320 --> 03:36.960
John Lee Pettymore jumped in, rolled luckily and paddled Kathy Piston back into the presuming

03:36.960 --> 03:39.040
safety of the catwalk.

03:39.040 --> 03:45.560
Keith performed CPR on both Francis and Kathy but wouldn't you know it only Kathy survived.

03:45.560 --> 03:51.000
After releasing Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad from his arm shredding fish

03:51.000 --> 03:56.600
hook our three protagonists and their two new companions stand together ready to take

03:56.600 --> 04:02.720
on the evil of Marvin Glass and foil his plans to take over the hometown of contention.

04:02.720 --> 04:08.240
But first I've set aside just enough time to prepare a brand new song.

04:08.240 --> 04:13.920
It may take some time to get used to like Bitter Coffee and Step-Parents but it's what

04:13.920 --> 04:19.660
the American masses want inside of them like Bitter Coffee and Step-Parents.

04:19.660 --> 04:24.560
It's kudzu with no backbone.

04:38.240 --> 04:53.920
Let's start the episode now.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.200
Zach later.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.200
Start it here.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.200
Pop pop pop!

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
Oh god.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.200
Now you can see.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.200
Yeah.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
It's visual.

05:02.200 --> 05:06.240
There was a guy on Reddit today that asked if you treated- fuck.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.240
I think it was-

05:08.240 --> 05:11.920
I think his example was IMDB scores and Rotten Tomatoes but I just used Rotten Tomatoes but

05:11.920 --> 05:16.440
it was if you treated directors scores as a batting average that if you took all their

05:16.440 --> 05:21.040
scores and averaged them out and I got really curious so I did a bunch of them and it was

05:21.040 --> 05:22.040
really interesting.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.040
Nice.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.040
Who had the best?

05:24.040 --> 05:29.400
So obviously because it's averages like Kubrick was way up there because he only has like

05:29.400 --> 05:33.580
six films and they're all a hundred basically.

05:34.060 --> 05:38.100
The ones I thought were interesting Ingmar Bergman and Martin Scorsese both have like

05:38.100 --> 05:43.260
80% averages and they've both got like 35 films each.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.260
They've got a huge list.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.860
I was gonna say Scorsese would probably be up there.

05:46.860 --> 05:47.860
Their status is way up there.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.300
The one I was surprised was low.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.300
What was it?

05:50.300 --> 05:53.260
I think it was Fincher maybe had a really low score.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.620
I wonder who the worst is.

05:55.620 --> 05:58.540
I did M. Night Shyamalan just to see and it was 49.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.660
It was really low compared to the others.

06:01.660 --> 06:05.460
He's had some bangers in some really really truly awful movies.

06:05.460 --> 06:08.940
Still batting 490 so.

06:08.940 --> 06:12.140
If he was a baseball player he'd be in the Hall of Fame.

06:12.140 --> 06:23.780
So as a GM and as a goon as I traditionally call myself or dumb as some have been known

06:23.780 --> 06:31.620
to say I have an interesting time with how we end a session or an episode in some of

06:31.620 --> 06:38.660
these cases do I do a cliffhanger is fun often or do I give you guys something right

06:38.660 --> 06:43.620
off the bat the next time that you're not prepared for you just always wait for somebody

06:43.620 --> 06:51.020
to say something dumb or funny and then I start screaming shut up it's over stop playing

06:51.020 --> 06:59.660
the fun game and then we have to stop talking to each other you won't take this seriously

06:59.660 --> 07:05.580
so let's go ahead and kick it off let's see where we're at I think you guys were on the

07:05.580 --> 07:12.660
catwalks walking up to we had getting down we had just got a trench head Trent Chad Doug

07:12.660 --> 07:18.240
Jacobs Chad yeah we just got him down and did we do anything else where was that pretty

07:18.240 --> 07:22.340
much this I'm pretty sure that's where we ended I think that's about where it ended

07:22.340 --> 07:29.180
you did you did some sort of a cheerful gathering the group together speech we all high-fived

07:29.420 --> 07:35.740
freeze-frame high-five Francis Dunn at this point right or is she very dead very dead

07:35.740 --> 07:41.900
and that's what I thought very dead Francis is bacon so you guys are standing on this catwalk

07:41.900 --> 07:48.540
with Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent Chad who's trying to recover from everything that's

07:48.540 --> 07:53.860
happened to him and Kathy piston who you've been having some interesting conversations with will

07:53.860 --> 07:59.060
you remind me how much time has passed since the last time we saw Doug Chad the last time you saw

07:59.060 --> 08:04.020
him would have been in the cage but I mean in mortal time did we put has a day passed or two

08:04.020 --> 08:11.060
I think about a day okay though you've all been unconscious remember in the last 24 hours when

08:11.060 --> 08:20.500
we died no not really it seems like weeks ago so you guys are all standing there and the there's

08:20.500 --> 08:27.820
the catwalk that leads away from the torture chamber or prison or whatever weird aquarium

08:27.820 --> 08:34.220
topping that you are currently standing in and on the other side away from that is the elevator

08:34.220 --> 08:39.620
door and I need you all to roll alertness for me as you begin walking toward the elevator door

08:45.180 --> 08:55.540
I pass an 18 on a 70 pass 54 on a 60 the eight nice yeah three successes so you guys all see

08:55.660 --> 09:02.700
as you're walking down this catwalk busting up out of the water just to the right of you

09:02.700 --> 09:10.700
is the fish man you saw earlier wearing the brown jumpsuit who is walking the perimeter in here and

09:10.700 --> 09:19.380
he flops up onto the catwalk kind of like a fish out of out of water and begins to shake off and

09:19.380 --> 09:29.300
we are going to enter combat cool enter combat now I've done something kind of fun maybe perhaps

09:29.300 --> 09:35.020
interesting for this specific combat that we're in right now we all got to get ourselves drenched in

09:35.020 --> 09:41.860
the bathtub this is very cool whoa I assume this will be posted on the Instagram it will indeed so

09:41.860 --> 09:46.380
what I've done is I used a whiteboard to make a map of the room that you're in you'll see the

09:46.380 --> 09:52.620
grid has the green where the water is and the white is the catwalk that you're standing on

09:52.620 --> 09:58.380
remember catwalk is kind of great you know so you can still see and very much smell the water coming

09:58.380 --> 10:03.980
out from underneath you that black X's are on a couple of the water spots those are where bodies

10:03.980 --> 10:10.400
are hanging and over there there's a circle with a little frowny face and two X's that's where the

10:10.400 --> 10:16.800
body of Francis beans is and then down here we have the catwalk leading to the elevator door we

10:16.800 --> 10:24.280
also have five little little magnets three of which are cat butts the butts of cats I thought

10:24.280 --> 10:32.400
they were dinosaurs they look extremely similar to brontosauruses and then we have two little

10:32.400 --> 10:38.600
markers down here one is a kitty pen magnet thing and the other one's just a little brick so the

10:38.600 --> 10:44.120
little brick is gonna be agent Trent Chad's body with Doug Jacobs trapped inside and the little

10:44.120 --> 10:51.120
kitty there is going to be Kathy piston what color cats do you guys want to be we've got an orange

10:51.120 --> 10:56.800
cat a gray cat and a black cat I want to be the orange cat I'll be the gray cat I got the black

10:56.800 --> 11:01.760
cat then all righty is that elevator door the one we came in to get into this room it is indeed okay

11:01.960 --> 11:15.000
so are we positioned correctly right now sure okay then we leave you got this Kathy so the elevator

11:15.000 --> 11:25.520
door so this brown suit fish man flops in between you guys and the elevator door and stands up and

11:25.520 --> 11:33.960
shakes all this water off of him and looks up at you and we are now in combat Joe Clark Bishop

11:33.960 --> 11:40.520
always acts first what do you do I want to pull so I handed Kathy a gun last episode yeah I want

11:40.520 --> 11:45.800
to pull the other one from my waistband and throw it to Doug Chad all right and if I can I'd like to

11:45.800 --> 11:51.280
still pull mine out of my boot can I do two of those I would say that you could like pull one

11:51.280 --> 11:56.080
throw it and then pull another but maybe not shoot this turn that's what I'll do if that works for

11:56.080 --> 12:03.040
you and who's got a better dexterity between John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna I have 60 50

12:03.040 --> 12:09.360
all right so Keith Vigna you are up next so real quick Doug Chad might not be able to catch too

12:09.360 --> 12:22.440
well with his stigmata dance I didn't want to influence your role-playing decision but I'll

12:22.440 --> 12:28.360
roll for him let's see if he'll have a 40% chance to catch it that's not bad given where the cat

12:28.360 --> 12:34.720
butts are I could just grapevine it down to him he rolled a 31 yeah so that's our Doug Chad he

12:34.720 --> 12:44.280
grimaces and is like alright ready to go and then he loads he like cocks the pistol so you can tell

12:44.280 --> 12:51.080
he means business and it is Keith Vigna's turn I pull out my tiny powerful gun aim it right at

12:51.080 --> 13:00.160
that fish man and take a shot all righty go ahead and roll firearms for me 74 and a 70 oh so you

13:00.200 --> 13:06.880
fire into the wall and it actually makes a divot in this so the wall right next to the elevator is

13:06.880 --> 13:12.600
that same like onyx kind of like black obsidian and you fire into it and it actually like kind of

13:12.600 --> 13:17.880
cracks and you can see in the reflection it like shatters into a bunch of different like mirror

13:17.880 --> 13:25.080
reflections all coming back and it looks very cool awesome miss thanks John Lee Pettymore it's

13:25.080 --> 13:31.000
your turn I want to sling my shotgun like down to my hip and pull my pistol out with my other hand

13:31.000 --> 13:37.120
and give them a blast with each with each yeah dual wielding yes all right I'm gonna have you

13:37.120 --> 13:49.800
roll firearms at negative 20% oh man hopefully this was a good call yes 25 on a modified 60 so

13:49.800 --> 13:55.240
40 congratulations all right so you are almost point-blank range so you're gonna be in your

13:55.240 --> 14:01.080
second damage increment on the shotgun so you're gonna roll 3d6 for damage on that on just the

14:01.080 --> 14:08.720
shotgun yeah and then also it was a pistol you said the heavy pistol in yep so 1d 10 3d 6 plus

14:08.720 --> 14:21.320
two hell yeah good shot oh no okay so eight plus so 10 10 total all right so that blast goes

14:21.320 --> 14:28.880
directly into his gut and have you ever was aiming for his guilt has he ever gutted a fish

14:28.880 --> 14:36.680
before yeah what's it look like on the inside fish guts yeah so it's that you blast through

14:36.680 --> 14:41.640
and you can tell especially since it's his turn next you'll be able to tell that he's gonna be

14:41.640 --> 14:49.800
able to continue to act but according to what one might call I think it's D&D is it Dungeons

14:49.800 --> 15:04.040
and Dragons rules he is certainly bloodied immediately he's oh wow for talking ooh ooh for

15:04.040 --> 15:11.720
talking talking talking for talking ooh ooh for talking talking talking yeah that's

15:11.720 --> 15:40.080
talking talking talking you hear that all happen in quartet fashion as three other fish men show

15:40.080 --> 15:45.400
up on the map and I will place them they're going to be on either side of you and in the

15:45.400 --> 15:52.200
back of the room by Francis beans body they're flanking us there was another cat but available

15:52.200 --> 15:58.960
and you saved it for a fish man there was what are those cats called it's got a black tail it's

15:58.960 --> 16:05.080
like the one in meet the parents like Siamese sure and so with that these other you hear a

16:05.080 --> 16:12.400
full quartet and surround sound of this chance oh by the way he has a smile while he's singing

16:12.400 --> 16:18.040
more of a grimace than a smile I suppose more of a giant purple action figure for McDonald's and

16:18.040 --> 16:26.840
he his teeth are like human teeth I don't know if I've ever explained that when he when he grimaces

16:26.840 --> 16:33.000
these uh these mutated humans they still have it's like those fish clown fish they're not

16:33.000 --> 16:40.800
fish I think I looked it up once and they've got real weird human looking teeth yeah and

16:40.800 --> 16:48.880
this creatures in front of you also has those teeth with that his turn is finished and Doug

16:48.880 --> 16:53.760
Jacobs Oh Kathy piston are both standing there with pistols in their hands well hey can we get

16:53.760 --> 17:01.360
back to the magnet thing real quick Doug was a cat okay okay you're absolutely right I fucked up

17:01.360 --> 17:07.720
really bad here so we're gonna take away the just swap them the brick the brick is now fish man

17:07.720 --> 17:15.000
the brick is now a fish man and Doug Jacobs is rightfully a cat but it's called a sheep's head

17:15.000 --> 17:23.360
fish oh I hate that yeah it's really gross like it what I'm imagining it's bad in my mind space

17:23.360 --> 17:32.960
bad oh freaking out they are they're both gonna fire in two two different directions here Kathy

17:32.960 --> 17:38.800
is gonna shoot the one who is flanking you from the back and side and Doug Jacobs is gonna fire

17:38.800 --> 17:45.240
at the one right in front of him Doug Jacobs misses wildly and fires into one of the shattered

17:45.240 --> 17:52.040
pieces of wall that Keith fired into earlier breaking it further into a prettier site oh and

17:52.040 --> 18:01.000
Kathy piston fires true and does five damage to one of the fish men the one on the bottom the one

18:01.000 --> 18:09.800
on the bottom nice good job Kathy Kathy piston fires straight and true she let loose a bullet

18:09.800 --> 18:17.720
she slayed the fish man she shot gun real good fireball variable the other three fish men

18:17.720 --> 18:29.040
continued in their their chanting and you hear a rumble and your feet begin to shake and you see

18:29.040 --> 18:40.200
in the distance two massive claws grab on to the catwalk and begin ripping it down and the catwalk

18:40.200 --> 18:49.720
fully breaks off into the water and where it once was you see this massive creature that looks

18:49.720 --> 18:58.040
exactly like one of these fish men unclothed and four times larger and this one has a giant wound

18:58.040 --> 19:06.880
in its side and it is bleeding out pus water and this black ichor what's the junk like oh it's

19:06.880 --> 19:14.200
super tight that will be portrayed by this magnet for tank seven by Boulevard Brewing

19:14.200 --> 19:22.680
smokestack series cool cool yeah making me thirsty and with that the giant monster fish

19:22.680 --> 19:27.760
creatures in the game at the top of the order here it's gonna be Clark Bishop's turn and I

19:27.760 --> 19:34.840
want to give you guys a few outlines for this combat basically in order to leave this room

19:34.960 --> 19:39.240
from what you know right now you have to leave through the elevator in order for the elevator

19:39.240 --> 19:43.880
to come you have to press the button you don't know how many rounds it's gonna take for the

19:43.880 --> 19:50.600
elevator to come after you press the button so you have to survive until the elevator comes you

19:50.600 --> 20:03.960
can each move you make an elevator come carefully you can each move two spaces which I'm gonna

20:03.960 --> 20:10.640
dictate as grid spots so you can move from like one water to the you know move up different water

20:10.640 --> 20:16.760
spaces in the grid or no sorry you can move one space and act or you can move two spaces with no

20:16.760 --> 20:21.400
how many spaces away is the button for the elevator the button for the elevator is going

20:21.400 --> 20:26.340
to be two spaces away from where you all are now okay like the elevator bridge represents two

20:26.340 --> 20:30.360
squares basically sure yeah yeah yeah cool all right Clark Bishop top of the round what do you

20:30.360 --> 20:36.520
want to do I'm going to fire at the fish man that is blocking our way to the elevator all right go

20:36.520 --> 20:48.040
ahead and roll firearms for me yeah I pass a 24 on an 80 already rolled damage that's a four four

20:48.040 --> 20:55.960
on one d10 do you say anything cool does he die oh yeah fuck so you you firing into him with your

20:55.960 --> 21:10.080
pistol I got him hook line and sinker it's made all the cooler as the fish man stumbles back and

21:10.080 --> 21:20.320
forth as being shot and looks at you and goes dogging and then falls off to the left side into

21:20.320 --> 21:26.840
the water and you see blood start to dissipate all throughout the water he would have been a

21:26.840 --> 21:34.120
really chill dude if he was like hook line and sinker barely knew her and then died that would

21:34.120 --> 21:40.320
have been very chill you're a chill way to respond to somebody like action movie line yeah is Delta

21:40.320 --> 21:45.320
green a game where if I've now used an action I can't move or can I go ahead and use the movement

21:45.320 --> 21:55.960
I would have had game Joe is this okay it's a life it's a lifestyle in which you can move one

21:55.960 --> 22:01.200
space after you fire yeah I'd like to go ahead and make my way middle of the gang weather making my

22:01.200 --> 22:08.640
way the middle Clark Bishop is now in the middle on his way to the elevator one space away Keith

22:08.640 --> 22:14.360
Vigna it's your turn hey do I have a clear shot on big boy you do he's pretty far away pretty

22:14.360 --> 22:21.240
right now about 50 yards out I'll take one step or one square towards them and then take a shot

22:21.240 --> 22:26.400
with my tiny powerful gun yeah do you do anything cool or do you just like walk slowly toward it or

22:26.400 --> 22:31.880
do you tremble or are you scared at all this giant fucking beast that's in front of you I fought this

22:31.880 --> 22:38.520
motherfucker already you fucking took this as I fire at him I say eat this noodle fish bitch

22:38.520 --> 22:57.040
all right okay roll okay 93 wow you cannot roll a success to save your life sucks you just fire

22:57.040 --> 23:04.520
this this gun I mean it the noise that it makes in this room every time you fire it is exhausting

23:04.520 --> 23:13.760
to the ears as is your lack of good rolling strongly petty more stern can I make it to the

23:13.760 --> 23:18.760
elevator this turn you absolutely can okay I want to do that and press the button now already pardon

23:18.760 --> 23:29.040
me you press the button to the left of the elevator door and it lights up green a few more

23:29.040 --> 23:37.520
times John Kathy piston is going to in full Keanu Reeves fashion just start walking slowly and

23:37.520 --> 23:47.240
calmly to the fish man she already shot and continue firing into it succeeding once again

23:47.240 --> 23:57.760
yeah awesome and compliant NPC oh but she she does fire true however she only wings them in

23:57.760 --> 24:03.720
the shoulder and it does not seem to do any damage whatsoever which is interesting if you

24:03.720 --> 24:09.720
had to put a numerical value on it I would say zero it seems like these fish men have some sort

24:09.720 --> 24:18.720
of armor on their skin that is making them not take full damage from gunfire interesting like

24:18.720 --> 24:27.040
an amphibious chainmail like an amphibious chainmail Doug Jacobs is going to join you on

24:27.120 --> 24:32.400
the catwalk he's very scared he wants to get out of here he's tired his arms hurt and he's bleeding

24:32.400 --> 24:38.440
all over the place he's very upset and for the last like couple hours he's just been doing

24:38.440 --> 24:48.200
everything everyone says and he hated feeling that way and he's scared if it gets real bad we

24:48.200 --> 24:54.400
just throw this bleeding bastard to the big fish like chum right I'm saying no of course not but

24:54.400 --> 25:03.680
I'm nodding yes these fish men both jump in the water ooh sneaky habits is bloop bloop and then

25:03.680 --> 25:12.520
they pop out on either side of Keith Vigna they got some movement on them the massive lumbering

25:12.520 --> 25:20.440
creature is clawing its way right toward Keith Vigna who is now being completely surrounded by

25:20.440 --> 25:29.720
these amphibious creatures oh that's close and it gets close enough in one turn to go ahead and

25:29.720 --> 25:45.680
try to claw at Keith Vigna succeeding so so Luke if you die before we play the next game do you

25:45.680 --> 25:57.200
want to just uber home instead of the claw does nine damage so claw basically one of the like

25:57.200 --> 26:06.320
claw just reach it like goes directly into your shoulder and the back four claws all dig into

26:06.480 --> 26:16.200
your back and it is going to with a successful claw attack it has a chance to grab and it fails

26:16.200 --> 26:22.320
the group the grab so it digs its claws into you for nine damage and you start bleeding just

26:22.320 --> 26:29.080
profusely and you actually feel a crunch where it entered you because it went all the way through

26:29.080 --> 26:38.640
the layer of metal that is in that arm gosh well fuck I have two hit points left not to say we're

26:38.640 --> 26:44.360
fucked oh you have two hit points left and so you took nine damage when you had 11 so I'm gonna go

26:44.360 --> 26:50.880
ahead with two hit points you might fall unconscious why did I say that so oh because we're playing a

26:50.880 --> 26:58.600
game fun when we when we play by the oh we shouldn't be shakes your consequences everything

26:58.600 --> 27:05.280
she always work out so I need you to roll a constitution check to stay awake as blood just

27:05.280 --> 27:14.200
gushes 93 with different dice yeah that is absolutely remarkable as Keith Emmett light

27:14.200 --> 27:22.600
goes out and he falls on to the catwalk Luke I'm gonna need you to leave the room yeah I figured

27:22.600 --> 27:30.800
oh shit we'll save you Keith I hope so I've actually got a pretty decent plan I think

27:44.200 --> 28:12.080
the only one

28:12.080 --> 28:14.960
try
