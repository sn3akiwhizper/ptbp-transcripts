00:00.000 --> 00:06.700
Shoot, dang boy, I can't believe that time machine I bought off the internet actually

00:06.700 --> 00:12.540
worked and I managed to squeeze my producer in that little thing with me.

00:12.540 --> 00:18.520
It was gonna be a tight squeeze but my barrel of meat grease helped us slip and slide right

00:18.520 --> 00:19.760
in y'all.

00:19.760 --> 00:26.120
We are broadcasting live from 25 years ago in contention once again.

00:26.120 --> 00:33.080
No matter what reality or time-space continuum we are in, we are always right here for y'all

00:33.080 --> 00:42.720
at 694.2 PTBP, the world's only time-traveling pirate radio station.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.840
Now this timeline's howlin' with Wolf is from At Matt Makes Messes who tweeted about

00:48.840 --> 00:56.760
the show and tagged At Pretending Pod a remarkably helpful, cool, and easy thing to do.

00:56.760 --> 01:03.060
He writes, Contention PD has issued a warning for residents to be on the lookout for a devilishly

01:03.060 --> 01:10.920
handsome 6 foot 1 British man with brown hair and brown eyes who goes by At Matt Makes Messes

01:10.920 --> 01:12.320
on Twitter.

01:12.320 --> 01:19.320
This individual has been seen being too attractive for his own damn good and CPD have warned

01:19.320 --> 01:25.980
not to approach this individual for fear of him talking to you about RPGs and other useless

01:25.980 --> 01:29.520
nerdy shit for far too long.

01:29.520 --> 01:35.360
If you have any information please contact Officer Poppy Cox of the Contention Police

01:35.360 --> 01:36.360
Department.

01:36.360 --> 01:44.960
Well Matt Makes Messes, you may be beautiful, you may be tall, heck you might even be British

01:44.960 --> 01:51.280
for all I know, but I'd like to see if you can make as big a mess as I can boy.

01:51.280 --> 01:58.000
I've made houses unlivable just by being near them, cleared out an entire neighborhood with

01:58.000 --> 02:04.640
the stank that my mess produces, I have made a dumpster behind an all-you-can-eat buffet,

02:04.640 --> 02:13.560
my residence, my kingdom, the rats gather around my grease-coated frame, I am the king

02:13.560 --> 02:22.480
of mess and you will respect and fear me as I sit atop my garbage throne.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.600
But thanks for writing in buddy, remember if you want to write up something for your

02:27.600 --> 02:33.120

Justin, a disgusting game of The End of the World with Taylor, and a cartoonishly silly

03:10.720 --> 03:17.360
two-episode run of Magnum Vice Fury Force GM'd by Jake who voiced a young Ferguson

03:17.360 --> 03:18.960
Beans on the show.

03:18.960 --> 03:25.040
This game is so wild y'all, normally the PCs would be cops, ex-special forces or informants

03:25.040 --> 03:31.460
sent on a mission by an angry police captain, but not this time, no Jake wanted the mission

03:31.460 --> 03:36.260
to be doled out by the fanatic pasture of a fringe religious group.

03:36.260 --> 03:43.700
So join Joe as Nelson Fairbanks, choir director and kung fu master, Zach as Christian, rookie

03:43.700 --> 03:50.060

03:57.460 --> 04:02.860

04:02.860 --> 04:09.160

04:13.740 --> 04:18.380
That's enough news for now, and I'm sure you're just as antsy to see what it's like here in

04:18.380 --> 04:19.380
the past.

04:19.380 --> 04:26.260
Well two things will always be true, one, shit is crazy fucked and two, Wolf has the

04:26.260 --> 04:30.000
tunes to shake loose the foundations of reality.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.020
So get ready, it's an oldie, it's timeless and perfect for a spineless crisis, it's Moondance

04:38.020 --> 04:42.540
by Blue False Indigo.

04:42.540 --> 04:53.980
She runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs,

04:53.980 --> 05:05.420
the sun is leaving soon.

05:05.420 --> 05:20.460
She knows, she knows, she knows, that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance

05:20.460 --> 05:25.540
beneath the shadow of the moon.

05:25.540 --> 05:39.500
No, is that not, they did it, it was a, it was a mash, they did a smash.

05:39.500 --> 05:44.420
They did the mash, they did the monster mash, they did the mash, it was a graveyard smash.

05:44.420 --> 05:49.820
They did the fuck, they did the monster fuck.

05:49.820 --> 05:59.060
Wolf bar mitzvah, spooky scary, men becoming men, men becoming men, boys becoming wolf.

05:59.060 --> 06:02.820
You're so bad at knowing how it works.

06:02.820 --> 06:06.980
I'm bad at knowing how a lot of stuff works, it's October 1st guys, we're in the spooky

06:06.980 --> 06:07.980
season.

06:07.980 --> 06:08.980
Scary time.

06:08.980 --> 06:09.980
It's our season to shine.

06:09.980 --> 06:10.980
Hell yeah dude.

06:10.980 --> 06:14.420
I think it's a perfect time to start a spooky woods story.

06:14.420 --> 06:19.620
And if you're starting the podcast with this episode at any point in the future that's

06:19.620 --> 06:26.420
not like the fall, I suggest you just stop and wait a year, just wait until it's the

06:26.420 --> 06:27.780
spooky times.

06:27.780 --> 06:31.380
You gotta know where we're coming from and you're just not gonna get it otherwise.

06:31.380 --> 06:36.900
Also if you're starting the podcast now, go back and listen to him from episode one probably,

06:36.900 --> 06:38.940
would be the best way to go about this.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.420
That one's a little tricky because you have to start it in December 2018.

06:42.420 --> 06:43.900
That's true.

06:43.900 --> 06:44.900
That's true.

06:44.900 --> 06:45.900
It'd be hard.

06:45.900 --> 06:46.900
Can you time travel listener?

06:46.900 --> 06:47.900
Hey listener.

06:47.900 --> 06:48.900
If you can.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.780
I appear in this room right now.

06:50.780 --> 06:51.780
Ooh.

06:51.780 --> 06:52.780
Oh my god.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.780
Whoa.

06:53.780 --> 06:54.780
Hey.

06:54.780 --> 06:55.780
Hey.

06:55.780 --> 06:56.780
You can't just come in here buddy.

06:56.780 --> 06:57.780
Hello.

06:57.780 --> 06:58.780
I am a time traveler.

06:58.780 --> 07:00.580
Are you guys glad the podcast is over?

07:00.580 --> 07:04.220
What time are you from?

07:04.220 --> 07:06.380
Oh goodness.

07:06.380 --> 07:11.820
So we're doing a new story set in the same universe.

07:11.820 --> 07:15.300
When did I tell you guys to start working on characters for this?

07:15.300 --> 07:16.300
Like three weeks ago.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.300
Yeah.

07:17.300 --> 07:18.300
Yeah.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.300
Something like that.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.300
Around there.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.300
And...

07:21.300 --> 07:22.300
And then we made them last night.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.300
Yeah.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.300
Yeah.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.300
Pretty much.

07:25.300 --> 07:29.720
When I told you guys to make characters, did you expect it to be in the same...

07:29.720 --> 07:30.720
What did I tell you?

07:30.720 --> 07:31.720
I told you to make High Schoolers.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.220
You told us pretty much exactly what's about to happen.

07:34.220 --> 07:35.440
High Schoolers in the Woods.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.440
It's a prequel.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.440
Oh yeah.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
Prequel.

07:38.440 --> 07:44.440
A while back you told us to prepare to make new characters, and I figured that our characters

07:44.440 --> 07:47.200
would die and we would just come in, you know.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.800
He figured our characters would die.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.800
Yeah.

07:49.800 --> 07:54.280
But we fucked up those plans in a very fun way.

07:54.280 --> 07:55.400
I didn't expect to be...

07:55.400 --> 07:59.340
Well, when you first brought it up, I didn't expect to be a High Schooler, but you know.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.340
Here we are.

08:00.340 --> 08:01.340
Here we are.

08:01.340 --> 08:06.760
So for those listening, I have asked these boys to create High Schoolers to play a little

08:06.760 --> 08:09.040
game in the woods.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.820
That's where we're at for this one.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.740
That's what Zach likes to do with his free time.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.200
Play with High Schoolers in the Woods.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.600
Take High School boys out for games in the woods.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.600
Yeah, it's fun.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.440
It's a good place to role play.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.440
It's called orienteering.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.440
I run a course.

08:21.440 --> 08:25.600
How many times do I have to tell you, Thomas?

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
Fully licensed and accredited.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.440
Yeah, go out to one of those team building things out in the woods.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.440
Walk on a rope.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.600
A lot of rope walking.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.760
So much rope walking.

08:34.760 --> 08:35.760
Get ready.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.600
I hope you guys have rope walking as a skill.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.200
I wrote it down as my craft.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.200
On your character sheets.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.120
I have 100% on rope walking.

08:43.120 --> 08:46.240
So we sat down and made characters last week.

08:46.240 --> 08:52.680
And just to give you guys, listeners, a parameter of what to expect here.

08:52.680 --> 08:59.040
The whole last arc with the characters that we played, we did a Pulp Cthulhu mashup.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.760
And on this one, we did not do that.

09:02.760 --> 09:09.120
So for their characteristics, what are they called, stats, for the strength and constitution

09:09.120 --> 09:15.540
and power and stuff, I gave them 60 points to put in, which would average out to 10 points

09:15.540 --> 09:17.380
on each stat there.

09:17.380 --> 09:19.640
Which means that they're weaker.

09:19.640 --> 09:20.640
They're the worst characters.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.040
Makes us a lot daintier.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.040
Exactly.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.040
And the hit points.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.600
We're just helpless little teen boys, like Zach likes.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.600
Exactly.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.320
Out in the woods.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.040
It's just because I want to teach young men how to become better men.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
Probably die eventually.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.440
I mean, everybody dies eventually.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.440
Exactly.

09:41.440 --> 09:47.480
But sooner, if I'm around and well, that hasn't been the case in the show so far, but it might

09:47.480 --> 09:49.980
be coming up.

09:49.980 --> 09:56.280
And then for the skills, I gave them 400 points to put into the different skills, which is

09:56.280 --> 10:00.940
considerably less than even a Call of Cthulhu or Delta Green character.

10:00.940 --> 10:04.880
He also put the parameter on there that we couldn't have any skill higher than 50, which

10:04.880 --> 10:07.640
puts another layer of squishiness on us.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.640
Yeah.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.640
There's a bit of squish.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.480
We're just helpless little boys.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.480
Just out here in the woods.

10:12.480 --> 10:16.880
Is that the only thing you wrote on your character sheet?

10:16.880 --> 10:19.480
What does Zach want to do to us out here?

10:19.480 --> 10:21.600
Torment, scare, kill.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.600
Push the narrative along.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.600
All right, we got it boys.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
We got them.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.600
We got them.

10:25.920 --> 10:26.920
Yeah.

10:26.920 --> 10:27.920
Come on in.

10:27.920 --> 10:28.920
Hello.

10:28.920 --> 10:29.920
No, Zach.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.920
I am a time traveler.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.920
From the FBI.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.720
All right, well, this has been going on long enough.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.920
Let's dive into the game.

10:44.920 --> 10:45.920
Damn it.

10:45.920 --> 10:46.920
Fuck.

10:46.920 --> 10:47.920
Oh, did you not want to play tonight?

10:47.920 --> 10:49.920
No, I just lost the game.

10:49.920 --> 10:50.920
Oh.

10:50.920 --> 10:51.920
Fuck.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.920
It's been a while.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.920
Yeah.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.920
All right, diving right in.

10:57.920 --> 11:07.240
We see a high school classroom and the round clock up on the wall, like all high school

11:07.240 --> 11:15.000
clocks, the normal analog clock says 3 30 on it.

11:15.000 --> 11:23.960
And on the whiteboard or chalkboard, regardless, is the word detention and sitting at the only

11:24.000 --> 11:29.600
desk that is occupied in the room is a boy, a helpless boy.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.560
Thomas, what does this boy look like?

11:32.560 --> 11:40.200
Like Judd Nelson in the Breakfast Club, but really young, like 13, 14.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.960
He even looked young for his age, but he's still trying to put on like pretty tough.

11:43.960 --> 11:44.960
So what's he wearing?

11:44.960 --> 11:46.940
Denim, cut off jacket.

11:46.940 --> 11:54.980
He's got kind of raggedy, like pretty thin Western shirt on Wranglers jeans and some

11:54.980 --> 11:58.940
kind of punky boots and a scowl.

11:58.940 --> 12:00.620
What's he doing right now?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.660
Sitting alone in detention.

12:02.660 --> 12:07.920
He's got his arms crossed and he's just staring at the clock and kind of tapping his toes.

12:07.920 --> 12:12.340
And even if there were other people in this room, like he's, he would be, he's giving

12:12.340 --> 12:15.180
off a vibe like fuck off, I've got enough friends.

12:15.180 --> 12:18.660
Mr. Pettymore, you know that you're supposed to be doing your schoolwork.

12:18.660 --> 12:21.660
He rolls his eyes.

12:21.660 --> 12:24.700
The teacher also rolls his eyes.

12:24.700 --> 12:31.980
The teacher is wearing a sweater vest and some slacks and kind of like an oversized

12:31.980 --> 12:36.300
shirt underneath the sweater vest that's poofing out from underneath it.

12:36.300 --> 12:42.540
And he's got horn rim glasses and he is equally scowling at you.

12:42.540 --> 12:49.620
Then there is a knock on the door and two more young boys come into the room.

12:49.620 --> 12:52.480
What do these boys look like, Joe and Luke?

12:52.480 --> 12:58.500
You see Ken Krenkelhoff walk in and he's wearing a letterman jacket, but he also is like 13

12:58.500 --> 12:59.500
or 14.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.940
So he wouldn't, shouldn't have one.

13:01.940 --> 13:06.140
It happens to be one that was bought for him by his dad and told that he needed to wear

13:06.140 --> 13:09.540
to visualize himself in the future.

13:09.540 --> 13:16.580
But he's tall and very fit and he's got a great head of hair and he walks in with a

13:16.580 --> 13:19.420
lot of, his head held high.

13:19.420 --> 13:22.560
He's got a lot of self esteem behind him and he's got a swagger to his walk.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.960
And the teacher greets you very warmly.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.980
He's like, Oh Ken, what a surprise.

13:26.980 --> 13:30.220
So good to see you come into my classroom on a day like this.

13:30.220 --> 13:31.500
How you doing, sir?

13:31.500 --> 13:36.460
Oh, I'm doing extremely, extremely much better now that, now that you're here.

13:36.460 --> 13:40.380
And Oh my God, look who it is, Ash.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.900
Oh, my two favorite students.

13:42.900 --> 13:48.300
Jeremy Pennymore real quick, just gives both of them like a look and pulls out his denim

13:48.300 --> 13:51.660
jacket so the teacher can't see, but he gives them a like jack off motion.

13:51.660 --> 13:52.660
Like, okay.

13:52.660 --> 13:54.780
Like, all right, jack offs.

13:54.780 --> 14:01.140
Ash walks in, he is like average freshman high school height, like however tall that

14:01.140 --> 14:02.980
is five something.

14:03.060 --> 14:08.380
He's got like black hair, just kind of messily placed on his head.

14:08.380 --> 14:14.020
He's got a white t-shirt on with kind of like a, like a sleeveless jacket vest kind of thing

14:14.020 --> 14:17.180
that's buttoned up over his white t-shirt.

14:17.180 --> 14:21.380
And it's a mix between like cheetah print and horn, horns, what is it?

14:21.380 --> 14:22.380
Houndstooth.

14:22.380 --> 14:27.740
Uh, but it's like cheetah print colored acid wash jeans and some like, uh, kind of like

14:27.740 --> 14:29.980
scuffed up tennis shoes on.

14:29.980 --> 14:33.980
And he walks in and he just kind of winks at the teacher and he looks and he sits down

14:33.980 --> 14:34.980
at a desk.

14:34.980 --> 14:39.240
Ash, I am, I am positive that you don't have detention today.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.900
What are you boys doing in my classroom?

14:41.900 --> 14:43.980
We saw that, uh, our buddy Jeremy was in here.

14:43.980 --> 14:45.900
We thought we'd come keep him company.

14:45.900 --> 14:46.900
Get back to work.

14:46.900 --> 14:47.900
Sorry.

14:47.900 --> 14:48.900
You were saying?

14:48.900 --> 14:53.100
We just, uh, we had some work that we could get done and we just thought we'd do it down

14:53.100 --> 14:54.480
here with Jeremy.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.980
Just make sure you didn't feel alone down here.

14:55.980 --> 15:00.780
Ken and I have a group project that, well, my parents don't really want people, uh, to

15:00.780 --> 15:04.340
come over until they're at home and, uh, Ken's is too far to walk to.

15:04.340 --> 15:10.500
So, uh, we figured we just hang out here until, until, uh, we got done with our, our stuff.

15:10.500 --> 15:15.740
Well you know that here at Silas Cole K through 12, we don't necessarily appreciate people

15:15.740 --> 15:20.960
joining in on detentions when they don't quite have detention, might give off the wrong idea

15:20.960 --> 15:22.780
that it's something fun to do.

15:22.780 --> 15:26.940
But you know, you, you two are allowed to do whatever you want.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.660
You know that Jeremy, get back to work.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.340
Well, hey, you want me to do my schoolwork, right?

15:31.340 --> 15:32.340
Yes.

15:32.340 --> 15:33.340
Fuck.

15:33.340 --> 15:34.340
The only schoolwork I got is with these two.

15:34.340 --> 15:35.340
Jeremy cursing.

15:35.340 --> 15:37.540
Sorry, sir.

15:37.540 --> 15:44.140
And he looks at the two of you and he's like, are you actually going to keep him in line?

15:44.140 --> 15:47.460
He is in our class with the, this, this group project.

15:47.460 --> 15:48.460
Okay.

15:48.500 --> 15:53.820
Yeah, somebody responsible has to be in here and Ken, since you're here, that's fine.

15:53.820 --> 16:00.020
I actually, I'm, I need to run down to the teacher's lounge real quick and okay, I'll,

16:00.020 --> 16:01.740
I'll, I'll be, I'll be back shortly.

16:01.740 --> 16:03.820
Yeah, we'll put it, we'll put our nose to the ground.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.660
Jeremy, get back to work.

16:05.660 --> 16:06.660
Yes sir.

16:06.660 --> 16:11.420
And the, uh, the, the teacher leaves the room and closes the door behind him.

16:11.420 --> 16:15.700
Jeremy flips him huge double birds as the door closes.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.100
Your fingers like grow.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.100
Yes.

16:18.780 --> 16:23.260
Uh, and I knocked some stuff off his desk and I'm like, all right, let's get out of

16:23.260 --> 16:24.260
here losers.

16:24.260 --> 16:25.260
Jeremy, what'd you do this time?

16:25.260 --> 16:28.060
Oh, you just know what, what's that guy's name?

16:28.060 --> 16:32.900
Oh, my teacher's name is, uh, uh, Benji Krinklehoff.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.460
Uh, no relation.

16:34.460 --> 16:38.300
Oh, you know, there's so many Krinklehoff's in contention.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.860
It's a common contention name.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.580
You know, old Benji just hates me.

16:41.580 --> 16:42.580
He just has it out for me.

16:42.580 --> 16:43.580
Oh yeah.

16:43.580 --> 16:47.620
Plus I called him a fuck.

16:47.620 --> 16:55.020
You hear from down the hallway, you all ready for the woods tonight?

16:55.020 --> 17:01.420
I open up my like little sweater jacket thing and lining the inside is just a bunch of like

17:01.420 --> 17:02.700
a water dynamite.

17:02.700 --> 17:03.700
What's water dynamite?

17:03.700 --> 17:07.100
The little red things that you can throw in water and they'll still explode under water.

17:07.100 --> 17:11.700
Oh, they're kind of like M-80s, but they're like waterproof M-80s.

17:11.700 --> 17:16.180
Oh, you guys were, we were, we were at, we were going to do that.

17:16.220 --> 17:17.900
Uh, yeah, no, sure.

17:17.900 --> 17:18.900
Of course.

17:18.900 --> 17:19.900
Are you nervous?

17:19.900 --> 17:20.900
What do you mean?

17:20.900 --> 17:21.900
Yeah.

17:21.900 --> 17:22.900
You scared old man.

17:22.900 --> 17:27.300
I just, I thought maybe we were maybe skipping, but no, it's, it's cool, but let's do it.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.580
Well, you might not want to see, we're going to go back to my house before we go to the

17:30.580 --> 17:36.540
woods and I got some, I got something that I wouldn't even bring to school, that home

17:36.540 --> 17:39.780
that explodes.

17:39.780 --> 17:45.380
Is that a penis joke or no.

17:45.380 --> 17:48.540
It's fireworks or maybe something more.

17:48.540 --> 17:54.060
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'll have to talk to my mom and dad and you know, they've been riding

17:54.060 --> 17:58.220
me lately, but it is our last hurrah for this year.

17:58.220 --> 18:02.900
So, uh, my older brother said I could take his car out and we can drive all the way out

18:02.900 --> 18:03.900
there.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.740
He's going to be partying with his stupid girlfriend anyway.

18:05.740 --> 18:08.780
That probably won't fly with my mom, but I'll meet you guys there for sure.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.180
Well, you can just come over to my house.

18:11.180 --> 18:13.180
You don't have to tell your mom.

18:13.180 --> 18:14.820
I'm sorry guys.

18:14.820 --> 18:15.820
You know how they are.

18:15.820 --> 18:18.580
It's a sick 91 firebird.

18:18.580 --> 18:20.740
It's practically brand new, dude.

18:20.740 --> 18:25.780
Maybe next year I'll be able to ride it, but this year I've got to do what they say.

18:25.780 --> 18:26.780
All right.

18:26.780 --> 18:27.780
You're a fuck.

18:27.780 --> 18:28.780
Just like Mr. Krinklehoff.

18:28.780 --> 18:29.780
We'll see you out there.

18:29.780 --> 18:35.160
Cursing as he comes back into the room and Mr. Krinklehoff looks at the stuff that was

18:35.160 --> 18:40.420
on his desk that is now on the ground and he looks specifically at Jeremy Pettymore.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.620
You shouldn't have left the window open, man.

18:43.340 --> 18:45.580
Hey man, actually our school project, it's outside.

18:45.580 --> 18:48.020
We got to go out in them woods and gather some sticks and stuff.

18:48.020 --> 18:49.360
So I'll see you all around.

18:49.360 --> 18:55.300
It's for our biology class with, uh, and then Ash, Ash can't think of a biology teacher

18:55.300 --> 18:57.140
because he's not in biology this semester.

18:57.140 --> 18:59.220
It's for biology, right Ken?

18:59.220 --> 19:00.220
Right?

19:00.220 --> 19:02.940
Biology, Mr. Krinklehoff.

19:02.940 --> 19:03.940
That's what he was working on.

19:03.940 --> 19:04.940
You trust Ken, right?

19:04.940 --> 19:05.940
All right.

19:05.940 --> 19:08.340
Well, Ken, if you, if you say so, that's, that's fine.

19:08.340 --> 19:12.580
But sir, Jeremy, before you leave, you're going to be here with me tomorrow.

19:12.580 --> 19:13.580
The two.

19:13.580 --> 19:14.580
Okay.

19:14.580 --> 19:15.580
I'll look forward to it.

19:15.580 --> 19:16.580
Wait, no, tomorrow.

19:16.580 --> 19:17.580
Saturday.

19:17.580 --> 19:18.580
We have the, the big, uh, the big parade.

19:18.580 --> 19:19.580
Yeah.

19:19.580 --> 19:20.580
No, um, yeah.

19:20.580 --> 19:21.580
Monday.

19:21.580 --> 19:22.580
Okay.

19:22.580 --> 19:23.580
Yeah.

19:23.580 --> 19:24.580
Detention right here.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.580
Whole time.

19:25.580 --> 19:26.580
And you're going to work.

19:26.580 --> 19:27.580
Don't think you're not going to work.

19:27.580 --> 19:28.900
These two can't come in every single day and save you.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.980
I mean, Ken's got sport practice, you know, that's true on Mondays.

19:31.980 --> 19:32.980
That's when you do sport.

19:32.980 --> 19:33.980
I wouldn't miss it.

19:33.980 --> 19:34.980
You better not.

19:34.980 --> 19:37.700
You are the best at the whole, the whole team.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.700
Yeah.

19:38.700 --> 19:41.660
And in the school, perhaps even in the state, you're one of the best.

19:41.660 --> 19:44.820
I understand that a lot of people's hopes and dreams are pinned on me and it, uh, it's

19:44.820 --> 19:45.820
never lost on me.

19:45.820 --> 19:50.020
My dad said, you're the only reason that anyone would ever hear of contention.

19:50.020 --> 19:53.380
Uh, once you're a senior bringing us to the game, the big game.

19:53.380 --> 19:55.620
My dad always says, I'm going to put the family on the map.

19:55.620 --> 19:56.620
That's for sure.

19:56.620 --> 19:57.620
The whole town's counting on you.

19:57.620 --> 19:58.620
The Krinklehoff name.

19:58.620 --> 20:05.700
I, I know Ken that we're not technically blood related, but, uh, it would be really nice

20:05.700 --> 20:08.120
to have our name shining in lights.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.120
That's right.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.120
That's right.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.720
Benji you married into the Krinklehoff family and took your wife's last name, right?

20:13.720 --> 20:14.720
Yeah.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.720
And this is the nineties.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.720
So that's emasculating and strange.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.720
Just like you.

20:19.720 --> 20:20.720
Let's go boys.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.720
I think, well, what are you guys doing tonight?

20:22.720 --> 20:26.720
We're already out the door.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.440
Yep.

20:28.440 --> 20:34.800
And uh, as you guys are walking down the hallway, let's get a sense of, I'm sorry that even

20:34.800 --> 20:39.920
though we're acting, uh, I felt real animosity towards an authority figure.

20:39.920 --> 20:48.440
Like it's just our natural relationship.

20:48.440 --> 20:52.520
As you guys are walking down the hall, I think we've gotten a decent sense of who your characters

20:52.520 --> 20:56.520
are, but how do you walk down the high school hallway, each of you?

20:56.520 --> 20:57.520
I'm curious.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.640
Uh, I'm probably kind of leading the way up toward the front, maybe even a little further

21:01.640 --> 21:04.720
ahead than it would be to look like I was with these people.

21:04.720 --> 21:08.120
I've got a lighter, the lighter that I'm gonna use for fireworks later in my hand and I'm

21:08.120 --> 21:12.920
just running it down the lockers to make like a clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, sound.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.960
I'm just on my smartphone.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.600
I like that.

21:18.600 --> 21:25.500
It's the only thing that, my only rule is no smartphones.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
It's a school.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.080
It is 1994, right?

21:28.080 --> 21:29.080
Doesn't matter.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.280
25 years later, 25 years earlier.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.280
Yeah.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.280
Okay.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.280
Time.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.280
I don't care for it.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.280
Yeah.

21:38.280 --> 21:42.640
That's why I decided to, on our very first podcast venture, run a role playing game based

21:42.640 --> 21:45.200
around time travel.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.680
Like a fucking idiot.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.680
Wait.

21:47.680 --> 21:48.680
What?

21:48.680 --> 21:49.680
Yeah.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.120
That's fair.

21:51.160 --> 22:00.720
So, as you guys are walking down the hallway, you see one of the upperclassmen, oh hey guys,

22:00.720 --> 22:04.760
looking in his locker, putting his books up and stuff and he's like, what are you guys

22:04.760 --> 22:05.760
up to tonight?

22:05.760 --> 22:08.600
I mean, come on man, tonight's the night we go out in the woods.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.600
You know how we boys do.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.600
Oh yeah.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.000
I forgot that's your guys' thing, right?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.880
You guys go look for Madge or whatever?

22:13.880 --> 22:14.880
Yeah.

22:14.880 --> 22:15.880
That's our thing.

22:15.880 --> 22:16.880
It's out of the three of us.

22:16.880 --> 22:17.880
That's our thing.

22:17.880 --> 22:18.880
It's certainly a thing that we've-

22:18.880 --> 22:19.880
That's our thing.

22:19.880 --> 22:20.880
We've done.

22:21.640 --> 22:26.560
It's kept us together over all the years we kind of became different people, kind of started

22:26.560 --> 22:31.080
hanging out with the little different groups, but it's the one thing that keeps us tied

22:31.080 --> 22:32.080
together like glue.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.200
Well, are you guys going to find her this year or what?

22:34.200 --> 22:35.200
Yeah, man.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.200
I mean, that's always been the idea.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.200
I mean, that's the goal.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.200
We're going to find her.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.200
What are you doing tonight?

22:39.200 --> 22:40.200
Yeah.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.200
Yeah.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.200
We'll find her.

22:42.200 --> 22:50.800
Oh, I'm just going over to like, probably like the, you know, the, um, you know.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.720
Hey man.

22:52.720 --> 22:53.720
We'll have fun doing that.

22:53.720 --> 22:54.720
Are you on weed?

22:54.720 --> 22:55.720
Yeah.

22:55.720 --> 22:56.720
Don't tell anybody.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.720
Hey.

22:57.720 --> 22:58.720
That's not cool, man.

22:58.720 --> 23:08.600
Dare to resist drugs, alcohol, violence, resist drugs, alcohol, resistance, education.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.600
Yep.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.600
Yeah, sure.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
There we go.

23:11.600 --> 23:15.600
Yeah, it works, man.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.600
It's real.

23:16.600 --> 23:21.160
Brother, uh, as I said, if I ran into you to tell you that he's out and, uh, to get

23:21.160 --> 23:22.160
ahold of him.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.160
That's cool.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.160
I could use some.

23:24.160 --> 23:27.360
Oh, do you guys want, how should I, am I supposed to sell weed to freshmen?

23:27.360 --> 23:29.680
I'm, I, I'm, I'm good for now.

23:29.680 --> 23:33.880
Ken, Ken is suddenly pretending to like not be involved in the conversation.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.800
He's kind of like turned around and just maybe like kicking the locker across the hall.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.800
Hey Ken.

23:38.800 --> 23:39.800
Ash, Ash.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.840
Dude, we got to be on our toes tonight.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.120
He's kind of waving and walking down the hall a little further now.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.120
It's true.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.120
We gotta, we gotta be.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.120
Okay.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.320
Well, Cleve Moore, we gotta, we gotta get on our way.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.320
I'll see you later.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.320
Yes.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.320
All right.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.320
Goodbye, Eduardo.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.320
You know, I prefer it when you call me Eduardo.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.880
It's well, it's the name I've chosen.

23:57.880 --> 23:58.880
Yeah.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.840
I just like to call people by their last names sometimes.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.840
All right.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.480
Well, it's rude, but I like you anyway.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.480
Okay.

24:05.480 --> 24:06.480
Bye Eduardo.

24:06.480 --> 24:07.480
Thank you.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.480
That guy's exhausting.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.640
It's like talking to a fucking turtle.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.640
It's like talking to Eeyore.

24:12.640 --> 24:13.640
I would, I don't know.

24:13.640 --> 24:17.560
That guy gets high every day and I personally as Jeremy Pettimore can not relate to that.

24:17.560 --> 24:21.200
And we skip on down the hallway.

24:21.200 --> 24:26.720
Ash and I arm in arm and we're like, what are, we're like reaching out for Ken.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.720
What is the contention?

24:27.720 --> 24:28.720
Ken, skip with us.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.400
What is the contention high school mascot?

24:30.400 --> 24:32.120
Ooh, uh, the octopi.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.600
Did we ever, was it, is that cannon?

24:33.600 --> 24:34.600
I think it's something weird.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.120
I doubt you said it.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.120
Octopus isn't bad.

24:37.120 --> 24:41.040
It's a Silas Cole K through 12 is the name of the school.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.440
And what was his industry besides orphans?

24:44.440 --> 24:45.600
It could be miners.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.600
The miners.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
100% the miners.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.600
Yeah.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.600
We know how much Zach likes that.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.600
The 40 miners.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.600
Stop making that joke.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
You're not.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Oh, thank you.

24:53.600 --> 24:58.180
I didn't even get it because that's not how my mind works.

24:58.180 --> 25:00.240
Your head was swirling with lore.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.240
That's exactly right.

25:01.240 --> 25:04.440
I was like, I do like mines.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.440
Lore is the name of a young boy he's had his eye on.

25:07.880 --> 25:11.880
It's short for Lauren, spelled like the boy name.

25:11.880 --> 25:12.880
Okay.

25:12.880 --> 25:13.880
All right.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.880
Well.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.880
Yeah.

25:15.880 --> 25:21.040
On the way out, the mascot is a guy with one of those hard hats on with the light and he's

25:21.040 --> 25:24.860
got the pickaxe in one hand and he's holding out his other and I jump up and I smack his

25:24.860 --> 25:26.200
hand to give him a high five.

25:26.200 --> 25:29.080
Except it's a huge, like it's a giant mascot head.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.560
Oh, that's fun.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.680
Like one of the cows.

25:31.680 --> 25:36.960
Like it's an oversized head mascot head of a minor dude and he's just like, he's got

25:36.960 --> 25:38.380
a little like foam hand.

25:38.380 --> 25:42.800
It's important that the head is massive with a giant minor head on it.

25:42.800 --> 25:43.800
Yeah.

25:43.800 --> 25:44.800
That's very fun.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.800
Yeah.

25:45.800 --> 25:49.240
I jump up and give him a little high five for good luck for the team, for Ken and for

25:49.240 --> 25:50.360
tonight.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.360
He topples over.

25:51.360 --> 25:55.640
He's just too top heavy and you guys head off.

26:06.960 --> 26:13.760
All right, Luke, Ash Hornbeam, horn beam.

26:13.760 --> 26:14.760
What is it?

26:14.760 --> 26:15.760
Horn beam.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.760
Horn beam.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.760
That's fun.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.040
H O R N B E A M. Horn beam.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.440
And Thomas, your character is Jeremy Pettymore.

26:22.440 --> 26:25.720
I believe we already know how to spell that.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.280
A lot of people don't.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.280
Ash you.

26:28.280 --> 26:29.280
It's not with a Y.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.280
It's with an I.

26:30.280 --> 26:34.880
Ash, you mentioned that you have a car for the evening, I believe.

26:34.880 --> 26:35.880
I do.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.880
It's my older brother's car.

26:37.880 --> 26:43.360
I think I said a 91 Firebird, which is an ugly car.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.360
What color is it?

26:44.360 --> 26:49.040
That weird like gold color from the 90s.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.480
Very cool.

26:50.480 --> 26:56.360
So as you guys are making your way out to the woods of contention for this evening,

26:56.360 --> 27:00.560
you're driving in this 91 Firebird.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.320
Luke, how fast do you drive in?

27:03.320 --> 27:04.320
How fast is Ash driving?

27:04.320 --> 27:06.560
Am I on a main road or the dirt road?

27:06.560 --> 27:07.560
It's a main road.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.560
It's like a country road probably, yeah.

27:09.560 --> 27:10.560
Two lane.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.560
Okay.

27:11.560 --> 27:12.560
I'm going the speed.

27:12.560 --> 27:17.800
I'm going like probably 10 over till we get to the dirt road and then just pedal to the

27:17.800 --> 27:18.800
metal.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.800
All right.

27:19.800 --> 27:25.780
So as soon as you turn on the dirt road to the contention woods, you put the pedal to

27:25.780 --> 27:26.780
the metal.

27:26.780 --> 27:31.800
I just fishtail into the dirt road and just dust is flying out.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.440
I reach over and turn the tape deck up and Copperhead Road is blessed.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.960
Oh, hell yeah.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.580
Go ahead and roll a drive check for me.

27:40.580 --> 27:43.440
When he does that, I'm like, dude, don't bust the speakers.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.560
And then I look at him and laugh.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.120
I'm like, it's my brother's car.

27:46.120 --> 27:51.640
And as you laugh, you look back at the road and you see a squirrel has run out directly

27:51.640 --> 27:53.440
in your wheels path.

27:53.440 --> 27:56.480
I rolled a 44 on a 50.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.400
Oh, okay.

27:58.400 --> 28:02.400
My brother lets me drive his car a lot.

28:02.400 --> 28:08.560
And you are very good at fishtailing and whipping the back end of this Firebird around.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.840
And as soon as you see it, you...

28:10.840 --> 28:13.620
So I'm still fishtailing and I see it.

28:13.620 --> 28:18.680
So I kind of turn the wheel to where the car kind of like goes sideways on the road, goes

28:18.680 --> 28:20.440
underneath the car.

28:20.440 --> 28:25.560
I like start driving backwards and flip it around and basically do a 360 and keep going

28:25.560 --> 28:26.560
straight.

28:26.720 --> 28:34.240
The squirrel looks at you with these massive cartoonish eyes before it dips off into the

28:34.240 --> 28:35.240
woods.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.480
When it's staring at me, I do a finger gun and wink.

28:37.480 --> 28:41.880
Jeremy's like, what the hell, man, are you trying to get me killed over a squirrel?

28:41.880 --> 28:44.400
Hey man, they're people too.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.400
And you guys pull in...

28:45.400 --> 28:47.180
It's gotta be popular to everybody, huh?

28:47.180 --> 28:48.960
You know, it works.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.920
It actually works out really well that you rolled a crit success on your first roll as

28:52.920 --> 28:53.920
Ash Hornbeam.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.480
Bean, I keep fucking this up.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.480
Hornbeam.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.480
Hornbeam.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.360
I want to say bean.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.360
Hornbeam.

29:01.360 --> 29:06.480
Fucking weird offshoot of the beans.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.480
Yeah, exactly.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.480
Yes.

29:08.480 --> 29:13.520
Well, we don't really speak with the Hornbeam cousins, but...

29:13.520 --> 29:18.640
So you guys pull into this parking lot, it's a gravel parking lot for the contention woods.

29:18.640 --> 29:25.160
And there are two cars in the parking lot currently, one of which has a notice that

29:25.160 --> 29:32.520
is taped up on the driver's side window and the other has a boot on the back left wheel.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.820
What does the notice say on the car?

29:34.820 --> 29:41.920
Move your car or we'll put a boot on it.

29:41.920 --> 29:49.320
And you guys see that there is a little shack at the entrance, which you know is typically

29:49.320 --> 29:54.320
unoccupied and it is like the entrance to the woods.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.160
So it's where the trailhead is.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.760
Is it like a park ranger shack thing?

29:58.760 --> 29:59.760
Exactly.

29:59.760 --> 30:08.600
Also, there in the parking lot right next to it, next to this little shack, is a SUV,

30:08.600 --> 30:14.240
like a Bronco, let's go with a Ford Bronco, that has got a lift kit on it.

30:14.240 --> 30:19.140
I want to reach back into the back seat, or like into the console of the car, get out

30:19.140 --> 30:26.400
a little piece of paper, write, please don't boot my car, ash horn beam, and put it underneath

30:26.400 --> 30:27.400
the windshield wiper.

30:27.400 --> 30:31.620
That's going to be crazy when they find our bodies.

30:31.620 --> 30:32.900
You said like a Bronco though?

30:32.900 --> 30:33.900
Yeah.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.260
Is there any notice or boot on that?

30:35.260 --> 30:36.260
No.

30:36.260 --> 30:37.260
So fresh.

30:37.260 --> 30:38.740
Does it look like the ranger's car?

30:38.740 --> 30:39.740
It does.

30:39.740 --> 30:40.740
Okay.

30:40.740 --> 30:50.340
To just in general shitheadery and hooliganism and anger at my dad, I want to see if those

30:50.340 --> 30:51.340
cars are unlocked.

30:51.340 --> 30:52.340
Absolutely.

30:52.340 --> 30:53.640
Do some petty theft from them.

30:53.640 --> 30:58.800
You guys were extremely mature police officers, so I'm sure making you a freshman in high

30:58.800 --> 31:00.500
school won't-

31:00.500 --> 31:06.800
My new eyes specifically was like, yeah, this guy's got a huge chip on his shoulder.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.040
Is it visible?

31:08.040 --> 31:10.540
Seems like it might be visible.

31:10.540 --> 31:16.100
And go ahead and roll a search check first.

31:16.100 --> 31:20.900
Ooh, critical success, 11.

31:20.900 --> 31:30.300
They are both unlocked, and in the first one you find almost nothing that has been cleaned

31:30.300 --> 31:32.300
out perhaps previously by someone else.

31:32.300 --> 31:36.060
Is there any like identifiable, like can we find out who the car belongs to?

31:36.060 --> 31:42.780
It's so clean inside that it looks like someone came in and took everything out of it already.

31:42.780 --> 31:43.780
That's kind of weird.

31:43.780 --> 31:44.780
That is kind of weird.

31:44.780 --> 31:54.900
And the other one you find a bunch of camping equipment, and there is in the console a title

31:54.900 --> 32:02.380
for the vehicle that belongs to one Stuart Feldman.

32:02.380 --> 32:03.380
Do we know who that is?

32:03.380 --> 32:04.380
No.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.660
Is it registered in contention, or somewhere else?

32:06.660 --> 32:08.980
It is registered in the city.

32:08.980 --> 32:12.260
We didn't bring any camping stuff, should we just take that?

32:12.260 --> 32:13.660
We can return it later.

32:13.660 --> 32:17.900
Yeah, Stuart hasn't been around in a while, so it's a real nice tent.

32:17.900 --> 32:20.340
It's the one with the notice on it.

32:20.340 --> 32:21.340
What do you think?

32:21.340 --> 32:22.340
We can always just bring it back.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.340
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.340
I like that idea.

32:24.340 --> 32:26.720
Do we find any liquor or anything?

32:26.720 --> 32:30.220
You find liquor and a pistol with ammunition.

32:30.220 --> 32:31.220
Oh shit.

32:31.220 --> 32:33.220
Oh fuck, dude.

32:33.220 --> 32:34.580
That's a badass piece.

32:34.580 --> 32:42.940
Ash gets kind of nervous, but I have all those fireworks in my jacket, and then I found a

32:42.940 --> 32:46.700
stick of dynamite at my grandpa's house, so I brought that with me.

32:46.700 --> 32:50.100
Well, okay, we're gonna shoot the stick of dynamite later.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.220
I don't want to touch the gun.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.460
I checked the gun to see if it's loaded.

32:53.460 --> 32:54.460
It is loaded.

32:54.460 --> 32:55.940
Holy crap, this is awesome.

32:55.940 --> 32:58.460
I'm gonna grab the tent and a sleeping bag.

32:58.460 --> 32:59.460
Sure.

32:59.460 --> 33:02.260
Can I peek into the shack to see if the ranger's in there?

33:02.300 --> 33:09.300
Yeah, and as you walk up to it and peek in, you do see there is an elderly man sitting

33:09.300 --> 33:10.740
on a stool.

33:10.740 --> 33:16.900
It's got one of those open-air windows that he would greet you from, basically, and he

33:16.900 --> 33:19.660
was asleep until you walked up.

33:19.660 --> 33:20.660
Fuck.

33:20.660 --> 33:21.660
And this is the ranger?

33:21.660 --> 33:23.780
This is the ranger, but as soon as you poke your head in-

33:23.780 --> 33:26.580
He's got a sweet fucking ride for such an old man.

33:26.580 --> 33:27.580
I know.

33:27.580 --> 33:28.580
He kind of-

33:28.580 --> 33:30.580
Hello there.

33:30.900 --> 33:37.060
Hi, young boys, what are you doing tonight in these woods of contention?

33:37.060 --> 33:40.020
Well, hey Jeb, we're here for our yearly camping trip.

33:40.020 --> 33:48.420
So you misread the situation because this is not the normal for a stranger of contention,

33:48.420 --> 33:53.780
and you see that he's actually wearing a uniform that is issued by the state, and he says,

33:53.780 --> 34:02.660
Well, it says right here, Woodrow, you can call me Buzz, as that is my nickname, and-

34:02.660 --> 34:04.260
Wait, didn't you just say his name was Jeb?

34:04.260 --> 34:05.260
No, you did.

34:05.260 --> 34:08.860
I know, but that was- I didn't make that up, did I?

34:08.860 --> 34:09.860
I think so.

34:09.860 --> 34:10.860
I think you did.

34:10.860 --> 34:11.860
I thought I heard it.

34:11.860 --> 34:13.580
You're just so good at improv that you just-

34:13.580 --> 34:17.700
Well, and you're so bad at it.

34:17.700 --> 34:20.620
And looking around, you see that he's got a cane.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.020
You've misread the situation.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.460
You've misread the situation, sir.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.140
No, but-

34:25.140 --> 34:31.460
I've already written down this man's name, and he's got a cane next to him, and you would

34:31.460 --> 34:36.660
see looking around the little shack, there are clipboards all hanging on the wall and

34:36.660 --> 34:44.180
at this desk, and there are fire extinguishers, axes, machetes, flashlights, hand sanitizer,

34:44.180 --> 34:47.780
and a first aid kit, and a bunch of other stuff like that.

34:47.780 --> 34:54.780
And you do see there is a board behind him with pictures and pieces of paper thumbtacked

34:54.780 --> 35:00.340
into the board, like a bulletin board kind of thing, and he says, I'm going to need to

35:00.340 --> 35:07.420
take down some of your information, as you know, all these people been going missing

35:07.420 --> 35:13.300
around here in contention, so we just need to make sure that we have all of the information

35:13.300 --> 35:19.620
necessary for any people who are coming into the woods, that way we have the information.

35:19.620 --> 35:21.300
Oh, sorry, I didn't hear you there.

35:21.300 --> 35:25.060
Did you ever consider that a goo monster was taking them to the past?

35:25.060 --> 35:26.500
Not even a little bit, son.

35:26.500 --> 35:27.500
Are you high right now?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.220
No, I was just fucking around with you.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.900
Hey, what happened to Jeb, the normal guy?

35:30.900 --> 35:34.940
Well, and he points back at the board, and there's a picture of Jeb.

35:34.940 --> 35:41.140
It's a Polaroid, and there's a piece of paper behind each Polaroid, and he says, we're going

35:41.140 --> 35:47.140
to need to take a couple pictures of you both and get some information as well, son,

35:47.140 --> 35:48.140
what's your name?

35:48.140 --> 35:51.660
And he holds a Polaroid up to you and snaps a picture.

35:51.660 --> 35:57.300
It's a picture of me blinking in the flash, and then I'm like, Jeremy Pettymore?

35:57.300 --> 36:02.860
Jeremy Pettymore, and what is your business in the woods this evening?

36:02.860 --> 36:04.700
We're just going camping.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.060
Okay.

36:06.060 --> 36:11.580
Did you bring along anything with you aside from normal camping gear?

36:11.580 --> 36:16.540
Just a keen sense of imagination and wonder and hope for the world and the future, despite

36:16.540 --> 36:21.700
the circumstances I come from personally in my broken home, I still got a lot, I think,

36:21.700 --> 36:22.700
to live for.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.500
That is very nice to hear.

36:25.500 --> 36:26.500
I like that.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.100
I like you.

36:28.100 --> 36:34.340
And he writes all that information down, and then he looks up and he says, one last question.

36:34.340 --> 36:40.740
If you were to be scared and run away in some place, where might we find you if you

36:40.740 --> 36:41.900
were hiding?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.380
Probably the old caves.

36:43.380 --> 36:45.140
Probably the old caves indeed.

36:45.140 --> 36:49.900
And then he looks over at Ash and he says, oh, I like the jib of your cut, and he takes

36:49.900 --> 36:50.900
a picture of you.

36:50.900 --> 36:54.260
And it's me smiling, giving thumbs up.

36:54.260 --> 36:56.580
And it is an extremely good picture.

36:56.580 --> 36:59.180
You might be the most photogenic person in contention.

36:59.180 --> 37:01.340
He says, what's your name there, sonny?

37:01.340 --> 37:02.340
Hornbeam.

37:02.340 --> 37:03.340
Ash Hornbeam.

37:03.340 --> 37:04.340
Ash, Hornbeam.

37:04.340 --> 37:06.340
All righty.

37:06.340 --> 37:09.580
And what are you up to tonight in the woods?

37:09.580 --> 37:15.220
Well, we take this trip every year, probably meeting a friend down there, probably going

37:15.220 --> 37:20.300
to come down later, but me and this guy and another buddy, every year we come down here

37:20.300 --> 37:23.060
and we, you know, just boys' night in the woods.

37:23.060 --> 37:24.180
Yes, sir.

37:24.180 --> 37:25.900
We've done it four years running.

37:25.900 --> 37:26.940
Four years running.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.140
You must be very close friends.

37:29.140 --> 37:30.300
Oh, yeah.

37:30.300 --> 37:31.420
The closest.

37:31.420 --> 37:35.980
And did you bring anything with you this evening, Mr. Hornbeam?

37:35.980 --> 37:38.540
That is not traditional camping equipment.

37:38.540 --> 37:41.740
Just the tent and this sleeping bag.

37:41.740 --> 37:44.060
But I see there's a first aid kit in there.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.060
Could we borrow that?

37:45.060 --> 37:46.940
Yeah, well, of course you can.

37:46.940 --> 37:52.580
I normally like to keep it here with me for people who may need it later.

37:52.580 --> 37:54.180
They come here looking for it.

37:54.180 --> 37:58.700
It's like if your kid goes missing in the grocery store, you don't want them to go looking

37:58.700 --> 37:59.780
about for you.

37:59.780 --> 38:03.100
You want them to stay as close to you as possible.

38:03.100 --> 38:10.860
I remember one time my grandchild Poppy, he went missing in the grocery store and we never

38:10.860 --> 38:11.860
found him.

38:11.860 --> 38:15.300
Did you ever consider that a goo monster was taking him back to the past?

38:15.300 --> 38:19.540
You have a funny sensibility about you and I enjoy it thoroughly.

38:19.540 --> 38:24.780
Well, sometimes your first aid kit grows up and you just got to let it go on its own.

38:25.380 --> 38:27.380
Same with the...

38:27.380 --> 38:30.380
Sometimes our normal campsite's a little overgrown.

38:30.380 --> 38:35.020
What about maybe, could we have one of those machetes to maybe cut down brush and whatnot?

38:35.020 --> 38:40.420
Well, you're going to need to roll a persuade check to get one of those.

38:40.420 --> 38:41.860
They're in alphabetical order.

38:41.860 --> 38:44.860
I know.

38:44.860 --> 38:46.660
That only helps if you can read.

38:46.660 --> 38:48.700
That's a fail.

38:49.100 --> 38:56.700
Well, you know, Sonny, I like to keep this one here just in case if there's any grass

38:56.700 --> 38:58.940
that grows too quick around here.

38:58.940 --> 38:59.940
You know what I mean?

38:59.940 --> 39:00.940
I know what you mean.

39:00.940 --> 39:04.300
Unlike the first aid kit, you're going to keep it because you're not entirely bad at

39:04.300 --> 39:05.300
your job.

39:05.300 --> 39:06.300
Exactly.

39:06.300 --> 39:12.340
I figure when all goes to chaos and we're desperately hunting, searching for our lives,

39:12.340 --> 39:13.700
if that were to happen.

39:13.700 --> 39:14.700
I hope not.

39:14.700 --> 39:18.860
You know, I figure we can just loot this place silly once all goes to hell and we find this

39:18.860 --> 39:20.460
guy with his head ripped off or something.

39:20.460 --> 39:21.460
I doubt it.

39:21.460 --> 39:28.060
And I was like, very strong and I've got my head on my shoulders tight.

39:28.060 --> 39:34.580
My mom always said that if my head wasn't attached to my shoulders, I wouldn't be alive.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.740
What else does your mama say?

39:35.740 --> 39:37.460
Does she ever tell you anything else?

39:37.460 --> 39:42.940
Yeah, she once told me that if you've got two birds, then why are you looking in bushes?

39:42.940 --> 39:43.940
Why don't you tell me some more?

39:43.940 --> 39:47.780
And as he does, I want to kind of like sneak around and try to maybe steal some of that

39:47.780 --> 39:48.780
shit.

39:48.780 --> 39:52.580
In order to help him, I want to pull a slingshot out, light one of my fireworks and kind of

39:52.580 --> 39:56.420
fling it out past to create a distraction.

39:56.420 --> 40:00.660
That is some good old fashioned like childhood shenanigans.

40:00.660 --> 40:03.780
I would like you both to roll stealth for me.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.540
Can I roll pranks for mine?

40:05.540 --> 40:06.540
Okay.

40:06.540 --> 40:07.540
So Luke.

40:07.540 --> 40:08.540
Yeah.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.540
Dude, yes.

40:09.860 --> 40:12.980
Luke made a skill under craft, right?

40:12.980 --> 40:13.980
Yeah.

40:13.980 --> 40:14.980
Yeah.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.100
And you can craft pranks.

40:16.100 --> 40:18.140
So that I'm crafting a prank right now.

40:18.140 --> 40:19.140
Okay.

40:19.140 --> 40:24.500
So first off, you're going to roll the prank first and if you succeed, then it'll give

40:24.500 --> 40:28.500
Thomas a boost to his stealth roll.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.680
That is a 46 on a 50.

40:30.680 --> 40:33.720
I would also like to use criminology instead of stealth.

40:33.720 --> 40:34.720
You absolutely can.

40:34.720 --> 40:41.040
As a petty more child, like my mom and dad are just addicts and I come from a bad home,

40:41.040 --> 40:46.480
but the uncles that I've been fostered out to occasionally are all quite criminal and

40:46.480 --> 40:48.640
they're the only people I have to look up to.

40:48.640 --> 40:49.880
All right.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.480
So I've kind of thing or two.

40:51.480 --> 40:55.900
Well, I'll give you a plus 40 on your criminology check here.

40:55.900 --> 40:59.720
That would, that takes me up to a 70 and I roll a four.

40:59.720 --> 41:00.720
Congratulations.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.120
Do you guys want to describe what happened?

41:02.120 --> 41:03.120
What all was in here again?

41:03.120 --> 41:04.800
A lot of clipboards.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.800
We've got the bulletin board with the pictures and the information.

41:07.800 --> 41:14.880
We've got fire extinguishers, axes, machetes, flashlights, hand sanitizer, and a first aid

41:14.880 --> 41:17.720
kit that is already in Ash's hands.

41:17.720 --> 41:22.520
I have stuffed that into the sleeping bag, which I will make into a regular bag until

41:22.520 --> 41:23.520
I sleep in it.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.080
I would like to focus on the clipboards.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.080
I'm kidding.

41:27.080 --> 41:31.880
I'm going to grab a fire extinguisher and then a machete for everybody.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.020
Does he leave?

41:33.020 --> 41:37.260
Does he go check out the relatively big pop in the sky behind the shack?

41:37.260 --> 41:38.260
Yeah.

41:38.260 --> 41:44.020
So there's a, uh, you pull out a slingshot and an M80 and I light the fuse and I sneak

41:44.020 --> 41:50.580
out of the view of the little window and like fired up probably 20 feet past the shack.

41:50.580 --> 41:52.420
So he has to leave to go check it out.

41:52.420 --> 41:55.380
He goes, Oh my goodness.

41:55.380 --> 41:59.740
And you hear it and he's like, Oh, Oh no.

41:59.740 --> 42:04.340
I, I, Oh, I'm going to be right back boys.

42:04.340 --> 42:05.980
I need to take care of something.

42:05.980 --> 42:11.380
And he stands up and uses his cane to walk out of this little shack and he heads over

42:11.380 --> 42:15.640
to the restrooms that are attached to the shack.

42:15.640 --> 42:19.660
So over the little counter, like through the window where you, where he would talk to people,

42:19.660 --> 42:25.200
you just see like machetes and the fire extinguisher and flashlights all just like being cartoonishly

42:25.200 --> 42:26.420
tossed out to Keith.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.900
And I just catch them all in my sleeping bag.

42:28.900 --> 42:29.900
Perfect.

42:29.900 --> 42:30.900
Keith.

42:30.900 --> 42:31.900
Uh, ash.

42:31.900 --> 42:32.900
Ash.

42:32.900 --> 42:33.900
Ash.

42:33.900 --> 42:34.900
That's going to be fun.

42:34.900 --> 42:35.900
So did we pretty much get everything?

42:35.900 --> 42:38.580
Maybe one fire extinguisher just in case two of everything.

42:38.580 --> 42:43.260
Two machetes, two axes, a fire extinguisher, three flashlights if we can get them.

42:43.260 --> 42:44.260
Yeah, for sure.

42:44.260 --> 42:47.180
Uh, and then hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer.

42:47.180 --> 42:48.820
And then I kind of want to take a look at the board.

42:48.820 --> 42:54.740
So looking at the board, you see lots of different types of people from contention.

42:54.740 --> 42:59.980
We recognize many of them because this is an extremely small town and you would know

42:59.980 --> 43:08.420
that a lot of people have been going missing over the past month and the contention police

43:08.420 --> 43:13.340
force is seemingly doing very little about it.

43:13.340 --> 43:15.180
They're not even really talking about it.

43:15.180 --> 43:19.100
Well they just assume it's contention realm spring where everybody goes out to the city

43:19.100 --> 43:24.300
for six months and you know, lives a sinful liberal life.

43:24.300 --> 43:26.220
Yeah, exactly.

43:26.220 --> 43:27.220
Learns about the world.

43:27.220 --> 43:29.060
So how many people are missing?

43:29.060 --> 43:30.060
18.

43:30.060 --> 43:31.060
Holy shit.

43:31.060 --> 43:33.580
Is there anybody I don't recognize or anybody who really stands out?

43:33.580 --> 43:39.380
Yeah, there is a, there's one guy who is named Stuart.

43:39.380 --> 43:40.540
What did I call that guy?

43:40.540 --> 43:41.780
Stuart Feldman.

43:41.780 --> 43:52.420
Stuart Feldman is a bald guy with an extremely thick jaw line and he seems to be upper middle

43:52.420 --> 43:59.980
aged but in incredible shape and looking at his information, he said that he was out

43:59.980 --> 44:06.500
in the woods on business and he is a Brit.

44:06.500 --> 44:07.500
It is noted.

44:07.500 --> 44:11.140
This is kind of, this is kind of weird here, Ash, right here looking for madge.

44:11.140 --> 44:16.340
I think we might've stumbled on some, some kind of a young adult coming of age bonding

44:16.340 --> 44:17.340
mystery.

44:17.340 --> 44:18.340
I agree.

44:18.340 --> 44:21.020
What's a, what's a British guy doing in contention?

44:21.020 --> 44:22.700
I don't even know what that is.

44:22.700 --> 44:28.460
I that's because you are always in detention and not doing your homework.

44:28.460 --> 44:32.660
Hey, you know, but Hey, I didn't know enough about geography than I can point it out on

44:32.660 --> 44:33.660
a map.

44:33.660 --> 44:34.820
I can't tell you why he's here though.

44:34.820 --> 44:37.900
That's like a three or four hour drive from England.

44:37.900 --> 44:38.900
Here's a little map.

44:38.900 --> 44:40.460
Here's a globe sitting on his desk.

44:40.460 --> 44:41.760
Could you point to that?

44:41.760 --> 44:44.340
And I point to Ireland.

44:44.340 --> 44:46.640
That's pretty close.

44:46.640 --> 44:50.140
If you were playing Keith, that would have been like an absolute win.

44:50.140 --> 44:51.140
Yeah.

44:51.140 --> 44:55.660
Uh, and then the last, the last thing I want to look for, um, are the keys to the Bronco.

44:55.660 --> 44:56.660
Okay.

44:56.660 --> 44:57.860
Do I see those in here anywhere?

44:57.860 --> 45:01.940
Uh, roll another search check for me there.

45:01.940 --> 45:04.620
17 on a 50.

45:04.620 --> 45:05.620
You do.

45:05.620 --> 45:11.460
You see the keys to the Bronco and they are attached to the keys for this shack seemingly.

45:11.460 --> 45:13.460
I'm going to go ahead and pocket all of those.

45:13.460 --> 45:14.460
Are there any more keys?

45:14.460 --> 45:15.460
Nope.

45:15.460 --> 45:16.460
Okay.

45:16.460 --> 45:20.340
I'm a little, uh, kind of like nervous, but I don't say anything about it.

45:20.340 --> 45:21.340
Hey, come on man.

45:21.340 --> 45:22.340
It's a role playing game.

45:22.340 --> 45:23.980
It's just, that's what I'm doing.

45:23.980 --> 45:26.980
We just thieve in stealth.

45:26.980 --> 45:35.400
The door opens to the bathroom and you guys hide all of your stolen items and buzz comes

45:35.400 --> 45:37.100
back and he says, yeah.

45:37.100 --> 45:39.260
And one more question there.

45:39.260 --> 45:44.700
If you were to go missing and running off somewhere, where would you be hiding?

45:44.700 --> 45:45.700
Ash?

45:45.940 --> 45:47.540
I'd be with, uh, with my friends.

45:47.540 --> 45:48.860
So I assumed the caves.

45:48.860 --> 45:49.860
Yeah.

45:49.860 --> 45:52.620
I mean, that's where we, that's where he said he'd be.

45:52.620 --> 45:54.260
That's where I'd go hiding.

45:54.260 --> 45:55.260
All right.

45:55.260 --> 46:00.340
And I'm not too familiar with these caves, but they are, where are they?

46:00.340 --> 46:05.020
They're in the far west of, yeah, in the, in the, in the northwest corner of the park

46:05.020 --> 46:06.020
on the globe.

46:06.020 --> 46:08.020
I point to contention.

46:08.020 --> 46:09.340
I'm like, they're right here.

46:09.340 --> 46:10.340
I hit there.

46:10.340 --> 46:11.340
Yeah.

46:11.340 --> 46:12.340
See?

46:12.340 --> 46:13.340
Okay.

46:13.340 --> 46:14.340
All right.

46:14.660 --> 46:15.660
You're learning.

46:15.660 --> 46:16.660
Yeah.

46:16.660 --> 46:21.940
He writes it all down and then he sticks your guys's pictures up on the board along with

46:21.940 --> 46:24.340
the information behind them.

46:24.340 --> 46:26.700
And he says, all right there.

46:26.700 --> 46:33.940
Well, welcome once again to these here fine woods of contention and be safe out there.

46:33.940 --> 46:38.740
If you find any one of these people and he like points at all the people whose pictures

46:38.740 --> 46:43.280
are now around your picture, you know, let us know.

46:43.280 --> 46:47.280
Can you take a, can you take a picture of those pictures and give it to us?

46:47.280 --> 46:49.480
So we might have a reference.

46:49.480 --> 46:54.400
I can absolutely spare one, a single Polaroid, a single Polaroid.

46:54.400 --> 47:02.320
I'll just have tiny little pictures we can't fucking see on it.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.240
I got, I got, we got young eyes.

47:04.240 --> 47:05.240
Is it yet?

47:05.240 --> 47:06.240
Is that Stu?

47:06.240 --> 47:07.240
I think so.

47:07.240 --> 47:12.000
Hey, sometimes I'm doing real good about pretending to be a child and sometimes I'm out, but that's

47:12.000 --> 47:19.760
cause I'm going through puberty and you guys head off to your normal camping spot.

47:19.760 --> 47:20.760
I would assume.

47:20.760 --> 47:25.920
Is it like a drivable trail down to there or is it walking on like, it's so we know

47:25.920 --> 47:31.960
that it is a trail that can handle a four wheeler and it is technically wide enough

47:31.960 --> 47:37.000
to handle a vehicle as well, but it's not, you're not supposed to, yeah, we'll leave

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
the car here.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Right.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
What do you think Jeremy?

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Oh yeah.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.920
We already stole all this shit.

47:42.920 --> 47:48.000
We don't want to like attract more attention by just driving over the, the parking barrier.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.600
My brother would kill me if we fucked up his beautiful car.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.560
Your brother's going to kill you one of these days anyway.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
He's a fucking maniac.

47:53.560 --> 47:54.560
I know.

47:54.560 --> 47:57.160
But uh, well he lets me borrow his car, so yeah, he's pretty cool.

47:57.160 --> 47:58.160
For now.

47:58.160 --> 48:03.720
Uh, Hey also look, look, look at what we got from, from the car and I, I waved the little

48:03.720 --> 48:04.720
liquor flask.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.480
You know what I'm saying?

48:06.480 --> 48:07.480
Yeah.

48:07.480 --> 48:08.560
I flashed the flask at him.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.040
It's a massive flask.

48:10.080 --> 48:11.560
It holds like half a fifth.

48:11.560 --> 48:18.680
Oh, I look at him and I look at him and I kind of smile and I'm like, well, and out

48:18.680 --> 48:25.400
of my back pocket, I pull out a great mad dog 2020 and I'm like, I'm like, we're prepared.

48:25.400 --> 48:27.040
Is tonight the night we become men?

48:27.040 --> 48:28.040
I think so.

48:28.040 --> 48:29.040
I think it is.

48:40.040 --> 48:51.440
So as Ash and Jeremy are heading down the trail, who's got a better survival skill between

48:51.440 --> 48:52.440
the two of you?

48:52.440 --> 48:53.440
I have a 30.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.440
Fuck.

48:54.440 --> 49:00.040
I thought we were still playing shit back and I was like, I've never heard this at all.

49:00.040 --> 49:03.160
It's like, this is insane.

49:03.160 --> 49:07.920
The look on your face when you, your eyes were like bugging out of your head.

49:07.920 --> 49:08.920
Legit.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Why does he look like that?

49:13.560 --> 49:17.560
He repeated the same words for the start of it and I was like, okay, we're listening back.

49:17.560 --> 49:18.560
Shit.

49:18.560 --> 49:19.560
Okay.

49:21.560 --> 49:22.560
That was spooky.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.560
I've got a 50.

49:24.560 --> 49:28.560
Okay, Thomas, go ahead and roll a survival check for me.

49:28.560 --> 49:29.560
19.

49:29.560 --> 49:30.560
Congratulations.

49:30.560 --> 49:36.680
You notice as you're walking out there, you've been in these woods a fair amount of times

49:37.440 --> 49:46.920
and you see that there are tracks on this trail and you are pretty positive.

49:46.920 --> 49:53.000
It looks like a car, some sort of vehicle and a smaller vehicle like a four wheeler

49:53.000 --> 49:56.120
have both driven down this trail.

49:56.120 --> 49:57.360
Here's something weird, man.

49:57.360 --> 50:02.720
Looks like both a car or some kind of large vehicle and a four wheeler both driven down

50:02.720 --> 50:03.720
here recently.

50:03.760 --> 50:05.960
When I look down, I'm like, oh yeah, I see it too.

50:05.960 --> 50:08.440
Damn, we should have driven down here in my brother's car.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.120
Yeah, I don't think that old guy pays too much attention.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.120
Obviously not.

50:12.120 --> 50:13.600
We're pretty far down the trail anyway.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.840
He probably won't be giving us any trouble tonight then.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.840
That's true, yeah.

50:17.840 --> 50:21.440
Or come to our aid in case of emergency.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.200
Good thing we got that first aid kit.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.440
Yes and hand sanitizer.

50:25.440 --> 50:28.200
And liquor that we can pour on any wounds.

50:28.200 --> 50:32.120
So when you guys get to your normal camping spots, what do you do?

50:32.120 --> 50:33.120
How do you set up camp?

50:33.520 --> 50:35.800
I start building a fire right away.

50:35.800 --> 50:41.840
Okay, you notice immediately that there is no wood waiting for you.

50:41.840 --> 50:48.320
Normally the contention woods, each camping spot has enough wood for a fire waiting for

50:48.320 --> 50:51.040
people to come start a fire.

50:51.040 --> 50:53.240
And you got a fire pit, but there's no wood.

50:53.240 --> 50:56.640
Damn, good thing there's that log over there and we have an axe.

50:56.640 --> 50:58.920
Yeah, go ahead and chop that up.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.080
You want to help me?

51:00.080 --> 51:01.080
No.

51:01.080 --> 51:07.280
Okay, well I go and start chopping at this log that's 20 feet away from the campsite.

51:07.280 --> 51:09.680
I know how to lat fire us, I don't know how to create them.

51:09.680 --> 51:13.320
So while he's chopping wood, what are you up to, Jeremy?

51:13.320 --> 51:19.960
I think it's kind of weird that there's no wood here, especially like Jeremy called ahead.

51:19.960 --> 51:22.760
He like made this reservation weeks ago for this spot.

51:22.760 --> 51:29.960
Like it was a weird amount of initiative for a 14 year old, but yeah, I'd like to reserve

51:29.960 --> 51:35.000
camp spot number B-15, it's Jeremy Pettymore, we come out there every year.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.960
Make sure he has some wood for us.

51:37.960 --> 51:39.480
I think it's pretty weird.

51:39.480 --> 51:42.080
I'm a little frustrated, but I also want to look around.

51:42.080 --> 51:45.000
I want to do a little search of the area to see what else is different.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.920
All right, go ahead and roll a search for me.

51:46.920 --> 51:47.920
89.

51:47.920 --> 51:48.920
I do not succeed.

51:48.920 --> 51:49.920
All right.

51:49.920 --> 51:58.000
So you go looking around in the woods in the area and everything seems to be about normal.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.840
And Luke, while you're chopping the wood, I'm going to have you roll an alertness check.

52:02.840 --> 52:05.640
42 and a 50.

52:05.640 --> 52:06.640
All right.

52:06.640 --> 52:23.280
Thomas, if you could leave the room.

52:23.280 --> 52:28.880
So I'm chopping at this log and it's just usually the wood is like real nicely chopped

52:28.880 --> 52:30.560
and easy to make fires out of.

52:30.560 --> 52:37.560
I just have like some just misshapen giant pieces of wood that, you know, will eventually

52:37.560 --> 52:38.560
start a fire.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.400
But I've never done this before.

52:40.400 --> 52:42.360
Disheartened by your attempt.

52:42.360 --> 52:46.040
Turn around and I just sit on one of the big pieces that I've chopped and just kind of

52:46.040 --> 52:47.040
take a break.

52:47.040 --> 52:57.280
As you're sitting there, you hear a rustling and then you see a man's head pops up from

52:57.280 --> 53:04.200
behind one of the bushes, alert ears, looks left, looks right, looks, makes dead eye contact

53:04.200 --> 53:07.520
with you and pops back down under the bush.

53:07.520 --> 53:10.800
My heart stops and my palms get sweaty.

53:10.800 --> 53:11.800
Are your knees weak?

53:11.800 --> 53:12.800
Are your arms heavy?

53:12.800 --> 53:13.800
There they are.

53:13.800 --> 53:14.800
Mom's spaghetti

53:42.800 --> 54:10.800
The time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon, ooh, ooh,

54:10.800 --> 54:28.160
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh with the howling wind.

54:28.160 --> 54:38.300
The sun has come again.

54:39.300 --> 54:50.300
Her eyes, her eyes have seen it all.

54:50.300 --> 54:58.300
The wonders of, the wonders of the shadow of the moon.

55:08.300 --> 55:22.300
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
