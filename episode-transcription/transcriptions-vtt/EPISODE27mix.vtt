00:00.000 --> 00:07.480
Come tidings to all of our listeners here on KITI City Radio, where the only thing softer than the vibe is the K in our name.

00:07.480 --> 00:12.720
I'm your host, Steve Innsmouth, filling in for Barry Nasti for the foreseeable future.

00:12.800 --> 00:19.140
Let us slide right into what is, personally, to me, my favorite segment, in my opinion, within the show.

00:19.260 --> 00:20.580
It's time for,

00:20.580 --> 00:27.400
Hey There Steve, where listeners here in the city can send thoughts and opinions to be read by me, your host, now and forever,

00:28.080 --> 00:32.740
Steve Innsmouth, your host. This listener wants to remain anonymous,

00:32.740 --> 00:37.920
but I think we all know there is no hiding when you open your stupid fucking mouth and try to speak truth to power.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.040
They write,

00:39.040 --> 00:42.760
Hey there, Steve. Big fan. Love the new direction for the show.

00:43.200 --> 00:49.960
Anywho, wowee, are things getting out of control here in the city. When the hospital caught fire and killed all those innocent children,

00:49.960 --> 00:53.280
we all said, wowee, it can't get worse than this.

00:53.640 --> 01:00.680
But Goobers Gracious did it. With the death of Ferguson Beans following Bruce Robin to sell off Raw Beans Industries to an overseas

01:00.920 --> 01:06.080
conglomerate, the unemployment rate has skyrocketed. We need someone to step up and do something about it.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.640
Wow, yes, and that's not to mention the catastrophic news of the evacuation of our neighboring town,

01:11.800 --> 01:14.920
Contention, due to a chemical spill from what was once Perdition,

01:14.920 --> 01:20.160
but is now unincorporated land west of the soon-to-also-be unincorporated town of Contention.

01:20.200 --> 01:27.120
Well, if there's one thing we here at KITI City Radio know, the only thing most people do in the face of abject horror and

01:27.120 --> 01:33.280
conscious destruction is to chill the fuck out and listen to House Fire by Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.160
Oh

01:54.560 --> 01:56.560
I distinctly remember where we left off.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.320
Are we all sounding good?

01:59.320 --> 02:07.120
Checka one two penis in the poo. Checka da chiney the Chinese chicken. Okay, so this morning I woke up at eight and

02:07.920 --> 02:12.020
Taylor is normally gone for work by

02:13.200 --> 02:17.600
seven. What time does school start? I don't know. I think she has to be there like

02:18.360 --> 02:23.920
720 or 730 or something like that and they're really not sure when it starts, but I woke up at eight and

02:24.920 --> 02:29.920
My phone is over by my bathroom. So I immediately went and had my morning

02:30.920 --> 02:32.920
constitutional and

02:33.040 --> 02:35.180
During said poop. I

02:35.900 --> 02:39.020
Heard footsteps in the living room that walked

02:39.720 --> 02:43.160
very carefully into the guest bathroom and

02:43.680 --> 02:46.800
Then closed the door and then it was silent

02:47.720 --> 02:50.440
And my heart was beating

02:51.360 --> 02:55.120
So fast like out of my chest and my contacts weren't in and I was pooping

02:55.560 --> 03:00.040
So I like and you're also like super small and cannot defend yourself

03:03.880 --> 03:05.880
Exactly so I

03:06.320 --> 03:09.100
silently wiped and then like

03:09.440 --> 03:14.980
got up and like tiptoed across my room in my underwear and put in my contacts and then

03:15.300 --> 03:18.840
Got my phone and dialed 911 and like had my

03:19.420 --> 03:23.820
thumb like ready to call it and I like creeped down the hallway and

03:24.620 --> 03:30.260
The door is closed to the guest bathroom and I couldn't hear anything coming from inside

03:30.380 --> 03:36.380
and so I tiptoed past to the kitchen and I grabbed my chef's knife and

03:37.380 --> 03:39.860
Then in my boxer briefs

03:40.860 --> 03:48.300
Holding my cell phone with 911 ready to go and a chef's knife in my other hand busted into our guest bathroom and

03:49.020 --> 03:51.020
She she was home sick

03:53.500 --> 03:59.140
Busted in on my sick tired early morning wife with with a knife

04:00.420 --> 04:04.000
That's hilarious. How was that? We were both horrified

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Damn

04:06.720 --> 04:08.720
Dude

04:08.840 --> 04:15.580
So anyway the winner that's hilarious though the winner of this bloody beating stumbles to his feet

04:15.960 --> 04:19.240
Exhausted and panicked. Hold on. I want to hit that one more time

04:22.160 --> 04:25.800
You gotta give it a little contact every little heads up

04:25.800 --> 04:35.000
The winner of this bloody beating stumbles to his feet

04:35.480 --> 04:39.560
Exhausted and panicked he begins to run back to his personal cage

04:39.960 --> 04:44.420
Open and locked into place on the side of the hanging plexiglass room

04:44.600 --> 04:49.940
But he slips on the blood from the young boy beaten and prostrate. He looks terrified

04:50.660 --> 04:55.740
You realize why when the ceiling begins to lower it is slow

04:55.780 --> 05:01.220
But ceaseless the weekend champion boy scrapes and crawls just quickly enough

05:01.420 --> 05:09.300
To slide into his cube of metal bars as the ersatz ceiling closes in on the perforated floor

05:10.140 --> 05:13.380
eliciting a guttural moan from the now deceased

05:14.140 --> 05:15.460
crushed

05:15.460 --> 05:17.460
juiced boy

05:17.820 --> 05:25.620
The blood rains down onto the gaudy and deranged crowd below many holding their mouths open and tongues out

05:25.940 --> 05:29.100
Like an innocent child trying to taste snowflake

05:29.340 --> 05:35.940
The cages attached at either end of this hanging chamber one holding the tired winner and the other vacant

05:36.580 --> 05:44.420
Unlock and detach moving along the ceiling mounted conveyor belt and through a dark exit in the far corner away from you

05:45.100 --> 05:47.780
John Lee Pettymore Keith Vigna Clark Bishop

05:48.100 --> 05:54.900
you sit smushed into cages alongside Doug Jacobs and FBI agent Trent Chad's body a

05:55.100 --> 06:02.100
Man, so massive his muscles are bulging against the metal bars and a boy who looks so underfed and sickly

06:02.240 --> 06:06.280
He could likely slip right out of the cage. I want to fight the boy

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
Man this is

06:11.220 --> 06:14.100
This won't be good it sounds good to be rich

06:14.580 --> 06:21.340
Dude, I would love to watch someone get smushed through tiny holes and then try to drink their blood. Yeah, who we

06:22.580 --> 06:24.580
You're juiced

06:25.900 --> 06:28.380
Juiced okay. Tell us what happens next

06:29.960 --> 06:32.160
Like the world's most elaborate ninja

06:33.700 --> 06:35.700
That's a juicer, right

06:36.420 --> 06:38.420
What

06:38.940 --> 06:43.320
Yeah, okay and then just like a blender like a smoothie blender, oh

06:44.140 --> 06:47.100
Wow, Oh blender would be cool for another like

06:47.740 --> 06:54.260
That for later blender would be a great name for a bisexual dating app. Yep. I was gonna say like grinder blender

06:54.260 --> 06:58.640
It's extremely good. Yeah, it probably is. Yeah likely anyway

06:59.700 --> 07:06.000
Bloodsport. Is there anything on my person? No, I've got my underwear and I've got a gun and you can feel

07:06.560 --> 07:12.560
You can feel your tiny powerful gun in your underwear Keith throbbing in my pants. I

07:13.640 --> 07:18.360
Watch all of this in horror. Oh, yeah, everyone roll sanity

07:20.040 --> 07:22.040
Whoops oh

07:24.440 --> 07:28.360
Shit I rolled it too and then knocked my microphone over as I

07:29.200 --> 07:35.800
Can I use some celebration but I got it too. Hell yeah the last time I'll probably pass sanity for a while

07:36.640 --> 07:38.320
I

07:38.320 --> 07:40.960
Passed I got a 15 in class buddies. I

07:42.200 --> 07:45.360
Did not pass. Okay, Keith you lose one sanity

07:45.360 --> 07:51.760
How did I I think Clark and John are likely confident that they can win in a fistfight?

07:53.520 --> 07:55.520
Well Keith just saw himself

07:56.520 --> 07:58.520
Did get juiced?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.720
In his own mind so

08:02.240 --> 08:09.040
We're in cages like all along the walls of this cube basically, so I'm picturing it as the cube is

08:10.200 --> 08:18.360
Like an elongated room in the middle hanging above and then separately on the walls like all along the ceiling are

08:18.360 --> 08:23.120
Different conveyor belt lines and they can move the cages all around the room. Gotcha

08:23.120 --> 08:27.120
Okay, and you guys are on one side of them up against the wall

08:27.120 --> 08:31.320
Yeah, the six cages how soon does it look like we're gonna be up on the conveyor?

08:31.320 --> 08:34.520
Well, there are only six cages and you're three people

08:34.520 --> 08:40.200
So it's the boy the guy the huge guy us three and Doug

08:41.640 --> 08:47.160
Yeah, Chad in agent Chad's body. Hey, hey Doug

08:48.280 --> 08:50.280
Yeah

08:50.320 --> 08:52.320
Calm down buddy. It's alright

08:53.840 --> 08:57.080
Do you still feel like you need to do everything we say

08:58.480 --> 09:00.240
Just do you want me to

09:00.240 --> 09:06.160
What do you mean? Don't worry about it. I yell over it. I am not worried about it anymore. I yell over Doug

09:06.160 --> 09:12.400
I'm like also, yeah, if if you fight one of us and you lose your nightmare is over and you'll wake back up

09:15.120 --> 09:17.840
Yeah, does anybody have anything on them

09:17.840 --> 09:19.640
I don't know who's listening right now

09:19.640 --> 09:25.320
So I kind of like look at both of you and I kind of like make like the shooty gun

09:25.680 --> 09:29.920
hand and then point to my underwear and I'm like

09:31.160 --> 09:37.960
Trying to give a sign like do you know you've got visibly shaking? He said no, like I don't want that my man

09:37.960 --> 09:39.760
Okay, I don't want to say it out loud

09:39.760 --> 09:44.880
So I don't I like kind of like do some kind of motion to try to get you guys to know

09:45.360 --> 09:49.700
But I'm not gonna be like, yeah, I have a gun in my pants Keith

09:49.700 --> 09:54.640
Just whisper what you're trying to say in my ear and then do the same for I'm in a cage

09:54.640 --> 09:59.120
Are we that close? Oh, I thought we were all in one. You're extremely close, but you're in separate cages

09:59.360 --> 10:05.280
Yeah, so that's why I was doing that. So I was picturing. Yeah, I do not I do not say

10:05.880 --> 10:07.400
That I have it out loud

10:07.400 --> 10:11.240
Can I swing my cage back and forth the cages connected on?

10:11.560 --> 10:15.480
Some kind of sturdy rod at least like two points gotcha

10:15.480 --> 10:19.900
So you could probably shake a little back and forth, but it's not gonna move very much

10:20.440 --> 10:26.840
Doing so however elicits no response from the crowd below as they are far too concerned. Just

10:27.360 --> 10:29.360
Raging like they're drinking

10:30.080 --> 10:37.080
Okay, so if we if I look around hold on let's I want to pee on them

10:38.200 --> 10:40.200
Yeah, okay

10:40.360 --> 10:47.940
How powerful is John Lee Pettymore stream solid you just make him do a p-roll. Okay. Yeah, that's right. Can you roll?

10:48.600 --> 10:50.600
Constitution

10:51.560 --> 10:53.560
At a negative 20

10:54.760 --> 10:56.760
Sure

11:01.560 --> 11:09.120
99 a crit fail involving my penis. Yep. That's absolutely correct. I

11:11.080 --> 11:12.920
John Lee Pettymore

11:12.920 --> 11:14.920
struggles to remove

11:15.760 --> 11:17.000
his

11:17.000 --> 11:21.560
penis from his underwear to urinate on the crowd below

11:22.200 --> 11:25.360
He slips within the cage and falls

11:26.120 --> 11:29.960
dick first onto the bottom of the cage and

11:30.740 --> 11:34.920
you fall right on the bottom of your shaft and

11:35.840 --> 11:38.680
as you begin to urinate it is

11:39.320 --> 11:47.000
Red as it comes out and a couple people who are closest to where you're at who are part of the crowd

11:47.480 --> 11:49.040
notice and

11:49.040 --> 11:50.360
begin to

11:50.360 --> 11:52.240
bathe in your

11:52.240 --> 11:54.680
Bloody your urine. Yeah, I thought they might

11:59.360 --> 12:01.360
You lose one hit point

12:02.280 --> 12:06.160
Okay, I want to scan the faces of the crowd right now know anybody yes

12:06.200 --> 12:11.880
You would notice I think especially Clark Bishop wouldn't would know the faces of these people

12:12.120 --> 12:18.840
The mayor the DA and the chief of police are all in attendance of the city of the city

12:18.840 --> 12:23.640
Oh, okay. I want to look around the crowd and see if I can see if there's like

12:24.480 --> 12:26.880
Someone in a position that looks like they are

12:27.600 --> 12:34.000
Controlling this event like a MC or like the host of the game that's going on

12:34.000 --> 12:40.840
so there is a bar on one far side of the room with one bartender and

12:41.640 --> 12:45.240
Sitting at the bar is a lone figure who is

12:45.920 --> 12:49.400
Dressed in all black. He is of

12:50.060 --> 12:54.480
Average build he's about six feet tall. He has light brown hair and a mustache

12:55.200 --> 13:02.000
He is wearing tight black pants and he has a dead stare with scars on his forehead and neck

13:02.600 --> 13:05.120
Do they look like wounds or like ritual?

13:06.440 --> 13:10.440
ritualistic scars they look medical from

13:12.120 --> 13:14.800
You can see very well from what you're at

13:15.920 --> 13:17.920
Luke the room is

13:18.040 --> 13:20.040
Laid out pretty bare

13:20.360 --> 13:25.440
Really? There's just this bar on one side. They're seating all around not in the splash zone

13:26.560 --> 13:33.040
that some people are in but the majority of the crowd is in this middle section with couches and

13:33.600 --> 13:37.960
recliners and pallets of pillows and and papa songs in which I had

13:42.600 --> 13:45.020
Yes, absolutely papa songs from Pier one

13:45.740 --> 13:47.020
I

13:47.020 --> 13:53.460
Thought you'd made a fancy word for beanbag chair. Probably not from Pier one at a party. That's fancy. No, it's gone now here

13:55.220 --> 13:58.960
They blew their budget on the blood dome, yeah

14:00.620 --> 14:05.500
It must have been pretty expensive so so when I look down at the bar and I see that guy do I

14:05.740 --> 14:10.160
Does he stand out as somebody whom he's the only guy at the bar, right? Yeah, okay

14:10.160 --> 14:15.000
He seems like he's just watching over everyone and not partaking of anything

14:15.600 --> 14:20.500
Necessarily and most people aren't in the blood pit. Most people are Oh are okay

14:20.500 --> 14:24.860
Most people are there's just a few sitting about and even they might be, you know a bit splattered

14:25.120 --> 14:30.920
But they have since walked away to regain their composure. Okay, but everybody looks like they're taking part

14:30.920 --> 14:35.960
There's no people like sitting out except for bar a bar guy. Okay bartender

14:35.960 --> 14:42.960
Can I do a quick estimate in my head about how blood drenched all the people are and how many fights they've seen

14:43.080 --> 14:51.600
These people were pretty clean. Okay up until this this recent and about how many people are we talking 25 30? Okay

14:52.480 --> 15:00.200
Slightly intimate blood Bowl exactly. So how far away from each other? Are we in our cages two feet? Okay. Hey

15:01.720 --> 15:03.720
John Clark

15:03.880 --> 15:05.880
Like try to get their attention

15:05.960 --> 15:10.760
Yeah, are we gonna wait until we fight or or like do you have a plan to get out?

15:10.760 --> 15:12.760
I have no idea what to do right now

15:14.240 --> 15:15.240
Oh

15:15.240 --> 15:22.600
I thought you were talking about your dick falling off which mine just kind of did know that looked very painful, but

15:23.680 --> 15:26.580
What the fuck are we what are we gonna do right now?

15:27.600 --> 15:29.800
Clark is purposefully remaining silent

15:29.800 --> 15:33.920
but Keith just kind of sent him into a panic realizing that there is no plan and

15:34.080 --> 15:37.880
He wants to start like shaking at the tops of the cage the sides of the cage

15:37.880 --> 15:43.960
see if you can get anything to give way as you begin doing so you feel the conveyor belt begin to move and

15:44.660 --> 15:49.680
Clark Bishop's cage begins moving no, no, no, no, no boys boys. No

15:50.400 --> 15:55.160
I try to reach my hand out through the bars to like grab his hand

15:55.160 --> 15:59.240
I reach out to grab and as your hands embrace

16:00.040 --> 16:02.440
they just as quickly release as

16:03.440 --> 16:05.080
Clark begins

16:05.080 --> 16:12.480
moving inside of his cage toward the plexiglass room hanging above and one other cage also

16:12.760 --> 16:19.320
begins moving to the other side of the plexiglass cage and in it resides a

16:20.400 --> 16:21.720
sickly

16:21.720 --> 16:23.360
sad

16:23.360 --> 16:24.880
tired looking

16:24.880 --> 16:31.040
boy, the cages make their way to either side of the plexiglass room and

16:31.520 --> 16:34.400
Lock into place before the doors

16:35.440 --> 16:37.440
Open and a buzzer

16:37.760 --> 16:40.200
Sounds the crowd goes wild

16:42.160 --> 16:44.160
John shouts kick his ass Clark

16:45.640 --> 16:52.680
What's the kid how's the kid look what's he doing the kid is sitting in his cage and as his door opens he slowly

16:53.400 --> 16:59.760
crawls out and stands as tall as he can and then begins hitting his chest as

17:00.480 --> 17:05.420
Hard as he can and he begins screaming at his feet just

17:06.920 --> 17:09.120
And this is a 12 year old boy

17:15.800 --> 17:19.680
Clark is yelling down through the holes in the ground

17:20.720 --> 17:24.320
So somebody stop this. I'm not gonna kill a kid

17:25.160 --> 17:30.640
Are you still in your cage, I'm gonna say no, I've already said I was screaming down through those holes. Oh, right

17:32.000 --> 17:35.480
Okay, nothing happens. Well, he's down there

17:35.680 --> 17:40.600
Can I like look at my cage and see like obviously one end opens up into the plexiglass?

17:41.120 --> 17:43.120
what I'm trying to do is

17:43.760 --> 17:51.500
Find which edge that is and see if there's any way to like get it open before it hits the plexiglass

17:51.980 --> 17:59.620
Got you I have 50 lock picking you do I do but you don't under craft lock picking tools with you

17:59.620 --> 18:05.200
I know that you have the skill of locking but you don't have the tools with you and there's no lock on your cage

18:05.620 --> 18:09.920
So, but he knows stuff things. So I but he knows how things open and close, right?

18:10.020 --> 18:14.100
So I am able to identify which side of the cage opens up

18:14.300 --> 18:20.200
Yeah, and I'll let you roll that Oh when you want to attempt to try to open that door, okay

18:20.200 --> 18:21.900
It's not gonna be right now, but for sure

18:21.900 --> 18:29.140
Clark is pounding on the plexiglass trying to see if there's any person giving more attention than anybody else roll alertness

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Fail okay

18:38.160 --> 18:45.080
Clark you feel a tiny foot run straight into the side of your head as this boy is

18:45.280 --> 18:53.000
Flung himself through the air at you and you did not see him coming you take one point of damage as he rolls across you and

18:53.640 --> 18:55.240
You hit the ground

18:55.240 --> 19:01.720
The fight has begun. What would you like to do that kick in the head sent me into a rage

19:03.440 --> 19:10.400
And I yell and I turn and I I want to pummel the kid I roll on armed combat I

19:15.080 --> 19:17.080
Hit my number exactly exactly

19:17.760 --> 19:23.800
That's the best thing you can roll without hurting. I've got a negative now, don't I you have a negative 20, dude

19:23.800 --> 19:25.440
We all do. Yep

19:25.440 --> 19:31.920
Yeah, oh, we're all gonna suck it come bad if we I didn't set it up. Did you guys on our combat?

19:31.920 --> 19:35.800
I know I've got 40 a horse. I have a 70 in it. Oh shit

19:36.360 --> 19:38.360
You're the only one I had a hope

19:38.640 --> 19:42.280
Okay, both rolling. Yeah, I failed. So did the boy in his

19:43.000 --> 19:46.320
In his attempt tiny orphan legs shattered

19:47.440 --> 19:53.920
and the two of you begin grappling it is his turn and he is going to try to

19:55.160 --> 19:57.160
Pin you to the ground

20:00.600 --> 20:02.800
Pass I rolled a crit fail

20:02.800 --> 20:09.880
So I would like you to describe as this kid tries to grapple you what you do with his body

20:09.880 --> 20:14.760
I picture that I was he was starting to get me down on the ground and I use that momentum

20:15.760 --> 20:21.880
Because he's a small little boy and I'm a big man and I use that momentum to flip around and I'm now on top of him

20:21.880 --> 20:25.880
So I've reversed that attempted grapple. Absolutely a roll alertness for me

20:28.400 --> 20:32.920
Pass you see his eyes begin to widen as he looks up and

20:33.560 --> 20:36.960
you hear the creaking of the ceiling begin to

20:37.960 --> 20:43.760
Make its way toward you. You still have the upper hand. What do you do? I clobber him in his face

20:43.920 --> 20:47.680
All right, go ahead and roll that. I'm gonna roll to try to defend myself

20:51.560 --> 20:57.560
Pass and he fails once again, so you can roll a d4 for damage. Oh

20:59.560 --> 21:01.560
You getting hit with a four my boy

21:01.560 --> 21:03.560
So

21:03.560 --> 21:10.840
You just like grab the front of his hair and begin smashing his head into the plexiglass in my mind

21:10.840 --> 21:15.600
I'm doing it just enough to get him unconscious. I don't want to kill him. All right, okay as you're doing this

21:15.600 --> 21:21.500
He's gonna try to grab your hands your arms your forearms to push you away from him

21:21.880 --> 21:25.180
So roll one more time for me an arm. Yes, sir

21:26.180 --> 21:33.660
Pass I rolled another crit fail. Are you crit failing all of them? Really? I rolled I've rolled 88 twice. Holy shit

21:33.660 --> 21:35.660
Those are good die

21:37.940 --> 21:44.820
How do you make this kid unconscious as the ceiling begins to close in on you guys I'm doing the head slamming thing

21:45.420 --> 21:49.560
Into the ground and then when I feel like I've got him like within an inch of his life

21:49.560 --> 21:52.140
I'm doing a my hardest right hook to the face

21:52.980 --> 21:58.140
By trying to knock him out purposefully as your fist connects with the young

21:59.460 --> 22:06.020
It's the kid from mid-90s. It's the kid from it's the baby child from mid-90s and

22:07.220 --> 22:09.580
The kid with the list from stranger things

22:15.940 --> 22:17.940
Into the ground

22:19.300 --> 22:21.300
He's like, I'm sorry sir, I didn't

22:22.140 --> 22:24.140
so

22:26.340 --> 22:33.260
With one last right hook your fist connects and moves through his baby fragile chin and

22:34.140 --> 22:37.960
His neck kind of goes limp as he hits the ground

22:37.960 --> 22:43.940
It is up to you what you do next as it's not this boy's turn because this boy

22:45.120 --> 22:46.340
Dustin

22:46.340 --> 22:51.620
Is unconscious I stand over him breathing heavy and I'm yelling to the crowd

22:52.140 --> 22:59.100
He kicked me first. He kicked me first. God damn it. They are laughing their asses off. They're

22:59.740 --> 23:01.940
uproariously giggling all of them

23:03.580 --> 23:05.500
The ceiling is

23:05.500 --> 23:09.220
Closing in on you is my cage door open your cage door is open

23:09.300 --> 23:15.140
I'm gonna try and drag the kid into the cage with me. Awesome. First. I need you to roll Constitution

23:16.180 --> 23:20.300
Is that does that get a negative with the willpower stuff? Yes, okay

23:23.100 --> 23:25.100
I rolled an eight

23:25.260 --> 23:26.500
helipass

23:26.500 --> 23:32.160
Congratulations, so you feel a tinge of pain in your chest

23:32.820 --> 23:37.080
Where you felt that tightness this morning when you woke up in a cab?

23:37.500 --> 23:44.860
but you push through the pain and grab this boy and begin to drag him across and toward your cage and

23:45.180 --> 23:50.240
When you get there, do you throw him into the cage first or do you get in?

23:50.320 --> 23:56.360
I'm dragging him in my mind and I'm backing my end of the cage first myself and trying to pull him in exactly with me

23:56.360 --> 24:01.900
As soon as you get in everything works out and you are free to go. Everything's great

24:03.200 --> 24:08.620
confetti pours from the ceiling and a big banner falls down that says I

24:09.400 --> 24:14.160
Happy we love you. Happy birthday promotion Clark and it's it's

24:15.840 --> 24:17.840
It's that Michael

24:18.480 --> 24:22.340
Michael Douglas Michael W Smith the game. Who's that?

24:22.340 --> 24:27.200
Michael Michael that oh, no, the game is Neil Strauss

24:27.280 --> 24:34.400
No, the main actor in the movie the game. I don't know the game. Anyway, I hate that. I know who wrote the game

24:34.840 --> 24:38.820
Is that the game the shitty red pill thing?

24:39.000 --> 24:39.520
Yeah

24:39.520 --> 24:40.800
definitely Clark

24:40.800 --> 24:47.620
When you drag this boy into the cage with you as soon as his body enters the cage alongside yours the entire

24:47.840 --> 24:49.840
cage becomes

24:50.120 --> 24:52.120
electromagnetic and you feel an

24:52.440 --> 24:58.040
Intense burning shock going through all of the skin that's touching the bars of your cage

24:58.640 --> 25:00.740
Stand on the kid. I need you

25:01.480 --> 25:03.360
actually

25:03.360 --> 25:07.560
It does for damage. Holy shit to you as you smell

25:08.080 --> 25:15.960
What is that delicious smell Thomas? Is it the skin of Clark Bishop? It is your skin smells pretty good Clark

25:17.840 --> 25:19.600
Oh

25:19.600 --> 25:21.280
Where's the kid's body right now?

25:21.280 --> 25:27.280
It's like kind of on you like a half in and half out of the cage as you continue to get

25:27.720 --> 25:30.720
Burned up by the bars. I don't want to let his body go

25:30.720 --> 25:35.720
But I want to push it toward the put into the plexiglass room so that it's not in the cage at all

25:35.720 --> 25:39.000
Oh as you do that the burning sensation stops

25:42.200 --> 25:44.640
All right, I'm just staying like that for a little while

25:44.760 --> 25:47.800
Okay, the ceiling comes down and

25:49.040 --> 25:52.640
the ceiling touches the boy's head and then it's

25:53.400 --> 25:57.080
lower and lower and Clark shoves the boys

25:57.800 --> 25:59.800
lifeless limp body

26:00.560 --> 26:05.920
onto the floor of the plexiglass room as the ceiling comes down and

26:06.760 --> 26:07.920
smashes

26:07.920 --> 26:12.360
completely leveling this boy's skin and bones

26:13.200 --> 26:16.600
Into this weird pulp this dark

26:17.720 --> 26:19.960
oily pulp that begins

26:20.840 --> 26:28.040
Raining down on the crowd below who are losing their fucking minds. They are

26:28.680 --> 26:30.680
loving it

26:31.200 --> 26:35.880
Your cage door closes and you begin to move your conveyor belt moves

26:36.200 --> 26:41.580
Along the line and it's heading toward the dark exit that the other boy had gone through

26:41.740 --> 26:46.340
But at the very last second it stops and you have full sight of the room

26:47.060 --> 26:52.380
It's for a plot reason and not so that you can just stay in the room

26:54.460 --> 26:58.820
From my vantage point am I how far away like what's my new position in the room?

26:59.140 --> 27:04.380
You are 20 yards away from the plexiglass which leads you to be

27:05.620 --> 27:07.620
50 yards away from

27:07.700 --> 27:08.780
your

27:08.780 --> 27:16.120
Fellow police officers ass fucking room Clark is just gonna look wild-eyed at my officer friends and maybe shaking his head

27:16.120 --> 27:18.120
No, so I need to do sanity

27:18.720 --> 27:21.940
Clark can you roll sanity for me? Obviously? What's

27:22.860 --> 27:30.180
Holy shit, I does sanity get a negative if sanity got a negative. I would have a negative. Yeah, let's say no sanity's just

27:31.700 --> 27:33.660
Yeah, let's let's say no, okay

27:33.660 --> 27:34.780
Let's I know cuz in fact

27:34.780 --> 27:42.140
I I would even venture to say that being because like exhausted and not quite in touch with reality would make it

27:43.620 --> 27:49.220
Yeah, I'm gonna give you a plus 20 while you take no, no, I'm not kidding while you take a negative 20 on everything else

27:49.220 --> 27:54.300
Let's do a plus 20 on sanity. Actually, that's kind of fucking dope. Okay, that's a that's a fine trade for me

27:54.300 --> 28:00.100
Yeah, yeah, I like that. I will gladly take a plus 20 to sanity. So you pass I pass either way

28:00.180 --> 28:04.020
Okay, so John and Keith you are in cages

28:04.820 --> 28:06.340
alongside a

28:06.340 --> 28:10.400
Doug in the FBI body as well as a extremely large

28:11.020 --> 28:13.020
bulgus man and

28:13.060 --> 28:17.020
You notice both of us. No, I said bulgus. Okay

28:17.880 --> 28:21.680
Which means like a bulger bulgarious exactly

28:23.460 --> 28:24.540
And

28:24.540 --> 28:25.540
So

28:25.540 --> 28:31.820
You would notice this guy actually has a massive tattoo on his back. That says mayhem, which is pretty cool

28:31.820 --> 28:36.540
I show him my matching tattoo and a wink just Clark see that from across the room

28:36.540 --> 28:41.500
Yeah, you might be able to see that. Am I two feet away from this guy as well? Yeah. Hey, dude, what's your name?

28:43.260 --> 28:49.380
Ozzie yes Ozzie. What are you what? How did you wind up in this predicament? Well

28:50.900 --> 28:52.900
You see I am cage fighter

28:53.820 --> 28:59.220
Can I do this voice? Yeah, we're not with them anymore. So

29:00.760 --> 29:02.920
He I am cage fighter and

29:03.580 --> 29:05.580
What's your stage name?

29:05.820 --> 29:12.860
well, I am Oz mayhem as you may see from my tattoo on my back and my last name is wolf and

29:13.980 --> 29:18.740
my brother Elby, he he owed the glass family lots of money and

29:19.460 --> 29:24.260
I went to fight in the scrap pit for him to try to earn this money and

29:25.140 --> 29:29.060
You know, I was quite good. I was quite good at it

29:29.060 --> 29:35.900
I still am and I was winning all of this money and my lifestyle became more and more

29:36.340 --> 29:41.740
Extravagant until I couldn't afford the lifestyle. I wanted to live any longer and

29:42.500 --> 29:45.780
So as it goes I currently own

29:46.380 --> 29:48.700
Marvin glass a lot of money and

29:49.020 --> 29:55.280
So he has me fighting in here as a way to get through this scrap pit is Marvin glass in this room

29:55.300 --> 30:00.900
No, I do not think so. He'd like looks around and he's like no I do not see him

30:00.980 --> 30:07.540
Do you know who that guy is and I point down to the guy at the bar? Oh, yes, that's Marvin security

30:07.580 --> 30:12.380
His name is Kevin. What if I could get Marvin glass a large sum of money?

30:12.860 --> 30:19.180
Would he let us out of these cages out of these cages no if he has you in here it is clearly for sport

30:19.340 --> 30:25.300
Okay, how many times have you won this? Have you been in this predicament? Yes, but this is easy

30:25.300 --> 30:30.260
They mostly throw children at you and that is fine. It is nothing to kill a child

30:30.900 --> 30:35.820
It is much easier than beating down say a planet juggernaut. I

30:36.380 --> 30:39.260
look down at my hands and I

30:39.900 --> 30:46.240
Think about the possibility of me having to fight this guy and I start silently sobbing to myself

30:46.940 --> 30:48.100
and

30:48.100 --> 30:55.460
Then I look up at the part of the cage that I had found opens and I try my damnedest to open it up

30:55.460 --> 31:01.660
All right, as you begin to fiddle with it your cage begins moving toward the plexiglass

31:02.300 --> 31:08.720
Chamber, I mean one other I want to yeah, who's the other cage as you look behind you you see?

31:09.380 --> 31:11.420
John Lee Pettymore's cage is

31:12.220 --> 31:18.380
Also moving and the two of you begin to travel. Okay. Can I try the fucking bastard?

31:20.060 --> 31:24.340
And I need you to roll your lot picking at 50 at a negative 20

31:29.580 --> 31:31.580
99

31:34.580 --> 31:37.420
Guys these dice have been rolling it real low for me tonight

31:39.260 --> 31:41.260
You

31:41.340 --> 31:44.580
Don't want our us to get our 99 filth on your desk

31:45.820 --> 31:48.500
Keith as you fiddle with your cage

31:49.100 --> 31:54.040
You almost get it unlocked and as the cage door

31:54.340 --> 32:01.240
Begins to unhinge and move out of place you feel the most intense burning sensation

32:01.460 --> 32:06.520
All over your skin that is touching these metal bars and you take

32:07.520 --> 32:11.760
For damage putting your hit points at what for

32:14.280 --> 32:20.520
And your cage attaches and locks into place across from John Lee Pettymore's cage

32:20.600 --> 32:22.720
Which also locks into place in?

32:23.600 --> 32:27.680
between you is a bloody pulpy pool and

32:28.640 --> 32:30.560
your cage doors

32:30.560 --> 32:32.560
open I

32:32.760 --> 32:34.760
Look over John

32:36.840 --> 32:39.560
And get my gun out and I just start shooting

32:40.080 --> 32:45.400
Down at the bottom of the plexiglass to see if I can break a hole into it

32:45.400 --> 32:47.080
I start jumping up and down

32:47.080 --> 32:51.880
I run out of my cage and jump up and down on the spots where he's shot and try to smash through

32:55.200 --> 33:00.960
Yes, yeah fuck yeah, yeah hell yeah that absolutely works they don't think you have a gun

33:01.800 --> 33:08.900
Especially an extremely powerful gun that's super small for some reason exactly. I brought probably the best one with me

33:09.760 --> 33:11.280
so

33:11.280 --> 33:13.280
Do I need to roll anything for that?

33:13.280 --> 33:13.600
No

33:13.600 --> 33:17.800
You're just shooting a gun into the ground as long as you don't hit yourself actually go ahead and roll

33:18.160 --> 33:24.620
Roll me dice and if the if the pair it's at 99 again, you know, that won't we do

33:24.620 --> 33:27.760
Well immediately ricochets under your brain

33:28.680 --> 33:32.800
53 yeah, yeah sure. Okay. So what do you what do you want to happen here?

33:32.800 --> 33:38.040
I guess we never really talked about this gun. How many rounds do I hold in this gun?

33:38.040 --> 33:44.560
It has as many rounds as until I find plot interesting enough and you current failing enough for you

33:44.920 --> 33:46.320
okay, so I

33:46.320 --> 33:48.320
Petty more and I lock eyes. I

33:48.840 --> 33:56.240
Pull out the gun and I just start in a circle shooting and I see as each bullet hits

33:56.240 --> 34:00.720
The plexiglass cracks a little more and petty more sees the cracks

34:00.720 --> 34:06.500
I start jumping up and down and I'm I'm expecting if we go like I'm looking at the motherfucker

34:06.500 --> 34:10.340
I'm trying to land on like so as I fall through I do a

34:10.960 --> 34:18.560
Six shots in a circle. He's jumping and I start jumping after that and I am also aiming at a big

34:19.000 --> 34:24.000
Fat ugly motherfucker in a papasan right below me as I'm jumping

34:24.000 --> 34:25.480
I

34:25.480 --> 34:30.640
Clark in his cage is losing his mind cheering. This is the best thing he's ever seen

34:30.640 --> 34:34.080
I want you to know the crowd is also

34:34.600 --> 34:38.400
Freaking out and super into this like they are so excited right now

34:38.880 --> 34:43.440
Except for like half of them who kind of understand what's happening

34:43.440 --> 34:47.940
Were any of them hit by stray rounds going through the if you're really paying that close of attention

34:48.000 --> 34:53.720
Yeah, absolutely a couple went straight through some noggins and how does the crowd react to that?

34:53.840 --> 35:00.040
They begin lapping up the blood. Yeah. Yeah as the two of you jump up and down

35:00.040 --> 35:02.040
I think three times

35:02.600 --> 35:09.160
on that third jump the plexiglass breaks and the two of you on a

35:09.680 --> 35:11.680
circular plexiglass

35:12.080 --> 35:13.440
punctuated

35:13.440 --> 35:15.440
perforated platform land

35:15.920 --> 35:21.520
Square on top of the fattest ugliest motherfucker you've ever seen sit in a papasan chair

35:22.160 --> 35:28.760
He completely out. Oh, I see you've heard of body flattened before

35:34.160 --> 35:36.160
Watch bodies flat

35:36.520 --> 35:38.520
our slash

35:38.740 --> 35:40.740
plexiglass

35:40.740 --> 35:43.040
That's a fat guy's in a papasan guinea

35:44.540 --> 35:46.580
Oh, so you've been to top post yeah

35:46.580 --> 35:47.140
Yeah

35:47.140 --> 35:53.220
So top all time as this happens the crowd begins to go wild and you are now

35:53.820 --> 35:56.480
Amidst this crowd who does not know

35:57.300 --> 36:03.020
whether or not to continue to soak up the blood of those who have fallen or

36:03.400 --> 36:10.420
To run away in terror. The first thing I do upon landing is aim my gun at Kevin

36:10.740 --> 36:15.780
And fire a single shot hoping to hit his chest roll firearms. I

36:16.660 --> 36:24.500
Do not pass you shoot right over his shoulder and nailed the bartender who flies back into the mirror on the back of the bar

36:24.500 --> 36:32.380
And is crunched up against the bar. Can I take one one more shot? No, John. What do you do? Ah,

36:32.980 --> 36:38.260
Okay, give me a second. No, so okay. Well, then I have an answer. I

36:39.140 --> 36:42.860
Just wanted to think of a better one, but John just runs into the crowd

36:45.580 --> 36:51.900
John without even taking a look around just like runs at this first motherfucker in front of them and tackles him

36:51.900 --> 36:57.180
It's a dude with like an extremely curly mustache and he has a massive

36:57.580 --> 37:04.220
Ascot flowing out from underneath one of his vests and you just lay him the fuck out

37:04.220 --> 37:08.300
Yeah, I just want to go GTA on as many people in this room as I can until

37:08.900 --> 37:12.300
Consequences catch up with me Clark. What are you doing? I want to be spitting them

37:16.980 --> 37:18.980
Be careful

37:21.560 --> 37:24.180
Can you roll a spitting check now, oh

37:24.780 --> 37:31.600
Wait, wait, I have an I have a line to add to what I said as he's beating people. He's just like you broke my dick

37:31.600 --> 37:39.360
Good, let's take it from the top. Yes. It is a unseasonably warm. I

37:40.880 --> 37:44.880
Want to be Keith this time. Oh, I'll be the goo

37:46.480 --> 37:54.640
Okay, as John Lee Pettymore is laying into just any person around him he's just screaming you bastards broke

37:54.640 --> 37:56.640
my dick

37:57.640 --> 38:00.040
Clark who you spitting on everyone

38:00.720 --> 38:04.600
Everyone that's below me. I'm really hawking as hard as I can. I'm doing it out of spite

38:04.600 --> 38:08.680
Maybe maybe I'll get somebody to look up and I'm really trying to spit on them

38:18.560 --> 38:20.560
Wing Jeff

38:20.560 --> 38:22.560
Do you

38:23.480 --> 38:26.520
There's some pretty hard spits too because you're pretty dehydrated

38:27.880 --> 38:32.240
Can I go again or is it everyone else's turn that what happens right now?

38:32.240 --> 38:36.720
It's everyone else's turn and the crowd begins to dissipate

38:37.080 --> 38:42.200
There are about five people who are so enthralled with the entire

38:43.080 --> 38:47.520
Situation that they are just lapping up the blood on the floor

38:48.160 --> 38:52.980
Snorting it licking at it everything they can do to get others blood in their body

38:53.480 --> 39:01.440
Standing at the bar is Kevin who has not moved Keith. What do you do? I run up to the bar and

39:02.240 --> 39:08.920
Try to tackle Kevin. Okay roll unarmed combat at a negative 20. Oh, I think it was gonna be strength, but okay

39:09.840 --> 39:14.560
I've been having some damn bad rolls his luck a thing still

39:15.120 --> 39:17.120
Yeah, I want to spend some

39:19.280 --> 39:23.000
Yeah, dope, okay, so I rolled a 93 woof

39:23.360 --> 39:26.760
So dick, what do I need to do to use some luck here?

39:26.760 --> 39:32.600
What is your unarmed combat at a negative 20 20 so you would have to spend 73 luck to get a success?

39:32.600 --> 39:36.760
I don't have that. So just is there anything else I can do? No, okay

39:36.760 --> 39:43.800
Well, I mean if you're that desperate, what did you point out determine outcome you use all your points that would take desperation

39:43.800 --> 39:45.800
Yes, okay. I use all of my point

39:47.760 --> 39:49.760
I was just pointing it out. Okay, I don't

39:51.000 --> 39:53.680
Don't do it. I okay. I'll be the devil now

39:53.680 --> 39:59.160
I run I run up to I run up to the bar and I see Kevin and I just run at him

39:59.160 --> 40:04.620
And I jump off my feet into the air and trying to just like grab on to him

40:04.620 --> 40:06.620
so he rolled a success and

40:07.060 --> 40:14.620
He is gonna use all of that momentum against you as he he reaches forward and also ducks out of the way and

40:15.060 --> 40:19.240
slams your head directly into the bar and you take

40:20.980 --> 40:22.980
Six damage, okay

40:23.580 --> 40:30.100
Four. Yeah, you're dead. So I am gonna use 30 luck points to avoid death. Hell yeah. Hell yeah

40:30.100 --> 40:35.280
First big luck spin to the game. So that puts me at 35 and avoid death

40:35.400 --> 40:41.280
But tell me how that works. So basically what happens is you move toward Kevin and

40:41.840 --> 40:48.600
Kevin slams your head directly into the bar and you go blank completely unconscious and

40:49.400 --> 40:52.040
You are bleeding out onto the ground

40:52.040 --> 40:59.040
He looks down at you and then with completely cold dead eyes just walks away. You're dead

40:59.080 --> 41:01.320
He's just gonna move on. Okay, I

41:01.320 --> 41:03.000
I

41:03.000 --> 41:05.440
Mean you're not dead cuz you spent the light but

41:06.760 --> 41:12.400
Essentially, I'm out for the time being you are dead. So what's your look at now? 35

41:13.040 --> 41:18.080
Clark, what do you do? How's the spittin going? Oh, man, you'd like you've hit one out of every ten spits

41:18.080 --> 41:23.760
Which is good. It's really good. It's a far distance to spit. You know, you gotta at least get ten yards

41:23.760 --> 41:27.640
You also did just see me get destroyed. So maybe

41:28.480 --> 41:30.480
Maybe you're mad and you do something

41:31.320 --> 41:37.680
I do want to try and start shaking my cage and see if I can break the motherfucker off the track

41:37.680 --> 41:40.520
I shake so hard. I shake so hard. I

41:41.400 --> 41:43.400
Vibrate so hard within the cage

41:45.840 --> 41:50.960
No, I want to take both hands on each side of the cage and just throwing my weight back and forth

41:50.960 --> 41:52.960
Do you wait back and forth?

41:53.800 --> 41:56.800
roll constitution first with a negative 20 I

41:58.440 --> 42:00.120
Pass a

42:00.120 --> 42:02.520
13 on a 45 nice

42:02.680 --> 42:10.200
So now roll strength because your chest is feeling that tight tight pain that it felt earlier

42:10.200 --> 42:13.360
But you're able to continue and fight through it. I

42:15.800 --> 42:21.000
Rolled a 13 again with different dice. I swear to God watching it happen. Everybody can see it's insane

42:21.360 --> 42:26.000
You roll better than anyone I've ever met in my entire life. They're all lying

42:26.000 --> 42:27.680
I

42:27.680 --> 42:30.360
Rolled a 73 on the same pair of dice

42:31.080 --> 42:38.280
Yeah, I passed it's also at a 45 with the mate with the minus. Okay, you you begin rocking back and forth John

42:38.280 --> 42:40.280
what do you do I

42:40.320 --> 42:43.120
Stop dead in my tracks when I see what happened to Keith

42:44.240 --> 42:51.460
And I want to run over to check on him and also get his gun you run over and grab the gun out of Keith's

42:51.860 --> 42:59.060
Hand as you do so you look up and you see Kevin who's standing at the bar Kevin can wait

43:05.180 --> 43:07.180
We

43:07.220 --> 43:09.220
Zach wrote that entire

43:16.260 --> 43:18.260
You look in Kevin's eyes and

43:18.660 --> 43:21.780
You get this weird feeling

43:22.500 --> 43:24.020
because

43:24.020 --> 43:28.620
You you feel like you know him. It's almost like you recognize him

43:29.140 --> 43:32.620
But you don't you've never seen this this guy before

43:33.740 --> 43:37.500
And his cold dead stare straight at you

43:38.940 --> 43:42.820
for just a second flickers and

43:43.700 --> 43:47.100
His eyes change and they look at you

43:47.700 --> 43:49.700
with this

43:49.700 --> 43:51.220
remembering and

43:51.220 --> 43:53.980
Then it is immediately back to these cold eyes

43:54.060 --> 43:59.180
I want to try to take the moment that he was off guard to shoot him in the face. Go for it

44:00.180 --> 44:02.180
At a negative 20. Yeah

44:02.460 --> 44:05.340
52 on a 60 so you fire a couple rounds

44:05.860 --> 44:11.500
completely shaken not able to even hold this gun steady at all you miss and

44:11.740 --> 44:12.580
And

44:12.580 --> 44:18.420
He stares at you and then he just runs out of the room as fast as he can

44:19.580 --> 44:25.420
John I'm standing you're standing Asian in confusion penis nursing your penis at the bar

44:25.420 --> 44:30.940
Can I see what my other cage mates are doing like agent Doug Chad and his mayhem still in his?

44:30.940 --> 44:36.260
Yeah, they're both in theirs. They're freaking out there. I mean, they're trying to pay attention. They're looking all around the room

44:36.260 --> 44:40.260
Can I yell to Doug Chad? Yeah, sure break out of your cage, man. I

44:41.140 --> 44:45.400
Thought about just asking him to do that earlier like Doug get out

44:48.020 --> 44:50.020
It could work

44:50.680 --> 44:54.240
Let's see Doug flips the obvious like lever

45:02.420 --> 45:07.380
All right, now what it pulls another lever and it just lowers gently to the floor

45:08.340 --> 45:10.940
Keith you're laying lifeless on the ground

45:12.140 --> 45:15.640
Clark is rocking back and forth in this cage

45:16.220 --> 45:21.900
hanging next to an empty dark void leading to another room and

45:23.020 --> 45:25.020
John is standing at the bar

45:25.900 --> 45:28.260
all the people in this room are

45:28.900 --> 45:30.780
freaking out and

45:30.940 --> 45:37.860
Running here and there and the last few of them trail out of the room as you hear a

45:39.540 --> 45:47.480
Snap and Clark's cage falls to the ground and breaks open upon impact Clark you take

45:50.180 --> 45:53.060
Eight damage from the fall that puts me out

45:53.060 --> 45:59.840
I I too will use 30 points of luck to avoid death. What were you at? Oh seven

46:00.780 --> 46:06.100
So now I'm at 45. Look god damn god damn had I not just on a whim

46:07.540 --> 46:13.180
Put that gun in my pants. I don't know how oh we would have figured we would have figured it out

46:13.180 --> 46:17.300
But I just don't know what it would have been. I would like beating you to death with your forehead

46:17.300 --> 46:23.140
I mean you you would you would have killed me because you would have been turned to a goo and then you would have spent

46:23.140 --> 46:25.140
30 luck to come back

46:25.980 --> 46:27.980
How would could we have done that?

46:30.780 --> 46:32.780
What we could

46:35.980 --> 46:37.980
Save this house

46:40.900 --> 46:43.380
But it burns because it's wood

46:53.900 --> 46:57.080
Name I smoked all day

47:00.780 --> 47:02.780
You sleep in it all day
