00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hey folks, I'm Zach, the producer, whoever that asshole is, totally fucked up.

00:09.000 --> 00:21.000
They forgot to remind Wolf the Dog that the Den of Sin will be live this upcoming Tuesday, the 28th of July, for an extremely special stream.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Luke is running a homebrew.

00:24.000 --> 00:35.000
This is the first time any of these players have run a DG scenario, and I consider myself blessed as fuck to get to join the rank of the PCs for this one shot.

00:35.000 --> 00:48.000
I have so much respect for Luke as a player, and so much love for this dude as a human, and I cannot wait to play in a game at which he is at the helm.

00:48.000 --> 01:03.000
And for all of you at the Splashylvania Fastpass holders at the $5 and up level, I will have part 3, the conclusion of our playthrough of Lover in the Ice, edited and uploaded in this coming week.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
So be on the lookout for that, and if you are not a patron of this fine podcast you've listened to a stupid amount of, don't worry.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
You can easily join us over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
The higher that number grows, the less stupid I feel about spending so much time working on this super fun and silly show.

01:26.000 --> 01:35.000
You'll immediately have access to 12 bonus episodes, as well as the ability to vote in polls that decide which scenarios I run for the boys.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
Seriously, I did a quick skim, my fault, and I ended up running Lover in the Ice, my fault.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
It did win the poll, that's why I ran it, my fault.

01:46.000 --> 01:58.000
So, if you want access to this monthly bonus content and a say in what that content consists of, join us, please, over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
The link is in the show notes, but it's easy as fuck to type into your browser. It's so easy, you just type it in.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
It's patreon.com slash pretending pod.

02:10.000 --> 02:23.000
On a real human note, I seriously, I spend a dumb amount of time making this podcast, and I'm dumbfounded and humbled by the responses we've received.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
When we were about to start, we talked about our pipe dreams for the show, right?

02:28.000 --> 02:39.000
Mine was fan art. I said, if someone makes fan art for our show, this will all have been worth it, and holy shit, I had no idea what was coming.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
You guys have made some of the dopest, ugh, it just, it's so heartening.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
I had no idea how invested we'd all be in putting out this show every week for thousands of people.

02:51.000 --> 03:03.000
That seems silly, even as I say it, but I just want you all to know, we really appreciate having you all along for this ride, this fucking wild-ass ride we're all on.

03:03.000 --> 03:15.000

03:15.000 --> 03:26.000
If you're dealing with instability right now due to COVID or being a poor college student, or legitimately just because capitalism fucking blows, do not worry. Fret not.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
We completely understand. Keep listening to the show. Tell your friends about it. If you could, just blow up the internet.

03:33.000 --> 03:46.000
Hit those RPG subreddits hard with recommendations. Tell your friends about the show. Just anything you can do helps, and it makes me smile, and it makes me hard.

03:47.000 --> 03:57.000
I know Wolf has joked about taking other people's iPhones and reviewing our show on Apple Podcasts. That, that wasn't a joke.

03:57.000 --> 04:08.000
That would help us tremendously. We really don't want to put ads on this show. We really like it the way it is, and we really hope you do too.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
Fuck, I've been going on way too long. Let me send it over to my luff in the fog, Wolf the dog.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
Aw yes, my children's children. It's good that you came to visit your old canine granddad, Wolf the dog.

04:24.000 --> 04:40.000
Come sit on Pop Pop's lap while he regales you with the weird stuff that happened and will happen in this shithole of a town and multiple other realities, live from 694.2 PTBP.

04:40.000 --> 04:49.000
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Roxy, who tagged that pretending part in an Instagram story. They write,

04:49.000 --> 05:01.000
Greetings listeners of 694.2 PTBP in whatever you call the present, from about 25 episodes, I mean a few days in the past.

05:01.000 --> 05:13.000
The opportunity arose to send this message to the future via radio broadcast technology operated by the exceptionally smooth radio presenter Wolf the dog.

05:13.000 --> 05:22.000
So I decided to let my beloved Andy know that his cute little butt is the cutest in the whole universe. I mean universes.

05:22.000 --> 05:33.000
Also, my contention uniform just arrived from the future, although I'm not sure what the meaning behind the pink square with skeletons dressed as the village people actually is.

05:34.000 --> 05:44.000
Agent Roxy from the European Bureau of Chronologics in Athens, Greece. Oh Roxy, you know how to butter up a wolf's ears and soul, that's for sure.

05:44.000 --> 05:55.000
But I will not accept you talking of others' meat buns on this here show. The only thick ham hawks I want people admiring are mine.

05:55.000 --> 06:04.000
Damn, now I want to eat some hawks of ham. Time to fuse some clues. The truths get me loose like an amuse-bouche, it's the news.

06:04.000 --> 06:16.000
Last time, Drew Carey, Pages, Andrews reunited with John before taking off on the four-wheeler with Agent Trent Catt and the odd-looking Broken Tubed Radio,

06:16.000 --> 06:25.000
heading to Clinkers to find the hidden underground location of Gary, Harry, Mildred, Clara, and Drew's body.

06:25.000 --> 06:37.000
The wall of water fell, crashing into and filling back up Bean's pond. Clark swam to safety, and John was lifted out of the water by a chanting and love.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
The two of them then walked across the water to Clark on the shore.

06:42.000 --> 06:56.000
Down in his secret underground laboratory, Keith Beans found the super unnaturally fucked up Tilly B. Mitchell behind the blast door, screeching and roaring like some sort of wild creature.

06:56.000 --> 07:08.000
Falling back, he stumbled upon a hidden compartment in the uneven concrete floor, revealing an odd-looking old revolver with glass tubes and a green light lit.

07:08.000 --> 07:20.000
Looking for other buried treasure, Keith found another small metal sphere, or ball, if you will. I'm honestly so shocked he didn't just grab this ball, y'all. I was so proud.

07:20.000 --> 07:31.000
But then, this dumb motherfucker starts chanting the spell he remembered was on the paper that fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket when he straight up NFL blitzed this old-ass lady.

07:31.000 --> 07:41.000
So Keith's body split open, discarding his metal bits before his human anatomy reformed inside and zipped itself back up.

07:41.000 --> 07:59.000
And with that, Keith Vigna Beans lost his goddamn mind. He walked over to the strange, old-timey revolver, found a massive, dusty cartridge in the cylinder, and pulled the trigger, triggering a blinding flash of light.

07:59.000 --> 08:19.000
Keith Beans came to the Old West. Contention in 1880-something. He saw the original Silas Cole walking down the dusty path towards town, chased him down, snapped his neck, and took his wrongful place as the founder of our beautiful, quiet little town here.

08:19.000 --> 08:31.000
If you love contention, then this is your commission. The admission of our religion to all that we can condition, which consists of listening to Cuz You With No Backbone.

08:49.000 --> 09:07.000
Alright, do you guys have anything interesting to say, or should we dive right into episode 88 of this podcast here that we make together?

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
If you put zeroes between the eights, it says boobs.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
The wall of water and fish previously surrounding Beansburg.

09:18.000 --> 09:28.000
You are just going to blast past Joe's amazing revelation like that, Zach?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I have never thought about it.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
If you put zeroes in between it...

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Hang on, let me pull up my calculator so I can show you.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh, he did it.

09:39.000 --> 09:49.000
Well guys, if you guys don't, I'm gonna leave real quick, but I'll be back in five minutes?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Okay.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Is that because you were so turned on by the number boob?

09:55.000 --> 10:05.000
If you think that's enough time to get your little dick done.

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
It's so small that it takes forever. This is great. This is grade A content.

10:13.000 --> 10:24.000
I've idly wondered almost every time if showing you guys my dick would be a crime. Like, literally.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
I think probably, which is why I haven't done it, but I'm surprised Luke has it.

10:29.000 --> 10:37.000
Yeah, it's pretty wild. We're Luke-less right now, at the top of this episode here. Nope, we're not Luke-less.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
I just don't want that I think about showing you guys my dick every episode part in...

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Oh, too bad.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Okay.

10:48.000 --> 10:56.000
I thought you were saying that we shouldn't say that Luke's not here, that way we could all react to him showing us his dick right now.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Wow!

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
It's weird.

11:01.000 --> 11:10.000
The wall of water and fish previously surrounding Bean's pond has now filled up the entirety of the previously dehydrated bowl.

11:10.000 --> 11:21.000
There's plenty of this water teeming with fish left over, and now the streets are gushing with a fair amount flowing down into the storm drains.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Clark, you were able to swim to the shallow shore safely.

11:25.000 --> 11:36.000
John, your partially metal skeleton weighing you down combined with a failed swim check led to your needing to be saved by the very woman you claim to not trust at all.

11:36.000 --> 11:46.000
Ann Love pulled you up out of the water, chanting, and she lifted you on top of the surface where the two of you walked, Jesus-style, over to Clark.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
I need you both to roll Sanity for witnessing this unnatural ability.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Fail. 45 on a 20.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I also fail a 48 on a 9.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Go ahead and lose 1d4 Sanity.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Oh no. A 1.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Oh, nice.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Is it a 1 of those 1 plus?

12:07.000 --> 12:15.000
It was not a 1d4 plus 1, because if you would have succeeded, you would have only lost a 0, and you would have gotten to roll another check that I would have asked for.

12:15.000 --> 12:23.000
But since neither one of you did succeed, you both just lose 1d4, which for Clark was 1 Sanity, for John is 2 Sanity.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
So I'm at 16. I was wrong. I was at 18, not 20.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh, even worse. Or better. Worse. Better? 1 or 2?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I never know.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Can I see 3 again?

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
And Anne kind of walks you over to- that was so stupid. Anne walks you over to-

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
I just had an eye appointment the other day, so it's on my mind.

12:48.000 --> 13:04.000
And she looks into both of your eyes. She's just cackling with laughter as she realizes how freaked the fuck out both of you are that-

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, right? I can do that.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
You made him walk on water. He was walking on water.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
I mean, it was mostly me, but, you know, I can let him, if you will. And I will.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Can you show us how to let people?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Sure.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Oh, shit. Do you guys want to get into this?

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
If it allows us to walk on water, that seems helpful.

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah, I mean, no. This spell is good for anything. You can walk on water, you can put people into walls. Like, you can do all sorts of stuff. It's so dope.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Could you put yourself on the other side of a door?

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Clark's heart sinks when she mentions the put people into walls thing.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
His face falls.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Clark did what?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I don't want to learn it. I don't want to learn it.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah, I guess you could walk through doors, for sure.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
What's it called?

13:56.000 --> 14:06.000
For the first time, you probably won't be able to just say it. You'll need to, like, read it off a paper. So, do any of you have- Oh, everything's all wet.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
I guess we'd need to find something to write it on first off.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I'd like to search the area for-

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah, I think that's a good call.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Ready, utensils?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Go ahead and roll search.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I got a 73 on a 50.

14:21.000 --> 14:31.000
Well, I mean, just like I did- Okay, so, we can figure this out later, but why do you want to be able to walk through a door? Is the book on the other side of a door?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Maybe, actually.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
Wait, for real? Do you know where the book is?

14:37.000 --> 14:45.000
Hold on, man. I've got to take this.

14:45.000 --> 14:53.000
He's just going to- He didn't take the call. He just told me he's going to take it. Now he's just texting?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Continue.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
We're talking about the book that you killed my parents for, is that right?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Yeah.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
What made you decide to come and get it now? They've been dead for years.

15:04.000 --> 15:16.000
Well, it's kind of the end, if you will, if we don't solve it. And I personally, and Maggie as well, of course, really thinks that the book could solve it.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
And if not, we're banking on this other guy to take care of things if he shows up.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Who's that?

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
The Overseer. It'd be really cool if the Overseer showed up, but-

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
I elbow Clark really hard in the ribs.

15:31.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, yeah. Hey, we don't know who that would be, right?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Right. That's right.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
Because we don't want to just go blabbing out. What is the Overseer supposed to do?

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
It's not really known too much, but basically like the revelation of the Overseer was that Jim was going to die.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
And now that he's dead, it kind of seems like it is only through death that he may live.

16:01.000 --> 16:09.000
And so this guy is this like rogue dude with, he's got some sort of light in his mouth or something like that.

16:09.000 --> 16:19.000
And I don't know how, I don't know how, but when you look at it, you could just feel the power, right?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
And it's this idea that like he started the circle of knowledge.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
And so therefore at the end, you know, he'll be able to come back and save us.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
And you haven't seen him.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
No, God, no. Wait, have you?

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
No. Clark looks at his feet.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
Roll. Persuade.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
I pass. Yes, I pass. A 40 on a 40. That passes, right? You can meet it?

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
It does indeed. It was a contested roll.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Oh, so I kicked ass, right?

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, none of us have seen it. I mean, that would be wild.

16:59.000 --> 17:10.000
And, you know, there's this overseer thing. There's the beans thing on the door.

17:10.000 --> 17:19.000
You're not aware of like a third thing, like a third prophecy or thing and a third special thing for another special person who might.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
Nope. Probably no other special people.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Right, right. Probably not. Yeah.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Who are you thinking of?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
No, nobody. Nobody in particular.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Like me?

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
I guess it could be anybody.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
But yeah, if you guys need to get through a door to find the book, then we can make that happen.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Oh, yeah, our friend Keith had the book.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
Roll Persuade, because add a negative 20, please.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
You don't need to apply the negative modifier.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Because I already failed.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Why are you okay?

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
He didn't have the book. I lied.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Did you just want me to take you to a...

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
Yeah, if you could magic us through the door, we really miss our friend Keith, and he would really come in handy at calm, comfy campgrounds.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
The little fellow who went through with the guy with the helmet on his head?

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
I know. I know he doesn't look like much, but he's scrappy.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
Not to mention whatever's down there seemed important to that guy and might help us in our journey.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
That guy with the helmet would almost certainly know where the book is.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
How?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
He's just really familiar with all of this shit.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Kind of like you. He just knows the whole hell.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
You guys should probably have a beer or something, maybe, and talk about this all.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
He's real dangerous, too. He was the one doing all the fish magic.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
And he wants to kill a bunch of people to go back in time and stop all of this, which might put a kibosh on whatever you're working on.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
He was trying to go back in time to do what?

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
I don't rightly know. Become Silas Cole or something?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Huh. Hey, John, right?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Ann.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Yeah, did you use the radio?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Today.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Ever?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Ann, I don't rightly remember.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I've been a lot of things in the past few days.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
What do you mean by that?

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
He just kind of points at his Kevin face.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Right, right. So you weren't always...

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
No, ma'am.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Okay. Quick question, then. Who the fuck are you?

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
And why were you acting like you were my partner? I...

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Ann, I'm your son.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I don't see how that would remotely be possible.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
Well, it was kind of a big leap, but I am Kevin's son.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Wait, so you're not the Kevin that I knew at all.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
You're just the body, but you didn't use the radio?

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Oh, no. I'm ball.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
It's this whole other deal.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Clark's eyes are wide, staring at John.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, this is... I forgot I was deceiving you.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Role-playing, baby.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
And by your ball, you mean...

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
My conscience is contained in a small metal sphere...

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah, a vector.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
...which rips out a vector.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Well, you are the ve... So you're one of...

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Are you telling me there is a special thing for me?

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, I guess there is.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Clark's hand is going to his pistol. Does she look scary?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Roll humant.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
I fail. A 46 on a 30.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
She looks the same as she did 30 seconds ago.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
She looks the exact same.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
She's not, like, making a move of aggression of any kind.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Okay. Well, that's wild.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Okay, what do you remember?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Sorry, I've never talked to one.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Do you mean about, like, the process or...

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, yeah, like, do you have human con...

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Like, do you think you're human?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And she looks at Clark and she goes,

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Oh, my God, he thinks he's human.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
John puts his hand on his gun.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
He's human. Look at him.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
He's been with us the whole way along.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
He just looks a little different now, that's all.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Wait, so you're, like, all done up, all metal-like, right?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Like, I can kind of see...

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Is that... Was that already in, Kevin?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Or is that part of you?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Does your skeleton grow out?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Like, does the ball make a skeleton for you?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
It's all part of me.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Calm down. Calm down.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
You look a little upset. I'm not upset.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I'm very curious.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Curious as hell. You are special.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
You're extremely special. You wanted to be special.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
You're damn special.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
You said you never talked to him,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
but that presupposes that you've run into him before.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
What do you know about him?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Yeah, I was sent here to take care of him.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
That's why me and Kevin were...

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
And Kyle were sent here by Jim

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
to get rid of these balls.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
He didn't tell you why or what they were or what they could do?

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
They were being put in babies?

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
So there was this place called Cole's Orphanage

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
that we had to completely get rid of, wipe out,

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
take off any trace that had ever existed, anything like that,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
because, I mean, it was...

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It was a big issue, right?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Because these people, they were adopting children,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
but they weren't fucking human.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
And that's what we were trying to stop from happening, right?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And so we were just trying to get rid of them,

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
but the only thing that Jim said was, don't touch them.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
So we didn't.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
So in your experience, how did you take care of them

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
if you couldn't touch them?

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
There's a certain way that I can handle things.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
It doesn't involve a bag of any kind, right?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
A bag? What kind of bag? Why'd you ask that?

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Just a thing that we've heard might work, but yeah.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
You, uh, what, do you use your magic?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah, in a way.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
So you were just out there killing babies.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
What?

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah, I guess me and your dad were out there killing babies,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
if you really want to think about it,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
whether or not he's actually your dad, but...

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Holy shit.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
They weren't babies, though.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Yes, they were.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
No offense, no offense. It's fine, it's fine.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I'm clearly impressed,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
but they needed to be taken care of at the time.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
And I know one thing.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
I'm more human than you will ever be.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Okay.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Well, shall we go?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Let's go to the church, Clark.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah, and I don't know about this anymore.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Her eyes narrow.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Huh.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Okay.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
What are you gonna do about it?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
We don't know, man.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
What's your end goal, then?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
What's your end goal?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
If we went and got that book,

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
ended up at Calm Comfy Campground, what happens?

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Okay, well, like, best case...

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Like, best case scenario, based on what Maggie said,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
if we could actually get the book,

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
then we would be able to either call for the Overseer,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
because we don't know whether he's actually gonna show up or not, you know?

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Like, it's not a determined thing ahead of time,

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
but she thinks that we could summon him

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
in order to save the world.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
I'm sorry, but doesn't the creator of your organization

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
showing up at the end of all things

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
to, like, tie it all up in a neat little bow

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
just seem a little too fairytale?

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
I don't think that he's who you think he is

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
if you think it's a fairytale.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
No, he does not strike me as a Prince Charming.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
No.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
No, King, perhaps, but not a...

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
No, not a good one.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I mean, most of those fairytales

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
aren't really about good people either,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
but don't you think it's still pretty convenient for yourself

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
that you'd just be able to summon this guy

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
and he'd end it for you?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
What do you want to do?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I've been talking a lot. What is your guys' plan?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
If I wasn't here, what would you guys have done,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
besides, you know, your friend dying?

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
We'd probably wander around

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
trying to gather more information

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
until it was too late and everything exploded.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
That's...

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
That's...

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
You're more than welcome to do that if you want to,

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
but based on our whole conversation that we've been having here,

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
it seems like you want to get down into the bottom of the pond

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
through that door to meet up with your friend.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
And if that's right, if you take me and show me the book,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
because I saw that weird face you made earlier,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I think you might have an idea of where it is.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
If you can show me the book, I will get you through the door.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Can I have a moment to speak with my associate?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Sure.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Clark, she walks away with her back turned toward you.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
John, do you know where the book is that she's talking about?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I don't know where the book is.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
She thinks it's at my house,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
but I mean, I've lived there for my whole life.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I've never seen a book there that...

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
I thought I had told you.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Maybe I had my mind as a jumble,

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
but yeah, I had a vision of Kacelle going to your parents' house,

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
and Kevin found the book and didn't tell the others.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
I don't know what he did with it.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
She did tell us that Jim tried to make his own book

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
when he couldn't find the one your parents had.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Right.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
So then, yeah, her guess is as good as ours.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
It could be at my house.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I didn't ever see a book up there.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
I mean, I wasn't lying when I was telling her

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
that Adam Kane might be the person who knows the most

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
about where that book might be.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
He seems to have been amassing a lot of supernatural bullshit

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
underneath our noses this whole time.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
He certainly mastered the object, it seems like.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
He knew about them and how to work them.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Yeah, I mean, when I saw that squirrel with the radio,

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
I was like, I don't...

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Or the cat, rather.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
Squirrels and cats.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
I was like, I don't even remember what that thing does.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
So kudos to Adam Kane.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
The radio was the one that switched bodies.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
I wasn't sure what the helmet did until now I've got a hunch

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
after seeing the things we did.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
What do you think the helmet does?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
It makes us see things.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
It's gotta be.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
I tell you, moments ago, I was bashing in the windows

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
of the van that was on fire, and then it disappeared.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
It wasn't there.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
Hey, hey, you know, you just gotta let that go.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
I just...

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
So does Adam.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
We're going to say that to him, and if he doesn't,

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
then we'll move on from there.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
Get over it, Adam.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I don't know what to do, John.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
We could maybe find the book with her

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
and then jump her and take it.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
I mean, what if she's right?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
What if the whole thing is right?

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
What if using the book that she finds calls what we think

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
is maybe hold me down, and he's willing to help us

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
because it's me?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Old G's been a little weird around us, though.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
I mean, not exactly.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
Not forthcoming, for sure, but he does seem to be helping.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Oh, shit.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
Okay, Clark, what if you write a letter to yourself

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
to open in the future saying like,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
hey, come back right now to this moment?

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Yeah.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
That'd be cool.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Yeah.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
We were looking for paper moments ago, though,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and we didn't find any.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
We'll really have to keep an eye on now.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
Also, things got real tense with Ann,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
and she's probably not going to teach us magic anymore.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
You guys should roll alertness for me.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
She's gone.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Wait, what is my alertness?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Damn it.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
80 on a 60.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Ah, fuck.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
A 76 on a 70.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
She's just been in the circle with us this whole time.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
No, you guys are good.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
You can keep talking.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
I'm getting a weird feeling about Ann.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Let's check in on her.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Ann?

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
As you say, I'm getting a weird feeling about Ann.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
You hear the chanting that has been happening behind your back

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
this entire time that is growing louder and louder.

29:57.000 --> 30:05.000
It's Stefani Nazifalo.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Gwen Stefani.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
And she has a large knife,

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
and she is holding it over her head,

30:16.000 --> 30:22.000
and she is coming down at John Lee Pettymore, the third skull.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Because she's getting the jump on you,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
you're going to be at a negative 40.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
And I'm sorry about that.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
She passed with a 30.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
My eyes grow wide, and I scream,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
she's coming for my ball!

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
And I try to artfully roll out of the way using athletics.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
Wait, I'm at, oh fuck, I'm at minus 40?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Yeah, what's your athletics?

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
I try to persuade her to stop.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
What's your athletics?

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm just trying to find anything else I could use.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
Oh, I'd like to use my robot constitution

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
and my metal plates to just take the fucking blow.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Alright, athletics, 50 at a minus 40.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Okay, so you have to roll an ought one

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
in order to win the contest.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I rolled a 73.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Well, that was really close.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
It was as close as any other number would have been

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
to what you were looking for.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
And, Clark Bishop, think about what you're doing

31:21.000 --> 31:27.000
as she is going to stab down.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
This knife goes directly into the top of your head, John Lee,

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
and you feel your skull crack as you take nine damage,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
and blood begins to just gush out of the hole.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
How much, wait, how many hit points did you have?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
I had 20.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Okay.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Good, I just realized that, not good,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
whatever it would have been,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
but I just realized that we had a whole gunfight earlier

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
that might have been an issue with nine hit points.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
So you're down to 11, and blood is just like gushing out,

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
and Clark Bishop, blood is spurting out

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
of John Lee Pettymore III's head.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Clay!

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
And, what the fuck, and I want to tackle her.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Get her to the ground?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah, that'll be unarmed combat, and she'll be at a negative

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
since she already attacked this turn.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
Okay.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
A 46.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
She passes 43.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I pass 46.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
How do you want to take her to the ground?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
As soon as she...

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
It's not that kind of podcast, Joe.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Calm down.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
And she's not into that.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I get her center mass and get her to the ground,

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
and I want to put an arm across her throat

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
so if she does try to start chanting again, she can't.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Ooh, nice.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I'm pressing into her throat.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Does that end the combat?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Do I need to talk to her now?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
No, it does not end the combat at all.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
You've got a large knife.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
I'd say yay long, about a foot long,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
and a good three inches of it are in you.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
I need you to tell me how three inches of knife

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
being in my skull affects my mind brain.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Yeah, no, I'm a scientist.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Or does it at all since it didn't hit ball?

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah, I mean, we're at the point now where, you know,

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
ball controls everything, so your brain is only there

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
as a human function to...

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Maybe it's grabbed onto your brain

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
to try to emulate empathy and emotion of some sort,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
or maybe that was in ball all along.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
You don't really know, but you know that in this moment,

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
you can't really see straight because everything's wobbly,

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
and you feel like you're gonna throw up,

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
but you are not at a mechanical disadvantage currently

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
for some reason.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
It might be because you're metal.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
Ah, fuck, let's see.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
John takes the pistol given to him by Harry,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and although he's wobbly,

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
he plants himself with his robot feet

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
and sort of steadies himself

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
and brings his arm up and shoots it in.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
32 on a 60.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Roll a D10 for damage.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Ten.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Fuck.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Whew!

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Where do you shoot her?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Clark knocked her to the ground.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Yeah, he's like on top of her.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
Then I'm sorry, Anne, but I shoot you in the knee.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
As you blast through her knee,

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
you see the entire calf just kind of like twitch and shake

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
off kilter from where it's supposed to be.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
Her leg now goes down and then off out to the side

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
as it kind of blasts those ligaments off

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
that keep it where it's supposed to be.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Oh, my God.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
And it hits an artery,

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
and blood is just pouring out of her leg.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Oh, no.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
And it's Anne Love's turn,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
and I've got Ramona on the desk.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Hi, Ramona.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Ramona, save us.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
Ramona, will you get down or get in my lap or something?

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Come here.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
There she is.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
All right.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
She's going to grapple with your arm,

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
and as she's doing it, she is trying to chant

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
and roll unarmed combat.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
She passed with a 25.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I passed with a 37.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
You motherfucker.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Fuck yes, Joe.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
And it's Clark Bishop's turn.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Oh, shit.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Okay.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Oh, boy.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
I want to grab the wound behind me

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
that has now been inflicted.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
I'm trying to cause so much pain that she passes out.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Holy shit.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
Okay, roll first aid against her constitution.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Holy shit.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
He really is a game master.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
She passes with a 17.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I fail a 95 on a 30.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
Okay, so you describe this nastiness, please.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
You did this.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Clark felt the spray of blood across his back

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
and knew that there was a wound back there,

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
so he reached behind him blindly to grab it,

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
and he wanted to clamp down as hard as he could

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
just to inflict pain.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
That was his only goal.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
She screams out,

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
but she clenches down on her teeth so hard

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
that as you're looking right into her mouth,

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
she's...

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
One of her teeth breaks.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Oh, my God.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
And she spits it at you.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Okay, this is beautiful justice for Clark.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
I just want to remind the audience

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
that this would feel real good for Clark.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I don't feel great about it as Joe.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
But this woman killed his parents.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
John Lee Pettymore, what's your excuse?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Oh, she said you weren't human.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Yeah, I am human. I'll show her.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
All right, Knifehead, you're up.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
John Lee Pettymore walks up and shoots her in the head.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
You're going to take that away from Clark?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Roll firearms.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
He was talking himself out of it.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Now she's pinned down on the ground, right?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Yeah, what'd you roll?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Let's say I rolled a 98.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Not a critical failure, but...

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Not a critical failure.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
With a 98, you walk up.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
She looks at you through gritted teeth

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
and one of the teeth is chipped off and missing

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
and then she's gritting.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
Another part of her tooth just cracks off

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
and you watch the enamel flake off of the other teeth

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
like peeling of an onion.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
God damn it.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Just enough so that she can get this out

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
so you fucking know.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
She says,

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
non-human.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Non-human.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
You bastard.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
You bastard.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
John winces as a piece of enamel hits him in the eye.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
And he sighs and he shakes his head and he says,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
all cops are bastards.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
And he pulls the trigger.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
And it clicks and you're out of ammo.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Fuck!

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Holy shit.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Clark, roll unarmed combat.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
She's gonna try to throw you off.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
She crit succeeds.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Oh my god.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
And I failed.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Just a regular fail.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
An 81 on a 70.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
55.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
She throws you off.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And immediately begins chanting.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
I'm going to spend luck for Anne Love

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
to take another turn and she continues chanting.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
John T. Fella!

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
John T. Fella!

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
I've got to grab some new headphones real quick.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
These are cutting in and out.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
I thought you were going to say that I just broke them.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
That's just what John says and he dips.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
She's like, yeah, no.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
No big.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Tell Murphy hi.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Say hello to Murphy for me.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
Oh, this is not going how I planned it all either.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Going into this, it was a debate about how we were going to,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
which place we were going to go.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
That wasn't.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
That's what I thought too.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I prepped a couple different options.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
Just like, I don't fucking know where they're going to go.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
John Lee Pettymore the 3rd, as she is chanting,

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
you feel the blade on top of your head

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
slowly sinking deeper into your skull.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Now, it says here that it's 2D10.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Oh shit.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
This knife does 2D10 damage when it has the spell being cast on it.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
So I'm going to show you the roll.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
He is moving his camera down so we can get a better view of the desk.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Is it 28?

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
So 8, 9, 10, right?

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Yep, 10.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
That puts me at 1.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Jesus Christ.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
He's holding on.

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
Very importantly, you have to roll a constitution check here to stay conscious.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
Okay, because of his robot bones, he gets a plus 10, which puts him at 70.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Fuck.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Fuck.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
It's a fuck because he dropped the dice.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
Alright, do you want me to tell you what it says on the floor or can I re-roll it?

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
The way you said that.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Thomas?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Is a floor dice a cock dice?

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
Do you remember every single time we rolled off the table when we used to play in the same room?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
What was the rule?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Call it from the floor.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
No.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
If one falls off, you re-roll both.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Oh, awesome.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Okay.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Man.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
So I didn't just roll a 94.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Thomas, there's a bug on you.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
I rolled a 64.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Do you think you got a fly up by your collar?

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
No, it's this firefly.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
It might be the same one I saw last night.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
It's like really old.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
How do you know?

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
It's gray.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Kind of, yeah.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
It's wizened.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Or it's really sick.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
It's a wizened firefly.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
But it looks wizened.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
It's like little chips of color have been flaked off its shell and shit.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Oh, that's sad.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
What'd you roll?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
A 64 on a 70.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Oh, yeah.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
You're going to be able to stay conscious, but you feel...

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah, and for some reason in the back of your throat, it's like a phantom sensation.

42:24.000 --> 42:30.000
Like the knife is all the way down inside your throat, even though you know that would

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
be like wild if that was true, but it like hurts as you scream.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
We need an ultra violence tag for this episode.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
And as you scream, Clark is looking at you and he sees a shimmer in the back of your mouth.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Oh my God.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Maybe I'm the overseer.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
Maybe you've got one hit point.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
I want to try and shoot her to make her stop chanting.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Roll firearms.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Oh my God.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
It's a 99.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Oh, that's good.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
That's really good.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
I told you not to roll so much before the episode, Joe.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Oh no.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Clark, you're so freaked out by...

43:28.000 --> 43:35.000
You look back at John Lee Bettymore and you see this shimmering as the knife is just literally

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
moving further and further into his skull without anyone touching it.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
And then as he's screaming, you see it in the back of his mouth.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
And as you go to fire the gun.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Yeah, just fumble it out of the holster so terribly wrong.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
And it lands directly in between you and Anne Love.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
John Lee Pettymore with one hit point left.

43:58.000 --> 44:05.000
Blood dripping down as if your head is a chocolate fountain.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
Blood is covering everything, including all over your eyes.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
So you're going to be at a negative 20 for any action you take that requires sight.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Where was Anne Love?

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Is she still just on the ground in front of me?

44:20.000 --> 44:25.000
No, she's standing and I'm picturing she's like backed up to the pond, essentially.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
You're all just standing in murky, muddy water, splashing about.

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
So the gun just fell to the point to where you can't see it in this murky, muddy water

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
because there's enough water covering the grass in this area that it is even spilled

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
over in the streets behind you.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
So she's just like at the edge of Bean's Pond.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
The overfull Bean's Pond.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah, I just want to try to reach out and crush her with my robot hands.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
Like, crush her skull.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
You can run up to her and try to attack her with your hands.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
She passes a 14 and he's shaking his head no.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
89.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Oh no!

45:09.000 --> 45:15.000
I'm like blind with blood, so I just imagine myself just like stumbling straight forward

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
and falling into the muck.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
And she kind of, as you're falling forward, she puts her foot out and kicks the top of

45:23.000 --> 45:28.000
your head so that the top of the knife goes straight into the ground and just...

45:29.000 --> 45:37.000
And the body of John Lee Pettymore lies flaccid face down in muddy water.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
I'll see you guys next time, Loop.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Bye, Thomas!

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Bye, guys.

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
Do I need to be on call at all this evening or is that pretty much it for...

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
Well, hold on, Joe. Take off your headphones.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
I'm off.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Hey, how much luck do you have?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
25.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Fuck.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I need 30, right?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
You need 30.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
God damn it.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
I was going to have... The ball could have popped out and I was going to have you control it.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
Oh, I could... How much is it to avoid major damage?

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
Oh, yeah. You should have done that earlier, but you can do it on this one.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I'll do it on this one.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Okay. Sounds good.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Okay.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
So that one only did one hit point of damage, so you get to keep your one hit point.

46:28.000 --> 46:34.000
It hits on a rock coming out of my chin and can't go all the way through.

46:34.000 --> 46:43.000
Yeah, there's a rock floating along in the water that gets stuck right above your chest on your throat

46:43.000 --> 46:50.000
and so as it dinks in, it just right into the rock instead of all the way through, finishing you off.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
And you're still going to lay flaccid there and you're just going to stay on the call

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
and we'll let Joe think whatever he wants to think, but you're going to lose 10 luck.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
I would suggest spending the other 15 during this.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Can you show me the luck chart real quick?

47:03.000 --> 47:11.000
What you can do now is you can avoid unconsciousness for one point per round, but it doubles each round.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
So one luck the first round, two, right?

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Yeah. And then four and then eight.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
And then after that, there's just adjusting any rolls.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
You can adjust one to one.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
For...

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Like if you rolled it...

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
So up or down for...

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Gotcha.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Okay.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
I've got to hit the restroom real quick if we want to keep Joe in suspense for just a little longer.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Actually, I'll probably finish out the episode with Joe.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Okay.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
We'll do one round with just him while you're kind of coming back.

47:41.000 --> 48:00.000
Joe, Clark Bishop sees John Lee Pettymore fall face first into this murky, mucky, muddy six-inch splash zone.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
God, no!

48:01.000 --> 48:08.000
Right in front of Anne Love as she just kicks the back of his head down toward the ground.

48:08.000 --> 48:17.000
And she looks up at you and her eyes are massive.

48:17.000 --> 48:27.000
Take me to the fucking book, Clark!

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
You killed him! You killed him! I'm not taking you anywhere!

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
And I want to shoot again.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
Did you have a second gun? Did you have two guns?

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Oh, fuck. God fucking hell.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
I did have two guns until I gave one to Drew.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
You gave it to Drew, who I realized...

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
In re-listening to the episode, already had a gun.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Already had a gun!

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
Yeah. Yeah. Imagine how great I felt re-listening to that episode.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
And especially now.

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
Drew's just driving off with his two guns.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
God damn it.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
He gives one to the cat.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
Well, fuck. She said take me to the fucking book.

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
Clark's freaked the fuck out. Just saw John die.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
Anne, I don't know where the book is. I don't know where the book is.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
I can't help you. You fucking killed John! Why?

49:21.000 --> 49:29.000
Any anger left on her face dissipates as a smile creeps in

49:29.000 --> 49:38.000
across both corners of her mouth, lifting upward as she stares you directly in the eyes.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
Well, Clark? The vector was my mission, wasn't it?

49:51.000 --> 50:19.000
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

50:19.000 --> 50:30.000
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
With no mind at all.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
No mind at all.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
No mind at all.
