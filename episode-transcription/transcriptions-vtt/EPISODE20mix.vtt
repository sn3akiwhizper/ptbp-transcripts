00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
Greetings my sheeple, it's your shepherd, wolf the dog, and I'm here to shear all your

00:08.880 --> 00:13.120
wooly little coats so y'all can be a little more comfortable today.

00:13.120 --> 00:18.040
And when I say shear your coats, I really mean give y'all some updates on what's really

00:18.040 --> 00:25.000
going down here in contention from 694.2 PTBP my babies.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.540
This week on Howlin' with Wolf, your best buddy wolf is gonna read one of those fine

00:29.540 --> 00:36.540
5 star reviews from iTunes because it makes wolf feel oh so nice and makes him feel like

00:36.540 --> 00:42.740
he's part of a community instead of just isolated in this basement studio here in dreary old

00:42.740 --> 00:43.740
contention.

00:43.740 --> 00:53.540
Emma Mara was kind enough to write a 5 star review titled Horror, Jokes, and Mystery!

00:53.540 --> 00:59.460
The review reads, A really great listen if you love D&D podcasts that have a strong narrative

00:59.540 --> 01:00.740
focus.

01:00.740 --> 01:05.100
Really fun for those of us that care more about the mystery than about the mechanics

01:05.100 --> 01:06.700
of dice rolls.

01:06.700 --> 01:11.300
This one has a mix of good humor and a pretty chilling story line.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.300
Hell yeah, Emma.

01:13.300 --> 01:18.700
Your buddy wolf loves a set of mechanics that don't interfere with the story telling.

01:18.700 --> 01:21.820
Last time the story was getting wild.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.620
It's the news y'all.

01:23.620 --> 01:28.820
A vocal group of the contention population are protesting and letting these officers

01:28.820 --> 01:30.740
know how they feel.

01:30.740 --> 01:36.820
Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like calls about

01:36.820 --> 01:42.620
missing persons, animals in the ponds and creeks, and a voicemail from the feds.

01:42.620 --> 01:49.540
Doug, Dr. Marie Jacobs' husband who is currently inhabiting the body of the cat Salem, showed

01:49.540 --> 01:54.740
the officers the animals are hiding in the water because the oily substance cannot get

01:54.740 --> 01:57.260
them in the ponds and creeks.

01:57.260 --> 02:04.700
Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, and historical society member reveal some interesting

02:04.700 --> 02:10.700
information to the officers about the picture from the odd camera John found in Julie Maxwell's

02:10.700 --> 02:14.740
car as well as about Cole's orphanage.

02:14.740 --> 02:21.660
In James the mill worker's house, they found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table,

02:21.660 --> 02:27.260
a bunch of cleaning supplies and random materials and a small enclave behind an oil painting

02:27.260 --> 02:33.500
of a rose, a few loose tiles in the kitchen where something buried has been dragged out,

02:33.500 --> 02:39.900
and a 12 foot deep pit under a trap door with two corpses and an officer Clark Bishop at

02:39.900 --> 02:40.900
the bottom.

02:40.900 --> 02:46.220
A heavy artillery weapon is being fired into the house from the front yard.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.340
This shit is intense y'all.

02:48.340 --> 02:49.780
You know what though?

02:49.780 --> 02:54.720
This calls for the premiere of a brand new song here on PTPP.

02:54.720 --> 02:59.060
This is Kudzu with No Backbone.

03:19.780 --> 03:35.380
Okay, so Clark is stuck in the bottom of a viscerally foul smelling 12 foot deep pit

03:35.380 --> 03:41.460
next to two corpses looking up at Keith and John who is lowering down one pant leg of

03:41.460 --> 03:45.140
Randy Angst's shit spoiled slacks.

03:45.140 --> 03:51.060
Just then, a brutally loud noise erupts from outside in the front yard and items in the

03:51.060 --> 03:53.580
house begin shattering.

03:53.580 --> 03:58.980
You are being fired on by some large artillery weapon.

03:58.980 --> 04:04.540
Your ears are shot and your vision clouds as dust billows about the room.

04:04.540 --> 04:10.900
The drywall is ripped to shreds, letting cold air and moonlight into the house.

04:10.900 --> 04:15.260
I need you to roll dodge in order to run or die for cover.

04:15.260 --> 04:19.740
Clark, you're actually in cover right now.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.220
What's going on up there?

04:21.220 --> 04:22.220
I got a...

04:22.220 --> 04:23.220
I don't pass.

04:23.220 --> 04:24.340
39 out of 30.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.060
I do pass 42 out of 50.

04:26.060 --> 04:30.180
I don't remember putting points into dodge, but I'm really happy I did.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.180
Okay.

04:31.180 --> 04:34.260
Success is going to gain you one D6 of cover.

04:34.260 --> 04:37.460
So what are you hiding behind after you roll?

04:37.460 --> 04:38.460
We'll find out.

04:38.460 --> 04:39.460
Okay, yeah.

04:39.460 --> 04:40.460
I got a five.

04:41.020 --> 04:46.940
I'm on my way to get those shit pants, so I tumble into the bathroom and take Randy

04:46.940 --> 04:48.620
Anx with me into the tub.

04:48.620 --> 04:49.620
Awesome.

04:49.620 --> 04:50.620
Fucking baller, dog.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.620
Pantsless Randy.

04:51.620 --> 04:52.620
Pantsless Randy.

04:52.620 --> 04:57.860
These extremely large rounds are still going to fly through the house, so I need you both

04:57.860 --> 05:00.980
to roll luck to see if you get hit.

05:00.980 --> 05:04.620
15 on a 55.

05:04.620 --> 05:05.620
Two on a 65.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.260
Way to roll good, boy.

05:07.260 --> 05:09.860
We are some lucky boys.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.260
You lucky sons of guns.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.260
All right.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.260
I need...

05:13.260 --> 05:14.260
Call my mom a bitch.

05:14.260 --> 05:15.260
I need all of you to roll.

05:15.260 --> 05:16.260
Take that out.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.260
Take that out.

05:17.260 --> 05:18.260
I love my mom.

05:18.260 --> 05:24.020
Call my mom a bitch.

05:24.020 --> 05:28.580
My parents were humans and not firearms.

05:28.580 --> 05:31.980
I need you all to roll sanity for me.

05:31.980 --> 05:32.980
Just a zero one.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.980
Oh, what's my sanity at?

05:34.980 --> 05:35.980
Oh, I pass.

05:35.980 --> 05:36.980
Including me.

05:36.980 --> 05:38.980
Including you for the fire.

05:38.980 --> 05:40.980
Oh, I pass.

05:40.980 --> 05:42.980
13 on a 29.

05:42.980 --> 05:45.980
I got a 50 on a 20, so I don't pass.

05:45.980 --> 05:46.980
Oh, no.

05:46.980 --> 05:47.980
50 on a 29.

05:47.980 --> 05:48.980
So I still don't pass.

05:48.980 --> 05:50.660
John, you just lose one.

05:50.660 --> 05:51.980
The other boys don't lose any.

05:51.980 --> 05:54.540
Keith, you're going to be the only one who can see this.

05:54.540 --> 05:56.180
I would tell them anyway.

05:56.180 --> 06:02.540
The front door of the house flies back into the foyer like a playing card being thrown.

06:02.540 --> 06:06.420
A staggering figure walks slowly through the doorway.

06:06.460 --> 06:12.660
He is a looming, overweight man wearing an all-black combat uniform, and he has a large

06:12.660 --> 06:15.080
scar over his right eye.

06:15.080 --> 06:20.680
He holds up his left hand and you see his arm is cut off at his wrist, but there is

06:20.680 --> 06:22.940
a wire attached to the nub.

06:22.940 --> 06:29.100
You hear a zzzzip as the wire begins retracting into his arm and you see the front door whip

06:29.100 --> 06:30.740
back into his possession.

06:30.740 --> 06:33.620
He holds it up like a shield as he faces you.

06:33.620 --> 06:34.620
Roll Sanity.

06:34.620 --> 06:37.140
They just gave us a D&D boss.

06:37.140 --> 06:39.700
We just got into Resident Evil.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.620
I pass again on a 10 on a 26.

06:42.620 --> 06:46.820
Okay, Keith, you just let out a shriek as you lose one sanity.

06:46.820 --> 06:51.220
That was really good.

06:51.220 --> 06:53.660
You take direction really well.

06:53.660 --> 06:57.820
If only we had equipped ourselves with all these weapons and body armor.

06:57.820 --> 07:01.700
I was just supposed to say, did we officially put them in the car?

07:01.700 --> 07:03.300
We did nothing with them.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.660
So they're still just on that table, right?

07:05.660 --> 07:08.860
And I'm like very close to that table, right?

07:08.860 --> 07:10.860
Tell me when it's my turn.

07:10.860 --> 07:11.860
Keith, it's your turn.

07:11.860 --> 07:12.860
What do you do?

07:12.860 --> 07:13.860
I forgot what we were doing.

07:13.860 --> 07:16.500
Like how far away is the table full of guns?

07:16.500 --> 07:18.540
It's a move action away.

07:18.540 --> 07:19.540
Okay.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.180
Let me ask you this.

07:21.180 --> 07:26.180
Can I pull my sidearm and shoot at him while I move to that table?

07:26.180 --> 07:27.180
Yes.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.180
In one move.

07:28.180 --> 07:30.660
You will take a negative 20 percent.

07:30.660 --> 07:31.660
On my firearms?

07:31.660 --> 07:32.660
Yes.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.020
I rolled a five.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.020
Hell yeah.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.020
Fuck yeah, dude.

07:37.020 --> 07:38.020
Is it too late?

07:38.020 --> 07:40.860
I guess I already rolled, so it's too late for me to do like a called shot.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.860
Yeah.

07:41.860 --> 07:42.860
Okay.

07:42.860 --> 07:43.860
Okay.

07:43.860 --> 07:44.860
Then I just shoot at him.

07:44.860 --> 07:48.740
You move toward the flipped over coffee table full of guns and body armor and such as you

07:48.740 --> 07:51.500
fire at this giant man.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.500
Quick question.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.740
I don't know if we said we should put that on or if I said I...

07:55.740 --> 07:56.740
Should.

07:56.740 --> 07:57.740
Okay.

07:57.740 --> 08:00.740
So go ahead and roll a d10 for damage.

08:00.740 --> 08:01.740
10.

08:01.740 --> 08:02.740
Holy shit.

08:02.740 --> 08:03.740
No, it's a...

08:03.740 --> 08:04.740
It's a one.

08:04.740 --> 08:05.740
Fuck.

08:05.740 --> 08:06.740
It was a one.

08:06.740 --> 08:07.740
God damn it.

08:07.740 --> 08:08.740
Oh, wait.

08:08.740 --> 08:09.740
But that was a...

08:09.740 --> 08:10.740
Yeah.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.740
I'll re...

08:11.740 --> 08:12.740
Yeah.

08:12.740 --> 08:13.740
It was a one.

08:13.740 --> 08:14.740
Okay.

08:14.740 --> 08:20.740
So you were firing center mass at this guy, but as you're running away...

08:20.740 --> 08:22.700
Am I running away or towards him?

08:22.700 --> 08:25.060
You're running away from him toward the table.

08:25.060 --> 08:26.060
Okay.

08:26.060 --> 08:27.060
I was thinking that it was...

08:27.060 --> 08:28.060
So it's not in between us.

08:28.060 --> 08:29.060
No.

08:29.060 --> 08:30.060
Okay.

08:30.380 --> 08:34.700
As you're running toward the coffee table, you are firing at him and you clip his arms

08:34.700 --> 08:41.060
and you hear one ricochet off, but you hear another one go in, but it's not a through

08:41.060 --> 08:44.160
and through and you just hear this like, okay.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.220
So it's like the bullet is lodged into one of his arms.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.220
Yeah.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.020
As I'm running and shooting in between...

08:50.020 --> 08:51.260
How many shots do I fire?

08:51.260 --> 08:52.260
Three.

08:52.260 --> 08:56.780
In between shots, I'm screaming mainly at John, but also to Clark.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.380
Hey guys, we got company.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.380
I need help.

08:59.380 --> 09:00.380
John, what do you do?

09:00.380 --> 09:02.180
I say, Randy, you stay right here.

09:02.180 --> 09:04.740
Are there two stories or one story in this house?

09:04.740 --> 09:05.740
One.

09:05.740 --> 09:06.740
Okay.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.380
How close is the bathroom to the back door?

09:08.380 --> 09:09.380
Halfway.

09:09.380 --> 09:13.540
Hey, just remember the sniper rifle is in the bathroom with you.

09:13.540 --> 09:17.140
I just remembered that the sniper rifle was in the bathroom with me.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.140
Sorry.

09:18.140 --> 09:22.740
Randy rolls over in the bathtub and he was like laying on it.

09:22.740 --> 09:23.740
Randy.

09:23.740 --> 09:26.340
Randy, do you know how to use a pistol?

09:26.340 --> 09:28.260
Oh yes, of course.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.260
Really?

09:29.260 --> 09:30.260
Did you just stay here?

09:30.260 --> 09:32.540
I should probably just stay here.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.540
Okay.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.820
All right.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.460
You stay put, buddy.

09:36.460 --> 09:38.380
Contention PDs on this.

09:38.380 --> 09:43.100
And I bust out the door with my pistol in one hand and like sniper rifle at my hip.

09:43.100 --> 09:46.020
You're immediately looking down a hallway that looks into the foyer.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.600
The foyer is the room this is all happening in?

09:47.600 --> 09:49.540
The foyer is the room where this man is, yeah.

09:49.540 --> 09:50.540
Can I see him?

09:50.540 --> 09:51.540
Oh yeah.

09:51.540 --> 09:52.540
Okay.

09:52.540 --> 09:55.220
He's on the other side of the hole in the ground where Clark resides.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.220
Okay.

09:56.220 --> 10:01.260
So I take some cover behind the bathroom door, temporarily holster my pistol, and I'm going

10:01.260 --> 10:03.060
to take a sniper rifle shot.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.660
Like I'm going to line it up and try to plunk this guy in the head.

10:05.660 --> 10:09.340
I don't know if that's a called shot, but I want to use the best ... I'm just going

10:09.340 --> 10:10.340
to shoot him with a sniper rifle.

10:10.340 --> 10:11.340
Okay.

10:11.340 --> 10:12.340
Sounds good.

10:12.340 --> 10:13.340
Yeah.

10:13.340 --> 10:14.340
Just straight up and down.

10:14.340 --> 10:15.340
Firearms roll.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.340
98 on a 60.

10:16.340 --> 10:17.340
98 on a 60.

10:17.340 --> 10:19.700
Could have been worse.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.740
You accidentally shoot yourself in the head with a firearm.

10:22.740 --> 10:27.180
You shoot out the window in the front of the house that looks out on the street.

10:27.180 --> 10:28.680
Clark, it's your turn.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.300
How deep is this hole that I'm in?

10:30.300 --> 10:31.300
12 feet.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.300
How deep is this hole that I'm in?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.300
How tall are you?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.300
Probably six foot something.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.300
Yeah.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.660
Is the hole perfectly square?

10:38.660 --> 10:40.460
Am I in an enclosed space?

10:40.460 --> 10:41.460
Yes.

10:41.460 --> 10:42.460
What are the dimensions?

10:42.460 --> 10:43.460
Five by five.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.460
By?

10:44.460 --> 10:45.460
Five.

10:45.460 --> 10:46.460
So it's-

10:46.460 --> 10:47.460
No.

10:47.460 --> 10:48.460
Five by five by 12.

10:48.460 --> 10:49.460
Yeah.

10:49.460 --> 10:55.300
He's just standing there, his head's broken up.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.300
Totally exposed.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.300
Guys.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.300
Guys, help me.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.300
He's like standing-

10:59.300 --> 11:02.740
The giant guy just kicks Clark's head off.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.300
Five by five by 12.

11:04.300 --> 11:08.900
I got nothing, so I'm going to look through the pockets of these people down here.

11:08.900 --> 11:13.060
He's just kidding.

11:13.060 --> 11:15.020
Clark is becoming one of us.

11:15.020 --> 11:16.020
Police work.

11:16.020 --> 11:17.020
I got nothing.

11:17.020 --> 11:18.780
Police work never sleeps.

11:18.780 --> 11:23.100
Rifling through the pockets of these corpses, you find-

11:23.100 --> 11:24.100
A ladder.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.100
Sweet.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.700
Go, go gadget ladder.

11:28.700 --> 11:36.740
You find a piece of paper that has a circle on it, a filled in circle, and that circle

11:36.740 --> 11:40.460
is surrounded by six circles.

11:40.460 --> 11:41.460
I remember that.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.660
I remember that too.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.900
And it's hand drawn.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.500
Hey, they like the faux place, just like us.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.500
Fuh?

11:47.500 --> 11:48.500
Yeah.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.360
What is the Fuh place called?

11:51.360 --> 11:52.360
The Daily Fuh.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.480
The Daily Fuh.

11:53.480 --> 11:59.900
This giant man in the all black combat uniform with the large scar over his right eye steps

11:59.900 --> 12:07.020
forward and looks down into the pit at Clark Bishop.

12:07.020 --> 12:11.740
And he holds out his other hand and he aims it at you.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.580
I need you to roll dodge.

12:13.580 --> 12:17.020
Is his other hand a wire thing too?

12:17.020 --> 12:19.660
So far it looks like a hand with a glove on it.

12:19.660 --> 12:21.220
I do not pass.

12:21.220 --> 12:23.020
97 on a 50.

12:23.020 --> 12:26.420
He does.

12:26.420 --> 12:30.840
So he shoots straight down at you and you try to dodge out of the way and you lose five

12:30.840 --> 12:38.820
damage as his hand reaches completely into your shoulder and grips.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.420
Wait, did his arm stretch?

12:41.420 --> 12:48.580
His fist shot off of his arm down into the pit at you and then grabbed onto your shoulder

12:48.580 --> 12:54.720
where your collarbone is and then gripped into your skin and his fingers are inside

12:54.720 --> 12:58.900
you as he's holding onto your shoulder.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.860
His hand is still attached to his arm though?

13:00.860 --> 13:02.560
Yeah, by a wire.

13:02.560 --> 13:09.660
So I need you to roll unarmed combat against his in order to get this out of your shoulder.

13:09.660 --> 13:17.580
His is definitely armed combat.

13:17.580 --> 13:18.580
It doesn't work twice.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.580
I pass.

13:19.580 --> 13:20.580
25.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.860
25 on a 70.

13:22.860 --> 13:24.860
You're 70 unarmed combat?

13:24.860 --> 13:25.860
Mm-hmm.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.860
He's 72 though, right?

13:27.860 --> 13:28.860
And you're rolling against him?

13:28.860 --> 13:36.900
He's 70 so he has to roll higher than a 25 but under a 70 and the suspense is great as

13:36.900 --> 13:40.540
Zach fiddles around the floor to find the dice that he dropped.

13:40.540 --> 13:41.540
Zach.

13:41.540 --> 13:42.940
Ripping his earphones out.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.500
Zach, would you like some dice?

13:44.500 --> 13:45.500
No!

13:45.500 --> 13:47.180
Where did it go?

13:47.180 --> 13:49.420
Daddy would you like some sausage?

13:49.420 --> 13:51.260
Daddy would you like some sausages?

13:51.260 --> 13:53.180
Joe, what did you roll?

13:53.180 --> 13:54.980
25 on a 70.

13:54.980 --> 13:56.860
It is staying in there.

13:56.860 --> 14:04.700
The fist is locked into place and it is actually his turn again.

14:04.700 --> 14:05.700
How?

14:05.700 --> 14:07.820
He's got crazy decks or something.

14:07.820 --> 14:08.820
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:08.820 --> 14:09.820
No, it's not.

14:09.820 --> 14:10.820
It's Keith's turn.

14:10.820 --> 14:11.820
That's what I fucking thought.

14:11.820 --> 14:18.060
Is it going to take a whole like move to grab a gun or can I grab a gun and shoot at him?

14:18.060 --> 14:19.620
You can grab a gun and shoot at him.

14:19.620 --> 14:20.620
Okay.

14:20.620 --> 14:21.620
What's my options here?

14:21.620 --> 14:27.020
You got a couple assault rifles and some heavy pistols, some light pistols.

14:27.020 --> 14:28.260
Actually here's what I want to do.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.260
I want to grab.

14:29.260 --> 14:33.540
Is it just body armor like a bulletproof vest or tell me if I can do this.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.260
I'm going to grab a bulletproof vest and a gun and hide behind the table.

14:37.260 --> 14:38.580
Yeah, you can definitely do that.

14:38.580 --> 14:39.580
What do I need to roll?

14:39.580 --> 14:40.580
Nothing.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.580
That's what I do.

14:41.580 --> 14:42.580
Okay.

14:42.580 --> 14:43.700
Wait, so what are my gun options here?

14:43.700 --> 14:44.700
Assault rifles.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.020
I don't know anything about guns.

14:46.020 --> 14:47.020
Okay.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.500
Grab the bulletproof vest, throw it on.

14:48.500 --> 14:54.560
I grab a fully automatic assault rifle and then I duck behind the, you know, flipped

14:54.560 --> 14:56.540
over table or you know, whatever it is.

14:56.540 --> 14:57.540
John, what do you do?

14:57.540 --> 15:00.620
I take another shot at him from behind the bathroom door.

15:00.620 --> 15:02.620
Fire away.

15:02.620 --> 15:03.940
91.

15:03.940 --> 15:08.060
You miss opposite like you overcorrect and shoot out the window on the other side of

15:08.060 --> 15:09.060
the door.

15:09.060 --> 15:10.060
Getting close.

15:10.060 --> 15:11.060
Clark, it's your turn.

15:11.060 --> 15:16.660
I want to take my hand and do a quick wrap around the cord and use that as my repel cord

15:16.660 --> 15:18.460
and walk up the wall.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.460
Hell yeah.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.460
Yes.

15:20.460 --> 15:25.820
Legit, that's the coolest thing any of us have done in any campaign.

15:25.820 --> 15:30.420
And the reason that you don't have to roll is as such.

15:31.420 --> 15:34.780
That's so badass.

15:34.780 --> 15:37.860
What do you do when you're teetering on the edge at the top?

15:37.860 --> 15:40.920
When you say teetering, am I out of the hole?

15:40.920 --> 15:45.540
I'm saying as you get, as you come out of the hole, I'm going to let you do one thing.

15:45.540 --> 15:46.540
Uh, yeah.

15:46.540 --> 15:47.540
I'm just going to shoot at him.

15:47.540 --> 15:48.540
Describe it.

15:48.540 --> 15:49.540
Uh, well, hang on.

15:49.540 --> 15:50.540
Roll and then we'll, uh.

15:50.540 --> 15:51.540
Hang on.

15:51.540 --> 15:52.540
Yeah.

15:52.540 --> 15:53.540
Hang on.

15:53.540 --> 15:54.540
There's the combat ones over there too.

15:54.540 --> 15:55.540
I know.

15:55.540 --> 15:56.540
I know.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.540
You can't roll and then do the minus 40.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.540
Right.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.780
Cause that's what I would have done when I got a five.

16:00.140 --> 16:04.060
I'm going to do a, uh, I'm going to do a fuck.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.060
I'm just going to shoot at him.

16:05.060 --> 16:11.000
Um, I I'm hoping that I, he should have his, uh, yeah, I'm just shooting at him.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Just shooting at him full on shooting at him.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.520
And I am not hitting him with a 98 on an 80.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.980
The wire is slack.

16:18.980 --> 16:25.600
Uh, as you make it up to the top, as he, you are firing at him, he literally just grabs

16:25.600 --> 16:30.580
onto your hand and moves it away from you actually hitting him.

16:30.580 --> 16:34.680
And so you're firing up at the ceiling and it's his turn.

16:34.680 --> 16:38.400
I need you to roll against unarmed combat.

16:38.400 --> 16:43.480
I was going to say maybe he has some different dice.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.420
Pass but not a great pass.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.240
It's 21 on a 70.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.240
That's a pretty good pass.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.240
Okay.

16:49.240 --> 16:54.040
Uh, he passed with a 22 on a 70.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.040
Fuck.

16:55.480 --> 16:59.480
Critical success.

16:59.480 --> 17:07.280
So you actually, oh, I'm just realizing what happens now.

17:07.280 --> 17:16.160
He retracts his hand and the wire begins zipping back into his wrist nub.

17:16.160 --> 17:24.280
And as it does, I need you to roll a constitution, a very important constitution check.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.860
Pass 52 on a 65.

17:26.860 --> 17:33.680
The wire cuts through your skin as it retracts back as it's wrapped around your forearm.

17:33.680 --> 17:39.020
It cuts all the way into your skin, but it doesn't go all the way through.

17:39.020 --> 17:45.420
You can actually feel this wire rubbing up against your nerves on one side and your bone

17:45.420 --> 17:46.840
on the other.

17:46.840 --> 17:54.520
And a unfathomable pain is coursing through your entire body and you become lightheaded

17:54.520 --> 18:01.200
as he brings you in and punches you directly in the mouth for 11 damage.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.120
Oh man.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.460
Your mouth was so purdy.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.800
I'm glad I didn't touch the suit of armor.

18:08.800 --> 18:13.840
I'm at seven hit points.

18:13.840 --> 18:21.520
My mouth and arm.

18:21.520 --> 18:31.040
Yeah, that's, so you are, he, he lets go of you and retracts fully, but you are on the

18:31.040 --> 18:32.040
ground.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.380
Keith, it is your turn.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.360
You are hiding as this is happening to officer Bishop.

18:36.360 --> 18:41.120
You are hiding a tactical.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.720
I have nothing against it.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.600
Okay, so I got a question.

18:44.600 --> 18:49.880
Forty if partially behind cover or minus 40 I am at that point or can I stand up and like

18:49.880 --> 18:52.640
not be, Oh yeah, that's for the opponent.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.800
Oh, perfect.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.800
Okay.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.200
I need this described to me.

18:56.200 --> 19:00.160
He's got one hand has the door as a shield.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.240
Yep.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.800
Clark is on the ground.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.800
He's on the ground.

19:03.800 --> 19:04.800
He's not being held up.

19:04.800 --> 19:10.200
So if I do a cold shot to like just shoot at, shoot at the guy, but not, I don't necessarily

19:10.200 --> 19:11.200
want to do a headshot.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.160
I just want to shoot and not hit the door.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.160
Oh yeah.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.160
That would be a called shot.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.160
Minus 20.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.160
Yeah.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.160
Fuck.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.160
That sucks.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.160
Cause you, you would have hit him.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.160
I would have hit him.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.160
Oh, that sucks.

19:23.160 --> 19:28.680
Uh, so you are firing at him and he holds up the door and I'm also how far away from

19:28.680 --> 19:29.680
him am I?

19:29.680 --> 19:30.680
That's cool though.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.480
Well, you're in the living room and he's in the foyer.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.760
The coffee table is in the living room and you hit on the other side of it.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.760
So you're at least 25 feet away from him.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.760
Okay.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.640
So I'm going to take this into consideration.

19:41.640 --> 19:47.440
I have a fully automatic rifle and I'm shooting through a presumably wooden door.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.440
Oh yes.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.760
The uh, the door gets, uh, so what'd you roll?

19:50.760 --> 19:59.640
So I rolled a 64 on a 70 minus 20 minus 20, but you cut the door in half and he is like

19:59.640 --> 20:01.240
crouched behind it.

20:01.240 --> 20:07.680
And as the door falls, you see him pop his head with the scar over his right eye above

20:07.680 --> 20:09.560
the door and just stare at you.

20:09.560 --> 20:10.840
John, what do you do?

20:10.840 --> 20:16.040
I am aiming this turn, which will give me 20% to hit on the next turn.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.040
Awesome.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.440
I wish I'd read that card a turn ago.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.360
Clark, what are you doing?

20:21.360 --> 20:23.520
Scrambling as far away as I can.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.520
Okay.

20:24.520 --> 20:28.240
Probably toward John toward getting deeper into the house.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.640
Is there anything in this game since I'm not taking a combat action that I can go even

20:31.640 --> 20:33.280
further than I normally would be able to?

20:33.280 --> 20:34.280
Yeah.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.520
I would like to get really fucking far into the house.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.520
Where do you want to go?

20:36.520 --> 20:37.520
Maybe back.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.520
Behind the bathroom.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.520
Behind me.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.520
Behind John.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.520
Crawling like through the kitchen door.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.520
Yeah.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.520
Cool.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.280
I'm still aiming, but I do like with one hand, I like help reel him in.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.280
Nice.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.280
Cool.

20:47.280 --> 20:53.400
This massive dude throws down the half door that Keith just shot through and begins running

20:53.400 --> 21:01.760
toward Keith at full speed while reaching behind him and pulling out a giant metal crowbar

21:01.760 --> 21:03.740
from off of his back.

21:03.740 --> 21:11.720
And he jumps and he is going to try to bring it down on Keith over through the coffee table

21:11.720 --> 21:13.540
on the other side of it where you're hiding.

21:13.540 --> 21:21.160
So he has a 50%, you're going to roll dodge, but you get to add 20% on it for being behind

21:21.160 --> 21:22.160
cover.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.160
Okay.

21:23.160 --> 21:24.160
That gives me 60.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.160
Fuck.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.160
It's a crit fail.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.560
66 on a 60.

21:32.560 --> 21:38.320
Oh, Keith, that's a, that's a pretty big bummer.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.320
Yeah.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.240
Uh, it is a big bummer.

21:41.240 --> 21:44.040
Oh my God.

21:44.040 --> 21:52.160
Keith, this dude, you just hear this like as the floor is moving, as this giant dude

21:52.160 --> 22:01.360
comes running toward you and then you hear quiet as a giant metal crowbar just slams

22:01.360 --> 22:07.920
into your side and it doesn't, it doesn't poke you, but he straight up just like baseball

22:07.920 --> 22:12.820
bat swings it into your rib cage that doing 11 damage.

22:12.820 --> 22:15.820
That puts me at nine.

22:15.820 --> 22:21.180
He turns his head and looks away from you and Keith, it appears that this man's face

22:21.200 --> 22:22.700
is a mask.

22:22.700 --> 22:28.660
You can actually, as he's been jostling himself about, you can see the glinting metal shine

22:28.660 --> 22:36.020
from beneath as his skin sloughs off of its current placement.

22:36.020 --> 22:44.700
So does this whole like the head skin fall off or does his face?

22:44.700 --> 22:47.780
His whole head skin is just slightly askew.

22:47.780 --> 22:48.780
Okay.

22:48.780 --> 22:50.620
It's loud to one side.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.620
Yes.

22:51.620 --> 22:58.960
I don't know if it's realistic after taking a hit like that for you to be able to do anything

22:58.960 --> 23:00.260
besides like get away.

23:00.260 --> 23:01.740
Oh, it's not realistic.

23:01.740 --> 23:02.740
It's your turn though.

23:02.740 --> 23:03.740
And you can do anything.

23:03.740 --> 23:04.740
Yeah.

23:04.740 --> 23:05.740
Get this.

23:05.740 --> 23:06.740
Get this fucker.

23:06.740 --> 23:12.860
I mean, he used a door as a defense mechanism, so I think that he could be, you know what

23:12.860 --> 23:18.500
I, what I do is I, so he's like standing what, like a foot away from me.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.500
Yeah.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.500
Don't be afraid to get creative guys.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
Okay.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.220
So what I'm going to do, can I, can I stand up?

23:23.220 --> 23:24.460
Have we tried talking to him?

23:24.460 --> 23:27.300
I got creative and lost an arm.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.300
I want to stand up.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.300
Tell me, tell me what I can do from this.

23:31.300 --> 23:35.780
It might change my mind of what I want to do, but I want to stand up, jump on his back

23:35.780 --> 23:42.580
since he's not facing me and use my lock picking skills to try to like, he's a, I think he's

23:42.580 --> 23:43.580
a robot.

23:43.580 --> 23:46.060
So I want to like unlock his head from his body.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.420
That's fucking awesome.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.420
Yeah.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.100
You got creative.

23:50.100 --> 23:55.880
So I'm going to have to have you pass two tests in order to accomplish this.

23:55.880 --> 24:00.780
The first will be anything against his strength.

24:00.780 --> 24:05.080
So whatever you think you're going to use to hold on or stay put is his strength on

24:05.080 --> 24:06.080
top of him.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.080
Can I know that or not?

24:07.080 --> 24:08.820
I mean, no.

24:08.820 --> 24:09.820
It's high.

24:09.820 --> 24:10.820
Okay.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.980
So this guy's a nerd.

24:12.980 --> 24:15.260
You can do anything that like would make sense against that.

24:15.260 --> 24:16.260
I guess.

24:16.260 --> 24:17.260
Yeah.

24:17.260 --> 24:19.820
So I mean athletics, strength, strength is my highest.

24:19.820 --> 24:20.820
Dexterity.

24:20.820 --> 24:21.820
I don't know.

24:21.820 --> 24:22.820
Yes.

24:22.820 --> 24:23.820
Okay.

24:23.820 --> 24:24.820
I'll use decks, which is 60.

24:24.820 --> 24:25.820
Okay.

24:25.820 --> 24:26.820
So you're going to bear or even dodge.

24:26.820 --> 24:27.820
Like you just got to be like six.

24:27.820 --> 24:29.540
He's going to be my highest.

24:29.540 --> 24:35.900
So the dice don't like us tonight.

24:35.900 --> 24:36.900
Yeah.

24:36.900 --> 24:37.900
You should stop using those two.

24:37.900 --> 24:38.900
Yeah.

24:38.900 --> 24:43.780
I'm going to do you jump onto his back and he immediately just grabbed the like grabs

24:43.780 --> 24:47.220
you and throws you over him into the wall.

24:47.220 --> 24:52.140
So you go flying over his back into the wall, like upside down.

24:52.140 --> 24:53.740
You hit flat, right?

24:53.740 --> 24:59.020
You're back against the wall and then you slide down the wall and you take four damage

24:59.020 --> 25:00.020
guys.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.020
I'm very close to dying.

25:01.020 --> 25:02.020
These are good boys.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.020
Roll with these.

25:03.020 --> 25:04.020
John's your turn.

25:04.020 --> 25:05.020
I want to try a couple of things.

25:05.020 --> 25:08.300
Let me know if I can do this with my move, but I am, I'm going to move on a look real

25:08.300 --> 25:09.300
quick clock.

25:09.300 --> 25:12.740
You get, I give him a weary thumbs up and start to get up back to my feet.

25:12.740 --> 25:13.820
You're just looking at your arm.

25:13.820 --> 25:15.060
It's fucking cheese.

25:15.060 --> 25:16.060
Okay.

25:16.060 --> 25:17.060
I'm looking at his chair.

25:17.900 --> 25:18.900
I'm trying not to look at his cheese arm.

25:18.900 --> 25:19.900
Yeah.

25:19.900 --> 25:20.900
Uh, but I see that he's okay.

25:20.900 --> 25:25.660
I am going to run down the hallway, peek around the corner through the door that apparently

25:25.660 --> 25:27.460
would look into the foyer and the living room.

25:27.460 --> 25:28.460
Right.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.300
So I'm going to level my gun at him, but I'm going to, I am going to try something we haven't

25:31.300 --> 25:32.300
tried yet.

25:32.300 --> 25:33.300
I'm going to shout.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.300
Freeze.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.300
Contention PD.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.300
Great.

25:36.300 --> 25:40.580
And I would like to roll a persuade.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.180
No, I don't have to.

25:42.180 --> 25:43.180
That's not going to work.

25:43.180 --> 25:44.820
I mean, don't say that.

25:44.820 --> 25:47.380
Just do it.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.300
Go ahead and roll persuade if that's what you want to do.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.300
No.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.620
What I want to do is shoot him with the sniper rifle.

25:52.620 --> 25:53.620
So yeah.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.020
I mean, what do you want to do?

25:55.020 --> 25:58.280
Uh, does he still get a plus 20 aim or no?

25:58.280 --> 26:00.860
He did spend a whole turn doing it.

26:00.860 --> 26:01.860
Boy.

26:01.860 --> 26:02.860
That's hard.

26:02.860 --> 26:03.860
Yeah.

26:03.860 --> 26:04.860
That is hard.

26:04.860 --> 26:05.860
I don't see me getting a bonus here.

26:05.860 --> 26:06.860
Yeah.

26:06.860 --> 26:07.860
Exactly.

26:07.860 --> 26:08.860
I was, I was aiming.

26:08.860 --> 26:09.860
He moved.

26:09.860 --> 26:10.860
We would want the same courtesy to us.

26:10.860 --> 26:11.860
Yeah.

26:11.860 --> 26:12.860
Exactly.

26:12.860 --> 26:13.860
Exactly.

26:13.900 --> 26:19.540
Like if Zach was like, well, actually the MPC kid chucked up in a, and so you fucked.

26:19.540 --> 26:20.540
We would hate that.

26:20.540 --> 26:25.180
So yeah, I'm just going to move to where I can see him shout, freeze, contention PD.

26:25.180 --> 26:29.340
And then before I wait for response, uh, I'm going to just blast him.

26:29.340 --> 26:30.340
Okay.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.540
Actually, how about trying to blast him?

26:31.540 --> 26:33.760
He freezes.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.900
If you pass a persuade, I will give you a plus 20 on your shot.

26:37.900 --> 26:38.900
Ooh.

26:38.900 --> 26:39.900
I like it.

26:39.900 --> 26:40.900
Like I confuse them enough.

26:40.900 --> 26:41.900
Exactly.

26:41.900 --> 26:42.900
86.

26:42.940 --> 26:43.940
86.

26:43.940 --> 26:44.940
Fuck.

26:44.940 --> 26:45.940
On a 60.

26:45.940 --> 26:48.580
You guys remember earlier when I said we were rolling good, boys.

26:48.580 --> 26:49.580
Sorry.

26:49.580 --> 26:50.580
Yeah.

26:50.580 --> 26:51.580
That stopped.

26:51.580 --> 26:52.580
All right.

26:52.580 --> 26:53.580
Roll that firearm straight up and down.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.580
25 on a 60.

26:55.580 --> 26:56.580
All right.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.300
Two D 10 for damage.

26:58.300 --> 26:59.300
Two D 10.

26:59.300 --> 27:00.300
Fuck yeah.

27:00.300 --> 27:01.300
Eight.

27:01.300 --> 27:02.300
Eight.

27:02.300 --> 27:03.300
Or 35.

27:03.300 --> 27:05.300
Depending on what you want to get.

27:05.300 --> 27:06.300
Describe it.

27:06.300 --> 27:07.540
I see him just on instinct.

27:07.540 --> 27:10.740
I shout that idiot shit, which obviously isn't going to stop a robot.

27:10.780 --> 27:12.940
I'm like, freeze contention PD.

27:12.940 --> 27:14.620
And I'm just, I'm shooting from the hip.

27:14.620 --> 27:20.460
Like I've just got a high powered rifle in pretty close quarters and I just take a shot.

27:20.460 --> 27:21.460
Where does it hit?

27:21.460 --> 27:22.460
Right in his gut.

27:22.460 --> 27:23.460
Okay.

27:23.460 --> 27:24.460
Yeah.

27:24.460 --> 27:30.660
And you hear this like, that satisfies John Lee Pennymore.

27:30.660 --> 27:31.660
Clark, it's your turn.

27:31.660 --> 27:35.060
I want to make my way to behind John again.

27:35.060 --> 27:36.700
Can I use my good arm to shoot my pistol?

27:36.700 --> 27:37.700
Yeah.

27:37.700 --> 27:42.660
I want to shoot my pistol at the robot at the thing that's buzzing at this point.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.820
Some kind of beautiful mechanical man.

27:44.820 --> 27:45.820
Yeah.

27:45.820 --> 27:48.100
This is the first time you guys have noticed anything weird.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.460
I mean, outside of the arms flying off of him, that actually might've been the biggest

27:51.460 --> 27:52.460
tip off.

27:52.460 --> 27:53.460
Now they think about it.

27:53.460 --> 27:54.460
The hands flying off.

27:54.460 --> 27:55.460
Yeah.

27:55.460 --> 27:56.460
Yeah.

27:56.460 --> 27:57.460
And then maybe the fact that yeah, bullets didn't go through him earlier.

27:57.460 --> 27:58.460
Okay.

27:58.460 --> 27:59.460
So you knew he was a robot.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.800
Also, I met a robot earlier in this campaign.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.800
Did you?

28:01.800 --> 28:02.800
Yeah.

28:02.800 --> 28:06.340
Well, I met a wizard who passed me binary and I assumed he was a robot.

28:06.340 --> 28:11.020
I'm going to pull around, get up behind John and I've got a clear sight on the...

28:11.020 --> 28:12.020
You do indeed.

28:12.020 --> 28:14.780
And I'm going to take a shot at the boy with my good arm.

28:14.780 --> 28:20.780
Roll firearms and yeah.

28:20.780 --> 28:21.780
Just roll.

28:21.780 --> 28:22.780
I pass.

28:22.780 --> 28:23.780
Crit pass.

28:23.780 --> 28:24.780
Crit pass.

28:24.780 --> 28:27.780
33 on an 80.

28:27.780 --> 28:28.780
Okay.

28:28.780 --> 28:29.780
Describe it.

28:29.780 --> 28:30.780
You do 10 damage.

28:30.780 --> 28:31.780
Hang on real fast, Keith.

28:31.780 --> 28:32.780
You got thrown off him, right?

28:32.780 --> 28:33.780
You're not on him anymore?

28:33.780 --> 28:34.780
Correct.

28:34.780 --> 28:35.780
I'm shooting at his head.

28:36.220 --> 28:37.220
I'm on John's shoulder to steady it.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.220
Yes.

28:38.220 --> 28:39.220
Hell yeah.

28:39.220 --> 28:43.420
And that gives me a real perfect line of sight on the guy's head and I pop, pop, pop, pop.

28:43.420 --> 28:48.180
You fire your weapon into this guy's head and what happens is really fucking weird.

28:48.180 --> 28:53.540
So each shot makes his neck snap back as his head recoils from the bullets.

28:53.540 --> 28:59.020
His entire torso reclines fully like he's prepping to do the limbo, but his bottom half

28:59.020 --> 29:01.660
stays completely still.

29:01.660 --> 29:06.860
And like a spring, his body snaps back into an upright position and you see the skin drooped

29:06.860 --> 29:10.420
over his face is covered in bullet holes.

29:10.420 --> 29:16.940
The skin is all loose and off kilter and you can see a shiny metal where this thing's skull

29:16.940 --> 29:17.940
should be.

29:17.940 --> 29:20.820
Guys, we didn't ever consider it if this was a Terminator.

29:20.820 --> 29:21.820
So send your help us.

29:21.820 --> 29:25.260
No, I was going to make like a John Connor joke, Sarah Connor joke.

29:25.260 --> 29:26.260
Go for it.

29:26.260 --> 29:27.260
There's a John Connor, right?

29:27.260 --> 29:28.260
That's your son.

29:28.260 --> 29:29.260
Yeah, he's the other one.

29:29.420 --> 29:32.140
Like a Schwarzenegger impression for us.

29:32.140 --> 29:33.140
Yeah.

29:33.140 --> 29:39.180
Hello, my name, oh boy, dude.

29:39.180 --> 29:40.180
What was it about?

29:40.180 --> 29:45.740
Like the, like the eighties that was like, yeah, we like buff Eastern European actors.

29:45.740 --> 29:49.780
Well, that's just where all the buffest act, see, we as a people have always loved our

29:49.780 --> 29:54.060
buff actors, but yeah, but like used to, it was like the buffest dudes were, and also

29:54.060 --> 29:55.940
Austria is not Eastern European.

29:55.940 --> 29:58.220
That is as Western European as it gets.

29:58.220 --> 30:01.780
Well, it's on the border between the two, but it's like, so fucking German.

30:01.780 --> 30:05.900
Well, they once ruled an empire with Hungary, which is very Eastern.

30:05.900 --> 30:10.500
See, that was only 15 seconds of stuff that'll get edited out.

30:10.500 --> 30:15.500
What the fucking fans come back for time and time again is these neat little tidbits that

30:15.500 --> 30:16.580
we give them.

30:16.580 --> 30:24.340
So the, see the thing about the Austro-Hungarian empire, so Franz Ferdinand, you take me out.

30:28.220 --> 30:34.820
We good?

30:34.820 --> 30:35.820
Let's keep going.

30:35.820 --> 30:36.820
Yeah.

30:36.820 --> 30:42.620
So you begin singing, take me out as this robot man snaps back into place and it is

30:42.620 --> 30:45.360
now his turn.

30:45.360 --> 30:50.900
This giant being turns and looks at Keith Vigna who is on the ground and he moves his

30:50.900 --> 30:55.500
torso like he's going to approach Keith, but his bottom half isn't functioning.

30:55.500 --> 31:00.420
His head begins whirring and popping little crackles and short stunted movements.

31:00.420 --> 31:05.700
With a look of realization, the metal skull turns its attention to the two officers on

31:05.700 --> 31:07.780
the other side of the room.

31:07.780 --> 31:09.740
You see one of its eyes is dead.

31:09.740 --> 31:15.780
You put a bullet right through it, but the other eye stares directly at Clark and John.

31:15.780 --> 31:20.660
He holds out both arms and shoots his fist at the two of you.

31:20.660 --> 31:23.100
So I need both of you to roll dodge.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.980
18 on a 50.

31:25.980 --> 31:28.820
64 on a 50.

31:28.820 --> 31:29.820
I do not pass.

31:29.820 --> 31:32.700
John Lee Pettymore didn't know what dodge meant in the skill chart.

31:32.700 --> 31:35.780
He rolled a 50 on a 50 against John Lee Pettymore.

31:35.780 --> 31:38.500
Oh, that means he hits me, right?

31:38.500 --> 31:43.680
Okay, so he rolled a 50 against John Lee Pettymore and a 47 against Clark Bishop.

31:43.680 --> 31:49.300
And so these come at you, they're coming in real hot.

31:49.300 --> 31:53.180
Nine damage on John, three damage on Clark.

31:53.180 --> 31:54.500
I'm at four hit points.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
I'm at five.

31:55.500 --> 31:59.740
I don't think we're going to make it to the mill today, boys.

31:59.740 --> 32:10.400
You say as this fist completely rips into your rib cage, the fist goes right into John's

32:10.400 --> 32:17.180
rib cage and holds on tight and you can actually feel the fist clench down and grab two of

32:17.180 --> 32:20.220
your ribs and bring them closer together.

32:20.220 --> 32:21.780
Oh my god.

32:21.780 --> 32:26.100
Yeah, I would like to spend 10 points of luck to avoid that.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.100
Oh, cool.

32:27.100 --> 32:30.920
This is the first luck spend of the entire campaign.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.820
What does that rule say on luck?

32:32.820 --> 32:37.860
Spend 10 points to avoid major damage that reduces damage by 1d6.

32:37.860 --> 32:42.640
If I get six more hit points, that would be insanely helpful to me, but even one is very

32:42.640 --> 32:43.640
handy at this point.

32:43.640 --> 32:51.160
All right, so John spends 10 luck putting his luck down at 45, roll that d6 to get six

32:51.160 --> 32:52.160
hit points back.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.160
Four.

32:53.160 --> 32:54.160
Oh, pretty good.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.760
He gets four hit points back, putting him at nine.

32:56.760 --> 33:05.160
As the fist tries to reach completely in, its fingers only actually go skin deep.

33:05.160 --> 33:09.680
It actually gets caught on a screw that was put in there from my sprint racing days and

33:09.680 --> 33:13.080
jammed and it can't bring my ribs together like it wants to.

33:14.080 --> 33:22.640
And the claw actually grabs onto the forearm that had been recently shredded on Clark.

33:22.640 --> 33:28.480
Just pushing that nerve right up against the bone and the two are rubbing against each

33:28.480 --> 33:29.480
other.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.480
Uh, go ahead and nevermind.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.480
Nevermind.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.480
You're dead.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.480
You're dead.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.480
Fuck you.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.480
You're dead.

33:36.600 --> 33:43.920
So now I need you guys to both roll against his unarmed combat to try to get out of this

33:43.920 --> 33:44.920
grapple.

33:44.920 --> 33:49.680
Okay, the baseline unarmed combat status, 40% if you don't modify it at all, which I

33:49.680 --> 33:50.680
have not.

33:50.680 --> 33:51.680
58.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.680
I don't pass.

33:52.680 --> 33:56.920
67 on a 70.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.320
That's a great fucking roll.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.320
Hell yeah, dude.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.320
It is indeed.

34:00.320 --> 34:03.200
And you actually win your roll.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.200
Fuck yeah.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.040
He passed against Clark with an eight.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.440
So John, your fist is staying in.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.080
It's hooked on that screw.

34:12.080 --> 34:18.000
And Clark, describe how you get this, uh, this inspector gadget go-go fist off of your

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
forearm.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.840
I use my gun to pry off the fingers.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.840
Tink, tink, tink.

34:23.840 --> 34:24.840
Ooh, badass.

34:24.840 --> 34:28.560
Yeah, that's very cool.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.040
And it is Keith's turn.

34:30.040 --> 34:36.160
Is there any way I could roll luck to see if this body armor that I put on might have

34:36.160 --> 34:37.680
a knife in it?

34:37.680 --> 34:39.480
You have a knife on you already.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.120
Oh yeah, can I see if there was a bazooka in my pants?

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
Wait.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.120
Well, no, I don't.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.120
Well, I do have a knife on me already.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.280
I would imagine that you have a knife.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.960
You live in the country, you're a police officer, I'd imagine you have a knife on you.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.320
Okay, so can I describe the knife I have on me?

34:52.320 --> 34:55.480
You can describe a pretty common knife that you would have on you.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.040
I want to describe like a...

34:57.040 --> 34:58.800
That Gipu being a knife guy.

34:58.800 --> 35:03.600
I've got a four foot long knife.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.160
I mean, some people might call it a sword, but yeah.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.840
I'm not going to go that far, but hold on.

35:07.840 --> 35:15.280
I take the broadsword off my back and with both hands more like a scythe, I take my spear.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.520
I know what I want to do.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.520
Let me describe it.

35:18.520 --> 35:24.880
So I pull out, it's like a pocket knife in the sense that it folds into itself, but I

35:24.880 --> 35:27.400
pull it out and it's like a four inch blade.

35:27.400 --> 35:35.080
I want to get up off of the ground and run with my knife and just chop the wires that

35:35.080 --> 35:41.680
are connecting his hands to these people and just cut the wires and then just like run

35:41.680 --> 35:42.680
through.

35:42.680 --> 35:43.680
Okay, awesome.

35:43.680 --> 35:48.980
If you're going to do it to both of them, I'm going to do a negative 20 on both rolls.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.480
Not to be super selfish, but he is only embedded in me right now.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.040
So if you did one of them.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.040
Well, that's true.

35:55.500 --> 36:00.080
Would you give me a negative 20 on the second one and a regular one on the first one?

36:00.080 --> 36:02.100
I'll give you a negative 40 on the second one.

36:02.100 --> 36:03.320
And a regular on the first one?

36:03.320 --> 36:04.320
I like that.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.320
Yeah.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.800
So what's the first one is connected.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.920
Did you know you can barter with your...

36:08.920 --> 36:10.400
Who's connected?

36:10.400 --> 36:11.400
You?

36:11.400 --> 36:12.400
Yeah.

36:12.400 --> 36:15.800
I mean, honestly there's only one wire like connected the other wire.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.800
Okay.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.800
Then I'll just do the only taught wire.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.800
Yeah.

36:18.800 --> 36:19.800
Okay.

36:19.800 --> 36:20.800
Let's take this back.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.800
Yeah.

36:21.800 --> 36:22.800
Hold on.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.800
So I pull out my knife.

36:23.800 --> 36:28.600
I'm going to use my orange blade pocket knife and I'm going to run and just try to cut the

36:28.600 --> 36:30.680
wire that's connected to John.

36:30.680 --> 36:31.680
Okay.

36:31.680 --> 36:32.680
And that's going to be a strength roll.

36:32.680 --> 36:33.680
Roll a strength roll.

36:33.680 --> 36:37.680
That's a crit success.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.840
11 on a 50 fuck.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.360
Fuck yes.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.680
This makes me very happy.

36:43.680 --> 36:44.680
And I'll tell you why.

36:44.680 --> 36:45.680
Oh no.

36:45.680 --> 36:46.680
No.

36:46.680 --> 36:49.680
Not for any devious reasons.

36:49.680 --> 36:50.680
Anytime.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.680
Zach is happy.

36:51.680 --> 36:59.200
No, it is because I was going to have to be a stick in the mud DM who is like, actually

36:59.200 --> 37:03.000
that wire is made from a very strong.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.720
So only a critical success could actually cut through it, which you did.

37:07.720 --> 37:12.000
Are we peeking hard?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Yeah.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Oh yeah.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Every time we cheer.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
So how do we fix that?

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Let's cheer away.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.120
All clear.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.120
John is no longer grappled.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.160
Let me fucking describe it, dude.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.160
Oh, sorry.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.640
Do it.

37:26.640 --> 37:29.080
So I get up off the ground.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.760
I like collect myself.

37:30.760 --> 37:34.240
My back hurts really bad and I look and see what just happened.

37:34.240 --> 37:40.000
I pull this pocket knife that you could barely call a pocket knife out of my back pocket.

37:40.000 --> 37:47.680
I flipped the blade up and it's like three inches wide, four inches tall.

37:47.680 --> 37:54.480
And I hold it with both of my fists out in front of me.

37:54.480 --> 38:01.240
And I run as fast as I can, arms wide out in front of me and just run into this wire.

38:01.240 --> 38:09.240
You just run straight and use it like a lightsaber or a simple machine.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.360
And I run through it and it cuts through it like butter.

38:12.360 --> 38:21.400
And as I do it, I look into the one eye of this monster and I flip it off.

38:21.400 --> 38:27.120
And then I, as soon as I hit the wire, obviously like tension comes and it kind of like throws

38:27.120 --> 38:28.120
me off.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.120
It cuts through the wire.

38:29.120 --> 38:35.560
I fall down and roll and I roll and I get back up and just two fingers, two middle fingers

38:35.560 --> 38:36.840
up to this robot.

38:36.840 --> 38:37.840
Hell yeah.

38:37.840 --> 38:38.840
John turn.

38:38.840 --> 38:39.840
John turn.

38:39.840 --> 38:40.840
John, it's your turn.

38:40.840 --> 38:41.840
John turn.

38:42.320 --> 38:48.080
Can you imagine as I get released from this thing's clutches that I probably in pain,

38:48.080 --> 38:51.480
like at least fall on a knee to the ground?

38:51.480 --> 38:52.480
Absolutely.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.800
Uh, because it did pull you forward as the tension.

38:55.800 --> 38:56.800
Okay.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.080
So I'm in the foyer now a little bit.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.080
A little bit.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.080
Yeah.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.920
Uh, he's still in the living room.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.440
He is indeed.

39:04.440 --> 39:10.300
And the fist is still clenched around my, okay.

39:10.300 --> 39:11.300
In your body.

39:11.780 --> 39:12.780
Ouchies.

39:12.780 --> 39:13.780
Ouchie mama.

39:13.780 --> 39:16.700
Well, I don't have time to worry about that.

39:16.700 --> 39:20.700
I am going to, I'm just going to try to shoot from the hip with a sniper rifle again.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.920
That does do more damage than my sidearm, right?

39:22.920 --> 39:23.920
It does indeed.

39:23.920 --> 39:29.260
And it doesn't even matter cause it's the same, but yeah, uh, same firearms go 37.

39:29.260 --> 39:30.500
I finally pass.

39:30.500 --> 39:34.380
Roll two D 10 for damage, uh, eight.

39:34.380 --> 39:35.380
Cobains.

39:35.380 --> 39:36.380
Describe it.

39:36.380 --> 39:37.960
So I fall into my knees.

39:37.960 --> 39:41.920
I guess he's still in front of me because he shot at us from inside that room.

39:41.920 --> 39:42.920
So I'm in pain.

39:42.920 --> 39:47.760
I'm clutching at my side, but I bring the sniper rifle up from the hip and I just try

39:47.760 --> 39:50.080
to shoot him kind of in the gut again.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.080
Awesome.

39:51.080 --> 39:59.560
Firing through his, his midsection, you get two shots just right through his gut.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.560
That's the sound of sniper.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.560
That's a good one.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.560
That's good.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.560
And a foyer.

40:03.560 --> 40:14.160
It's like

40:14.160 --> 40:18.000
as like the inside of him is just going crazy.

40:18.000 --> 40:23.600
There are wires flying out of his midsection and his head is just kind of like shaking

40:23.600 --> 40:27.500
back and forth and it's really weird.

40:27.500 --> 40:35.820
You probably wouldn't notice it if you weren't peeking so fucking hard on Coke right now,

40:35.820 --> 40:45.500
but you actually see this guy, his face grimace and his teeth clench.

40:45.500 --> 40:48.220
I shout, Hey guys, it can feel pain.

40:48.220 --> 40:51.860
And then I also say, take that weird science.

40:51.860 --> 40:52.860
Perfect.

40:52.860 --> 40:55.460
Clark, it's your turn.

40:55.460 --> 40:56.460
Finish him.

40:57.420 --> 40:58.420
I want to shoot.

40:58.420 --> 40:59.420
I want to shoot at it.

40:59.420 --> 41:00.420
Do it.

41:00.420 --> 41:01.420
Nope.

41:01.420 --> 41:04.420
I do not pass.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.420
98 on an 80.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.420
98?

41:07.420 --> 41:08.420
A couple 98s.

41:08.420 --> 41:09.420
Yeah.

41:09.420 --> 41:10.420
We might need some different stones.

41:10.420 --> 41:11.420
Hey, try those.

41:11.420 --> 41:12.420
Try those.

41:12.420 --> 41:13.420
They spit hot fire.

41:13.420 --> 41:14.420
Oh, darn.

41:14.420 --> 41:15.420
I got to go buy more dice.

41:15.420 --> 41:16.420
Oh shit.

41:16.420 --> 41:17.420
Do you want to buy dice tomorrow?

41:17.420 --> 41:20.860
Cause it's been a minute for me.

41:20.860 --> 41:22.420
Maybe you need different stats.

41:22.420 --> 41:23.420
Oh,

41:24.380 --> 41:28.380
Fucking burn dude.

41:28.380 --> 41:30.380
Come on man.

41:30.380 --> 41:31.380
Fucking burn.

41:31.380 --> 41:32.380
What the fuck dude.

41:32.380 --> 41:40.020
Maybe before you buy a new dice you should check your decks.

41:40.020 --> 41:45.940
It is the shiny headed robot man's turn and he sets his sights on the meat boy that just

41:45.940 --> 41:48.020
cut off one of his hand wires.

41:48.020 --> 41:53.300
So I need a strength roll from Keith or an unarmed combat check, whichever one's higher.

41:54.180 --> 41:55.180
I did strength, which is 55.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.180
I got a 34.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.660
You were doing 55 in the 34.

41:58.660 --> 42:11.060
You lose the opposed contest that you were in with this man as you lose the torso of

42:11.060 --> 42:27.780
this being becomes unattached from the legs beneath it and a small jet pack begins shooting

42:27.780 --> 42:36.340
flames, begins shooting flames from the bottom of the torso as it runs, as it runs, as it

42:36.340 --> 42:44.220
flies towards Keith, it reaches down, zips back into one decent hand, grabbing you by

42:44.220 --> 42:53.180
the throat and flying you out the window of the living room into the front yard.

42:53.180 --> 43:00.160
I need you to roll an extremely important strength or unarmed combat contest.

43:00.160 --> 43:06.040
As you fly through the window, you have a chance to break free from this robot.

43:06.040 --> 43:12.680
19 out of 55, but also that's a competition, so maybe not so good.

43:12.680 --> 43:13.680
That sucks.

43:13.680 --> 43:14.680
I hate that.

43:14.680 --> 43:15.680
I'll roll it in front of you guys.

43:15.680 --> 43:18.960
He has a 70.

43:18.960 --> 43:19.960
He fails.

43:19.960 --> 43:24.080
You just cartoonishly clutch.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.680
You rolled a 94.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.160
94 on a 70.

43:27.160 --> 43:28.320
He grabs you by the throat.

43:28.320 --> 43:31.620
He grabs you by the throat and as you bust through the window.

43:31.620 --> 43:36.640
I bite into his mechanical hand.

43:36.640 --> 43:37.640
Shatter your teeth.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.520
Two of my teeth break off.

43:40.520 --> 43:41.520
Which two?

43:41.520 --> 43:42.520
Now you're from contention.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.520
These two right here.

43:43.520 --> 43:44.520
Okay, cool.

43:44.520 --> 43:45.520
Describe them.

43:45.520 --> 43:46.520
It's an audio podcast.

43:46.520 --> 43:51.820
My canine and the one next to it going to the middle, I don't know what that one's called,

43:51.820 --> 43:58.560
break off and I realize, oh, I can't bite a machine and so I just poke my finger into

43:58.560 --> 44:03.460
his one good eye.

44:03.460 --> 44:10.420
As you do that, the robot man releases you and you fall into the front yard as the robot

44:10.420 --> 44:16.220
flies up towards the sky and explodes in a firework-like explosion.

44:16.220 --> 44:18.620
Holy shit, good work guys.

44:18.620 --> 44:21.060
You just had to poke it in the eye the whole time.

44:21.900 --> 44:23.300
Let's try that with all the enemies from now on.

44:23.300 --> 44:29.460
I land on my back, breath gets knocked out of me, but I look up as he's exploding and

44:29.460 --> 44:38.020
I put my hand up to my forehead and I salute and I go, skyrockets in flight, baby.

44:51.060 --> 45:10.980
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
