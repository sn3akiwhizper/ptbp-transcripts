00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
What's up, my babies? It's your handler, your GM, your BM, which stands for Best, May, and Never Your DM,

00:07.280 --> 00:15.120
because if I'm in a dungeon, I am most assuredly not the master. It's Zach. I'm Zach. I am Zach.

00:15.120 --> 00:21.280
We have a special bonus episode this week, because this is the end of an era.

00:21.280 --> 00:28.160
This is the last episode of Pretending to Be People that will be released on a Monday,

00:28.160 --> 00:35.520
because in 2020, we are switching our release day to Friday. So the next episode will be out

00:35.520 --> 00:42.240
next year on Friday, January 3rd. But this episode right here? This episode right here is special.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.600
It's a bonus. This is the first episode we made for the Patreon. It's a Q&A from back in May.

00:47.600 --> 00:54.400
This is a taste of what our honorary police officers have access to for $5 a month. Wolf

00:54.400 --> 00:59.840
has an intro to this episode, so I won't keep you for much longer, but go to your Google Cal,

00:59.840 --> 01:06.880
put a horny emoji on every Friday in 2020, and enjoy this Q&A episode. Also, thank you so much

01:06.880 --> 01:10.320
for listening, and every time we get to interact with y'all on the internet, it makes my heart

01:10.320 --> 01:14.080
warm, and every time I see fanart on Instagram or over on the subreddit, it makes my heart

01:14.080 --> 01:19.760
heart okay. I love you. Okay, bye. Welcome, friends, to the nastiest radio show this side

01:19.760 --> 01:27.360
of the city. Y'all know I'm all about that nasty. This is 694.2 PTBP,

01:27.360 --> 01:34.480
contention's greasiest and grimiest radio show, hosted by me, Wolf the dog.

01:35.040 --> 01:42.880
Y'all know I'm such a nasty boy. Now, what ain't nasty is that y'all have been helping support us

01:42.880 --> 01:51.360
through a little thing called Patreon, and that makes Wolf feel real nice inside. Nasty nice.

01:51.360 --> 01:57.600
Keep them dollars flowing, y'all. Wolf needs to buy himself a big old nice bucket to fill with

01:57.600 --> 02:04.560
some tasty meat slop. We have yet another special presentation here on PTBP for y'all. We got

02:04.560 --> 02:11.840
ourselves another listener Q&A from that weird podcast called Pretending to be People. Remember,

02:11.840 --> 02:17.280
y'all, there are spoilers abound here, so make sure you are caught up with what they're putting

02:17.280 --> 02:24.560
down before you take a listen. Now, it's time for this new band I heard to dish out some hot

02:24.560 --> 02:37.280
slop for y'all. I hope y'all ready, cuz it's Kudzu with no backbone.

02:54.560 --> 03:18.160
Hey, that's John McCain. That's not me. He actually sang that at a fundraiser,

03:18.160 --> 03:23.200
didn't he? He did. Oh, fuck. Did he really? Yeah. Have you not seen that video? I guess not. Yeah,

03:23.200 --> 03:30.160
he was like, it reminds me of that old Beach Boys song. Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran. Yeah,

03:30.160 --> 03:38.560
and then he did it. What a country we live in. Welcome to... Wait, what? The first Patreon

03:38.560 --> 03:46.160
episode. Are we live? Thomas likes that we're kicking it off with that one. When do you think

03:46.560 --> 03:53.600
John McCain bombed Iran? Twice in 89, and then I think he's planning on doing it when he died.

03:54.960 --> 04:00.080
Is he dead now? He's dead now. He died of brain cancer. Yeah, so now then, I guess, probably.

04:00.080 --> 04:11.760
Well, he said that in like 2002. So, 89 was a record. In 89? Mm-hmm. In 91? I wasn't born then.

04:12.640 --> 04:18.960
Okay. So you don't need to know anything. It's impossible to know. Yeah. I don't think of

04:18.960 --> 04:25.920
anything before 93. Luke, you don't think of anything before 93 minutes ago. Ouch. Boom.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.160
He got you. That's not true. I could tell you all about podcasts that I listen to.

04:30.800 --> 04:37.280
Unnamed podcast. I know every episode. Oh, God. Okay, yeah.

04:39.760 --> 04:44.080
Rhymes with gum frown. Oof. All right. Hey, I don't listen to that.

04:46.080 --> 04:51.760
No, you listen to Cum Town. No, I listen to Cum Town. Gum Frown is a terrible racist podcast that

04:51.760 --> 04:58.560
thinks it's doing it ironically. All right. Welcome to the Patreon for pretending to be people.

04:58.560 --> 05:04.240
Don't let the Chapo subreddit hear you say that. Hey, first off, thank you so much for listening.

05:04.240 --> 05:09.680
You are a part of an elite crew. Oh, my God. Like, we are so grateful. Honestly,

05:09.680 --> 05:13.600
fuck all the other people that listen to this podcast except you guys.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.880
You're the heroes. Absolutely. You know what? You're the heroes. Yeah. Let's all clap.

05:18.880 --> 05:35.680
First question is from stories colossal on Twitter. Says if I give you money,

05:35.680 --> 05:41.200
will you tell me what was up with that jump scare? I'm spooked and I can't shake it. Well,

05:41.840 --> 05:51.360
it's colossal. Step one. You have given us money. So, yeah, actually, I said yes, we'll answer it

05:51.360 --> 05:58.240
tonight. And they said, okay, it's a deal. It's a done deal. It was a pact. We made a blood pact

05:58.240 --> 06:08.400
over Twitter. Just please don't unsubscribe to the Patreon immediately. You know what?

06:08.400 --> 06:14.160
Yeah. Thanks for kicking it off. That's what you wanted? Yeah. $5 for this answer? Absolutely. So,

06:14.160 --> 06:20.400
here's what happened. We were in the room recording that episode and in the middle of the

06:20.400 --> 06:28.080
Marvin Glass monologue, I fucking screamed. Like, I went for it. It was absolutely in real life

06:28.080 --> 06:35.520
shocking. It was all like jaw dropped staring. Like, that's why there didn't seem to be much

06:35.520 --> 06:43.200
of a reaction is because our reaction was not audio quality reaction. It was just,

06:44.560 --> 06:49.840
I'm doing it right now. You can't hear it. Again, Luke, this is an audio medium.

06:50.800 --> 06:56.240
It was absolutely stunned silence. Our jaws dropped. We were stunned. And the reason that

06:56.240 --> 07:04.400
it sounded even crazier on the podcast is the magic of audio editing. A little behind the scenes

07:04.400 --> 07:13.360
here, basically what I did was I layered my scream on top of itself three times and I changed up the

07:13.360 --> 07:18.400
interval just a little bit. That way I wasn't at the exact same time each time. And then I modulated

07:18.400 --> 07:27.040
the voice I believe up and down perhaps. So you added the spooky filter. I did. I clicked on my

07:27.040 --> 07:34.000
audacity tab that says spookify. Spooky. 90%. You can check us out on spookify. There were some

07:34.000 --> 07:38.880
questions as to what that was. That was just Marvin getting very angry. He got upset and he

07:38.880 --> 07:45.280
screamed. And it sounded not of this world. It didn't. It didn't for some reason. I wonder why.

07:45.280 --> 07:52.480
And yeah, I've also seen some questions. I saw somebody on Reddit said like, is this DM just

07:52.480 --> 07:58.320
crazy good at voices or is there a modulator in there? And the answer is I am very.

07:58.400 --> 07:58.900
Both.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.880
Yeah, so every once in a while I'll throw something up or down and have a sandwich with it,

08:06.880 --> 08:11.440
but in between like it's all my voice. That's just an old audio pro term.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.680
In the biz, you know. In the biz.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.960
Zach, could you do your best voice of anything for us right now?

08:20.960 --> 08:23.840
Oh yeah, obviously. Give us your Schwarzenegger.

08:24.080 --> 08:32.000
Hello. My name is Arnold Schwarzenegger.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.840
Very good. I nailed it.

08:36.880 --> 08:43.920
What is your favorite character voice to do? So this is so actually growing up. I grew up with.

08:43.920 --> 08:44.400
Too far.

08:44.400 --> 08:57.840
We're not trying to get too intimate on this podcast. Oh God, I'm going to do it.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.360
My dad is an awesome dad. He reigns from heaven.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.520
This is brought to you by assemblies of God.

09:08.400 --> 09:18.720
Oh God, so we are assembling and I am your God. So when I was younger, my dad, he did voices

09:18.720 --> 09:25.280
all the time for us. He's a total goofball in the best way possible and I love him to death.

09:25.280 --> 09:32.960
And he did Mickey Mouse and Goofy and Elmo. And it was always, I mean, in the morning it'd be,

09:33.440 --> 09:39.600
hi everybody. He would just jump into it at any point in time. And he was actually,

09:39.600 --> 09:48.320
I can never get down the Donald Duck. He can talk while he does it. I'm still working on that one.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.960
The Donald Trump. I tried that in my whole childhood.

09:50.960 --> 09:55.920
And never figured it out. You can mumble, but I can't say words.

09:57.040 --> 10:01.680
Thomas can actually do a solid machine gun with his mouth. And I haven't gotten him

10:01.680 --> 10:06.480
to do the Foley work on the podcast yet, but one of these days he'll get some extra

10:06.480 --> 10:11.440
points on the Patreon. Yeah, we're going to debut that on an episode sometime.

10:11.440 --> 10:17.040
We'll have bonus content where we all just do, what's the guy from Police Academy?

10:17.040 --> 10:18.560
Oh yeah. Michael Winslow.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.120
Yeah, we'll do Michael, right? Is that right?

10:22.480 --> 10:23.680
Michael Winslow impressions.

10:23.680 --> 10:33.520
The dad from Family Matters. So we'll debut that at a later time after Thomas meets with

10:33.520 --> 10:36.960
his vocal coach a couple more times. I do, yeah. I've got to do some work out.

10:36.960 --> 10:42.160
Speaking of character voices, we're kind of talking about that recently. And by recently,

10:42.160 --> 10:45.440
what I mean is right before we started recording and we all said, oh wow,

10:45.440 --> 10:49.360
this is a good conversation that we should have had on microphone. Let's go for it.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.560
You didn't answer my question. Luke, why don't you have character voices?

10:52.560 --> 10:58.400
What is your favorite character voice to do in pretending to be people?

10:58.400 --> 11:02.240
Oh, my favorite one to do is Drew Andrews and that's why he's in it the most.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.280
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.640
It's one of my favorites also. Could you give us a sample?

11:08.000 --> 11:14.160
No, but what I can do is ask you guys what you're going to do when you are playing a

11:14.160 --> 11:18.320
different character with the voices, Joe? I'm not playing a different character.

11:18.320 --> 11:24.480
If Clark dies, I fucking die. I don't know. I've been working on it.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.680
Don't leave us, Joe.

11:25.680 --> 11:30.720
If I have to do a new character voice. I don't know what I'll do. I have a bad

11:30.720 --> 11:35.840
habit of slipping down into my Southern accent no matter what character I play.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.720
So I'm going to try and actively fight against that, but we'll see what happens.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.800
Do you think that's based on your roots?

11:40.800 --> 11:41.600
I reckon so.

11:41.680 --> 11:45.840
Joe is from South America.

11:51.840 --> 11:56.000
Luke, you do a, like a really out there character voice on the show right now.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.480
Yeah. I do it so often.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.440
It comes back around.

12:01.440 --> 12:08.400
The thing is, once I started doing this podcast, it's kind of like just slipped

12:08.400 --> 12:12.160
in to my everyday life. Like I've started just talking like Keith.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.280
That's crazy, man.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.000
That's insane.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.680
So I'm going to have to get back to my, my normal, you know what I'm thinking?

12:19.680 --> 12:20.800
You got to shake off the character.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.400
I'm thinking I'm shaking. I'm going to shake off the character voice and talk in my normal

12:24.400 --> 12:30.080
voice for the next character, which I mean to, I mean, to the Patreon subscribers, you,

12:30.080 --> 12:35.200
you know, this is just for you, but my normal talking voice is a little bit like this.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.400
And I ain't like talking like this.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.560
We don't hang out with Luke outside of recording.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.160
No, it's impossible.

12:42.160 --> 12:42.720
Honestly.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.480
I just role play during my life.

12:46.480 --> 12:50.560
Yeah. I've told you, you can use your normal voice when you're describing what your character

12:50.560 --> 12:51.040
does.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.320
Yeah. But I don't know.

12:52.320 --> 12:57.760
We tested it with some audiences and it really didn't go over well.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.080
And you know, that might've just been the wrong crowd.

13:00.080 --> 13:05.760
But, uh, people tell me I have a, a, a face for radio and a voice for the library.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.200
Well, and the focus group said voice for closed captioning.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.720
The focus group said that your voice was too smelly.

13:15.440 --> 13:15.680
Yeah.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.120
That reminds me.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.000
I haven't owned a toothbrush in so long.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.280
I really need to go buy one.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.640
How do you brush your teeth?

13:24.640 --> 13:25.280
I don't.

13:25.280 --> 13:25.920
Oh no.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.360
Well, I mean, I brush his teeth.

13:27.920 --> 13:33.280
I let, uh, I let Thomas's dog lick my mouth clean.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.440
Cause they say it's cleaner than a toilet.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.720
They do say that.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.040
I heard it is at least cleaner than the toilet.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.120
That's a bar.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.320
You want to kiss me?

13:46.320 --> 13:48.080
My mouth is cleaner than a toilet.

13:48.640 --> 13:54.640
Speaking of the character voices, uh, we, we had some, some interesting responses to

13:54.640 --> 13:58.000
Wolf, the dog, not being the radio DJ.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.240
When we went to the city, Justin, what are you going to do if the story leaves contention

14:04.240 --> 14:04.880
forever?

14:05.440 --> 14:06.000
I don't know.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.080
Let's probably just do Wolf.

14:08.080 --> 14:08.320
Yeah.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.680
Wolf just moves to the city.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.000
Right.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
I feel like Wolf, the dog, Wolf could get really successful in the city.

14:14.000 --> 14:14.320
Yeah.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.080
He expands his empire.

14:16.080 --> 14:16.320
Yeah.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.080
He's an upward rising mobile individual.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.600
Wolf's an ambitious young man.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.160
He is an influencer or whatever.

14:25.040 --> 14:25.840
Or whatever he is.

14:27.760 --> 14:28.480
Slash Wolf.

14:31.360 --> 14:31.600
Yeah.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.680
And he's an influencer on social media.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.440
Did, did people not like my NPR radio host voice?

14:37.440 --> 14:41.040
Oh no, actually I think, uh, I think people were super into it.

14:41.040 --> 14:41.680
Yeah.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.160
Oh no.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.400
What if they like him more than Wolf?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.680
Well, everyone's like, fuck that weird voice.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.840
Let's get more of this soothing voice.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.440
More Steve.

14:51.440 --> 14:55.760
There's a podcast that, uh, or a few months ago, give us a cool little shout out.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.760
They were, they were caught up in listening and they just, uh, recently gave us another

14:59.760 --> 15:02.800
little shout out saying they were kind of catching up and caught up.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.440
And one of the hosts, this is the ugly mugs podcast.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.000
Oh yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.960
The other host said that Wolf, the dog is one of his favorite things in the world and

15:08.960 --> 15:12.640
that he slips into that voice in his day to day life.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.680
That makes me happy.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.560
It was really cool.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.440
That's so fun.

15:15.440 --> 15:20.480
So that actually came about because we were hanging out of the house one day playing a

15:20.480 --> 15:27.280
game of everyone is John, which is a touch on a, another question shortly about this.

15:27.280 --> 15:27.680
Yeah.

15:27.680 --> 15:34.320
I think we, uh, like that's a single page role playing game that we like to do when

15:34.320 --> 15:35.840
we're just hanging out on a Saturday.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.880
The games take what?

15:36.880 --> 15:38.240
Like an hour, hour and a half.

15:38.240 --> 15:42.000
So yeah, we, we can crack out two games or one long one.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.040
But we get along so well last eight hours, pretty much every time.

15:47.040 --> 15:52.320
Uh, but in the middle of that game, Justin just started speaking exactly like Wolf, the

15:52.320 --> 15:56.640
dog, and then immediately named the character in that improv.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.800
And I looked at him and I was like, Justin, this is a thing.

16:01.920 --> 16:06.400
Cause we, I mean, that was like what mid recording of, of the podcast.

16:06.400 --> 16:06.960
Oh yeah.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.280
We were just like, this is going to be on the show.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.640
We have to figure out a way.

16:10.720 --> 16:17.200
And honestly, I think that had a lot to do with how we figured out how to put an intro

16:17.200 --> 16:18.080
onto the show.

16:18.080 --> 16:25.120
And we wanted to do a previously on, but I knew how much work the editing was just to

16:25.120 --> 16:27.520
edit a show and put it out every week.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.160
I really didn't want to put together a previous.

16:30.160 --> 16:34.160
Come through the whole fucking episode, looking for clips and like, yeah.

16:34.160 --> 16:40.080
And so we, uh, we kind of talked to Justin and I and came up with, uh, with the radio

16:40.080 --> 16:40.720
station.

16:40.720 --> 16:45.280
And I love that it adds, it adds a character and it is so much more entertaining to listen

16:45.280 --> 16:49.760
to than a, here's the thing that you like, especially if you're binging a show, it's

16:49.760 --> 16:52.640
like, here's what you listened to 20 minutes ago.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.200
Yeah.

16:53.200 --> 16:58.880
It adds like a, for me listening to it even, cause I'm a, I'm like, I kind of listened

16:58.880 --> 17:01.040
to it after the fact with you guys.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.160
Like I'm, I wasn't involved in those recordings initially.

17:04.160 --> 17:08.160
So it's really fun for me to get like, as a huge narcissist who loves to hear them.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.240
I love my voice.

17:10.240 --> 17:10.560
Oh yeah.

17:10.560 --> 17:17.600
If you guys don't know that, no, it was just fun to get to do this weird, I wanted to like

17:17.600 --> 17:20.400
help out with the podcast and like any way that I could.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.840
So it was fun to get to like actually add my voice.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.240
Cause we had already talked about you doing the music.

17:26.240 --> 17:26.560
Yeah.

17:26.560 --> 17:26.880
Yeah.

17:26.960 --> 17:31.520
And so it was cool to be like, oh, I'm actually like kind of like a character within this

17:31.520 --> 17:34.000
universe now, which is very fun.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.280
But he's kind of this other world.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.000
You are one of the most well-defined characters in this universe.

17:40.160 --> 17:44.000
And you're like, you're like an, like a, almost like a godlike character where you're

17:44.000 --> 17:45.440
like, it's like, how the fuck do you know?

17:46.400 --> 17:52.240
Me and Zach have talked like extensively about Wolf's like backstory that may never

17:52.240 --> 17:56.480
actually get revealed, but we have like all this weird like character history for him

17:56.480 --> 17:58.720
and it's real goofy and fun.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.040
Yeah.

17:59.040 --> 18:05.280
It's necessary in order for us to, uh, to, to get just all up inside Wolf the dog every

18:05.280 --> 18:05.680
week.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.640
All up in them guts.

18:06.640 --> 18:10.560
All up in them guts when we're writing the, uh, the intro.

18:10.560 --> 18:15.600
So that kind of leads us into, uh, BFEvans19 wrote, uh, have you ever, have any of you

18:15.600 --> 18:19.440
ever played any interesting systems other than Delta Green or Pulp Cthulhu?

18:19.440 --> 18:20.000
No.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.360
And the answer is no, no.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.120
I would like to specifically un-shout out D&D.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.760
I don't know that I ever want to play D&D again.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.160
No.

18:30.160 --> 18:36.400
I'm playing, I'm playing Pathfinder with a group right now and it is, it's fun every

18:36.400 --> 18:38.960
time, but it's like, it's a different game.

18:38.960 --> 18:43.600
It's so different than Delta Green where it's like, you know, you are just like in,

18:43.600 --> 18:44.960
everybody's involved the whole time.

18:44.960 --> 18:50.240
And then with Pathfinder, it's like, I am having fun playing it and like when it's my

18:50.240 --> 18:51.360
turn, it's, be careful.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.240
He's listening.

18:52.240 --> 18:52.800
Right.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.840
Shout out to Andy.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.880
Thank you Andy for running Pathfinder.

18:56.880 --> 18:57.380
Oh, sorry.

18:58.240 --> 18:58.560
Docs.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.280
Who lives that?

19:01.040 --> 19:04.320
Andy, after we finished this, let's play Delta Green.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.560
But, but yeah, we played a lot of systems.

19:10.560 --> 19:14.480
And we've played, um, like I said earlier, we play Everyone is John if we're looking

19:14.480 --> 19:16.000
to have a relaxed afternoon.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.520
And that one is so much fun.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.560
It's a really fun game.

19:18.560 --> 19:18.880
Yeah.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.680
Besides, you have to have somebody like Zach to run it.

19:21.680 --> 19:25.760
Besides Dungeons and Dragons and Delta Green, the only campaign I've gone through.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.280
What was that called?

19:27.280 --> 19:30.800
The Sion with Zach and Justin.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.000
And you play there too.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.600
Luke was playing a way less annoying character in that campaign.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.200
I was the drummer.

19:45.360 --> 19:50.400
You play semi-mythical like superheroes kind of who, who all follow an ancient pantheon

19:50.400 --> 19:55.680
of some kind, whether it be Egyptian, uh, Hellenic or, uh, like Aztec.

19:55.680 --> 19:55.840
Yeah.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.160
We played the fuck products of gods.

19:58.160 --> 19:58.800
Yeah.

19:58.800 --> 20:05.680
It was, it was so fun to like, I think sometimes like the gameplay in that system can be a

20:05.680 --> 20:09.920
little like, I think the gameplay in the system can be a little, eh, like it gets like, you

20:09.920 --> 20:11.520
can kind of get OP really quickly.

20:12.080 --> 20:16.400
Um, but the like character creation and the thought you put into like having this.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.680
What did you play?

20:18.240 --> 20:25.280
I was like a Kurdish rebel who killed, uh, was it Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein?

20:25.280 --> 20:27.040
Oh, it might've been Saddam.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.080
Was it both?

20:28.080 --> 20:29.280
I can't remember.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.680
I made my guy like this crazy, like, uh, assassin basically.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.720
But I also had all these, we, the powers were really interesting.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.560
And what was your, your God?

20:38.560 --> 20:41.280
Ooh, I actually, I actually can't remember.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.800
Do you remember your pantheon?

20:42.800 --> 20:44.560
What like category it came from?

20:44.560 --> 20:47.040
Was I like, was I a noob?

20:47.040 --> 20:48.560
No, someone else was a new bus.

20:48.560 --> 20:48.960
I think.

20:48.960 --> 20:49.600
I don't remember.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.440
I had no idea what mine was.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.400
Was I a noob?

20:54.080 --> 20:57.040
I actually, I played in off, uh, an officer in offspring.

20:57.040 --> 20:57.840
I played in offspring.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.080
I played the band, the offspring played in the band, the offspring.

21:00.080 --> 21:05.840
And, uh, I played a son of Dionysus who was a drunk priest.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.440
That was a, that one was really fun.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.560
Super fun to play.

21:08.560 --> 21:12.560
I played a son of Apollo, I think, or Hermes.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.520
I don't remember who was just David Bowie basically.

21:16.000 --> 21:16.880
It was a lot of fun.

21:16.880 --> 21:22.560
Thomas would write, and Thomas would write songs during the sessions.

21:22.560 --> 21:27.280
There was Christmas time in London town.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.960
The streets are gray.

21:28.960 --> 21:33.040
Wait, the skies are gray and the streets are brown.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.600
Yeah, it was very good.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.040
It's my favorite song ever.

21:38.640 --> 21:42.880
Uh, what was that system that we did a one shot one day of where you play heightened

21:42.880 --> 21:44.000
versions of yourselves?

21:44.720 --> 21:45.760
That was a lot of fun.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.760
Uh, the end of the world one.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.000
Yeah.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.880
Was it called apocalypse?

21:50.880 --> 21:52.160
Dude, I have no idea.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.440
We need to look that up right now.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.240
Can we take a break?

21:54.240 --> 21:54.800
I gotta pee.

21:55.760 --> 22:01.440
We'll, uh, go ahead and take a break and we'll come back right after a word from our sponsors.

22:01.440 --> 22:09.840
It's DJ AJ.

Ladies get a further 15% off and a complimentary rim inspection.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.080
You know what I'm talking about.

22:36.080 --> 22:41.440
I'll be spinning the freshest cuts and selling my proprietary jewel blend while supplies last.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.720
So come on down to Al's Tires this Saturday only.

22:46.480 --> 22:51.760
Thank you to product for advertising on this, uh, here podcast.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.120
Product has changed my life.

22:53.120 --> 22:58.480
I was really excited that we had, uh, that product on this time because that is one

22:58.480 --> 23:04.960
that legitimately like I, on a daily basis, think about or use.

23:04.960 --> 23:09.920
Well, like product in my toes, product in my hair, product in your ears.

23:09.920 --> 23:13.120
Don't put things in your ears, but product goes everywhere.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.080
I know I said last week that I was going to buy two.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.200
I think I'm going to up the order.

23:17.200 --> 23:17.680
Oh yeah.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.200
Yeah, I think I got it.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.640
I think four is appropriate.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.120
So, uh, putting so much product up my penis.

23:23.120 --> 23:27.040
We were in, that's a fun place for it and save it for later.

23:27.040 --> 23:27.840
Spicy.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.840
So the, uh, the, the game that we were talking about was called the end of the world.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.560
Uh, we played, I think there's six different variants on it.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.080
I just remembered it.

23:36.080 --> 23:36.320
Yeah.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.440
We just remembered.

23:37.440 --> 23:37.680
Yeah.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.800
We didn't have to look that up.

23:38.800 --> 23:39.680
Great memories.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.600
And it is called the end of the world.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.560
Thomas was right.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.000
You get a five points of luck.

23:44.960 --> 23:45.360
Awesome.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.240
I'm writing that down.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.080
So what, uh, what else?

23:52.880 --> 23:53.040
Yeah.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.920
So we played that zombie apocalypse into the world.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.400
Joe, you were the one who brought that up that day where we played the, uh, the bigger

24:00.400 --> 24:06.080
versions of ourselves where we actually, the stats on that game are built by making what

24:06.080 --> 24:08.560
you think are the stats for yourself.

24:08.560 --> 24:12.160
And then the group votes on whether or not you are right.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.160
Yeah, that is incredible.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.200
I forgot about that part.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.680
Did we have too many like disagreements on that?

24:17.680 --> 24:19.840
We had, uh, two slight ones.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
Uh, we just up stats, right?

24:21.840 --> 24:23.920
Like typically that's what we do.

24:23.920 --> 24:24.420
Yeah.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.320
Makes the game more interesting.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.200
But I spent, I feel like people underestimated themselves, right?

24:29.200 --> 24:29.440
Yeah.

24:29.440 --> 24:33.040
That was, uh, that was one where we were like, Hey man, you're smarter than that.

24:33.040 --> 24:38.000
One of the fun things about that, uh, that scenario, I guess, I don't know if they all

24:38.000 --> 24:40.080
work this way, but you play heightened versions of yourself.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.640
And then we played, uh, that we were in our town.

24:42.640 --> 24:46.560
So it was like, we went over to so-and-so's brother's house that we all have been to

24:46.560 --> 24:46.960
before.

24:46.960 --> 24:51.040
It was actually, you are supposed to play where you are, right?

24:51.040 --> 24:51.280
Yeah.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.880
You start the game in the space where you're playing.

24:54.880 --> 25:01.360
And then, uh, we actually moved pretty quickly to our friend Jake's house and Jake was on

25:01.360 --> 25:02.160
the podcast.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.800
He played a young Ferguson beans.

25:04.800 --> 25:05.280
Rest in peace.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.360
And we'll hopefully be on the podcast again.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.800
And we'll hopefully be on the podcast.

25:08.800 --> 25:13.760
Also, Jake's backyard neighbor is Justin's brother.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.320
Yes.

25:14.320 --> 25:18.960
And we started our zombie story by making him the first infected, basically.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.680
Oh, that's right.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.960
The first one we saw.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.200
Ryan shout out to Ryan.

25:23.200 --> 25:28.160
Everyone has a Ryan Sala at your local meta games.

25:28.160 --> 25:33.680
Everyone has a Ryan Sala and Ryan Sala runs our local gaming store called meta games here

25:33.680 --> 25:34.400
in Springfield.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.640
Meta games has been very good to us.

25:36.640 --> 25:40.000
And Ryan, that will cost you $25 for that.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.520
Also shout out to Jake's vegan burgers.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.880
That's another 25.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.720
We just made $50 this episode.

25:47.920 --> 25:48.800
Who else do we know?

25:48.800 --> 25:52.080
So that was a, that was a really fun one.

25:52.080 --> 25:57.200
And actually about, uh, three quarters of the way through that game, we took a little,

25:57.200 --> 25:58.880
uh, we took a little detour.

25:58.880 --> 25:59.280
Oh yeah.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.080
In real life.

26:00.080 --> 26:00.800
Yeah.

26:00.800 --> 26:05.440
And not in the game, even though the game was based on real life in real, real life.

26:05.440 --> 26:05.920
What was it?

26:05.920 --> 26:07.760
Your dad needed help with some horses.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.280
Oh, I was there for that.

26:09.280 --> 26:09.600
Yeah.

26:09.600 --> 26:09.840
Yeah.

26:09.840 --> 26:10.640
You were here for this game.

26:10.640 --> 26:10.800
Yeah.

26:10.800 --> 26:11.760
The horse.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.240
We went out to my, uh, my parents' house.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.960
Shout out to Jake who has Jake's vegan burgers.

26:16.960 --> 26:20.800
I don't think he needed help with the horse, but we did just get really drunk and hang

26:20.800 --> 26:21.760
out with my dad's horse.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.360
Who is also named Jake.

26:25.360 --> 26:25.860
Yes.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.960
So Jake, uh, the human got to meet, uh, Jake the horse.

26:30.960 --> 26:31.360
Yeah.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.840
And they couldn't stop staring at each other.

26:33.840 --> 26:34.640
They knew.

26:34.640 --> 26:38.240
When Two Jakes, Two Jakes is a movie, I think, but when Two Jakes meet, they know.

26:38.240 --> 26:42.800
Well, and it was awesome to see Jake ride Jake, but I won't tell you who rode who.

26:43.440 --> 26:47.440
Justin, have you played any other interesting game systems?

26:47.440 --> 26:48.320
Why yes, Zach.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.200
I have.

26:49.200 --> 26:55.840
As a matter of fact, uh, I've actually played, uh, dungeon world a little bit, which I am

26:55.840 --> 26:57.280
a big fan of.

26:57.280 --> 27:03.200
Um, I was actually running a campaign for some friends that, uh, crumbled spectacularly.

27:03.200 --> 27:08.160
If I may say so myself, uh, probably in ways that people can guess.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.400
That's a very fast paced system, right?

27:10.400 --> 27:12.080
Or am I confusing it with something else?

27:12.480 --> 27:13.600
It's easy.

27:13.600 --> 27:17.120
All the roles are like, are pretty simplistic.

27:17.120 --> 27:22.320
Uh, I haven't done, I actually forgot what the, you basically always roll the same, like,

27:22.320 --> 27:23.120
is it like two dice?

27:23.120 --> 27:24.160
Two D six, I think.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.400
Is that a powered by the apocalypse game?

27:26.400 --> 27:27.040
Yes, yes, yes.

27:27.040 --> 27:27.540
Yeah.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.920
I think it's savage world.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.720
Savage world and, um, what else?

27:32.720 --> 27:33.600
Monster of the week.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.440
Those are all powered by the apocalypse.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.920
And so did we ever play monster of the week?

27:37.920 --> 27:38.640
We still haven't.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.140
Okay.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.200
But it was, it was so fun.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.280
Like it was my first time getting to host something.

27:43.280 --> 27:47.840
And this, like you guys said, like with D and D stuff, sometimes you wait for your turn

27:47.840 --> 27:51.920
and it's just like, there's so many things you have to think about.

27:51.920 --> 27:56.640
Whereas dungeon world is so fucking get that, like, let's, let's make this story happen.

27:56.640 --> 28:01.520
Let's do this shit instead of like, okay, get your rule books out and look at all your numbers

28:01.520 --> 28:02.160
and everything.

28:02.160 --> 28:06.960
And speaking of getting to run stuff, uh, a couple of the days where we've played everyone

28:06.960 --> 28:08.640
is John as a friend group.

28:09.200 --> 28:14.960
Uh, we've had, I, I've gotten to play and I believe Thomas has run.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.560
Everyone has run one.

28:16.560 --> 28:16.880
Yeah.

28:16.880 --> 28:20.160
Did you do the underwater F1 thing?

28:20.160 --> 28:20.660
Yeah.

28:20.720 --> 28:21.220
Yeah.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.240
That was very fun.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.600
And Luke, did you run one?

28:23.600 --> 28:30.480
I haven't run one yet, but I would like to do it just to dip my feet into, I've never

28:30.480 --> 28:32.320
like ran a game before.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.680
It was a fun way to learn a little bit about DMing.

28:35.680 --> 28:40.000
It's the only thing I've ever run below, you know, you have 10 or 15 minutes to prepare

28:40.000 --> 28:41.120
and then you just have to wing it.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.480
And it was, it was fun.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.480
It's a, it's a improv Olympics.

28:44.480 --> 28:48.560
You, you, you, you set out a few goals for yourself and then have fun.

28:48.560 --> 28:52.800
There's really no structure to it beyond what the DM writes in 15 minutes or so.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.560
Did we talk about this game at all?

28:54.560 --> 28:56.400
Did we talk about how everyone is John works?

28:56.400 --> 28:57.600
Oh no, we didn't.

28:57.600 --> 29:01.040
But if you want to hop into it, be my guest.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.440
Well, so literally everyone is John.

29:04.400 --> 29:08.720
John is, is one character that you all kind of take turns controlling.

29:09.920 --> 29:15.760
And before you start playing the game, you set specific goals for John and try to two

29:15.760 --> 29:20.880
specific goals for John and you try to meet them sometimes as many times as you can.

29:20.880 --> 29:21.120
Yeah.

29:21.120 --> 29:25.280
And each character voice has two talents, right?

29:25.280 --> 29:26.160
You, yes.

29:26.160 --> 29:33.360
So you're basically controlling this person who's just losing his mind as he gets compelled

29:33.520 --> 29:36.720
by wildly different interests.

29:37.360 --> 29:42.400
So the, and then the DM tries to set up the world to, to meet the, make those goals meetable.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.400
Like Joe said, it's improv Olympics.

29:44.400 --> 29:44.880
Yeah.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.640
And we all try to win a medal.

29:46.640 --> 29:52.640
Also like whoever's running the game tries to, you know, get everybody to get, meet those

29:52.640 --> 29:53.040
goals.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.800
Like there's one, what you, somebody wanted to play with the Beatles.

29:56.800 --> 29:57.680
Was that you Joe?

29:57.680 --> 29:58.080
Yeah.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.760
So you kind of set up the goals.

29:59.760 --> 30:03.280
You have one that seems impossible and then you have one that you can kind of do on a

30:03.280 --> 30:04.640
repeated basis.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.640
So mine was, I, it was to play in the Beatles was my unreachable goal.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.200
And then I think the other one was to steal stuff or something like that.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.320
So I tried to steal free or steal.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.920
You've got corn dogs or something.

30:15.920 --> 30:16.480
Something like that.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.240
I just tried to steal stuff as I made my way toward the stage that Thomas had created where

30:20.240 --> 30:22.160
the Beatles were having a reunion concert.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.400
I tried to get John there.

30:25.680 --> 30:29.760
I remember there was one where I like, one of my talents was like, I was really good

30:29.760 --> 30:31.280
at like sucking on stuff.

30:31.920 --> 30:36.800
And so like, I attached really uncomfortable ball to play role playing games.

30:38.320 --> 30:44.480
Well, I attached myself to the bottom or to the top of a car moving vehicle with my mouth.

30:45.040 --> 30:45.200
Yeah.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.560
If that's not using your talent, then I don't know what is.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.200
Use your mouth.

30:52.080 --> 30:55.680
I think Jake had one that was like, he just wanted to like drink milk.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.080
Milk.

30:56.080 --> 30:56.320
Yeah.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.760
That was the one that won, right?

31:00.480 --> 31:01.520
Drink a lot of milk.

31:02.400 --> 31:06.160
Well, no, because other people kept drinking things that had milk in them somehow.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.600
Like, Oh yeah.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.680
Cause if other people achieve your goal, then you hit the point for it.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.720
Somebody's like, I'm going to drink a, like a white Russian.

31:14.720 --> 31:14.960
Yeah.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.320
White Russian or a milkshake.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.600
That whole drink was yeah.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.880
Latte based.

31:18.880 --> 31:25.280
So, um, we've got another, uh, we've got another question here from Limey Well.

31:25.280 --> 31:26.560
Uh, I think it was on Twitter.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.760
Got a Tinder match.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.120
Oh, congratulations.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.040
Pause.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.560
Let's hear that bio.

31:32.560 --> 31:32.720
Yeah.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.440
Let's look at this.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.560
Well, I, uh, today, earlier in the day, it said I had a free boost.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.720
So I've been matching with a lot of people.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.240
You've been like matching like crazy.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.640
So I matched with just now.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.240
Uh, it's a fun name.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.640
Just the quintessential goth girlfriend.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.240
E-girl TM.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.560
New to Missouri as of five 27.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.440
Show me what you got.

31:54.000 --> 31:54.240
Wow.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.240
Next question.

31:56.240 --> 32:01.760
On an extremely similar note, Limey Well asks, are you going to post up the campaign

32:01.760 --> 32:03.120
notes when it's complete?

32:03.120 --> 32:09.280
Uh, my answer is, you know, whatever Zach says, that's, that's, that's.

32:09.280 --> 32:09.520
Yeah.

32:09.520 --> 32:15.360
You can take your own notes along with the podcast, but if someone will pay me, I will

32:15.360 --> 32:17.280
take pictures and post them online.

32:17.280 --> 32:21.840
Are you going to go into my journals with my information that I have about all of you

32:21.840 --> 32:22.640
in the campaign?

32:22.640 --> 32:24.160
You don't know that I haven't already.

32:24.240 --> 32:29.200
Last time we did that, I found out a disturbing fact about you, which is why I am now wearing

32:29.200 --> 32:30.880
my vans at your house.

32:30.880 --> 32:31.280
Yeah.

32:31.280 --> 32:35.600
I, everybody else took their shoes off when I came in, but Luke kept his on cause I have

32:35.600 --> 32:38.160
my shoes are trying to see those toes, baby.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.440
What shoes are you guys wearing right now?

32:41.440 --> 32:47.120
So the actual answer to that question is, uh, I, I think, uh, yeah, yes.

32:47.120 --> 32:53.440
If there's interest, uh, when this, uh, when this, uh, first arc, a story arc with these

32:53.440 --> 32:57.040
characters of this campaign is finished, I'll, I'll probably type up something and,

32:57.040 --> 32:59.920
uh, send it off or just self publish it.

32:59.920 --> 33:03.840
If, if that's something people are interested in, for those of you listening, you would

33:03.840 --> 33:06.000
be the ones who had, who would probably get it.

33:06.480 --> 33:11.360
Uh, as Patrion subscribers, when, uh, is campaign though, it's a specific thing.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.440
Does he mean typing up this campaign?

33:13.440 --> 33:13.680
Yeah.

33:13.680 --> 33:18.320
So basically what I would do is I would be able to run, yeah, I would outline the town

33:18.320 --> 33:25.600
and the characters in the town and then, uh, some sort of, uh, a chain of events with,

33:25.600 --> 33:27.040
uh, to match your timeline.

33:27.040 --> 33:27.680
Exactly.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.720
And then, and then you would all have to do with that what you will.

33:30.720 --> 33:31.840
Cause that's what I'm doing.

33:32.720 --> 33:37.120
And you get to invite your new friend that has never role-played and make them be Keith.

33:37.120 --> 33:37.600
Yeah, man.

33:38.400 --> 33:38.880
Oh God.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.360
And, uh, yeah, no, I, I, that would be extremely fascinating.

33:45.600 --> 33:49.840
I would love to hear how other campaigns went that, uh, played in this setting.

33:49.840 --> 33:50.080
Oh, that would be super cool.

33:50.080 --> 33:50.960
Yeah, absolutely.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.440
That would be extremely interesting to me.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.400
Um, let's see, we've got another one here.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.520
I don't know how to pronounce this.

33:57.520 --> 33:58.720
It's a user on Reddit.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.680
It's a J O R S E S H O.

34:01.680 --> 34:02.880
Jors is ho.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.120
Like horses ho, Jors is ho.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.000
I don't know.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.680
Uh, Jors ho, Jors show, Jors show.

34:09.680 --> 34:13.280
How do you determine the mental disorders the guys suffer from?

34:14.160 --> 34:15.360
It's a really good question.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.840
And it, uh, it took some balance here.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.600
We just add the ones from our own lives.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.960
Uh, has, since I don't listen to the other guys stuff,

34:24.960 --> 34:27.520
do they, does the audience know all of our disorders?

34:27.520 --> 34:30.720
You know, I'm not sure if we've, uh, I don't think we've said it.

34:30.720 --> 34:34.480
Well, that's, that's not going to specifics then unless you want to here.

34:34.480 --> 34:37.200
Um, I think it's fine to not go into specifics here.

34:37.200 --> 34:42.720
Basically I met with each of you individually and we had a quick conversation about it where

34:43.280 --> 34:47.280
I told you what I was thinking, a base outline for what the disorder would be.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.800
And you said yes or no.

34:48.800 --> 34:53.120
I can't remember how that went down, but we muddled it and whittled it down to something

34:53.120 --> 34:54.000
that we could play with.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.240
Historically in our past games, the disorders have always been kind of based on whatever

34:58.240 --> 35:00.240
happened to give us that sanity loss.

35:00.240 --> 35:00.480
Right.

35:00.480 --> 35:05.680
So on the last episode, we actually, the last Q and A, we talked about how Luke's previous

35:05.680 --> 35:09.360
character, Dr. Denny Dennison, AKA worm fingers.

35:09.360 --> 35:14.480
He had a, I had a scat fetish, a scat fetish, a debilitating scat fetish.

35:14.480 --> 35:19.520
Do you actually remember, I remember the clue that led you to become infatuated with the

35:19.520 --> 35:27.920
poop, but I, I remember I, there was something like I had to dig through a toilet to find

35:27.920 --> 35:29.840
a clue or to find something.

35:29.840 --> 35:30.480
Yeah.

35:30.480 --> 35:35.680
And like while doing it, I lost enough, uh, to hit your breaking point, to hit my breaking

35:35.680 --> 35:36.000
point.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.640
So I developed a scat fetish and you know what?

35:40.640 --> 35:42.880
I really ran with it on that one.

35:42.880 --> 35:43.600
You sure did.

35:44.560 --> 35:49.200
So I believe in that one, we were actually playing a bit of a body horror campaign where

35:49.200 --> 35:54.880
you guys had, uh, the spawn of an elder God inside of you in the form of these little

35:54.880 --> 35:56.640
white gooby spiders.

35:56.640 --> 36:02.640
And Luke's character was bent over the toilet puking spiders like these like goopy monsters

36:02.640 --> 36:05.200
into the toilet when he saw a note.

36:05.200 --> 36:10.000
But a previous character maybe hadn't flushed when he rolled poorly or something.

36:10.000 --> 36:16.400
I had to dig through to get what I had thrown up through puke and poop to find a note left

36:16.400 --> 36:18.000
by a character who had been in the bathroom.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.240
So I lost, I lost that sanity.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.080
And then, um, you know what?

36:23.120 --> 36:27.600
It was really the perfect thing for that character to have developed.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.240
Patreon subscribers, we promise you more of this.

36:30.320 --> 36:36.720
One of mine in that last campaign.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.920
That's a little taste of the next character voice.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.720
Don't let Keith die.

36:44.480 --> 36:45.600
Already got a catchphrase.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.560
Joe, what were you saying?

36:46.560 --> 36:52.000
I, uh, I saw a ghost girl in a window for one of my disorders that sent my sanity right

36:52.000 --> 36:55.040
to the breaking point and I just was scared of kids from that point on.

36:55.040 --> 36:55.520
Children.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.520
It doesn't always have to be as gross as scat fetish.

36:58.160 --> 37:01.040
No, I mean, that's an extreme, I'm pretty sure.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.120
I would say that children are just as gross.

37:04.000 --> 37:10.320
Children and poop are also just funny because I don't remember any specifics of like you

37:10.320 --> 37:13.680
acting that out, but I just kind of ran into a group of kids in an alley one time.

37:13.680 --> 37:19.040
And I, uh, I, so, oh, wait, was that that town full of just the weird fucking kids.

37:19.040 --> 37:22.160
So when you hit your breaking point, sometimes you don't have any control over what your

37:22.160 --> 37:23.120
character does.

37:23.200 --> 37:27.920
And so I, uh, ended up running the opposite direction and like across town and away from

37:27.920 --> 37:31.040
you guys, I didn't get to be part of whatever was going on for a few minutes.

37:32.080 --> 37:36.480
That campaign was really cool because we passed through this, a very creepy town in

37:36.480 --> 37:41.920
Arkansas coming back from a show we had seen Zach and I, uh, and another friend of ours.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.880
And we were like, fuck, this would be an amazing.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.400
We can say what we went and saw.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.480
Was it, uh, it was Harmon.

37:48.480 --> 37:53.360
It was when we were at a casino in Arkansas.

37:53.360 --> 37:57.600
We know when Thomas and I were somehow more sad than we are now and still listening to

37:57.600 --> 37:58.240
Harmon town.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.720
No, Harmon town was less sad.

38:02.240 --> 38:06.320
I don't know, man, but we were going through the alienate any harmonians.

38:06.320 --> 38:06.880
No, of course.

38:06.880 --> 38:10.480
Why would we, uh, cause they're all sad losers.

38:14.080 --> 38:18.240
And we too have, uh, and we've been there so you can get out of it.

38:19.040 --> 38:24.080
But no, Harmon town was one of the things that brought, uh, Zach and I that got us interested

38:24.080 --> 38:24.560
in roleplaying.

38:24.560 --> 38:25.440
Absolutely.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.440
Have you guys ever watched Rick and Morty?

38:27.440 --> 38:30.720
So Harmon quest was not smart enough to watch Rick and Morty.

38:31.360 --> 38:31.600
Yes.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.040
Harmon quest was awesome.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.320
I really enjoyed it.

38:34.320 --> 38:39.840
So, uh, we were on our way back from Arkansas and went through this super creepy town.

38:39.840 --> 38:44.160
Then we based, uh, uh, I based a town like three months of our play on.

38:44.160 --> 38:44.560
Yeah.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.440
And it worked.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.200
It was super, it was super fun.

38:47.200 --> 38:51.600
Was that when we were doing the, like, uh, in the caves and shit with, uh, yeah.

38:51.600 --> 38:55.920
Was it a different one where it was like the, uh, the church put on the Halloween?

38:56.640 --> 39:01.040
Yes, that was different characters, but different scenario.

39:01.040 --> 39:01.360
Okay.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.080
Yeah.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.760
That was a real fun time.

39:03.760 --> 39:09.440
Uh, that's based on the Helen Texas campaign written by Scott Dorward of the good friends

39:09.440 --> 39:15.680
of Jackson Elias podcast and actually fucking huge shout out to Scott Dorward because when

39:15.680 --> 39:21.600
I was running Helen Texas during that campaign, I posted on the call of Cthulhu subreddit

39:21.600 --> 39:27.600
and I got some awesome responses from people who had also run that scenario.

39:27.600 --> 39:35.360
But also Scott responded who wrote the scenario and gave some fantastic insight into how I

39:35.360 --> 39:41.280
could finish up that scenario in a, uh, in a really interesting and a horrifying way.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.240
That's super duper cool.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.320
And I remember I came to you guys, I was like, Oh my God.

39:44.320 --> 39:44.480
No.

39:44.480 --> 39:44.720
Yeah.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.000
You were very excited.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.520
We were all excited too.

39:47.520 --> 39:52.480
Reddit is obviously the best and worst website in the world because you can create anything

39:52.480 --> 39:52.800
on there.

39:52.800 --> 39:56.880
But if you're into something very niche like this, like there it's, there's nowhere else

39:56.880 --> 39:58.080
you can go really.

39:58.080 --> 40:03.040
Honestly, the community of role playing in this game, the call of Cthulhu and Delta green

40:03.040 --> 40:05.920
specifically is so fantastic.

40:05.920 --> 40:06.480
Actually.

40:06.480 --> 40:11.040
Um, yeah, that Scott Dor that, that freaked me out and I got so giddy, but then I was

40:11.040 --> 40:12.000
in my kitchen.

40:12.000 --> 40:12.880
That was years ago, right?

40:12.880 --> 40:14.000
We were just dorks.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.600
That excited us all a lot.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.000
We're just like, Oh, we're playing this little role playing game.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.040
And I wrote it.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.200
No, he talked to me.

40:21.200 --> 40:27.520
Uh, and then like a month ago I was in my kitchen doing dishes, listening to their podcast,

40:27.520 --> 40:30.000
which I've been listening to for years now.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.400
And they started talking about pretending to be people and I lost my shit.

40:34.400 --> 40:34.900
Yeah.

40:35.440 --> 40:35.920
Incredible.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.960
I was, I was so happy.

40:38.960 --> 40:44.800
But speaking of the people within this, uh, within this hobby being fantastic humans,

40:44.800 --> 40:52.880
uh, one of the guys who is very responsible for Delta green, the role playing game, becoming

40:52.880 --> 40:55.440
a game, his name is, uh, Dennis debt Willer.

40:55.440 --> 41:03.040
And I was writing a paper for my undergrad about why role playing games are a positive

41:03.040 --> 41:06.640
influence on both the individual and society.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.560
And I needed to interview someone.

41:08.560 --> 41:14.480
And so I found his email through his Patreon and I emailed him a bunch of questions, not

41:14.480 --> 41:17.440
thinking that, uh, he would, he would respond.

41:17.440 --> 41:21.600
I emailed a bunch of different people because he was one of the creators of Delta green,

41:21.600 --> 41:25.600
the game that is the only game that I've ever run and obsessed over.

41:25.600 --> 41:32.000
And he responded like so quickly with these amazing in depth responses.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.120
And it blew me away.

41:33.120 --> 41:38.080
And I didn't even realize when I asked for some of his credentials, uh, he was, uh, he

41:38.080 --> 41:43.360
was the artist of, he was one of the artists for the original magic, the gathering.

41:43.360 --> 41:43.840
No way.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.600
Oh, so that's a cool card game.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.100
Yeah.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.520
Painting the cards.

41:47.520 --> 41:47.840
Yeah.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.040
He's an incredible artist.

41:49.040 --> 41:52.480
I think he worked for Marvel, uh, for a while.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.600
And what is Marvel?

41:53.600 --> 41:55.760
It's a, uh, they're kind of big now.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.360
Uh, actually it's funny.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.880
Little indie comic book company.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.360
They're doing real good for themselves.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.840
So that, that also, I mean, that just absolutely blew me away.

42:05.840 --> 42:10.560
And he's, he's done some interviews on some podcasts recently that have been so fun to

42:10.560 --> 42:12.000
listen to and really in depth.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.120
Um, yeah.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.080
Shout out to Dennis.

42:14.080 --> 42:18.320
He's, he's doing just amazing work and keeping the game that we love alive.

42:18.320 --> 42:18.960
Dennis.

42:18.960 --> 42:19.360
Dennis.

42:23.600 --> 42:24.000
Yeah.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.880
An alternative name for Delta green is the Dennis system.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.680
Separate entirely.

42:34.240 --> 42:36.080
That is, that is a good DMS.

42:36.080 --> 42:40.240
Like guideline for if you want to make your players terrified.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.440
Yeah, man.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.640
Delta green's real.

42:42.640 --> 42:45.520
I know we don't play the, uh, the rules as written in this.

42:45.520 --> 42:51.280
So, uh, your characters, uh, are a little bit, uh, heartier than they would be in Delta

42:51.280 --> 42:51.600
green.

42:52.800 --> 42:55.040
But we still just, and we also,

42:55.040 --> 42:56.480
Which is why Pope Cthulhu was made.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.640
It's just to offer a slightly different play style.

42:58.640 --> 42:59.280
Exactly.

42:59.280 --> 43:04.480
And like we, we also in the past, you know, have played as government agency, you know,

43:04.480 --> 43:08.080
members before, but for the podcast, wanted to do a little something different.

43:08.080 --> 43:13.200
So we are playing a, uh, a, a outside of the normal realm of Delta green and this whole,

43:13.200 --> 43:14.480
and this whole campaign.

43:14.480 --> 43:14.720
Yeah.

43:14.720 --> 43:19.760
Like, um, I don't, were you in those Delta green sessions where just people would drop

43:19.760 --> 43:22.080
like flies with me whenever we first started?

43:22.080 --> 43:26.880
Justin, when we first started, I went through three characters in three games.

43:26.880 --> 43:27.200
Yeah.

43:27.200 --> 43:32.960
I, I remember just like having a character that survived like three sessions and being

43:32.960 --> 43:34.080
like, I can't die.

43:34.080 --> 43:39.520
Like it was like this, like you feel like a God, but normally it's just like, you roll

43:39.520 --> 43:41.200
something wrong and you're fucking gone.

43:41.200 --> 43:41.440
Yeah.

43:41.440 --> 43:47.040
And your character becomes the expert in the group on the mythos within one session.

43:47.040 --> 43:47.280
Yeah.

43:47.280 --> 43:51.360
Cause you're just out survived to one other person and it's like, I guess I'm the veteran.

43:52.080 --> 43:55.760
I think that's, that's why straight Delta green rules are great for one offs.

43:55.760 --> 44:02.160
When you're like, you've got a few people together to play a one night scenario when

44:02.160 --> 44:06.160
you have six hours, six people, three people are going to die or more.

44:06.160 --> 44:11.680
Like, and it's fun to feel that, uh, fragility like to be like, I'm, I could, I could die

44:11.680 --> 44:16.320
cause I feel like I don't know if we've mentioned this or not, but I think we lost our first,

44:16.320 --> 44:18.800
the first one I played, I think we didn't win.

44:18.800 --> 44:19.200
Right.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.960
Oh, or did I just get too drunk?

44:22.480 --> 44:22.640
No.

44:23.600 --> 44:24.400
Yeah.

44:24.400 --> 44:27.040
So I don't know that I've been a part of one that we've won.

44:28.640 --> 44:28.960
Right.

44:28.960 --> 44:29.440
Yeah.

44:29.440 --> 44:36.480
Well cause yeah, like the losing upward doctor, the doctor Denny, Dr Denny Dennison one.

44:36.480 --> 44:41.600
I ended up becoming like a, a servant to the demon.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.720
Oh, well yeah.

44:42.720 --> 44:50.240
You became a servitor of a glocky, uh, the elder God who is in the labyrinth.

44:50.800 --> 44:56.640
Oh, it was the one who made us vomit spiders, right?

44:56.640 --> 44:56.960
Yes.

44:56.960 --> 44:57.280
Yeah.

44:57.280 --> 45:00.880
Oh, spoilers for that elder God.

45:03.120 --> 45:03.620
Yeah.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.160
Any new players to Delta green?

45:06.160 --> 45:09.840
If you find yourself bobbing in spiders, it's, I might be, I heard.

45:09.840 --> 45:10.720
Don't say his name.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.480
Al from Al's tires here.

45:14.480 --> 45:18.480
I would like to offer him a sincerest apologies to all of you who may have heard a recent

45:18.480 --> 45:22.240
advertisement on this radio station ostensibly from Al's tires.

45:22.800 --> 45:28.080
I assure you Al's tires disavows that message and its content completely.

45:28.080 --> 45:31.520
It does not reflect the values and standards of Al's tires.

45:31.520 --> 45:35.600
We shy unabashedly from that sort of empty braggadocio and flash.

45:36.240 --> 45:42.000
My son Al Jr suffers from acute hyperactive attention deficit disorder, leaving him as

45:42.000 --> 45:46.160
devoid of business sense as he is a sense of basic radio propriety.

45:46.160 --> 45:50.640
He will no longer be watching Al's tires on Saturdays unsupervised.

45:50.640 --> 45:55.920
Several weeks ago, my beloved wife Molly suggested I take out a local radio advertisement.

45:55.920 --> 46:02.320
And while I was at first reluctant, the resulting 7% increase in business was frankly intoxicating,

46:02.320 --> 46:07.200
but seeing the impact of fame on my family and my son Al Jr in particular has me questioning

46:07.200 --> 46:10.080
whether Al's tires hasn't lost 7% of its soul.

46:10.720 --> 46:14.720
So for the next few weeks, we're going to do a little less talking and take some more

46:14.720 --> 46:16.880
time to listen, pray, and reflect.

46:17.760 --> 46:22.320
All sale prices mentioned in the original advertisement will, of course, be honored.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.720
Thank you and God bless.

46:24.720 --> 46:29.040
We've got another question here from Reddit from user, oh boy,

46:29.040 --> 46:40.080
Rinafiron asks, are there different classes?

46:40.080 --> 46:42.800
It seems magic is available in this world.

46:42.880 --> 46:48.240
Did the boys just choose not to go down that road with these characters?

46:48.240 --> 46:53.040
I'm going to let you guys field this one because we've, this is our third campaign together

46:53.040 --> 46:54.320
and we have some experience with this.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.520
So yes, magic is available.

46:58.720 --> 47:00.000
This is actually a question for you, Zach.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.280
Is it available from the outset?

47:01.280 --> 47:03.600
You kind of have to find it as a character, don't you?

47:03.600 --> 47:05.040
That's, that's what we've done.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.080
And that's fun.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.240
I think, which is why I don't think any of us.

47:08.880 --> 47:10.560
Is there a mechanic for it to start out with?

47:10.560 --> 47:11.840
Can you find it to start?

47:11.920 --> 47:15.920
I believe in the rules of Delta green rules is written.

47:15.920 --> 47:22.080
You can take a, uh, from the top, you can have an experience with the unnatural.

47:23.120 --> 47:26.240
However, we have never played that way.

47:26.240 --> 47:31.120
And I, the rules I think would totally allow for you to be an advanced kind of character

47:31.120 --> 47:32.560
in that if you want it to be.

47:32.560 --> 47:39.120
But when we've done our longer campaigns, I think I'm the only one who's been given magic.

47:39.520 --> 47:43.760
You're the only one, as far as I can remember, you're the only one that has used magic.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.920
And it was a pretty long process and it was cool.

47:45.920 --> 47:51.040
Zach made, literally, he handed me at our friend Jake's, uh, pizza night.

47:51.680 --> 47:52.640
Pizza night?

47:52.640 --> 47:54.000
Shout out to Jake Heron again.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.800
This hand drawn, uh, 25 more dollars.

47:56.800 --> 47:57.920
Jake's vegan burgers.

47:57.920 --> 48:00.400
You owe us 50 for the app.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.440
Get the total.

48:01.440 --> 48:06.560
This hand drawn little notebook with all these symbols and like weird incantations in it and

48:06.560 --> 48:07.040
shit.

48:07.040 --> 48:08.800
And like, it was awesome.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.120
And he just like, he handed it to me silently.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.640
He's like, it's like, you know what this is?

48:12.640 --> 48:13.920
And I was like, I don't know what this is.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.960
It's like, no, that was actually so dope.

48:18.960 --> 48:20.240
I remember that so clearly.

48:20.240 --> 48:27.920
So the, uh, call of Cthulhu put out a supplement called the grimoire, the grand grimoire.

48:27.920 --> 48:33.920
And I was so fucking stoked for that book because that's a call of Cthulhu mechanic,

48:33.920 --> 48:35.040
not a Delta green mechanic.

48:35.040 --> 48:40.160
Yeah, so that, that, those, that book, uh, is for the call of Cthulhu game.

48:40.160 --> 48:47.120
And it has every single spell that has been used in a call of Cthulhu scenario in the

48:47.120 --> 48:50.000
book alphabetized and ready to go.

48:50.000 --> 48:56.720
And so I went through it and I found ones that I thought fit into the campaign that

48:56.720 --> 48:59.120
we were currently running at the time.

48:59.120 --> 49:07.920
And what I did with it is I buried it in the grave of Joe's character's brother.

49:07.920 --> 49:11.120
And that character, the brother was still alive.

49:12.320 --> 49:15.840
And Thomas's character found the book in that grave.

49:15.840 --> 49:20.000
Thus learning that Joe's character's brother was still alive.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
And that was still a closed game at the time.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.440
So we did that in game.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.520
We figured, we figured out and found out in game.

49:25.520 --> 49:26.720
It was real, it was real cool.

49:26.720 --> 49:32.240
And basically for that game, the whole idea was that you guys were playing cowboys, uh,

49:32.240 --> 49:38.400
as the terminology goes in Delta green within the, uh, within the lore of the system, there

49:38.400 --> 49:40.800
are two factions of Delta green.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.760
There's the cowboys and the program.

49:43.760 --> 49:49.200
And the cowboys are these, uh, these guys who've been doing this forever, who have the

49:49.200 --> 49:52.240
cells, a cell B cell all the way down.

49:52.240 --> 49:56.960
And they are there to protect the world from the mythos.

49:56.960 --> 50:03.760
And then, uh, basically the program was this Delta green, uh, organization, basically the

50:03.760 --> 50:08.640
ones who were brought over from majestic 12, which is an organization within the original

50:08.640 --> 50:09.440
Delta green game.

50:09.440 --> 50:14.080
I'm getting into some deep lore here, but basically, uh, Joe's character's brother was

50:14.080 --> 50:16.240
the leader of the opposition group.

50:17.040 --> 50:17.520
Nice.

50:18.080 --> 50:21.200
And they found out that he was alive and they found this spell book.

50:21.200 --> 50:25.840
So, uh, Thomas was allowed these, like, I think I gave you like eight spells.

50:25.840 --> 50:29.600
They were all, um, as powerful as they were fucked up.

50:30.320 --> 50:33.600
Cause you had to do something in order to cast the spell, right?

50:33.600 --> 50:36.480
They cost, I think willpower and some other things.

50:36.480 --> 50:42.080
They, they all exact, like they were costly and they weren't guaranteed as the thing.

50:42.080 --> 50:45.280
I lost my arm trying to cast one of them.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.960
I remember that one so specifically.

50:46.960 --> 50:50.880
Was that the helicopter one or so with, had you fucked it up?

50:50.880 --> 50:52.960
I remember, I remember the scene so well.

50:52.960 --> 50:59.680
So in that town that we based off, uh, in Arkansas, there was a cave because, um, there

50:59.680 --> 51:03.680
was some sign we saw in this like seemingly abandoned town in Arkansas.

51:03.680 --> 51:04.080
Oh yeah.

51:04.080 --> 51:07.600
It was like trail of the hill people or some shit like that.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.040
That's exactly what it said.

51:09.040 --> 51:12.800
And we also cave people, I think trail of the cave people.

51:13.360 --> 51:17.600
And so I immediately was like, Oh, going to go into that for our game.

51:17.600 --> 51:22.080
And it was like, it's a cool, I think archeological thing that I'd like to go back to,

51:22.080 --> 51:24.080
but it sounded spooky as fuck.

51:24.080 --> 51:24.480
Yeah.

51:24.480 --> 51:34.400
And in the game it was, and there is this woman up there who was a, uh, who was a mythos,

51:34.400 --> 51:38.080
um, tainted, uh, creature at this point.

51:38.080 --> 51:44.640
And she had trapped them and Thomas tries to pull off the spell and rolls a fucking

51:44.640 --> 51:45.360
crit fail.

51:46.160 --> 51:50.800
The spell, if it had been successful, I believe would have transformed some of the blood in

51:50.800 --> 51:55.200
my body into this like damaging dust, right?

51:55.200 --> 51:56.880
That shoots out my arm.

51:56.880 --> 52:00.640
And so I'd pulled it off a couple of times, uh, before this.

52:00.640 --> 52:05.520
And this time, yeah, I roll the crit fail and instead of the blood in my arm turning

52:05.600 --> 52:10.320
to dust, just my whole arm turned to dust and it was gone.

52:10.320 --> 52:10.640
Yeah.

52:10.640 --> 52:10.960
Yeah.

52:10.960 --> 52:13.040
So not to get too sorry, Luke, go on.

52:13.040 --> 52:17.840
I was going to ask, uh, just, was this the woman that made us drink blood out of a bowl?

52:17.840 --> 52:18.320
Yes.

52:18.320 --> 52:18.640
Okay.

52:18.640 --> 52:18.960
Yeah.

52:18.960 --> 52:19.600
Yeah.

52:19.600 --> 52:23.040
Um, so it was one of our more lighthearted adventures.

52:24.720 --> 52:30.080
So I, uh, not to get too deep on just me and Thomas talking about a past campaign, but,

52:30.080 --> 52:35.520
uh, one of my favorite role playing nights of all time was actually just Thomas and I

52:35.520 --> 52:37.200
sitting at my kitchen table.

52:37.200 --> 52:42.800
And that character had just gotten this spell book that, you know, that he had found and

52:42.800 --> 52:46.560
he went out to the woods to, oh my God.

52:46.560 --> 52:46.960
Yeah.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.440
To try to experiment with some of the spells.

52:49.440 --> 52:51.600
Was this the professor character?

52:51.600 --> 52:55.520
This was the professor, uh, professor Richard Ryland.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.320
Oh, dr.

52:56.320 --> 52:56.800
Dr.

52:56.800 --> 52:58.320
Richard Ryland.

52:58.320 --> 53:06.160
And your wife was very ill.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.040
She's very ill.

53:07.040 --> 53:13.120
And so, so one of the spells in the book was, it wasn't quite clear what it did.

53:13.120 --> 53:18.240
That's why I had to experiment on it, but it looked like it would transfer a life into

53:18.240 --> 53:19.920
a, into a healthier body.

53:19.920 --> 53:20.080
Yeah.

53:20.080 --> 53:24.000
Can you go into like, none of the spells in the spell book actually said.

53:24.000 --> 53:24.960
Yeah, exactly.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.320
They just kind of had, um, fuck.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.680
I don't, I don't remember.

53:29.680 --> 53:31.040
I'm sure I still have it somewhere.

53:31.040 --> 53:31.280
Yeah.

53:31.280 --> 53:36.000
They had obtuse and vague names for the spells and then light directions.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.040
So very much so.

53:37.680 --> 53:41.440
So he didn't necessarily know what they were going to do, but what he did do was go out

53:41.440 --> 53:45.120
to a gas station and, uh, find some right.

53:45.120 --> 53:45.600
Dr.

53:45.600 --> 53:48.400
Ryland picked up an aimless teen.

53:48.400 --> 53:48.640
Yeah.

53:48.640 --> 53:49.920
Three of them, I believe.

53:49.920 --> 53:50.800
Oh, that's right.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.000
Aimless teens.

53:52.080 --> 53:56.400
And he took them out to the woods and he tried to switch the body with deers.

53:56.960 --> 53:57.200
Yeah.

53:58.080 --> 54:04.160
So he like shot a deer and then tried to transfer the life of one of these boys into the body

54:04.160 --> 54:04.800
of the deer.

54:05.360 --> 54:11.440
And, uh, it was one of the most fucked up and horrifying nights of role playing I've

54:11.440 --> 54:17.760
ever had in my life because I was the one, I was the one playing, I was the DM, but I

54:17.760 --> 54:23.600
was playing these Call of Cthulhu characters basically who were stuck in the woods with

54:23.600 --> 54:24.800
a goddamn sorcerer.

54:25.520 --> 54:26.000
Wait.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.200
So I, I, I don't know if you told us about this or if this was just, no, that was specifically

54:31.200 --> 54:38.560
something that I think I kept from you guys in the campaign because I had, I know, um,

54:38.560 --> 54:41.520
I killed three teenagers.

54:41.520 --> 54:44.160
Uh, he actually at least one teenager.

54:44.720 --> 54:50.640
If I remember correctly, they tried to run away and then you use that, the one that you

54:50.640 --> 54:55.120
lost the spell that you lost your arm to, you use that to disintegrate them.

54:55.680 --> 54:57.120
So the teens didn't get away.

54:58.480 --> 55:04.880
Well, the, the spell that I remember you casting in that was a, to down a helicopter.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.560
That was the blood arm one.

55:06.560 --> 55:09.840
I was trying to shoot my blood dust at that helicopter to down it.

55:09.840 --> 55:12.400
I don't know if I succeeded in that one or if that's where I lost my arm.

55:12.400 --> 55:13.520
I actually can't remember.

55:13.520 --> 55:15.120
You lost your arm in the cave, but it doesn't matter.

55:15.120 --> 55:20.160
It was very, you successfully down the helicopter.

55:20.160 --> 55:25.120
I don't know why, but like for some reason we were found out of all the shit that we

55:25.120 --> 55:25.840
had been doing.

55:25.840 --> 55:25.920
Yeah.

55:25.920 --> 55:31.200
I don't know if you've been listening, but I'm pretty lenient on, uh, what is allowed

55:31.200 --> 55:37.760
to happen in the games because it's so much fun and like the more fun shit that happens,

55:37.760 --> 55:40.000
the better the game is in my opinion.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.080
And I'm not going to step in your way.

55:42.400 --> 55:48.560
So it's so much sucks when you're like, yeah, like you, you do not do this often.

55:48.560 --> 55:56.000
And when you do, well, you do it for good reasons.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.080
I mean, I say you don't do this often.

55:58.080 --> 56:03.120
You do it very sparingly, but it's like, the only times you say no is when I'm saying

56:03.120 --> 56:07.360
something and I'm like, there's no way that he says yes to this.

56:07.360 --> 56:09.680
And then, and then, and then you say no.

56:09.680 --> 56:10.320
I'm like, okay.

56:12.080 --> 56:17.600
I just, I was just listening to an episode where, um, you, Luke as Keith.

56:17.600 --> 56:21.440
Oh, it's, it's where you, uh, I was really listening to the episode where you kill your

56:21.440 --> 56:22.000
brother.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.320
Cause I was like kind of fuzzy on those events and I was like, wait, what happened with all

56:26.320 --> 56:26.800
that?

56:26.800 --> 56:32.480
So I listened to it again and you shut off the power to, uh, Fergie's house.

56:33.280 --> 56:37.600
Then you try to go back through this automatic door and Zach's like, you prop that open,

56:37.600 --> 56:37.840
right?

56:38.880 --> 56:41.440
He didn't just say like, you can't get back in.

56:41.600 --> 56:48.880
Which I think is a very tempting DM instinct sometimes, but it's, it's so much more fun

56:48.880 --> 56:53.440
to just get to keep murdering his brother and that woman.

56:53.440 --> 56:57.360
I would have found a way around it, but also it would have just taken up time.

56:57.360 --> 57:00.080
A roadblock for roadblock's sake is not a fun thing.

57:00.080 --> 57:00.960
Exactly.

57:00.960 --> 57:04.080
If it's, if it's really something stupid you've done, sometimes yes.

57:04.080 --> 57:08.320
But like this was straight up just like, yeah, there's no reason to not get you back through

57:08.320 --> 57:08.720
this door.

57:09.360 --> 57:17.200
Recently I was talking to Andy who is Luke's DM in that Pathfinder game and we were, shout

57:17.200 --> 57:21.280
out to Andy, we were talking about the campaign that you're actually playing in right now.

57:21.280 --> 57:27.600
And he was asking me about ways to carry forward and I kind of told him, I was like, well,

57:27.600 --> 57:31.760
if you want them to do something that you don't expect, give them a dead end.

57:31.760 --> 57:37.760
And it's what I did with Thomas and Luke in the, in the box that was hanging over the,

57:37.760 --> 57:41.360
the pulping, the juice box as I've thought of it.

57:42.400 --> 57:46.720
Where the fighters, the loser got pulped and juiced onto the crowd below.

57:46.720 --> 57:48.000
I basically, I put you guys in there.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.440
I had no fucking clue.

57:49.440 --> 57:54.560
I'd honestly, um, listeners, I know you're ready for us to get pulped.

57:54.560 --> 57:59.520
No, I know that you think that, uh, I'm, I'm paying really close attention and I am, but

57:59.520 --> 58:00.960
I forgot Luke had that gun.

58:02.960 --> 58:07.040
That is exactly, that is hilarious because we had confirmed it.

58:07.360 --> 58:11.280
That's exactly what I was going to ask is like, did you remember that I had that?

58:11.280 --> 58:12.320
No, no, I didn't.

58:12.320 --> 58:14.560
And when you pulled it out, I was like, yes, dig gun.

58:15.840 --> 58:21.280
So like what was, uh, what, what would an alternate reality be if you know what Keith

58:21.280 --> 58:22.960
isn't as stupid as you think he is.

58:24.160 --> 58:28.880
And alternate reality is that we do a strength test on each other to beat each other to death.

58:28.880 --> 58:29.280
Yeah.

58:29.280 --> 58:31.120
And one of you fucking kills the other one.

58:32.400 --> 58:34.880
And then we just go into the next character or something.

58:34.880 --> 58:35.360
Yeah.

58:35.360 --> 58:37.600
Um, actually I've got a 50.

58:37.600 --> 58:38.800
What do you have in strength?

58:38.800 --> 58:39.280
Strength.

58:39.280 --> 58:40.800
We've, uh, we've got some dice here.

58:40.800 --> 58:41.680
We could settle this.

58:41.680 --> 58:42.240
Yeah.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.680
You need, what's your score?

58:43.680 --> 58:46.720
Strength 55.

58:46.720 --> 58:46.960
Okay.

58:46.960 --> 58:48.400
You've got five more than me.

58:48.400 --> 58:52.480
So whoever rolls the highest without going over, beats the other one to death.

58:53.760 --> 58:55.120
26.

58:55.120 --> 58:56.160
Oh, that's a pass.

58:56.880 --> 58:57.840
At least it's a pass.

58:57.840 --> 58:58.720
40.

58:58.720 --> 58:59.520
Luke wins that one.

58:59.520 --> 59:00.400
Oh shit.

59:00.400 --> 59:03.840
Keith Vigna fucking kills John Lee Pettymore.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.600
Good thing that didn't happen canonically.

59:06.960 --> 59:09.440
Um, we literally had someone on the subreddit ask.

59:10.560 --> 59:13.440
They're like, Oh man, I wanted to see John kill Keith.

59:13.440 --> 59:13.600
Yeah.

59:13.600 --> 59:14.720
And we all agreed.

59:14.720 --> 59:15.360
Yeah.

59:15.360 --> 59:19.920
Hey, well to whatever, uh, user that was, fuck you.

59:23.440 --> 59:26.320
Keith kills John and you know what?

59:26.320 --> 59:27.440
I'm going to role play it out.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.360
Use your character voice.

59:31.360 --> 59:32.160
Yeah, please.

59:32.160 --> 59:32.640
Yeah.

59:32.720 --> 59:33.040
Hold on.

59:35.680 --> 59:42.800
Keith, uh, walks into the, uh, walks into the cube, squares up with John and we're looking

59:42.800 --> 59:44.160
at each other in the eye.

59:44.160 --> 59:48.240
And Keith is looking at John like, man, I really don't want to do this.

59:49.280 --> 59:52.720
John is looking at Keith like, man, I really want to do this.

59:52.720 --> 59:54.000
Really wants to kill me.

59:54.000 --> 59:54.960
And I see that.

59:55.840 --> 59:56.720
And then you shoot him.

59:56.720 --> 59:57.600
You just pulled the gun.

59:57.600 --> 59:57.840
Yeah.

59:57.840 --> 59:59.840
And then you pull the gun out of your penis.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.680
And then I pull the gun out of my penis.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.720
No, I, uh, I, I, yeah, that's exactly for sure.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:12.080
Uh, Rena, uh, the, uh, the same user asked, uh, are you really going to end the podcast

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.840
if you don't hit the Patreon goal?

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.480
Yes.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:14.800
Yeah.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:15.680
Yeah.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.400
I know.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.920
We will continue the story for, for us, but we will have the fan on.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.600
We will have the door open.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.960
We will be, we will be getting drunker than we do.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.160
Zach won't be spending like a full time job every week.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.400
I'll hang out with my wife all the time.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.600
Well, your wife sucks.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:39.760
That's not true.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.480
That's not true.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.000
Oh my God.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.800
Well, I just, uh, you've got the coolest wife.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:45.360
I know.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.120
Shout out to Taylor.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.440
Shout out to Taylor who did a stellar job in the episode, sweater vest, sweater vest,

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.160
sweater vest with Joe on his backstory.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.560
We are also bringing her back shortly.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:57.680
Oh, spoilers.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.640
I haven't listened to yours.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.120
Also, uh, on, on one of the breaks, also shout out to product.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:12.240
Um, on one of the breaks, I, uh, I walked into the kitchen to throw away a beer can

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.960
and recycle to recycle a beer can.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.760
And, uh, I was like, this smells so good.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.720
You had another question coming from, Oh no, you said it.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.160
I was trying to pull us up.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.480
No question from Joe.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.200
Can we leave?

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.560
Yeah, it is definitely edit all of that.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.840
Do we, do we have another question to end it with or a thing too?

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.760
Well, wait, let's expand a little bit more on.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.840
Yes, we are going to end the podcast.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.480
So yeah.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.520
Uh, sadly.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:51.520
We will have to, uh, stop releasing, uh, weekly and free episodes and any episodes

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.600
for anyone we'll just shut down completely.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.400
And let's not mention that we like, don't even mention we'll keep playing it.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.600
Just be like, no, this is the end.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.160
Yeah, of course.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:00.640
It's the end.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.000
You definitely won't keep playing.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.520
And we'll, we'll know.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.480
I mean, we won't know what happens to these characters, but, uh, if you don't,

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.480
if we don't make a thousand dollars a month, we won't be friends anymore.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:14.960
Oh yeah.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.040
No, I'll never hang out with these guys again.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:17.760
Why would I?

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.800
That's pretty true.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.560
I will move out of the house that we all live in.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.120
But we do need to make it worth Zach's time.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.400
That's the bottom line.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.360
He, he, he put, he puts hours and hours and hours and hours into it.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.640
It needs to be, uh, uh, something that he can be able to do.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.120
But more importantly, we really want to grow this into a big enterprise where

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.240
we are delivering you solid content, not only on a weekly basis, but maybe a

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.720
twice a week basis, the episodes can get longer.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.080
We can get bonus episodes.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.920
We can start a second podcast.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.560
There are so many things that we can do.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.000
We can play other games.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.760
Um, this is super fun.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.480
It's something we'd really like to keep doing all of us.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.040
And so what we would like to say is thank you.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.760
Thank you so much for hopping on board right away.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.960
That's so fucking cool.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.080
Everybody that is listening to this right now.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.440
Keep telling your friends about the podcast.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.960
That's one of the easiest ways you can help, uh, help us grow is by telling your

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.280
friends that, uh, we're doing this weird thing.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.200
If you know somebody who likes funny stuff, tell them.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.200
If you know somebody who likes spooky stuff, tell them.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:17.680
Yeah.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.840
If it's the same person, you can tell them twice.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.360
Keep reviewing us on iTunes.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.120
We'd love to hear it.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.440
Even the negative reviews, like really help us.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:32.480
We got one that, uh, we were all pretty tickled by because it specifically said,

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.840
you know, this podcast is just for white guys sitting around being funny.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.080
And they didn't say trying to be funny.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.560
Thank God they didn't say trying.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.880
So a horror podcast, you know, role play podcast isn't for everybody, but at least

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.520
you like us.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.080
So thank you.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.280
Thank you so much for supporting us.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:04.240
It really honestly, it, it means, it means so, so much to us that you care enough to

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:04.800
do that.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.600
And we are infinitely and, uh, disgustingly grateful.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.160
Absolutely.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.400
Thank you.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:10.960
Thank you.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.440
Thank you.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:11.840
Yeah.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.040
Uh, so let's send it on back to Wolf the dog.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:15.760
We'll see you next month.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:16.720
We'll see you next month.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:56.720
We'll see you next month.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.960
I just wanted to apologize for saying kudzu was dishing out hot slop.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:26.800
You see for your boy Wolf hot slop is something good and something good in the neighborhood

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:38.720
is kudzu with no backbone.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:06:05.600
How am I the only one trying to fool?

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:15.600
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:28.600
With no mind at all, no mind at all

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:35.600
Light to light, street me down, takes me back to where you're from

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:46.600
When you don't stop a dying of devotion to only one

01:06:46.600 --> 01:07:06.600
With no mind at all, no mind at all, no mind at all

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:30.600
With no mind at all, no mind at all

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:39.600
Tell me the words, tell me the lies

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:47.600
Tell me the guns, tell me the lies

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:59.600
Tell me the lies, tell me the lies

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:20.600
Tell me the words, tell me the lies

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.600
Thank you for watching!
