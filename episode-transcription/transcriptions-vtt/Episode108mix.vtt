00:00.000 --> 00:13.280
Hey y'all, it's Zach. Sorry for not being wolf, he'll be on momentarily, but first I have a quick announcement and a request, a plea, I'm begging, it's a bag.

00:13.280 --> 00:22.640
The announcement, you may have noticed we released a trailer for this first season of pretending to be people here on our RSS feed.

00:22.800 --> 00:31.120
We've also uploaded said trailer to YouTube, yeah! I'm so abso-fucking-lutely stoked.

00:31.760 --> 00:37.680
This has been on my to-do list for two years now and crossing it off,

00:39.840 --> 00:49.120
I won't go into detail, but it feels good. I have poured everything I am into this show and I'm

00:49.120 --> 00:55.600
immensely proud of the result. And the fact that my best friends and I have been able to stay close

00:55.600 --> 01:05.440
and create this story together, it's really meaningful. Shit, okay, on to the request, the plea,

01:05.440 --> 01:13.360
the bag. Please, please, you've listened to so many hours of this campaign and like

01:13.360 --> 01:22.080
three and a half years of our bullshitting banter, so I beg you, please share our trailer

01:22.080 --> 01:30.080
for pretending to be people season one everywhere. Reddit, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook,

01:30.080 --> 01:39.840
fuck Mark Zuckerberg, everywhere. It would make me feel good. And as Wolf says, the link

01:40.400 --> 01:47.760
is in the show notes. Seriously, thank you all so much for listening. We have horribly delightful

01:47.760 --> 01:55.200
things in store for you after season one, so hold on to your horses by their sick BDSM gear

01:55.200 --> 02:03.280
and get ready. Now over to you, Wolf. I have a question for y'all, my adoring fans. Do you

02:03.360 --> 02:11.840
prefer your bread to be moist or unmoist? Before I answer, you should comment down below what y'all

02:11.840 --> 02:19.360
prefer. And don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe. And before I answer, this question

02:19.360 --> 02:26.560
was brought to you by Wet Bread Incorporated. They make bread wetter. So anyway, I, of course,

02:26.560 --> 02:33.120
like my bread moist and sloppy. You throw a couple of slices of that good year old bread

02:33.120 --> 02:40.000
into a bucket of room temp milk, let it sit for a month to 10, and you got a damn stew going.

02:40.000 --> 02:50.640
And oh yeah, this is live from 694.2 PTBP, the only channel that offers you at least a baker's

02:50.640 --> 02:58.240
dozen of new songs every week. This Howlin' with Wolf is from Brendan, who lives in San Diego.

02:58.240 --> 03:03.840
They tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. Just one of the many ways

03:03.840 --> 03:09.760
you can help to make sure your favorite wolf's trash stays good and wet. They write,

03:10.320 --> 03:17.200
Wolf, it's me. I was able to use the gun again, and I think this is the right time stream.

03:17.200 --> 03:23.040
Things are really messed up. We have to make sure we keep those myriad monsters from stopping the

03:23.040 --> 03:29.040
contention boys from fulfilling their destiny. Remember to keep checking the trash for the

03:29.040 --> 03:38.480
updates from the head office. Your friend, Dog the Wolf. Head office? Head office? You think there

03:38.480 --> 03:45.520
are powers that are above my own in this world, Dog the Wolf? Dog the Wolf, if that even is your

03:45.520 --> 03:52.160
real name, what a stupid piece of shit name you have that no one would ever take seriously.

03:52.160 --> 03:57.520
If you write this show again, I'm gonna find you, Dog the Wolf. And when I do,

03:59.280 --> 04:06.000
well, I'd probably give you a big ol' hug. But then I'll banish you back to your own time from

04:06.000 --> 04:12.320
whence you came. And remember, I don't make the rules, except for when I decide to. If you want

04:12.320 --> 04:19.360
to write up something for your sourdough damsel, Wolf to Hal, tag at PretendingPod on the dadgum

04:19.360 --> 04:27.040
internet, or write up a five star review on Apple Podcasts. And let my producer know you did so by

04:27.040 --> 04:34.240
dropping an email to pretendingpod at gmail.com. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. Follow at PretendingPod

04:34.240 --> 04:39.520
on Instagram though. Fuck Jack Dorsey. Make sure you follow at PretendingPod on Twitter.

04:39.520 --> 04:45.680
And fuck Jack Conte. Subscribe to Pretending to Be People on Patreon. Discord sick though,

04:45.680 --> 04:53.520
no doubt. Follow along with our little community over there. All the links? Guess where they are.

04:53.520 --> 05:02.400
Hyrule? No, you fucking nerd. The links are in the damn show notes. I am the segue, and the truth,

05:02.400 --> 05:12.480
and the life. No one cometh unto the news but by me. Last time Rose Mary performed its predictable,

05:12.480 --> 05:19.040
prepared, profusive prose. Though the production proved powerless due to a pitiful pun,

05:19.040 --> 05:25.760
John stood his well-lit ground, shed the skin of his father, and began to alter the stage for what

05:25.760 --> 05:33.360
is sure to be a main event level brawl. Don, Keith, and Clark ran for the shiny black building.

05:33.360 --> 05:41.600
They were met by a chanting chorus, a singing swarm, a reciting circle, a luminous land liturgy,

05:41.600 --> 05:47.360
a crooning crowd that consisted of close to all the characters that have been in this show so far.

05:48.080 --> 05:55.680
Except for me. But like, I am here. I'm not looking around. I'm, uh, fuck. This new world's

05:55.680 --> 06:02.240
got me feeling like a child called David after he visits the first Randy Angst. Is this going to be

06:02.240 --> 06:10.400
forever? If so, that's fine. I've got Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In?

06:17.440 --> 06:27.440
On top of the water, Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar,

06:28.960 --> 06:38.400
crossing the double line, doing it every time. Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

06:38.400 --> 06:45.440
What kind of world are you living in?

06:51.920 --> 07:02.320
Farts and Buttons. This 10-story tall creature with Rose M-A-R-Y atop it begins to trudge forward.

07:02.880 --> 07:11.360
You see little technicolor beams from in front of you as you're running toward this building begin

07:11.360 --> 07:22.160
to, as people start appearing on this luminous land all around you. As they hit the ground,

07:22.160 --> 07:27.600
they're confused about what's happening. They're looking around. You see they're feeling their skin

07:27.600 --> 07:35.040
like they were just recently covered in ooze. And now they're here. And you see with each

07:35.040 --> 07:43.840
new person that arrives in this place, the beast grows even larger. You're running away,

07:43.840 --> 07:49.120
but as you turn back and look over your shoulder to see, I mean, this thing is growing and growing

07:50.080 --> 07:53.200
and Rosemary is just cackling into the sky.

07:59.600 --> 08:07.520
And with one arm, this beast swipes at Silas Cole, picks him up off the ground,

08:07.520 --> 08:14.640
and as Silas Cole is devoured by this fist, he is no longer visible.

08:14.640 --> 08:19.120
Black and red light starts coming out from the hole that Jon has made in the ground.

08:20.160 --> 08:24.480
And the air around you sounds angry. Keith Vigna, your counterpart,

08:24.480 --> 08:30.800
you sent him to his seeming demise. It's your turn.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.280
I'll just keep running. Clark.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.760
I want to say real fast that we started doing some goof-em-ups, but when you were describing

08:39.760 --> 08:46.000
seeing the town, I was getting nostalgia waves of joy with each person. When you said Gary

08:46.000 --> 08:52.400
Daly was dressed to the nines, I was like, oh, Gary. That was really cool. That was really cool

08:52.400 --> 08:59.840
to see all of our old friends. Now you get to die alongside them.

08:59.840 --> 09:06.720
Clark is hearing that chant. Is that ringing a bell for him? Joe's, I guess, asking, is this

09:06.720 --> 09:12.880
the chant that he had heard back when he was here previously? Yes. As this thing reverberates in

09:12.880 --> 09:20.640
your head, you kind of think back to the moment you were in the circle of knowledge. Chief Maggie

09:20.640 --> 09:27.520
Cook places this thing, this little bug-like creature with round circular mouths on the

09:27.520 --> 09:35.360
bottom of your left foot, and you're sent to this place where these 12 figures are chanting up to

09:35.360 --> 09:40.400
this beast. This beast that now in your memory looks tiny compared to this thing that you're

09:40.400 --> 09:47.120
running away from, but at the time brought you to your fucking knees. And as you were weeping,

09:47.760 --> 09:57.440
you just heard, Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya of all the overseers. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya of all the overseers.

09:57.440 --> 10:03.760
Clark is kind of with Reckless Abandon going to run toward that group, and he's singing along.

10:03.840 --> 10:08.000
I don't know if he can find a way to get into the circle, but he wants to, he's like,

10:08.000 --> 10:14.640
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya of all the overseers. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya. And I'm kind of emotioning

10:14.640 --> 10:20.880
to the guys around me like, come on, come on. As you begin chanting this,

10:22.560 --> 10:32.560
a light beams straight up into the dark sky from the middle of this circle, and a figure begins

10:32.560 --> 10:39.280
rising with both of its hands out from the middle of this inner and outer circle that are going

10:39.280 --> 10:47.840
in counter and normally clockwise directions. And you see a light emitting up into the air

10:47.840 --> 10:57.600
from this humanoid's face. It is wearing dark robes, and it removes the hood above its head,

10:58.240 --> 11:10.560
and there's a cowboy hat. Like a no-shit, like John Wayne-style cowboy hat on top of Clark Bishop

11:10.560 --> 11:18.240
with black robes about 10 feet off the ground in the middle of this. And you, with your immense

11:18.240 --> 11:29.040
power, chanting this same chant has given the overseer an overwhelming dose of unnatural power.

11:30.720 --> 11:39.280
Yes, dude. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya. Clark has a lot more gusto in his chant as he sees this happening

11:39.280 --> 11:49.120
before him. He is groovin' to it. Don, as you've gotten closer to this towering building,

11:50.080 --> 11:57.120
this building that once looked huge, but again, with the perspective you have in this world now

11:57.120 --> 12:01.360
with this creature behind you, this building doesn't look so tall, maybe three stories,

12:01.360 --> 12:07.040
four stories. You hear the phone ring, and it's ringing from the top floor of this building. You

12:07.040 --> 12:12.640
know it to be true in your Pettymore heart. You always trust a Pettymore heart. Just shut up,

12:12.640 --> 12:19.920
Zach. Don't squint at me and frown. No, yeah. Donnie Pettymore's gonna run. I don't know.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.520
Does the building have doors even? Like, I don't know. Is it like an unnatural? Yeah,

12:23.520 --> 12:27.840
you kind of run past this huge group that's chanting, not giving a fuck about the thing

12:27.840 --> 12:32.800
that is tugging at the heartstrings emotionally of the other three PCs in this situation,

12:33.600 --> 12:39.440
and you can head right into the door of this thing. Yeah, I'll kind of push my way through

12:39.440 --> 12:46.720
the crowd if they're in the way. Yeah, love it. Even rudely so, just knocking someone over.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.680
I gotta get to that damn phone. You make it all the way up the stairs. You just fucking

12:51.680 --> 12:57.840
sprint through these people into this building, up the stairs to the top floor. You see a small room.

12:57.840 --> 13:03.840
There's a table made out of this inky black substance that the entire building is made out

13:03.840 --> 13:09.360
of. There's a candle that is lighting this room that's sitting on top of this table,

13:09.360 --> 13:16.000
and the candle is giving off the only light in this room, and it is illuminating two objects

13:16.000 --> 13:23.760
sitting beside it on this desk. One on one side of the candle. There is an old-timey radio with

13:23.760 --> 13:29.840
strange glass tubes, one of the glass tubes of which is broken, and neither the red nor the

13:29.840 --> 13:36.400
green light are lit. On the other side of the candle, there's an old rotary phone.

13:38.800 --> 13:50.960
Jon. Like a bad 3D animation, the ground where Jon was is just sinking and sinking deeper and

13:50.960 --> 13:58.480
deeper, and this red and white light is coming out of it, this angry light, now that you've seen

13:58.480 --> 14:05.920
Silas be destroyed. And all you see this turn is that it suddenly goes out. And in its place,

14:06.480 --> 14:16.240
a technicolor swirl begins to appear. This spinning mass of people who are treating

14:16.240 --> 14:22.000
the overseer like the top of a mayday pole as they weave in and out of each other. Now,

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
you've got the inner circle going one way, the outer circle going the other way, and before they

14:26.000 --> 14:31.440
were purely inner and outer, but now they're weaving in and out of each other, passing left,

14:31.440 --> 14:37.760
right, left, right, like a do-si-do, but never quite connecting arms in order to spin around

14:37.760 --> 14:44.320
in a small circle before carrying on with a new partner. And they head toward this foe.

14:45.120 --> 14:51.840
The monster? Yeah, sorry. This gargantuan behemoth. Big baddie.

14:51.840 --> 14:58.400
Dripping with shadow. The big bad evil guy, if you will. As these dancing, singing, chanting

14:58.400 --> 15:07.680
people from all across space and time and this specific campaign move toward this enormous

15:07.680 --> 15:15.680
creature, it had just swiped down and grabbed consumed Silas Cole with one of its hands,

15:15.680 --> 15:27.120
and the other arm swings across and takes out about half of this mass of people as it swipes

15:27.120 --> 15:33.280
through backhanded like the second swing in a petty more slap. An uncle slap. Ouchie ouchie,

15:33.280 --> 15:50.000
they all say. I felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried

15:50.000 --> 15:59.760
out ouchie ouchie and then were silenced. And with that half of the luminous land liturgy,

15:59.760 --> 16:08.960
this group of two intertwining circles chanting has just been consumed by the arm of the Gigantum

16:08.960 --> 16:21.360
Repithecus in one swing. So let's play a game. This game could be fun. This game could also

16:22.000 --> 16:28.400
be not super fun, depending. Are you going to force us to gamble the lives of the contention

16:28.400 --> 16:43.600
for townsfolk? You're evil. This is sadistic. You're an evil, evil man. The dice tell the

16:43.600 --> 16:50.720
story. The dice tell the story. And since I can't trust any of you, I'm going to need your cameras,

16:50.720 --> 16:56.800
like Thomas is doing now, to show me the dice rolls that you will be making. I'm going to

16:56.800 --> 17:07.840
assign each of you a group of NPCs, or former PCs, and you will roll, if you roll under 50,

17:10.880 --> 17:14.240
that NPC survives.

17:19.760 --> 17:25.760
I wasn't looking, what did Joe do? None of anyone's business. He was rolling his dice.

17:27.440 --> 17:35.760
Down by his wiener. Showing us his dice. This is a very serious moment.

17:45.200 --> 17:52.240
If you roll under 50, the NPC that you were rolling for in that moment survives the attack.

17:53.040 --> 18:01.200
If you roll 50 or over, they are consumed. We're going to start with Justin.

18:05.840 --> 18:13.120
Justin, show me this roll. We'll roll individually for most NPCs, but for the first three,

18:13.120 --> 18:18.880
we're going to put them in a chunk. They're all right next to each other. We've got the Old West

18:18.960 --> 18:24.080
folks, not the PCs that you guys played, but we've got the bartender, the piano player,

18:24.080 --> 18:30.480
and a gambler named Thomas. Kill them. They all have friend branded across their foreheads,

18:30.480 --> 18:36.160
and they have a raccoon, a chunky kitty, and a handsome dog. You better not kill them.

18:37.440 --> 18:46.080
Justin, don't kill these people. So roll for their life. Like RuPaul says, roll for your life.

18:46.160 --> 18:51.120
Under 50, survive. Over 50, survive, but a little worse for wear.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.200
Are you sure? That's my vote.

19:00.560 --> 19:05.760
Well, rolled off camera. Well, I don't know where to put it. It's too tiny. There's a two.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.360
Wait. Okay. Show us the important one.

19:10.240 --> 19:17.200
Yeah. 32. So good. You got that roll out of the way. Now roll for Jack Pearlman.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.320
Why did you make me do the good one first? That's right.

19:22.320 --> 19:26.560
There's no way this is going to land on camera, but we can pull that camera a little bit further

19:26.560 --> 19:35.200
away. That way I can watch your fucking hands. I got a 40. Yay. I'll show you.

19:36.160 --> 19:40.080
Right on. And with that, Jack Pearlman,

19:40.080 --> 19:47.520
the bartender, piano player, and gambler named Thomas, all from our old west of contention

19:47.520 --> 19:49.280
have survived. Yay.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.360
Next, we're moving on to Joe. Boo.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.200
Listen as if you didn't know Joe and Justin are feuding this week.

19:59.200 --> 20:05.440
No, Justin knows that I've been rolling really bad lately. So

20:06.080 --> 20:08.880
everybody he throws up is about to get swatted right now.

20:09.680 --> 20:14.320
Well, we're starting off with a pretty, pretty easy one. No one will care if they disappear.

20:14.320 --> 20:21.120
It's Drew Andrews' body. Councilman Terry pages is likely inside.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.000
His corporeal form, but not as like soul or memories.

20:24.640 --> 20:29.280
And the excitable black lab, Tyler. Tyler.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.120
It's an eight. Yay.

20:35.920 --> 20:36.880
Well done. Well done.

20:39.680 --> 20:46.000
All right. Next up, Harry clinker with an old distinguished proud.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.120
Don't kill clinker.

20:54.640 --> 20:59.600
What's it going to be? That boy's dead. It's a 62.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.440
Damn. Oh no.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.480
God damn.

21:06.480 --> 21:14.800
Harry clinker stops chanting at the moment that this behemoth's arm is swiping across toward him.

21:14.800 --> 21:22.160
His eyes get big. He looks down at this old distinguished gray dog,

21:22.240 --> 21:28.640
pulls out a slice of white bread with some cut up hot dogs on it and feeds it to the dog.

21:29.680 --> 21:33.360
Oh yeah. That's right. That's right. Good job. You're done. Good boy.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.640
As they both get fully consumed.

21:37.840 --> 21:41.120
Next up, I'm going to roll for old Everett Pace.

21:41.120 --> 21:41.920
Okay. Oh shit.

21:44.080 --> 21:44.720
Joe Terry.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.440
Everett survives. It's a 45.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.880
I'm so glad to stay around.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.680
Good job, Joe.

21:55.680 --> 21:58.640
Jack Pearlman fires a gun off in celebration.

22:01.600 --> 22:05.280
Luke, your turn. We've got two people for you to roll for.

22:05.280 --> 22:14.240
First is going to be Mildred Mitchell, rainbow earrings, her face completely bruised and swollen

22:14.240 --> 22:20.800
from her last encounter with the contention PD and on her shoulder is an old gray squirrel.

22:23.120 --> 22:23.840
22.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.560
They survive little squirrelly.

22:28.560 --> 22:35.120
And next is Gary Daley with the golden retriever named Bean.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.240
He's putting your own dog in it.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.160
That's so sad.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.080
And it's a seven.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.760
Thank God.

22:47.760 --> 22:48.320
There you go.

22:53.120 --> 22:53.600
Whew.

22:54.960 --> 22:55.520
All right.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.160
Bean lives to see another day.

22:58.160 --> 23:03.440
This is going so, so much better than I expected.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.440
Whew. My heart was racing for Bean.

23:05.440 --> 23:11.920
Thomas, first up, your uncle, Jimmy Sanders with a possum.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.240
Okay.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.840
Yeah. Roll whatever.

23:13.840 --> 23:18.320
Yeah. Thomas was like, this one can go over 50. That's fine.

23:18.320 --> 23:18.560
Yeah.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.280
Rolling in a terracotta pot.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.880
He rolls 53.

23:24.880 --> 23:25.360
Over.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.680
Who's going to make our sandwiches?

23:30.320 --> 23:32.160
The possum was named Common.

23:32.160 --> 23:37.760
He was a NPC from Contention Critter Coalition, one shot.

23:37.760 --> 23:44.480
Okay. But an NPC, not a PC and not a dog or a cat.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.520
Just a possum.

23:45.520 --> 23:50.560
Some people love possums and keep them as pets.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.000
Fun fact today for you.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.520
The John Ball shrieks in white hot rage like, I will avenge you, Jimmy.

23:58.160 --> 24:02.800
Jimmy completely hears and understands that as he's fully fucking insane.

24:02.800 --> 24:10.160
His eyes have been just as dilated as they ever were on any of his many shrooms trips

24:10.960 --> 24:12.480
while he's been in this world.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.200
And he's honestly been having a pretty good time.

24:15.200 --> 24:22.400
So as he's consumed by this endless darkness within the arm of this gigantic creature,

24:23.200 --> 24:27.680
he takes the possum, he takes the possum by the front two legs,

24:27.680 --> 24:32.080
stares into its eyes and says, down to the next one.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.920
That fucking rules. That's how I want to go.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.000
Never go to a second location with a possum.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.920
They're probably just playing dead.

24:44.000 --> 24:44.500
Yeah.

24:45.120 --> 24:50.080
Professor Horace Green holding the decapitated head of preacher Sheriff Dr.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.920
Bobby Custard is up next.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.320
I love this character so much.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.040
Please don't die.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.880
Fuuuuuuuuck.

24:58.880 --> 24:59.680
That's a death.

24:59.680 --> 25:00.320
What is it?

25:00.320 --> 25:01.120
81.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.240
Oh, that's too much.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.920
I don't remember what that character voice was.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.360
So that's personally...

25:09.360 --> 25:11.120
Professor Horace Green?

25:12.320 --> 25:13.600
Oh, I just like this.

25:13.840 --> 25:17.920
I just meant like I'm glad I wouldn't have to be playing him since he's dead.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.400
Oh, okay.

25:18.400 --> 25:18.640
Yeah.

25:18.640 --> 25:19.040
Perfect.

25:19.040 --> 25:19.600
Good timing.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.760
Now, can you play him real quick as he dies?

25:22.640 --> 25:25.760
Now, play him at his most important moment.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.680
Of all the wonders I've stared at in the natural world.

25:31.680 --> 25:36.400
He says as the gigantron propithecus is swinging its arm towards him.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.680
I never thought I'd imagine I'd see anything so beautiful.

25:39.760 --> 25:43.920
And a smile crosses his face as he's subsumed into the creature.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.520
Love it.

25:45.520 --> 25:46.160
Love it.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.560
Now, the last one.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.840
Carrie Page's body.

25:54.000 --> 25:54.480
Oh, no.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.800
Drew Andrews inside with Salem the cat's body.

25:59.920 --> 26:00.720
Oh, God.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.000
Agent Trent Chad.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.160
I hope God loves me enough for this role.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.080
Everyone, if you could bow your heads.

26:08.080 --> 26:08.880
Have you done your apples today?

26:08.880 --> 26:10.640
I'd like to say a quick prayer.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.080
Yes.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.120
Drew lives and so does his corporeal form.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.000
Hell, yes.

26:20.000 --> 26:20.880
Thank God.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.080
We got both Drew's.

26:23.040 --> 26:23.360
Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.680
Guys, this is literally, this is like fucking Thanos snapped and only Hawkeye disappeared.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.800
I don't really understand that reference.

26:34.800 --> 26:45.280
The song decibel level is cut in half as a large portion of these chanting individuals

26:45.280 --> 26:55.600
are soaked up into the arm of this massive monster that then grows and grows its arm first.

26:57.440 --> 27:03.440
About twice the size it was before as the ooze slowly forms out over the rest of its being.

27:04.400 --> 27:15.200
And Rosemary leaps from a top now 15 stories off the ground and lands.

27:15.200 --> 27:19.920
Her body does not touch the ground as the four tentacles from the back of her neck slam

27:19.920 --> 27:22.640
themselves into the luminous land below.

27:23.360 --> 27:28.880
And it kind of holds her up and she makes direct eye contact with the overseer.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.240
Keith, it's your turn.

27:32.320 --> 27:37.040
Am I just like following Don or how about I tell you, I'm just following Don.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.080
And I get into the same room that he's in with the one candle

27:42.080 --> 27:46.720
and I look around and it's just everything is dark except the candle.

27:47.520 --> 27:52.000
And I just stare right at the candle and go over to it and blow it out.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.560
And then I just lay down on the ground and my heart rate kind of slows down and I just take a

27:59.360 --> 28:03.040
ah and lay on the ground.

28:10.800 --> 28:14.400
The traditional action turn of a Delta Green character.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.880
Clark Bishop, it is your turn.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.920
And take a breather, take a little nice nap on the ground.

28:19.920 --> 28:23.280
Yeah, Clark is gonna lay down and

28:23.280 --> 28:31.920
No, Clark wants to he's been this whole time he's been doing his best to kind of keep up with the

28:31.920 --> 28:36.160
steps that somehow everybody already knows this this circular dance he wants he doesn't want to

28:36.160 --> 28:41.120
look stupid so he's trying his best to keep going in that dance he stumbles over some people here

28:41.120 --> 28:46.480
and there but he's wanting to make his way up to get as close to Clark Gold as he can

28:47.680 --> 28:51.200
or the overseer and he wants to kind of shout

28:51.200 --> 28:57.440
hey um I'm here I think I did thanks I thanks thanks for getting us here I think

28:58.240 --> 29:02.000
I don't know what I'm supposed to do now could I do I do you need me to do something

29:02.000 --> 29:09.280
with pure anger in your own eyes he looks down at you haven't you already done enough

29:09.280 --> 29:13.520
I I don't I uh I don't know if that's a rhetorical question or not

29:13.520 --> 29:18.640

29:22.080 --> 29:27.360

29:32.400 --> 29:36.240

29:36.240 --> 29:40.800
a lot of your bidding and pretty cryptically too if you could have just told me not to do that I

29:40.800 --> 29:45.520
would have not done that that seems kind of it's I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't mean to be mean

29:46.160 --> 29:51.520

29:51.520 --> 29:57.920
gives you like a hand motion of like okay start please uh Clark now is kind of side-eyeing him

29:57.920 --> 30:08.960
angrily chock teela overseer he's lost all his gusto he was really feeling like things were

30:08.960 --> 30:19.520

30:24.640 --> 30:33.920

30:52.160 --> 30:58.960
Clark you begin chanting with more gusto than you even had before as he looks down at you and says

30:58.960 --> 31:07.520
a few words under his breath you are unnaturally compelled to worship the overseer oh shit

31:09.760 --> 31:29.920
teela you turn out to be a dick all right so uh it is on deep anymore's turn um I'm in the room

31:29.920 --> 31:38.000
with the phone and I think I he finally stops muttering to himself as he's like shocked into

31:38.000 --> 31:47.280
the present right now it's it's here I John it's here John and he kind of looks around you see

31:47.280 --> 31:54.240
Keith on the floor well but all all around you you you hear though you just hear I'm with you

31:55.280 --> 32:01.120
reverberating in the room around you who the hell's this kid with me and I and I point to

32:01.760 --> 32:08.880
is there any light in this room right now no it's completely dark it doesn't matter and I

32:09.760 --> 32:15.760

32:15.760 --> 32:23.040

32:35.600 --> 32:42.560

33:16.240 --> 33:23.040
phone how does he use the phone with a capital u I guess if I walked up to a supernatural phone

33:23.040 --> 33:32.720
I would just dial like 666 or whatever the spookiest number I could think of and then I

33:32.720 --> 33:39.440

34:56.880 --> 35:04.560
as the tone rings through my face just like completely like just falls and I'm just like

35:04.560 --> 35:13.280
kind of staring into space and I drop the receiver out of my hand this was this was this is why I

35:13.280 --> 35:20.480
can't this is supposed to fix things it's what what happened keith you hear him saying this is

35:20.480 --> 35:23.760
you're the only other person in the room you didn't hear what was on the other end of the line

35:24.320 --> 35:30.480
but he's devastated what's wrong this is just enjoy what's around you are you

35:30.480 --> 35:39.120
are you fucking kidding me what the fuck is wrong with you boy oh nothing at all right now he uh

35:39.120 --> 35:44.240
grabs you by the collar again like he did earlier when he was trying to help you but much more

35:44.240 --> 35:50.480
threatening this time keith is just extremely relaxed and and kind of limp john it's your turn

35:51.040 --> 35:58.720
the small hole that had been like deepening sinking into the ground has expanded it

35:58.720 --> 36:04.160
disappeared in a flash and there's there's a there's a technicolor swirl there now

36:04.720 --> 36:10.640
it's whirlpooling around in light and and sound and if you were near the whole wind

36:11.280 --> 36:17.520
all of a sudden it's so much bigger than the little silver ball and it grows and it grows

36:17.520 --> 36:24.000
and it grows the light kind of disappears from it and all of a sudden you see like the night sky

36:24.640 --> 36:34.320
and from what to you is the ground but what to them is is the air falls upward planet juggernaut

36:35.920 --> 36:41.600
keith beans and clark bishop and a john lee pettymore

36:43.520 --> 36:50.480
holy shit keith and clark are both wearing bomb squad gear like the hurt locker

36:51.040 --> 36:56.560
and you would recognize this as the gear that they had on in the scrap pit

37:00.400 --> 37:09.920
john looks confused but relaxed keith and clark literally still have like the bloodlust coursing

37:09.920 --> 37:17.600
through them from the arena you see clark has these these weird gloves on they're like

37:18.560 --> 37:25.520
magnetic pneumatic hands and he's kind of like punching them and he's ready for a fucking tussle

37:25.520 --> 37:30.640
after he gets over his brief surprise when like gravity flips on them and they fall from the sky

37:30.640 --> 37:40.880
up into your world keith has his nitro gun that he used to freeze 37 members of the of the crowd

37:40.880 --> 37:46.240
on family night at the scrap pit and in his other hand he has this crossbow that appears to shoot

37:46.320 --> 37:57.120
the blades from like circular saws and john looks like he's just come from a couch his shoes are off

37:57.120 --> 38:06.080
he's you see his like sweaty socks he's he's still got this huge look of surprise on his face from

38:06.080 --> 38:12.800
where planet juggernaut clark bishop and keith but not the clark bishop and keith from his timeline

38:12.800 --> 38:18.880
have collected him from the house of clark bishop's parents after after he watched keith

38:18.880 --> 38:25.520
disappear into into a door and clark disappear into his book and he took a moment to just watch

38:25.520 --> 38:32.160
wheel of fortune at clark's house that's this john he doesn't look ready for this world like

38:32.720 --> 38:41.840
like keith and clark do and planet juggernaut but the whole like they shoot up out of it and then

38:41.840 --> 38:47.840
kind of plop down as they as they encounter the gravity of this world and the hole disappears

38:47.840 --> 38:54.960
underneath them it just sucks back up and they land on solid ground in fighting pose like in

38:54.960 --> 39:02.480
an anime or like cartoon fighting style fucking clark and keith are down at the base of this

39:02.480 --> 39:10.880
towering planet juggernaut who also has his hands out with his mickey mouse gloves and he's got them

39:10.880 --> 39:17.200
he's got them ready for a fight as well john falls out of the air and lands flat on his back

39:17.760 --> 39:24.720
and doesn't know what's happening and above above it all you see a tiny silver ball just like

39:24.720 --> 39:33.600
floating and the camera pans around to where we see a 2d scene essentially like a fighting video

39:33.600 --> 39:46.400
game and on the left side of the screen we have gigantam propithecus and rose mxry versus the

39:46.400 --> 39:58.000
overseer and planet juggernaut out of a tiny vacuum in planet juggernaut you see these two

39:58.000 --> 40:02.400
you know like when the urakai get born in lord of the rings when they're pulled out of the muck

40:03.120 --> 40:08.400
out of like those kind of sacks the two announcers from the scrap pit get thrown

40:11.360 --> 40:20.800
and land yes let's take a look at the situation right hand here if it was up to me to decide

40:20.800 --> 40:25.680

40:25.680 --> 40:30.560
