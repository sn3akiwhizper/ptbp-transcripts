WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.580
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

00:03.580 --> 00:06.140
It's your moon howling and scowling

00:06.140 --> 00:10.320
Puparoni with the side of extra cheese wolf the dog

00:10.320 --> 00:14.520
The moistest DJ this side of the solar highway

00:14.520 --> 00:20.140
And I am a-wooing at you live from 694.2 PTBP

00:20.140 --> 00:23.080
The greatest radio station that ever did

00:23.080 --> 00:27.000
Now let's move on to the greatest things y'all ever did

00:27.000 --> 00:28.740
Write me fan mail

00:28.740 --> 00:33.820
This week's Howlin with Wolf is from at black goat underscore M10

00:33.820 --> 00:37.980
Who instagrammed about the show and tagged at pretending pod

00:37.980 --> 00:41.700
What a super cool way to let your friends know you're a freak

00:41.700 --> 00:42.660
He writes

00:42.660 --> 00:44.660
Greetings Mr. Wolf

00:44.660 --> 00:48.140
Pretty new listener and first time howler here

00:48.140 --> 00:49.240
Great show

00:49.240 --> 00:52.780
I've not really been into RPGs before

00:52.780 --> 00:57.420
But I really enjoy the gang's escapades and contention in the city

00:57.420 --> 00:58.940
Keep up the good work

00:58.940 --> 01:01.820
Big shout out to Victor for sending me your way

01:01.820 --> 01:06.180
Appreciative howls from Mattias in Sweden

01:06.180 --> 01:07.500
Mattias

01:07.500 --> 01:11.180
Are you telling me that THE Victor sent you?

01:11.180 --> 01:13.060
What did he tell you?

01:13.060 --> 01:15.340
Who do you work for?

01:15.340 --> 01:16.420
Mattias

01:16.420 --> 01:18.380
You're on thin ice buddy

01:18.380 --> 01:20.500
And you better watch your back

01:20.500 --> 01:22.340
And you tell Victor

01:22.340 --> 01:24.700
Tell him that Wolf says

01:24.700 --> 01:26.260
Hello

01:26.300 --> 01:29.100
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl

01:29.100 --> 01:31.540
Tag at pretending pod on twitter

01:31.540 --> 01:34.940
Tag at pretending pod on instagram like Mattias

01:34.940 --> 01:38.300
Or tag at pretending to be people on facebook

01:38.300 --> 01:42.900
Wolf and his producer haven't spent a single dime on advertising

01:42.900 --> 01:46.460
So y'all all here because of words in mouths

01:46.460 --> 01:47.900
Or words in posts

01:47.900 --> 01:50.260
Or words in comment sections

01:50.260 --> 01:52.980
The point is words are powerful

01:52.980 --> 01:57.060
Please use yours to share this show with your friends

01:57.060 --> 01:58.340
Your co-workers

01:58.340 --> 01:59.900
Your grandparents

01:59.900 --> 02:01.540
And step-cousins

02:01.540 --> 02:04.980
And as a reward for your sharing I'll do two things

02:04.980 --> 02:08.540
One, I might choose you to submit a howling with Wolf

02:08.540 --> 02:14.220
And two, I might and definitely always do put the links in the show notes

02:14.220 --> 02:19.740
And while you're posting on them socials about 694.2 PTBP

02:19.740 --> 02:24.260
Keep them ear holes open and receiving my dulcet tones

02:24.260 --> 02:26.900
It's time for the news

02:26.900 --> 02:30.300
Last time the field team at City Action News

02:30.300 --> 02:34.940
Showed the good people of TikTok a glimpse into the calzone

02:34.940 --> 02:39.500
On their way to a potential story from a woman named Kaylee Silver

02:39.500 --> 02:43.380
What they found was the scene of a gruesome homicide

02:43.380 --> 02:45.860
After watching footage from the Furbo

02:45.860 --> 02:49.180
It's clear that Kaylee Silver walked over to her fridge

02:49.180 --> 02:50.340
Cracked a beer

02:50.340 --> 02:52.540
And her friend Kaylee Gold's head

02:52.540 --> 02:55.340
Unnaturally snapped toward the kitchen

02:55.340 --> 03:00.820
Before this differently dispositioned Kaylee Gold lunged at the apartments resident

03:00.820 --> 03:02.100
Kaylee Silver

03:02.100 --> 03:04.540
The attack took place out of view

03:04.540 --> 03:06.420
Behind the kitchen counter

03:06.420 --> 03:10.740
But it seems Kaylee Silver stabbed her friend repeatedly in the neck

03:10.740 --> 03:12.500
With her broken beer bottle

03:12.500 --> 03:16.140
Until Kaylee Gold's head was all but decapitated

03:16.140 --> 03:18.140
Thankfully for this story

03:18.140 --> 03:20.700
The can crew called the city cops

03:20.700 --> 03:21.980
Made statements

03:21.980 --> 03:26.060
And headed off to cleanse their palates with a drink at the foundry

03:26.060 --> 03:29.220
Taking us there now is a bop that don't stop

03:29.220 --> 03:31.020
Good shit that don't quit

03:31.020 --> 03:33.260
An anthem for the handsome

03:33.260 --> 03:34.940
It's Alter Girl with

03:34.940 --> 03:38.620
My Life is Great and It's All My Fall

03:48.140 --> 04:04.060
My Life is Great and It's All My Fall

04:15.060 --> 04:17.460
Also why would we do a season one name?

04:17.500 --> 04:20.780
Everyone from season one is dead to this podcast, Luke.

04:20.780 --> 04:22.780
We are moving on. This is season two.

04:22.780 --> 04:26.540
Dude, Thomas, ask me anything about season one.

04:26.540 --> 04:27.700
What's season one?

04:27.700 --> 04:31.220
I don't remember.

04:31.220 --> 04:33.940
Welcome back to season two of Pretending to be People.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.780
If you got into this podcast because of season one, thank you.

04:36.780 --> 04:41.020
But honestly, that shit is over and done.

04:41.020 --> 04:48.100
And this is a new era of excellence and groundbreaking podcast roleplay.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.820
Straight up, dude.

04:49.820 --> 04:53.380
Get your two tight britches on, which is a reference to nothing.

04:53.380 --> 04:58.860
If you listen to season one, stop listening right now.

04:58.860 --> 05:00.860
Stop. Yeah, you need to stop.

05:00.860 --> 05:04.660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, keep going.

05:04.660 --> 05:08.620
The britches this, oh, I feel like I'm, am I clipping for you guys?

05:08.620 --> 05:09.140
A little bit.

05:09.140 --> 05:10.500
I feel very loud.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
I'll turn you down.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.700
Turn me down a little bit.

05:12.700 --> 05:13.940
I'll just talk louder.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.980
Oh, the cat's going in the pod box.

05:15.980 --> 05:17.020
Cat in the pod box.

05:17.020 --> 05:25.940
I will say the main difference after listening to the edited version of the first episode of this season.

05:25.940 --> 05:28.940
Yeah, like once it was edited, we were funny and good.

05:28.940 --> 05:33.740
Exactly, but after listening to that, huge differences.

05:33.740 --> 05:37.580
The britches are going to be small this year, this years.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.620
This years?

05:39.620 --> 05:41.100
All right, they were big in that thing.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.940
They were big last time and now they're small.

05:43.940 --> 05:46.260
Hey, Zach, are they coming out of the ******* world right now?

05:46.260 --> 05:46.860
No.

05:46.860 --> 05:48.100
Oh, okay, nevermind.

05:48.100 --> 05:52.420
Which is a reference to nothing.

05:52.420 --> 05:59.420
Zach is currently aggressively kissing our cat.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.300
And the first two times she was like, yeah, sure.

06:01.300 --> 06:06.020
And then the fifth time she was like, I'm not going to sit on this ******* couch with you anymore.

06:06.020 --> 06:07.100
You lost cat privilege.

06:07.100 --> 06:12.660
Okay, so obviously I know the answer to this, but Joe, where exactly did we leave off last time?

06:12.660 --> 06:15.940
Oh, dude, you should have seen the crazy **** that I saw.

06:15.940 --> 06:22.500
A girl killed another girl in an apartment and it was messed up and we were all kind of exasperated by it.

06:22.500 --> 06:28.060
And so Cal, Colorado asked us to go to the foundry to maybe wind down.

06:28.060 --> 06:34.220
Which is not a reference to the old Joplin, Missouri music venue.

06:34.220 --> 06:36.020
It's a reference to what, Zach?

06:36.060 --> 06:38.140
Oh, it's a reference to what, Thomas?

06:38.140 --> 06:40.620
I don't remember exactly, but isn't it a newsman's bar?

06:40.620 --> 06:43.380
I believe it's a bar specifically for newsman's.

06:43.380 --> 06:44.660
That's right.

06:44.660 --> 06:46.620
I remember the whole thing.

06:46.620 --> 06:49.060
I knew the whole time I knew that.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.220
So vroom, vroom?

06:51.220 --> 06:52.100
Vroom, vroom.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.620
Vroom, vroom.

06:54.620 --> 07:00.940
Julius Summers pulls into the parking lot of the foundry.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.700
Yeah, where's the foundry located, Thomas?

07:02.700 --> 07:04.660
What kind of bar is this?

07:04.660 --> 07:09.660
It's got like dive bar aesthetics, but much like Cal, Colorado's house, there are pictures

07:09.660 --> 07:12.500
all over the walls of local news people.

07:12.500 --> 07:18.820
And it's kind of maybe equidistant downtown from the three different local news stations.

07:18.820 --> 07:24.340
And so they all come and relax and unwind there and talk shop afterwards.

07:24.340 --> 07:27.700
Are there any TVs on the walls at all?

07:27.700 --> 07:33.140
Are they showing the news at this place or is it specifically to unwind away from that?

07:33.140 --> 07:34.140
I think they are.

07:34.140 --> 07:37.580
I think they never play sports, just the news.

07:37.580 --> 07:40.140
How many news channels are in the city?

07:40.140 --> 07:41.140
He just said there are three.

07:41.140 --> 07:43.660
Okay, there's three TVs then.

07:43.660 --> 07:48.540
I think the foundry is like in an older building downtown, but just absolutely like always

07:48.540 --> 07:50.700
in the shadow of these skyscrapers.

07:50.700 --> 07:57.220
We're in like the downtown railroad like intersect.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.220
I love it.

07:58.220 --> 08:01.560
It's right where the train rolls by and there's a...

08:01.560 --> 08:03.060
They do train shots.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.580
Yeah, of course they do train shots.

08:05.580 --> 08:12.780
So pretty much every time this foundry is like rumbling with the train that is basically

08:12.780 --> 08:14.980
right outside its back door.

08:14.980 --> 08:20.420
There's just a shitload of like attractive people in good suits like getting fucking

08:20.420 --> 08:23.220
hammered and the trains come by a lot.

08:23.220 --> 08:27.820
That's one of the reasons that they chose this place because it's very hard to overhear

08:27.820 --> 08:30.140
the conversation like anybody else is having.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.140
You have to lean in close.

08:31.140 --> 08:35.420
It's a great place to like protect your sources.

08:35.420 --> 08:41.040
In your mind, is this place filled with producers and talent or is my ilk of the camera man

08:41.040 --> 08:42.540
and crew there?

08:42.540 --> 08:44.540
Everyone comes to the foundry.

08:44.540 --> 08:45.900
We're all friends at the foundry.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.980
Color 10, KY3, any of the other ones?

08:49.980 --> 08:53.540
I don't think we're like referencing specific networks, but it would definitely be like

08:53.540 --> 09:00.460
the local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, like local anchor people all hanging out there except

09:00.460 --> 09:06.420
it's CAN, NNN, Nightly News Now.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.500
ETC is there.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.980
ETC, which is...

09:09.980 --> 09:10.980
Ethical...

09:10.980 --> 09:13.860
This is going to be like PBS and nobody watches it.

09:13.860 --> 09:14.860
Ethical...

09:14.860 --> 09:15.860
Television.

09:15.860 --> 09:16.860
Television channel.

09:16.860 --> 09:17.860
Channel.

09:17.860 --> 09:20.860
Joe, you do one.

09:20.860 --> 09:25.700
Yeah, now that we said them all.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.300
RBQ, you guys have fun.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.020
It's sponsored by Arby's and it's barbeque.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.020
Barbeque.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.420
Yeah, Royal Broadcasting.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.420
Quarterly.

09:34.420 --> 09:38.980
They only air three months.

09:38.980 --> 09:48.100
Anyway, I've speedily pulled into...

09:48.100 --> 09:50.540
I screech into the parking lot of the foundry.

09:50.540 --> 09:53.700
Does Beck say that?

09:53.700 --> 09:55.700
Unless Julius goes...

09:55.700 --> 10:02.740
Yeah, no, Julius pulls in like as any normal person would into a parking spot, but as he's

10:02.740 --> 10:04.540
doing it, he goes...

10:04.540 --> 10:09.780
And then he kind of like looks around at the other two and sees Cal is not laughing.

10:09.780 --> 10:16.200
No, Cal is like holding onto the oh shit handle and is like is clutching at his chest.

10:16.200 --> 10:23.360
Keep in mind throughout these interactions of the sites you just saw at the apartment,

10:23.360 --> 10:25.280
the high rise that you were just at.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.280
Yeah, I bet you we land in silence.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.880
I bet you we pull in a little somber.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.960
I was going to mention, I don't think...

10:32.960 --> 10:34.440
He would not bring his camera in here.

10:34.440 --> 10:38.800
I think that this is a sacred place that he knows not to film and that's a very out of

10:38.800 --> 10:39.800
character for him.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.800
So you guys walk across...

10:40.800 --> 10:44.900
This is like where the witches and the witch hunters meet.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.940
There are as many people outside smoking as there are inside.

10:48.940 --> 10:49.940
Also smoking?

10:49.940 --> 10:57.620
Yes, this is a smoking bar, but it's a nice day.

10:57.620 --> 11:01.860
It's a cool evening from an oppressively hot, hot day.

11:01.860 --> 11:07.060
The humidity kind of dies off into the night and you've got kind of a cool summer evening

11:07.060 --> 11:13.140
as you guys walk across this gravel parking lot and head around back to the entrance of

11:13.140 --> 11:15.900
the foundry on the train track side.

11:15.900 --> 11:19.060
A train is currently finishing up.

11:19.060 --> 11:26.540
It's bustling through this back area and you see a server is haphazardly making their way

11:26.540 --> 11:30.180
through the smokers outside with train shots.

11:30.180 --> 11:33.460
He's yelling, train shots, yeah, who had the train shots?

11:33.460 --> 11:36.300
We got a whole mess of them here.

11:36.300 --> 11:41.020
Cal just like silently takes one off the tray and downs it and puts it back on the tray.

11:41.020 --> 11:46.500
Julius grabs one, takes it, and then puts $2 down on the tray.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.500
Nice.

11:47.500 --> 11:51.900
Which train shots are specifically a special here at the foundry.

11:51.900 --> 12:01.780
It is a single dollar for a shot of whiskey when the train toots its horn as it drives

12:01.780 --> 12:02.780
by.

12:02.780 --> 12:08.460
Oh God, if it's fucking like dollar whiskey, we're talking old crow or worse.

12:08.460 --> 12:09.460
Oh, it's old granddad.

12:09.460 --> 12:10.460
Brown derby select.

12:10.460 --> 12:11.460
It's old granddad.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.460
It's old granddad.

12:12.460 --> 12:13.460
Oh yeah.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.460
Orange bottle.

12:14.460 --> 12:22.180
And you set this down and the server looks at Cal Colorado with a certain appreciation

12:22.180 --> 12:25.260
as he carries on with his job.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.860
I think he knows to just add it to Cal's tab.

12:27.860 --> 12:28.860
Nice.

12:28.860 --> 12:36.680
Julius did put the $2 down on his tray even though he knew that those were not poured

12:36.680 --> 12:38.820
out for Cal and Julius.

12:38.820 --> 12:44.340
Immediately you hear him as he walks over to a group who's calling him over with the

12:44.340 --> 12:45.340
train shots.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.060
He's reassuring them like, yeah, no, I'll be right back.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.220
I'll be right back.

12:49.220 --> 12:55.740
And their understanding after seeing the looks on the pained faces of Cal Colorado, Julius

12:55.740 --> 12:58.880
Summers, and Beck Wilder.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.880
Probably like we recognize.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.780
Are they just like local news crew?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.520
Yeah, it's just another local news crew.

13:03.520 --> 13:10.020
They hold up their shots to you as they all wait on the other two shots to come, which

13:10.020 --> 13:12.200
come quickly and you're all able to.

13:12.200 --> 13:16.720
Beck takes his head off and does an exaggerated bow and puts it back on.

13:16.720 --> 13:21.200
Guys, this is my first time in here.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.200
Very excited.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.600
I've heard a lot about it.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.680
This is the first thing that maybe like brightened Cal's face in a while.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.520
Like he gives a very knowing look to Beck.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.200
Well, we have a first timer here.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.960
I think you know what that means, Becca.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.780
We exchange a look and you see a big smile on Beck looking at you.

13:38.780 --> 13:43.960
Are you thinking like we're going to do like do the full set up like now?

13:43.960 --> 13:49.720
Maggie doesn't let any first timers in without putting them through the printing press.

13:49.720 --> 13:55.500
Oh, Julius, my man, you're going to have fun tonight, dude.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.640
It's going to be good for you.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.720
You're going to want to shake off what we saw earlier.

13:58.720 --> 14:03.560
You're going to forget all about that weird, horrible home brew murder.

14:03.560 --> 14:09.720
I mean, I don't know that I'll forget about that anytime soon, but no, the images will

14:09.720 --> 14:17.360
haunt you for the rest of your life, but we can obliterate them temporarily.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.360
The printing press?

14:19.360 --> 14:20.360
You'll see.

14:20.360 --> 14:25.620
Julius starts walking faster and wants to be the first one in there because he's stoked

14:25.620 --> 14:30.800
to see what the hell the printing press is.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.500
Do you think that you and I have a booth that we haunt?

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
Probably yeah.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
I think that'd be cool.

14:36.500 --> 14:43.180
Julius has done his research asking his uncle all about these guys, so he knows which booth

14:43.180 --> 14:47.780
it is.

14:47.780 --> 14:52.020
So Julius goes and sits down in the booth that you guys usually go sit down.

14:52.020 --> 14:56.220
Do you go sneak in right before Beck gets there?

14:56.220 --> 15:01.140
Leading the way, I'm just going and sitting down and turning around like, look what I

15:01.140 --> 15:02.140
know.

15:02.140 --> 15:03.700
Hey, that's the one we always sit at.

15:03.700 --> 15:04.700
That's weird, dude.

15:04.700 --> 15:05.700
Cool.

15:05.700 --> 15:13.340
Hanging Wes Anderson style directly center frame of the booth is an old picture of Cal

15:13.340 --> 15:21.220
from the night after his first television broadcast as a head news anchor, and it's

15:21.220 --> 15:27.420
beautifully framed in this old oak wooden frame and is sitting gloriously.

15:27.420 --> 15:28.540
He looks like a kid.

15:28.540 --> 15:29.780
The suit's wearing him.

15:29.780 --> 15:33.460
Yeah, Cal sits purposely with his back to that.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.460
In what way?

15:34.460 --> 15:38.900
Is it so that when people look at it, they see your face next to your face?

15:38.900 --> 15:44.700
What they're going to see is a much younger, more handsome man with a huge smile on his

15:44.700 --> 15:50.900
face next to that, aged 30 years and looking absolutely miserable tonight.

15:50.900 --> 15:55.580
It does have that effect that those are contrasted, but he's not trying to do it as a power move

15:55.580 --> 15:56.580
or anything.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.900
He just doesn't want to catch sight of it.

15:57.900 --> 15:58.900
Sure, sure, sure.

15:58.900 --> 16:05.860
As Julius slides into the booth, he's not saying anything, but wiggling with excitement.

16:05.860 --> 16:08.380
He's wanted to do this for so long.

16:08.380 --> 16:12.560
Just be a producer and be part of the news and be able to get into this place.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.140
He is so fucking stoked.

16:14.140 --> 16:20.820
Julius, if you wiggle like that during the printing press, you could lose a finger.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.140
Printing press.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.420
I want to find out what it is.

16:24.420 --> 16:26.420
Your research didn't tell you what it is.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.820
My uncle would not tell me.

16:28.820 --> 16:29.820
That makes sense.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.820
I mean, it's kind of a closely guarded secret around here.

16:31.820 --> 16:36.220
I don't think that anybody goes out there just telling other people about it, you know?

16:36.220 --> 16:39.180
They never do, if they want to live.

16:39.180 --> 16:40.980
Only kidding.

16:40.980 --> 16:44.500
It's a process that happens in three steps.

16:44.500 --> 16:52.100
The first step, you are laid across the bar and your belly is exposed.

16:52.100 --> 16:57.820
Julius pulls his shirt up as he lays on the table and then realizes what was said and

16:57.820 --> 16:59.680
then he goes and sits back down again.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.420
Tell him the second part.

17:02.420 --> 17:06.580
This is kind of like your last moment of choice here, but you get to decide what liquor you

17:06.580 --> 17:07.580
want.

17:07.580 --> 17:11.420
Once you're laying on the bar with your shirt up?

17:11.580 --> 17:14.620
What would be your choice if you said your favorite liquor?

17:14.620 --> 17:15.620
Tequila.

17:15.620 --> 17:21.520
Ooh, that's a bad choice to try on.

17:21.520 --> 17:28.100
The third step is more tequila than you've ever had in your life, with hungry news crews

17:28.100 --> 17:39.180
eagerly licking it off your midriff as Maggie, the hardened barkeep, pours a bottle into

17:39.180 --> 17:40.180
your mouth.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.540
Same, by the way.

17:42.540 --> 17:49.660
So the tequila gets poured into my mouth and your belly button.

17:49.660 --> 18:00.500
And they let the older interns just absolutely go at you.

18:00.500 --> 18:05.800
So at this point, you're probably asking what's in it for you.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.300
The deep respect that comes.

18:07.300 --> 18:15.060
I spent a lot of my time in college practicing for this day.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.860
Oh, you've had a lot of people lick you.

18:17.860 --> 18:19.260
I wish.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.540
Oh, has anyone licked you?

18:22.540 --> 18:27.780
Julius gets up from the booth and walks over to the bar with his, while he's like untucking

18:27.780 --> 18:35.060
his shirt from his pants, his all tan suit.

18:35.060 --> 18:39.340
Oh, I thought you were going to describe your body and I was like, he strikes me as

18:39.340 --> 18:41.340
a very pale man.

18:41.340 --> 18:42.340
He's pretty pale.

18:42.340 --> 18:43.340
Yeah.

18:43.340 --> 18:53.460
You see a trunk of a woman in a denim vest with long, a long braid down the back of her

18:53.460 --> 18:54.460
hair.

18:54.460 --> 19:03.980
She clinks a bell above her head and she's like, hot off the press.

19:03.980 --> 19:09.540
Oh, that's right.

19:09.540 --> 19:14.780
We got a newbie over at city action news.

19:14.780 --> 19:23.620
Come on down everyone for Julius Summers.

19:23.620 --> 19:29.060
He's in for the printing press, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, and the entire crowd

19:29.060 --> 19:33.620
in circles, like all the smokers come inside when they hear the bell and immediately jackets

19:33.620 --> 19:34.620
come off.

19:34.620 --> 19:37.860
Ties are loosened, top buttons are undone.

19:37.860 --> 19:43.020
And like these very dorky, like you see the interns start circling and they all look like

19:43.020 --> 19:44.700
Jonah from Veep.

19:44.700 --> 19:54.260
Julius is laying on the bar with his like shirt kind of pulled up, exposing his stomach.

19:54.260 --> 20:08.700
And then one of the Jonah interns just rips all of his like upper clothing off.

20:08.700 --> 20:17.900
And the chants fade away, much like Julius's memories from the entire night.

20:17.900 --> 20:24.700
Beck and Cow, however, don't get printing pressed by a bunch of rabbit interns and therefore

20:24.700 --> 20:28.660
are able to keep their wits in their brain helmets for the evening.

20:28.660 --> 20:29.660
Let's go check that out.

20:29.660 --> 20:34.900
And Oh, Hey, thanks so much for listening to pretending to be people probably means

20:34.900 --> 20:37.340
you're fucking cool.

20:37.340 --> 20:46.660
We've got a very special guest on today's episode of pretending to be people.

20:46.660 --> 20:51.860
I had an idea in my head when we were discussing the recording of season two, Joe and I had

20:51.860 --> 20:57.420
talked about who his character would interact with the most.

20:57.420 --> 21:02.420
And your answer to that was a mother.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.420
The answer was mother.

21:03.420 --> 21:04.420
Yes.

21:04.420 --> 21:08.060
I think you specifically told me I can't have dead parents this time.

21:08.060 --> 21:15.100
Well, not yet, not yet, exactly.

21:15.100 --> 21:21.380
And when you said mom immediately, I thought, well, let's get our podcast, uh, dad to come

21:21.380 --> 21:24.820
on and play Beck Wilder's mom.

21:24.820 --> 21:28.820
It's Scott Norwood is back!

21:28.820 --> 21:30.940
Thank you very much for having me back on.

21:30.940 --> 21:35.300
And like, this isn't the first time I've been called a mother, but at least the circumstances

21:35.300 --> 21:37.300
are different.

21:37.300 --> 21:43.020
Well, we really appreciate you coming on for those of you who are just hearing Scott on

21:43.020 --> 21:47.140
pretending to be people for the first time for some fucking reason.

21:47.140 --> 21:52.360
Scott is my parasocial RPG mentor.

21:52.360 --> 21:59.900
He didn't know that he was my mentor, but listening to his podcast that he does with

21:59.900 --> 22:06.660
Matt Sanderson and Paul Fricker, good friends of Jackson Elias truly developed me into the

22:06.660 --> 22:09.380
GM that I am today.

22:09.380 --> 22:14.220
And I am super appreciative of all the lessons I've learned listening to their podcast over

22:14.220 --> 22:15.220
the years.

22:15.220 --> 22:16.220
Oh, blimey.

22:16.220 --> 22:22.740
I thought I'm still amazed that anyone even listens to it.

22:22.740 --> 22:26.380
Scott before I was ever aware of who you were, I knew that Zach listened to your podcast

22:26.380 --> 22:30.780
and you answered some questions for him one time and he was so excited and told us all

22:30.780 --> 22:31.780
about it.

22:31.780 --> 22:35.780
And that was way before there was ever a glimmer of hope of meeting you, let alone playing

22:35.820 --> 22:36.820
No, yeah.

22:36.820 --> 22:41.280
We weren't even talking about recording a podcast, but I was running Helen Texas, which

22:41.280 --> 22:46.920
is a scenario that you wrote for the book, The Things We Leave Behind by Stygian Fox

22:46.920 --> 22:48.340
Publishing.

22:48.340 --> 22:55.100
And that's a great book and your scenario in it is so terrifying and awesome.

22:55.100 --> 22:59.880
So I posted some questions on the subreddit and you yourself came in and answered them

22:59.880 --> 23:07.720
and I lost my fucking shit, Scott.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.600
I waste half my life on Reddit.

23:11.600 --> 23:16.080
It is my main time sink and I am not proud of that.

23:16.080 --> 23:21.540
Well that time sink made this nerd super happy and validated many, many years ago.

23:21.540 --> 23:22.640
So thank you for that.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.720
Some might say this podcast wouldn't exist without you, Scott.

23:25.720 --> 23:29.640
You gave him the hope, the drive.

23:29.640 --> 23:33.000
It's all my fault now, is it?

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
We have to pin it on somebody.

23:36.000 --> 23:52.560
I would like to take us to the home of Beck and Kim Wilder as Ramona scoots her cat.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.600
Zach has a cat food bowl that is one of those ones that's like a maze.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.600
Yeah, it keeps Ramona nice and...

23:58.640 --> 24:00.120
But it kind of becomes a game.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.880
Smart, yeah.

24:02.880 --> 24:08.040
Yeah, she grabs each piece individually and then eats it out of her own paw, which is

24:08.040 --> 24:10.440
rad.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.400
But noisy, I imagine.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.320
Quite noisy.

24:13.320 --> 24:18.320
I'm going to move it into the back room.

24:18.320 --> 24:22.680
I barely get through a recording session without one of my cats running into the room and

24:22.680 --> 24:28.160
screaming like a seagull or jumping all over things and knocking shit over.

24:29.160 --> 24:33.320
My cats are named Chaos and Anarchy, and it's with good reason.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.400
That's great.

24:36.400 --> 24:41.560
Beck Wilder has had a brutal day.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.560
Started off fine.

24:42.560 --> 24:51.440
Woke up around 2 p.m. in your tighty-whities, in your messy bedroom, headed off, shot a

24:51.440 --> 24:53.680
segment out on a farm.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.680
He had a rough evening.

24:54.680 --> 24:55.680
Was it evening?

24:56.200 --> 24:59.160
Yeah, it was a rough evening.

24:59.160 --> 25:03.680
You were called out for a potential story that was...

25:03.680 --> 25:06.400
We weren't even 100% sure what we were going out there for.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.560
And what did you find?

25:07.560 --> 25:10.320
Oh, man, it wasn't good.

25:10.320 --> 25:17.280
It was a terrible, terrible crime scene, including a partially severed head.

25:17.280 --> 25:20.840
That wasn't what Beck was thinking was going to happen that day.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.560
Yeah, I mean, a severed head is bad enough.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.840
A partially severed head sounds worse.

25:26.840 --> 25:32.720
Yeah, it's a lot worse.

25:32.720 --> 25:33.720
Just holding on.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.640
Just a little hinge.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.200
Beck isn't in the greatest headspace.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.800
He's now just gotten back from the foundry, where he had a nice night trying to drink

25:42.800 --> 25:43.800
his troubles away.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.840
Are you feeling a little loose?

25:45.840 --> 25:47.760
You feeling a little warm in the face?

25:47.760 --> 25:50.320
Beck always feels loose.

25:50.320 --> 25:54.960
He's maybe a little bit looser than normal, but he kind of lives in an equilibrium of

25:54.960 --> 25:55.960
inebriation.

25:55.960 --> 26:00.360
A loose state, I like that.

26:00.360 --> 26:04.640
So as you arrive home, it's late at night.

26:04.640 --> 26:11.320
It's 1130 PM, maybe even midnight, which is about as late in the night as you can get.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.640
Before it starts becoming morning.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.640
That's right.

26:16.760 --> 26:20.920
Kim Wilder has the home to herself.

26:20.920 --> 26:30.240
Her son is a mid-thirties field cameraman for City Action News, and he is still living

26:30.240 --> 26:33.160
in your house, Kim.

26:33.160 --> 26:37.320
For now.

26:37.320 --> 26:41.200
What is Kim Wilder up to on a random Saturday evening?

26:41.200 --> 26:48.320
I think she's sitting there on the sofa, knitting and watching television.

26:48.320 --> 26:54.880
The sound is way down on the TV, and there's just the clack, clack, clack of knitting needles.

26:54.880 --> 27:00.960
And somehow she is managing to make knitting look angry.

27:00.960 --> 27:06.480
Out of the corner of her eyes, she just keeps darting her eyes over and stabbing them into

27:06.480 --> 27:13.000
the corner where Beck keeps his camera equipment, which is not there at the time, but there's

27:13.000 --> 27:21.040
like a whole corner of this room that is specifically set up to house Beck's livelihood.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.200
Oh yeah.

27:22.200 --> 27:26.160
You can tell exactly where it is just by all the scuff marks and the skirting board and

27:26.160 --> 27:30.000
the floor tiles.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.120
And the last you saw Beck, it was maybe even yesterday because today you knew that he was

27:36.120 --> 27:37.120
in his bedroom.

27:37.120 --> 27:42.880
You knew that he had been sleeping in, but you went to knock on his door for tea or snack

27:42.880 --> 27:44.960
or he wasn't even in there.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.400
He just left the house without saying anything.

27:47.400 --> 27:53.440
And as those thoughts are flowing through your brain, the front door swings open.

27:53.440 --> 27:56.440
Hey, Ma, you're up.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.880
Oh, this is awkward.

27:58.880 --> 28:04.880
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

28:04.880 --> 28:11.720
I thought that was a burglar coming in, but no, it's just my son staying out all hours

28:11.720 --> 28:13.040
again.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.800
And where have you been tonight, young man?

28:15.800 --> 28:17.280
Get some drinks with the boys.

28:17.280 --> 28:23.160
You know, it's, uh, uh, I had a, I had a bad night, Mom.

28:23.160 --> 28:31.000
Yes I could, I can smell just how bad your night was from here, yes.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
You're not going to bed until you put something in your stomach to soak up some of that beer.

28:36.000 --> 28:42.200
There's still some hot dog casserole in the oven, it's probably, oh, it's probably burnt

28:42.200 --> 28:46.200
to a crisp by now, but well, give it a try.

28:46.200 --> 28:50.720
I cut up the wieners nice and small, just the way you like it, just the way I like it.

28:50.720 --> 28:55.520
Cut up more hot dogs.

28:55.520 --> 28:59.760
Beck starts walking toward the fridge and you can tell now that he's a little drunker

28:59.760 --> 29:01.320
even than you've ever seen him.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.600
He's a stumble-ier than you've ever seen him.

29:03.600 --> 29:10.680
And he kind of catches himself, woo, a little woozy, sorry, sorry about that, Ma.

29:10.680 --> 29:16.800
It uh, I know we don't like to talk about like what I do, but like, I saw some shit

29:16.800 --> 29:18.680
tonight Mom, it was bad.

29:18.680 --> 29:22.280
And what exactly did you see?

29:22.280 --> 29:26.920
Oh, it's kind of like a thing that's like under investigation now.

29:26.920 --> 29:31.320
I don't know if like, I might need a lawyer to talk to you about it.

29:31.320 --> 29:37.000
Honestly, I really don't understand why you can't have a proper job.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.320
You're out all hours.

29:38.320 --> 29:42.840
I never know whether I'm going to find you sleeping in your room in the middle of the

29:42.840 --> 29:47.080
afternoon or whether you're going to stay out until three o'clock in the morning.

29:47.080 --> 29:50.760
Clearly what you're doing isn't making you enough money for you to actually move into

29:50.760 --> 29:52.440
your own place.

29:52.440 --> 29:58.200
And now you're saying that it's dangerous as well, and it's going to get you into trouble.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.560
Why do you do this?

29:59.560 --> 30:01.780
Why can't you just get a proper job?

30:01.780 --> 30:08.280
You know, Macy Grindel's son, Deke, he's got, he's got a nice thriving business for himself

30:08.280 --> 30:14.020
selling secondhand sofa beds and he's moved into a new apartment downtown.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.280
It's all his own.

30:15.280 --> 30:20.100
Well, I think he's got a couple of flatmates, but he's not living with his mother anymore.

30:20.100 --> 30:21.100
That's the important thing.

30:21.180 --> 30:23.580
Yeah, but Deke's a fucking asshole.

30:23.580 --> 30:27.260
Oh, not this again.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.020
Jesus Christ.

30:29.020 --> 30:31.420
He's a financially solvent asshole.

30:34.060 --> 30:37.660
Sorry, uh, the, uh, the internet connection cut out a little bit right there.

30:37.660 --> 30:47.660
He's a financially solvent asshole.

30:47.660 --> 30:48.300
Brilliant.

30:51.260 --> 30:55.580
As Kim started to go into that diatribe, Beck had his back to her and he was kind of mouthing

30:55.580 --> 30:56.700
along with these words.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.140
He's heard it so many times.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.180
Oh, she's got to mention Deke again.

31:03.180 --> 31:04.380
She's got to mention Deke.

31:04.380 --> 31:05.500
Oh, there we go.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.420
Playing the greatest hits.

31:09.340 --> 31:12.380
If you love Deke so much, why didn't you give birth to him?

31:15.260 --> 31:17.980
Don't think that I haven't thought about that every day.

31:18.060 --> 31:19.100
Ew, gross mom.

31:19.100 --> 31:21.180
You think about fucking Deke's dad?

31:23.420 --> 31:25.900
A wistful look crosses Kim's eyes.

31:31.820 --> 31:36.380
For like half a second, I thought we were going to get something like really meaningful

31:36.380 --> 31:39.500
when Kim was like, why do you even do this job?

31:40.780 --> 31:43.500
And then Beck's like, go fuck my friend's dad.

31:48.620 --> 31:54.220
At this point, Beck has lost the gusto for the hot dog casserole and it's just kind of

31:54.220 --> 31:58.540
like slopping it onto a plate and throwing it in the microwave and is trying his best

31:58.540 --> 32:00.300
to like avoid eye contact with you.

32:01.340 --> 32:05.980
Look, Ma, I know that it's like not like the best paying thing in the world, but it's like

32:05.980 --> 32:07.420
what I want to do.

32:07.420 --> 32:12.860
Like, I don't know if you can understand like happiness from that perspective, but that's

32:12.860 --> 32:14.620
what I've got for me right now.

32:14.620 --> 32:21.740
Look, you've got to understand that part of being a grown up is that we all have to do

32:21.740 --> 32:28.860
things that we don't want to do, because that's just how we get through life.

32:29.580 --> 32:36.380
And yes, all right, you can run around doing your camera stuff and whatever it is you do

32:36.380 --> 32:37.820
at three o'clock in the morning.

32:37.820 --> 32:44.700
And I try not to judge you, but sooner or later, you've got to grow up.

32:44.700 --> 32:50.300
You can't just carry on like this and pretend that everything's all right.

32:51.420 --> 32:55.660
You've got to you've got to grow up someday, boy.

32:56.540 --> 33:01.820
Beck is now kind of a little more solemn and a little more introspective visually.

33:02.540 --> 33:06.220
And he pulls the food out of the microwave and he's holding the plate and he's kind of

33:06.220 --> 33:07.340
picking at it with a fork.

33:07.980 --> 33:10.300
Yeah, I mean, fine.

33:11.340 --> 33:13.900
We disagree on like fundamental things, Ma.

33:13.900 --> 33:22.140
I just maybe someday you'll see that I can do this and also like be successful, whatever

33:22.140 --> 33:23.100
that means to you.

33:24.300 --> 33:25.580
I'm going to my room.

33:25.580 --> 33:26.140
All right.

33:26.140 --> 33:28.380
You'll have to pick up the clean sheets.

33:28.380 --> 33:31.580
I've left them out for you, but you'll have to make the bed yourself.

33:31.580 --> 33:37.740
And I tried to get the stains out, but we're going to have to try a new brand.

33:43.020 --> 33:43.260
Yeah.

33:43.260 --> 33:43.660
Okay.

33:43.660 --> 33:44.380
Thanks.

33:44.380 --> 33:45.180
Thanks, Mommy.

33:45.980 --> 33:46.940
You got any milk?

33:53.740 --> 33:58.780
Scott, we didn't bring you on here to roleplay anything other than what's about to happen.

34:01.580 --> 34:07.980
Oh, Scott, thank you so much.

34:07.980 --> 34:09.580
I think that's the end of the night.

34:09.580 --> 34:10.300
That was perfect.

34:15.100 --> 34:17.820
Oh, Scott, as always, an absolute pleasure.

34:19.260 --> 34:20.060
Oh, thank you.

34:21.020 --> 34:25.100
Zach, we live in a weird privileged world that we just had Scott Dorward on to play

34:25.100 --> 34:25.820
my mom.

34:25.820 --> 34:26.940
And I said, thanks, Mommy.

34:26.940 --> 34:27.580
Got any milk?

34:27.580 --> 34:34.060
And then we said, have a good day.

34:34.060 --> 34:35.420
That is going to haunt me.

34:40.220 --> 34:41.260
Scott, thank you so much.

34:41.260 --> 34:42.940
Seriously, thank you so much.

34:42.940 --> 34:49.820
And for those of you who enjoyed Scott just now, you can hear him.

34:49.820 --> 34:55.420
He runs two different full scenarios for us on pretending to be people in our bonus episodes

34:56.140 --> 34:58.140
here on the main feed.

34:58.700 --> 35:04.940
Scott, you ran Bleak Prospect, a Call of Cthulhu scenario that you wrote so fucking creepy.

35:04.940 --> 35:07.100
It's one of my favorite things that we've done on the show.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.060
It's so fun.

35:08.060 --> 35:11.900
Starts in a Hoover town and goes to worse places.

35:11.900 --> 35:12.400
Yeah.

35:13.980 --> 35:19.980
And you also recently ran a Pulp Cthulhu scenario, both of which, by the way, that Scott wrote.

35:19.980 --> 35:22.380
This one was A New Age of Wonders.

35:22.380 --> 35:28.780
And that was, for me personally, I think one of my absolute favorite player experiences

35:28.780 --> 35:30.380
I've ever had in an RPG.

35:30.380 --> 35:30.940
Oh, man.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.780
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

35:32.780 --> 35:34.540
I had an absolute blast running it.

35:34.540 --> 35:35.100
You did, too.

35:35.980 --> 35:36.940
That's so fun.

35:39.180 --> 35:39.500
All right.

35:39.500 --> 35:45.180
Well, I'm going to stop gushing and we'll see you soon, Scott.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.060
Oh, marvelous.

35:46.060 --> 35:46.780
Look forward to it.

35:46.780 --> 35:47.420
Good night, Mommy.

35:49.900 --> 35:51.260
Got to go and have a bath now.

35:52.380 --> 36:05.500
You're just now joining us.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.660
Welcome back to Pretending to Be People.

36:07.660 --> 36:11.100
We are here with a special guest right now.

36:11.100 --> 36:19.420
It is the GM of the Lost Mountain Saga, one of the best players from Glass Canada Network's

36:19.420 --> 36:20.780
Androids and Aliens.

36:20.780 --> 36:25.660
It is Eleanor de Lorenzo.

36:27.180 --> 36:28.620
Let's get one that the people can hear.

36:31.580 --> 36:36.300
It's fun to talk like this, but I don't know if anybody can understand Eleanor de Lorenzo.

36:38.140 --> 36:39.180
Hey, Ellie.

36:39.180 --> 36:39.680
Hello.

36:40.220 --> 36:41.500
I understood.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.020
There were compliments in that.

36:43.020 --> 36:43.820
I understood that.

36:44.860 --> 36:46.860
I sucked that up right up.

36:46.860 --> 36:48.300
I picked those out right away.

36:49.020 --> 36:50.700
Thank you so much for coming back on.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.700
Thank you so much for coming and joining us again.

36:53.820 --> 36:56.140
I'm so excited to be back.

36:56.140 --> 36:57.260
Thank you for inviting me.

36:57.260 --> 37:02.060
If you're listening to this and you haven't heard Ellie on Pretending to Be People before,

37:02.060 --> 37:06.380
Ellie was a guest and a player when I ran a homebrew scenario that I wrote,

37:06.380 --> 37:10.380
Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt for her and some other guest players.

37:10.380 --> 37:12.940
And we had an absolutely phenomenal time.

37:13.660 --> 37:18.140
You were such a wonderful player that I was so excited to bring you back on.

37:18.780 --> 37:22.940
Another huge reason that I was so excited to bring you on is when I told Thomas, I was like,

37:22.940 --> 37:27.740
Hey, dude, Ellie from A&A is coming on Pretending to Be People.

37:27.740 --> 37:28.060
Yeah.

37:28.060 --> 37:31.420
And then you had her play with a bunch of people who weren't fans of that show,

37:33.740 --> 37:35.820
which as a fan was like, well, that's a bummer.

37:37.500 --> 37:42.620
Couldn't have anyone except me getting too starstruck on her first appearance on Pretending

37:42.620 --> 37:43.260
to Be People.

37:43.260 --> 37:43.740
Fair enough.

37:43.820 --> 37:48.460
You wanted to protect her from what's about to happen.

37:48.460 --> 37:48.960
Yes.

37:49.660 --> 37:53.580
Slobbering idiots of the PTBP pod.

37:53.580 --> 37:55.260
I love slobbering idiots, though.

37:55.260 --> 37:57.260
That's what I'm more comfortable with.

37:57.260 --> 37:57.980
Do you know what I'm saying?

37:58.540 --> 38:02.140
Now I played with very talented, wonderful women and they were all great.

38:02.140 --> 38:04.460
But that sounds deeply intimidating.

38:06.540 --> 38:07.660
They were hot.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.460
They stared at me with their hot eyes.

38:10.460 --> 38:13.500
And one of them was apparently married to you, Zach.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.300
That is correct.

38:14.300 --> 38:14.700
Yeah.

38:14.700 --> 38:15.260
Apparently.

38:16.780 --> 38:17.420
Apparently.

38:18.060 --> 38:18.300
Yeah.

38:18.300 --> 38:20.140
Allegedly married.

38:20.140 --> 38:22.220
Taylor and her hot eyes are married to Zach.

38:23.420 --> 38:24.940
I'm an allegedly lucky man.

38:28.940 --> 38:29.440
Okay.

38:29.980 --> 38:33.340
I'm not going to correct that just because I'm waiting for all the chinks in your marriage's

38:33.340 --> 38:36.940
armor to collapse at once.

38:36.940 --> 38:37.660
Coming in hot.

38:37.660 --> 38:38.300
Coming in hot.

38:38.860 --> 38:39.500
Love it.

38:39.500 --> 38:40.860
I'll have to beat Luke off, but.

38:41.820 --> 38:42.220
Wow.

38:42.220 --> 38:42.940
I'd watch that.

38:43.500 --> 38:46.700
Well, so Thomas, are you married?

38:46.700 --> 38:47.660
Uh, no.

38:47.660 --> 38:48.460
No, I'm not married.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.740
You said that very quickly.

38:49.740 --> 38:52.460
No, it was like, it was like a gut reaction.

38:52.460 --> 38:52.700
No.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.220
Well, I remembered that I wasn't.

38:55.180 --> 38:55.420
Right.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.140
Well, you looked back at your whole life.

38:59.820 --> 39:03.420
Did I leave a wife somewhere along the road?

39:03.420 --> 39:06.300
It's like when people ask you if you're like, do you have any kids?

39:06.300 --> 39:08.140
And you're like, not that I'm aware of.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.260
It's like, do you have a wife?

39:09.260 --> 39:11.900
Not that I'm aware of.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.540
I'm known for not knowing much about America.

39:14.540 --> 39:21.500
And I just realized that I know you guys are from a state, but I don't remember which state

39:21.500 --> 39:23.020
right this second.

39:23.020 --> 39:25.180
Is it Missouri?

39:25.180 --> 39:25.820
It is.

39:25.820 --> 39:27.820
Oh, wow.

39:27.820 --> 39:31.420
I was going to make a joke about you have a one in 50 shots, so just go for it.

39:31.420 --> 39:33.020
You fucking nailed it.

39:33.020 --> 39:33.740
I did.

39:33.740 --> 39:34.780
Got it in one.

39:34.780 --> 39:38.860
It is indeed Missouri, which we like, but a lot of people don't.

39:38.860 --> 39:39.660
Oh yeah.

39:39.660 --> 39:40.380
We love it.

39:40.380 --> 39:41.340
It's nice here.

39:41.340 --> 39:42.220
It's really hot right now.

39:42.220 --> 39:43.260
Actually, it sucks here.

39:44.940 --> 39:49.100
Oh, but still, I would love to go, but like, is it nice because it's like, you know, you

39:49.100 --> 39:53.020
can be on a horse ranch and I'm sorry.

39:53.020 --> 39:53.580
You can be.

39:53.580 --> 39:55.100
Yeah, you can be on a horse ranch.

39:56.140 --> 39:56.700
Okay.

39:56.700 --> 40:02.860
Well, I mean, I don't make very much money and this is my house that we're recording

40:02.860 --> 40:02.940
in.

40:02.940 --> 40:08.860
Oh, screw you and making fun of my bullshit New York studio cabin.

40:11.740 --> 40:12.620
But that's true.

40:12.620 --> 40:14.860
That's a really cool thing about Missouri.

40:14.860 --> 40:16.620
You have an actual kitchen.

40:16.620 --> 40:17.120
I love that.

40:18.060 --> 40:20.300
I want a Missouri kitchen.

40:20.300 --> 40:24.460
Let's get into Cal, Colorado.

40:25.020 --> 40:26.940
Cal, you've had a very interesting night.

40:26.940 --> 40:32.380
I want to dive back into some of the things that you've seen here on this random night.

40:32.380 --> 40:34.060
You were, oh, yeah.

40:34.060 --> 40:38.780
That makes sense because one of these memories that keeps just blasting into your head as

40:38.780 --> 40:47.500
you're leaving the foundry is just this headless, almost headless neck held on by a couple of

40:47.500 --> 40:53.580
tendons and skin on one side.

40:53.580 --> 40:59.180
Your mind drifts immediately from this severed neck off to your daughter.

40:59.180 --> 40:59.740
A little bit.

40:59.740 --> 41:04.780
Mostly my mind is just shouting neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as I see like this horrifying

41:04.780 --> 41:08.540
like red flash and this image of this nearly headless neck.

41:08.780 --> 41:11.580
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you get into your car.

41:12.300 --> 41:16.700
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you drive really far back to your home.

41:17.580 --> 41:21.180
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole, neck hole everywhere.

41:22.060 --> 41:26.380
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you sit into your chair.

41:26.380 --> 41:29.660
And he turns on a 24 hour news channel like he always does.

41:29.660 --> 41:30.160
Natch.

41:30.940 --> 41:31.980
Drown it out, baby.

41:31.980 --> 41:35.500
Honestly, the cleaning person must have turned it off because he kind of likes to just keep

41:35.500 --> 41:36.460
it on all day.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.620
But yeah, he turns that on.

41:38.620 --> 41:41.740
He goes over to his pretty dusty home bar.

41:42.540 --> 41:49.500
He grabs a glass and takes a bottle of cheap white wine out of the refrigerator and pours

41:49.500 --> 41:53.020
it to the brim and then downs that and pours another.

41:53.020 --> 41:58.700
And at that moment, you feel a vibration coming from your pocket and it's not the vibration

41:58.700 --> 41:59.820
of a text or a call.

42:00.700 --> 42:02.540
Do you not have a phone that vibrates?

42:02.540 --> 42:05.500
No, he does, but we don't do vibrates here.

42:05.500 --> 42:08.460
We have a ring on this podcast.

42:08.460 --> 42:09.020
That's right.

42:09.020 --> 42:11.260
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

42:11.260 --> 42:13.660
Yeah, he hears the ringtone set to his daughter, Carol.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.660
Eleanor de Lorenzo.

42:17.660 --> 42:22.060
What is Carol's face look like on the screen of Cal's phone here?

42:22.060 --> 42:25.100
It's a young woman, young 20s.

42:25.100 --> 42:29.260
She currently looks a little flushed as if she might have been, I don't know, working

42:29.260 --> 42:30.300
out or something.

42:30.300 --> 42:35.100
But since Saturday night, you might assume that she might be a little tipsy and she's

42:35.100 --> 42:39.660
sitting down on a couch that you recognize to be her student room.

42:39.660 --> 42:39.900
Hey.

42:42.940 --> 42:46.540
Oh, Carol, it's lovely to hear from you.

42:46.540 --> 42:47.020
I'm sorry.

42:47.020 --> 42:51.180
I've had kind of an extraordinary evening.

42:53.020 --> 42:53.820
Honey, how are you?

42:53.820 --> 42:57.180
Dad, can you tilt your phone up a little bit?

42:57.180 --> 43:00.220
I can't see you like you're filming your forehead again.

43:00.220 --> 43:01.980
He tilts it down and you can just see his chin.

43:01.980 --> 43:04.940
Is this better?

43:04.940 --> 43:05.820
No, please.

43:06.940 --> 43:10.620
You remember, like, you can put it a little bit further away from your face.

43:10.620 --> 43:11.660
Then that works better.

43:11.660 --> 43:14.940
You just see one giant eye as he's looking into the camera lens.

43:14.940 --> 43:15.980
It's all right.

43:15.980 --> 43:19.020
And she puts down the phone and it's just voiceover.

43:23.500 --> 43:28.540
Honey, I'd love to see your darling face, especially with you so far away from home.

43:29.100 --> 43:30.700
Please explain FaceTime to me.

43:31.980 --> 43:36.540
Oh, Dad, have you been drinking?

43:37.180 --> 43:39.340
Not just a little wine.

43:39.340 --> 43:40.780
It's a Saturday night.

43:40.780 --> 43:42.620
I'm a single man.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.420
Can I not enjoy a sifter of wine?

43:45.420 --> 43:46.220
No, of course.

43:46.220 --> 43:48.540
Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you a little bit about.

43:48.540 --> 43:52.540
I wondered if you have you been doing anything fun lately?

43:52.540 --> 43:53.580
Like, except working.

43:54.780 --> 43:56.380
Work is fun, sweetie.

43:56.380 --> 43:58.140
Your mother and I always tried to tell you that.

43:58.140 --> 43:59.100
No, I know.

43:59.100 --> 43:59.500
I know.

44:00.060 --> 44:01.980
I just, I don't know.

44:01.980 --> 44:02.700
I worry about you.

44:02.700 --> 44:07.020
That's why I just wish you, you know, would get out there a little bit.

44:07.580 --> 44:10.700
Cal thinks about where he just got out to and pauses.

44:11.500 --> 44:15.180
And he kind of gulps and he's like, I get out, sweetie.

44:15.180 --> 44:19.260
Just today, I saw some corn wrestling while I was out on assignment.

44:19.260 --> 44:22.460
They also had crabs, not the men, the farm.

44:23.420 --> 44:24.780
They raised corn and crabs.

44:25.820 --> 44:26.380
All right.

44:26.380 --> 44:27.180
So I get out.

44:27.180 --> 44:29.900
Yeah, no, I get it.

44:29.900 --> 44:30.460
I know.

44:30.460 --> 44:37.660
I just, I don't know if you, I'm sure you already heard, but mom, I think mom's seeing someone.

44:38.860 --> 44:40.620
Yes, I heard.

44:40.620 --> 44:42.540
He's quite a bit younger too.

44:42.540 --> 44:44.220
I heard he was 40.

44:44.220 --> 44:49.820
Yeah, but I mean, after you turn 25, it's like age doesn't matter anymore.

44:50.620 --> 44:51.120
Oh.

44:52.080 --> 44:58.720
She says that with 100% sincerity, because she thinks that if you're over 25, you're

44:58.720 --> 45:04.960
ancient and you can tell that suddenly Carol seems a little bit nervous.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.960
It's yeah, I don't know.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.640
Is there something else on your mind, sweetie?

45:08.640 --> 45:12.160
Well, promise you won't get angry.

45:12.880 --> 45:13.920
I promise.

45:13.920 --> 45:21.040
Well, you know that I know, you know, that I always wanted to make you happy and that

45:21.040 --> 45:24.000
that's why I went to journalism school.

45:24.000 --> 45:29.040
Of course, just like your mother and I, you went on to journalism school to continue the

45:29.040 --> 45:33.840
family business, which is your ultimate dream and desire, of course, right?

45:33.840 --> 45:34.560
Right.

45:34.560 --> 45:40.160
But well, I've decided and she suddenly gets like defensive as if she's ready to fight.

45:40.880 --> 45:44.080
I've decided that I'm not going to do that anymore.

45:44.080 --> 45:49.600
I've decided that I am going to pursue something else, something that I am passionate about

45:49.600 --> 45:51.120
and it's not journalism.

45:51.120 --> 45:52.000
It's not writing.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.320
It's not any of that.

45:54.320 --> 45:57.280
I have decided I'm going to become a nature photographer.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.960
Well, sweetie, that's that's wonderful.

46:04.960 --> 46:05.360
Really?

46:05.360 --> 46:09.840
You know, photography is still technically journalism.

46:13.360 --> 46:18.880
Sweetheart, I just want you to know that no matter what you choose, even if you're not

46:18.880 --> 46:24.320
a world class news anchor like me or a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist like your mother,

46:26.080 --> 46:32.000
we're happy that what you have chosen is still inexplicably linked to the nexus of

46:34.000 --> 46:39.920
of reporting and well, you know, showing the truth of our world to the people.

46:39.920 --> 46:40.560
That's what it's all about.

46:40.560 --> 46:45.280
OK, well, see, see, that was like I knew that you were going to react like that.

46:45.280 --> 46:48.720
So now I'm going to tell you the real my real job.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.320
I'm going to tell you the real.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.360
It's still related to photography.

46:56.640 --> 47:04.960
Yeah, but it's like for like beautiful women posing without clothing.

47:04.960 --> 47:07.760
Pornography, pornography.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.720
It's not it's not pornography.

47:11.360 --> 47:14.240
It's boudoir photography.

47:14.240 --> 47:15.600
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:15.600 --> 47:16.720
Nerd pornography.

47:20.880 --> 47:21.840
See, this is the thing.

47:21.840 --> 47:22.880
You never understand.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.080
You mock everything I do.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.680
That's the problem with you and mom.

47:25.680 --> 47:26.880
You're both academics.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.400
And I don't want to be involved with this.

47:28.400 --> 47:30.080
Like, I don't want to go to school anymore.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.280
I'm going to buy my camera.

47:31.280 --> 47:36.480
I'm going to take pictures of my friends and and they will pay me eventually.

47:36.480 --> 47:39.440
And then I'll start an Instagram account and I'm going to make a lot of money.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.040
And there's nothing you can say or do.

47:41.680 --> 47:44.080
And yeah, roll grip check, dad.

47:44.080 --> 47:46.080
No, I think he's no, no, no.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.040
This is hold on.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.680
This is specifically because of what you've seen tonight.

47:49.680 --> 47:51.840
And the amount of grip that you lost.

47:51.840 --> 47:54.400
It is going to affect the relationships that you have.

47:54.400 --> 47:54.800
Yeah, I know.

47:54.800 --> 47:57.760
But I was like what I was just about to say was all about that.

47:58.320 --> 47:58.880
Oh, okay.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.400
Why it actually wouldn't.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.880
Well, that's part of the game is you have to roll to do that.

48:05.520 --> 48:09.120
Yeah, he hates the dice, but he succeeds.

48:10.080 --> 48:10.480
Okay.

48:10.480 --> 48:10.720
Yeah.

48:10.720 --> 48:11.280
All fair enough.

48:11.280 --> 48:18.720
Uh, so you see from the part of your father's chin that you can't see it like quivers a

48:18.720 --> 48:25.360
little bit, but then he, then he composes itself and he says, honey, your mother and

48:25.360 --> 48:28.400
I will support you no matter what you choose to do.

48:28.960 --> 48:30.480
We only want you to be happy.

48:30.480 --> 48:36.000
And tonight I saw some horrible things that I can never unsee.

48:36.720 --> 48:42.880
If you can make beautiful art and put it into this world, that is enough for me.

48:43.760 --> 48:46.960
You're going to want to approach this more carefully with your mother.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.600
We may not tell her until you've graduated.

48:50.480 --> 48:51.760
Well, I'm not going to graduate.

48:51.760 --> 48:52.640
That's the thing.

48:52.640 --> 48:54.000
Right, right, right.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.600
Until you burlesque photography.

48:57.600 --> 49:03.440
Well, I'm, this is a whole new world for me, pumpkin.

49:03.440 --> 49:06.320
So dad, are you, are you all right?

49:06.960 --> 49:08.640
You said you've seen some horrible stuff.

49:08.640 --> 49:09.920
I didn't see a neck hole.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.000
Sorry.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.160
Uh, one of the wrestlers broke his arm.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.360
It bent the wrong way.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.400
It was gnarly.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.800
I love that Cal picked up the word gnarly from Beck.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.000
Oh no, Jesus.

49:24.000 --> 49:24.320
All right.

49:24.320 --> 49:25.440
Is he going to be okay?

49:25.440 --> 49:26.000
Yes, sweetie.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.280
I think he'll be fine.

49:27.280 --> 49:33.360
Everything will be fine in the world and you will, no matter what you choose to do, you

49:33.360 --> 49:35.440
will be an important contributing part of it.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.600
And your mother and I love you very deeply.

49:37.600 --> 49:41.680
Well, I love you too, dad, but, and she's starting to get worried.

49:41.680 --> 49:44.160
Like, wow, he really needs to start getting out there.

49:47.520 --> 49:52.560
I don't know that I know it's not my business, but I think it would be good for you to like,

49:53.200 --> 49:58.640
there are apps you can download that would like match you with other women.

49:58.640 --> 50:01.200
I just don't want you to be like, be alone.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.320
I'm not alone, sweetie.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.200
I have you, I have my memories.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.360
He points to all the pictures around the house.

50:09.360 --> 50:10.800
Oh my God.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.960
See, that's the definition of being alone.

50:14.320 --> 50:17.200
But I will try to get out there more.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
What are these women apps you told me about?

50:20.800 --> 50:23.840
Well, one of them is called Bumble.

50:25.200 --> 50:28.160
I mean, like when you've downloaded them, let me know and I'll give you some advice

50:28.160 --> 50:33.840
because you can't be like, like, don't start commenting on women's profiles like a weirdo.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.000
How do you comment like a normal low?

50:38.000 --> 50:41.680
Well, you just wait for them to like, you put up a nice picture of yourself

50:41.680 --> 50:43.600
and then you write something nice about you.

50:43.600 --> 50:48.480
Like you're an established journalist and then you wait for women to contact you.

50:48.480 --> 50:51.120
Is there an app that finds me a woman exactly like your mother?

50:54.320 --> 50:54.800
Dad.

50:55.920 --> 50:56.420
What?

50:58.160 --> 51:02.320
Maybe you should go for the complete opposite.

51:03.520 --> 51:04.080
Like a guy?

51:07.280 --> 51:07.920
Well, maybe.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.320
I don't know, man.

51:13.120 --> 51:17.680
Carol, I promise you, I will look into online dating.

51:17.680 --> 51:18.000
All right.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.360
Carol, exciting news.

51:19.920 --> 51:22.400
Do you post your boudoir pictures on TikTok?

51:22.400 --> 51:23.120
Well, okay.

51:23.120 --> 51:25.920
So dad, you can't follow my friends.

51:25.920 --> 51:27.760
Like, they are not part of the dating pool.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.520
No, no.

51:29.520 --> 51:30.400
Have you heard of this?

51:30.400 --> 51:31.520
Have you heard of TikTok?

51:33.680 --> 51:35.200
Of course I've heard about TikTok.

51:35.200 --> 51:35.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:36.640 --> 51:39.120
Well, I learned about it today and I did a dance.

51:40.160 --> 51:42.480
Carol, no, you should see the dance I did.

51:42.480 --> 51:45.120
It's posted on the can TikTok for the station.

51:45.920 --> 51:46.720
People liked it.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.000
Hey, you'll see, I'm out there.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.600
Hey Carol, when you pull it up on your phone, you see it's called the calzone.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.160
Oh God.

51:56.720 --> 51:57.520
Oh God.

51:57.520 --> 52:02.720
And he's doing a dance with a random guy on the street who's doing a very cool dance where

52:02.720 --> 52:08.880
it looks like he's sitting while he's upright and dancing around in the sitting position.

52:08.880 --> 52:11.600
And Cal does it perfectly alongside of him.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.320
Wow, dad.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.000
Actually, that's pretty impressive.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.160
You should actually, you should keep doing that.

52:16.160 --> 52:20.000
I'm in a weird twisted reality that we currently live in.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.360
You would actually find more dates based on this video.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.120
With women like your mother?

52:26.160 --> 52:30.400
Maybe women like my mother.

52:30.400 --> 52:36.160
Sure, but you should not narrow your, like, there are plenty of women out there that aren't

52:36.160 --> 52:36.720
like mom.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.560
Oh, well, that's the problem.

52:40.240 --> 52:40.960
All right, dad.

52:42.160 --> 52:46.960
I have to go, but thank you for being supportive of my choices.

52:46.960 --> 52:51.200
Try to get some sleep and then maybe we'll, yeah, we'll, I'll check in with you tomorrow.

52:51.680 --> 52:57.360
But I still, until I have some money, maybe don't cancel my credit card yet.

52:59.520 --> 53:01.680
I wouldn't dream of it, sweetie.

53:01.680 --> 53:06.000
But again, don't tell your mother she would cancel them in a heartbeat.

53:07.200 --> 53:08.160
Thanks, dad.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.560
Yeah, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you tomorrow.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.560
I love you very much.

53:12.560 --> 53:13.920
I love you too, dad.

53:13.920 --> 53:15.680
And I, yeah, thank you.

53:18.160 --> 53:18.660
Thank you.

53:19.220 --> 53:21.540
This has been Cal Colorado.

53:21.540 --> 53:22.580
Have a pleasant evening.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.140
You really don't have, okay, fine.

53:28.740 --> 53:31.300
Ellie, thank you so much for coming on the show.

53:31.300 --> 53:31.940
Oh my God.

53:31.940 --> 53:32.420
That was great.

53:32.420 --> 53:32.980
That was fun.

53:32.980 --> 53:39.300
I'm very much looking forward to seeing how this relationship thrives or...

53:39.300 --> 53:40.260
Yeah, it was very normal.

53:40.260 --> 53:45.060
Like, I love how, like, I expected Zach to come in and be like, and then all of a sudden

53:45.060 --> 53:47.540
her head falls over, like she dies.

53:48.180 --> 53:49.460
And I'm like, okay, cool.

53:49.460 --> 53:50.580
We got a long ways to go.

53:50.580 --> 53:52.660
We got time to fuck this shit up.

53:52.660 --> 53:55.140
Yeah, there can definitely be a phone call where your head falls off.

53:56.020 --> 53:57.220
Hey, if that's what you want.

53:57.220 --> 54:00.500
Is season two a homebrew as well?

54:00.500 --> 54:01.460
Yeah, very nice.

54:01.460 --> 54:02.420
It's all I can do.

54:02.420 --> 54:03.220
I don't like reading.

54:04.260 --> 54:05.300
You actually can't.

54:06.740 --> 54:07.700
I'm too stupid.

54:08.340 --> 54:08.980
It's a shame.

54:17.540 --> 54:37.540
My life is great and it's all mine Cause my life is great and it's all mine

54:47.540 --> 54:48.620
I
