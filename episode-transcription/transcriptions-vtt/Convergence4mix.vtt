WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.720
Shit.

00:00.720 --> 00:03.440
God damn it, quit poking and prodding me.

00:03.440 --> 00:04.840
I can't see shit.

00:04.840 --> 00:08.200
Who put this fucking blindfold on me?

00:08.200 --> 00:11.360
Hey, I'm talking to you, whoever, or whatever you are.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.400
Cut that shit out now.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.800
I got a damn show to run here.

00:15.800 --> 00:21.560
Don't you know I'm broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:21.560 --> 00:27.080
the only radio station currently being run by an in-prison DJ

00:27.080 --> 00:28.400
Wolf the Dog?

00:28.440 --> 00:31.240
Now, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf, y'all.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.480
And this week's comes from Nathan,

00:33.480 --> 00:36.960
who claims he is either deep in the heart of Texas

00:36.960 --> 00:39.800
or deep in the hell that is Texas.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.560
He writes, shout out to Eric N for being the most badass

00:44.560 --> 00:48.800
bone-digging buddy one could ask for in this dirty business.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.280
And to my wife, Erin, who is so good at wrangling all those

00:53.280 --> 00:57.080
werepuppies and kitties, I'm so glad you're diving

00:57.120 --> 00:59.640
into a world of unseen horrors.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.440
Love you, insert creepy cackling laugh.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.200
Oh, shit.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.400
To those hardworking cultural resource archaeologists

01:12.400 --> 01:15.600
out in the field, keep on digging those holes

01:15.600 --> 01:19.960
and hopefully those sinister abandoned cabins we find

01:19.960 --> 01:24.960
on survey aren't the layer of any backwoods Eldritch cults.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
Stay safe and sane, says here a creepy cackling laugh

01:30.560 --> 01:32.560
again but better this time.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.200
Oh, God damn it.

01:38.680 --> 01:42.920
Well, Nathan, thanks for forcing me to cackle not once

01:42.920 --> 01:46.920
but two times on a day where I don't especially feel

01:46.920 --> 01:48.160
like cackling.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.400
I forgive you this time but next time.

01:51.400 --> 01:55.720
Oh, buddy, you better hope it's a cackle day or else.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.880
If you wanna write up something for this

01:57.880 --> 02:01.360
and caged wolf to how, click on the show notes

02:01.360 --> 02:05.400
and tag us on the internet at pretending pod.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.440
One of those links down there is to patreon.com

02:08.440 --> 02:10.360
slash pretending pod.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.840
For the whole month of November, we here at PTBP

02:13.840 --> 02:17.720
are taking any new and upgraded monies,

02:17.720 --> 02:21.240
doubling it and using that scratch to buy blankets

02:22.080 --> 02:25.200
and sleeping bags for cold folks in Springfield, Missouri.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.640
And y'all have been super duper kind.

02:27.640 --> 02:31.480
So far, you've raised $375.

02:31.480 --> 02:36.480
So wolf gonna double that and we can spend $750

02:36.560 --> 02:39.160
on supplies for those who need them.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.040
And congrats, I said I'd give away a couple

02:42.040 --> 02:47.040
of PTBP logo t-shirts to a couple fine patrons on Patreon.

02:48.040 --> 02:52.160
So yay and good job to Jasmine Johnson

02:52.160 --> 02:54.280
and Chainsaw Unicorn.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.400
Please reach out by any means necessary

02:57.400 --> 03:00.160
so we can send you a damn shirt.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.520
Woo hoo hoo, it's time for the news.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.320
The news is wild, y'all.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.000
There's a pregnant girl in this motel room

03:09.000 --> 03:12.320
that we all thought was meant for storage.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.600
Hmm, hmm, Scott Adams, hmm, indeed.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.480
Now I'm gonna give you all what we all need.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.160
It's Brat Pit with Ms. Mary.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.080
Mary, yeah.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.960
I gotta work in the morning

03:37.960 --> 03:40.960
and this shit's so important

03:40.960 --> 03:44.960
so I can't get high.

03:44.960 --> 03:50.840
No, I can't get high.

03:50.840 --> 03:55.120
I thought this stuff helped anxiety.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.360
There must be something inside of me.

03:58.360 --> 04:02.480
Does anybody know why?

04:02.480 --> 04:06.360
I can't get high.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.400
I think we both thought you wanted to open it.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.320
No, I was saying like this, I don't really like it

04:13.320 --> 04:14.560
but it's really not that bad.

04:14.560 --> 04:15.400
It's not.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.000
But also every time I drink it, I go through,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.520
I don't like it, it's fine.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.400
I don't like it.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.240
And of course, we're talking about

04:22.240 --> 04:25.120
the new Limoncello Naturally Essence

04:25.120 --> 04:27.160
Sparkling Water from La Croix.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.480
We'll like it if La Croix does podcast ads.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.800
That is true, until then, fuck La Croix

04:32.800 --> 04:34.600
and fuck every brand that doesn't.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.280
Yeah, we will keep talking shit about you

04:36.280 --> 04:37.840
until you pay us off.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.040
It's like a vanilla lemon thing.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.640
There's too much vanilla in it, though.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.640
No, it's kinda gross.

04:43.640 --> 04:47.040
We're here with David Winters!

04:47.040 --> 04:49.840
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.480
Wam, wam, wam, wam, wam.

04:52.480 --> 04:56.480
Winter is coming, now is the winters of your discontent.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.320
What's up, man?

04:57.320 --> 04:58.760
Yeah, hi.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.440
Have you been having fun with us?

05:01.440 --> 05:02.280
Have you enjoyed this?

05:02.280 --> 05:03.920
You got some hot energy coming in.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.280
Yes, yes, I have.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.640
These are like those one-word answers

05:09.640 --> 05:13.280
when your parents call and you are in the middle

05:13.280 --> 05:14.760
of something and you pick it up.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.920
Is this like when you're at like a con

05:16.920 --> 05:19.240
and people ask you questions, you're just like,

05:19.240 --> 05:21.960
hey, I loved the show so much, how is it?

05:21.960 --> 05:22.800
Yes.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.240
So are you a lawyer in real life?

05:25.240 --> 05:26.080
No.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.000
Who's your favorite PTV people?

05:32.360 --> 05:33.200
Yes.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.120
It makes for good radio.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.120
It does, yeah.

05:39.120 --> 05:39.960
Who's your favorite?

05:39.960 --> 05:40.800
Really short.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.640
Glass cannon.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.120
To the point.

05:43.120 --> 05:43.960
No.

05:44.960 --> 05:49.040
Okay, so if you had to pick only one Colin Hanks movie

05:49.040 --> 05:50.920
and then replace him with every.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.000
Can you name a third Colin Hanks movie?

05:54.000 --> 05:58.840
I can name Orange County and I don't know any more than that.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.120
That's the end of my list, too.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.240
Oh, right, I said Dexter, that's not even a movie.

06:02.240 --> 06:06.200
All right, let's dive into this shit, shall we?

06:06.200 --> 06:09.880
We just learned a lot of information, so much information.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.200
Well, you learned some of the information.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.320
We got cut off so rudely by the end of an episode

06:15.320 --> 06:19.000
right at the about halfway point of an info dump.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.840
I'm willing to keep dumping

06:20.840 --> 06:22.480
if you're willing to keep receiving the dump.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.320
Oh, please dump on us.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.160
Dump all over us.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.000
Please dump on us.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.560
We got a glass table right here, we'll pull out.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.400
Well, that made it weird.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.720
Steam and hot info.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.960
Yeah, you made it into like scat or something,

06:33.960 --> 06:34.800
that was weird.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.360
Yeah, we just want knowledge shat all over our chests.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.200
Right.

06:42.240 --> 06:46.720
I love these big steamy dumps that David is taking.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.520
You just cracked open his notebook

06:48.520 --> 06:52.440
and got a dump of several different happenings

06:52.440 --> 06:54.920
that he has seemed to have researched in the area.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.640
Things like livestock mutilations, livestock alterations,

06:58.640 --> 07:01.680
some missing time, some helicopters being sighted,

07:01.680 --> 07:03.840
including some muzzle flashes,

07:03.840 --> 07:06.760
lights being sighted in the hills, some crop circles,

07:06.760 --> 07:10.400
some notes about J.A. being Jane Allen.

07:10.440 --> 07:13.520
Pregnant three weeks equals six months.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.560
Exactly, and the aldermen who never go home.

07:16.560 --> 07:21.320
That was in the notebook, his wide ruled school notebook.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.160
Freak.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.960
You, again, should be questioning his sanity.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.320
And you still see his Macintosh power book

07:28.320 --> 07:31.800
in front of you plugged into the phone outlet

07:31.800 --> 07:34.800
as you had learned earlier when you tried to dial them.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.320
Is there anything you'd like to do?

07:36.320 --> 07:40.040
Can I ask a kind of retroactive question?

07:40.680 --> 07:42.440
When I was looking at Jane Allen,

07:42.440 --> 07:44.960
when Tan was looking at Jane Allen,

07:44.960 --> 07:49.960
did she seem older than she should be?

07:50.120 --> 07:52.640
Nope, she's still a high school senior,

07:52.640 --> 07:54.560
looks like a high school senior,

07:54.560 --> 07:57.200
actually looks very similar to some of those photos

07:57.200 --> 08:00.160
that you saw of her family in her house

08:00.160 --> 08:01.000
when you were there, right?

08:01.000 --> 08:01.840
When her mom was dressed to kill.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.600
At least one of you,

08:03.600 --> 08:08.120
yeah, at least one of you was looking through

08:08.160 --> 08:12.200
all the family photos and she looks as you would expect.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.600
So back to the computer.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.440
Sure.

08:15.440 --> 08:20.440
Jodine goes over and turns it on and we saw he had AOL.

08:20.960 --> 08:25.960
He does, however, in typical 1990s computer fashion,

08:26.120 --> 08:30.800
it does still ask for a password as you open it.

08:30.800 --> 08:35.400
Does anyone have an often underused skill?

08:35.400 --> 08:39.080
SIGINT, signals intelligence.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.280
I don't.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.120
Exactly.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.380
I have a 50 in pilot.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.320
Can I pilot this computer too?

08:48.320 --> 08:49.920
Can we negotiate with you here?

08:49.920 --> 08:52.880
Luke, we need to seriously have a conversation

08:52.880 --> 08:55.920
about the fact that I took special training in parachute.

08:58.020 --> 09:00.760
Yeah, I knew both of those

09:00.760 --> 09:02.560
and I didn't want to connect them yet,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.840
but I know what's going to happen.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.460
You don't need SIGINT.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.000
SIGINT is one option,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.240
but fortunately there's a second one

09:12.240 --> 09:13.720
which is computer science.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.080
Oh, good.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.960
I've got computer science at a 50.

09:16.960 --> 09:17.960
Oh, good.

09:17.960 --> 09:22.420
50, with a 50, given how much time and effort

09:22.420 --> 09:24.060
you've invested in knowing computer science.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.100
You know, in the early 1990s,

09:26.100 --> 09:29.680
people don't use the most secure passwords.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.440
Not realizing that information security is important.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.120
Guess me a password.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.640
Love, one, two, three.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.320
Okay, that doesn't work.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.660
Watch the sky's exclamation point.

09:40.660 --> 09:41.500
Purple.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.360
Watch the sky's exclamation point actually worked.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.180
That's all it was.

09:44.180 --> 09:45.800
Well, I didn't try that one, so.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.400
Shit, I'm not there.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.240
Cindy.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.060
I'm sorry, Joe.

09:49.060 --> 09:49.900
Oh, Cindy's not there?

09:49.900 --> 09:50.720
Oh, oh, okay.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.560
I'm sorry, Joe.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.940
Sorry, it's not, so did purple work?

09:52.940 --> 09:56.640
Yeah, Joe, guess like 15 more.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.160
I try watch the sky's one.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.000
No?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.380
I try watch the sky's two.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.500
Oh, no.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.340
I accidentally.

10:04.340 --> 10:05.160
Maybe I should just have you roll.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.860
I accidentally hit caps lock.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.200
I go back to the one,

10:10.200 --> 10:12.880
because I thought I might have mis-hit that one.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.300
I countermeasured triggers,

10:14.300 --> 10:16.200
and the computer catches on fire

10:16.200 --> 10:20.220
due to 10 failed password attempts.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.060
No, I'm just kidding.

10:21.060 --> 10:21.880
I'll give it to you.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.800
I wasn't going to actually make you guess every password

10:23.800 --> 10:26.600
until you got to football one, two, three

10:26.600 --> 10:28.000
was the correct answer.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.320
Hey, I was on the backtrack.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.420
Go team, you were, you were.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.100
It cracks open.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.660
You find a document on the desktop,

10:36.660 --> 10:40.820
and I am going to display it in front of you now.

10:40.820 --> 10:44.220
If you check out your television, it's long.

10:44.220 --> 10:48.260
This is a long multiple paragraph document

10:48.260 --> 10:53.260
written in kind of first person stream of consciousness.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.900
It looks like it's,

10:55.900 --> 10:59.340
they're looking for evidence of extra sensory perception.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.540
I am wondering about the possibility

11:01.580 --> 11:03.660
that the brain translates information

11:03.660 --> 11:05.500
in terms of the extra sensory.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.340
He literally told us not to read this.

11:06.340 --> 11:07.900
And that's why it achieves.

11:09.580 --> 11:12.020
Can we shut up for like two minutes and just read it,

11:12.020 --> 11:13.860
and then we can talk about what it says?

11:13.860 --> 11:16.900
Is it just like a stream of thought?

11:16.900 --> 11:18.500
Yeah, it gets just insane.

11:18.500 --> 11:22.260
Omni parent consciousness, open network.

11:22.260 --> 11:23.100
Yeah.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.660
It starts out kind of coherent,

11:24.660 --> 11:26.380
but it gets a little rambly.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.700
Oh, we get into some Jesus stuff.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.480
I thought so too, but that's not what it is.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.940
Yeah, it's French, just sweetie.

11:34.940 --> 11:36.540
Yeah, French Jesus.

11:37.420 --> 11:38.620
So it's a long,

11:38.620 --> 11:40.500
and the reason why I said not to read it all out loud

11:40.500 --> 11:42.060
is it would make no sense.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.440
And people would have to rewind several times and be like,

11:45.440 --> 11:47.340
what the hell are these guys talking about?

11:47.340 --> 11:50.020
But suffice to say, this is something presumably

11:50.020 --> 11:52.220
that was written by Scott Adams on his computer

11:52.220 --> 11:53.400
stream of consciousness,

11:53.400 --> 11:58.180
talking about extra sensory perception and existence

11:58.620 --> 12:01.420
and seeing things and consciousness

12:01.420 --> 12:05.020
and all sorts of nonsense related to thought

12:05.020 --> 12:08.060
and the sensory experience.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.660
He should have stuck to Dilbert.

12:12.220 --> 12:13.820
He's branching out, okay?

12:13.820 --> 12:15.300
You have to try new things.

12:15.300 --> 12:20.300
Yeah, the file title was S-Z-E comma T.

12:21.260 --> 12:23.900
Of course it was, of course it was.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.820
But now you have that, that's thing number two

12:25.820 --> 12:27.540
from this steamy dump.

12:28.500 --> 12:32.380
Thing number three, you see a file on the desktop.

12:32.380 --> 12:34.380
It's simply titled message.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.420
It's a wave file.

12:36.420 --> 12:40.240
And I am going to need an alertness roll from everyone.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.860
Fail, 73 on a 70.

12:47.860 --> 12:50.300
I also fail, a 75 on a 50.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.020
Succeed, 39 on a 50.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.320
I got a 36 on a 50, nice.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.160
All right.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.760
So Zach and Luke, keep your headphones on.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.000
The other two of you, please take your headphones off

13:01.000 --> 13:02.760
and then we will swap.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.320
Dude, Zach, we can literally say anything about these guys

13:05.320 --> 13:06.160
in the beginning.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.180
Fucking idiots.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.800
I love them both a whole lot.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.260
Me too.

13:12.260 --> 13:13.640
You fire up the message

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
and this is the clip you get.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.560
Dealing with, it's been a long time

13:20.560 --> 13:22.400
and we have many things to do

13:22.400 --> 13:25.240
and you are not sure what you are doing.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.780
Stop, stop, stop.

13:29.780 --> 13:31.080
That's all you get out of it.

13:31.080 --> 13:31.920
Okay.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.280
So someone's telling this guy to stop what he's doing

13:35.280 --> 13:37.960
because he doesn't know what he's dealing with.

13:37.960 --> 13:38.780
Is that right, Luke?

13:38.780 --> 13:39.620
Did I do it?

13:39.620 --> 13:41.200
I wrote down, not sure what you're dealing with.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.040
Stop now.

13:42.040 --> 13:42.860
Wow.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.320
One in the same.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.240
Pop, swap, swap, swap, swap.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.760
Zach didn't teach you the bird.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.280
When he wants to call us back in,

13:50.280 --> 13:51.920
we do this on our screens.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.280
Oh, really?

13:53.280 --> 13:55.240
We did it when we were remote

13:55.320 --> 13:56.140
because we couldn't.

13:56.140 --> 13:56.980
People can fly away at home.

13:56.980 --> 13:59.360
You could see on the screen if we needed them back.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.200
Fair enough.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.280
Well, I've got you two now

14:01.280 --> 14:03.360
and now it's time for you to fire up

14:03.360 --> 14:07.000
this metallic squawky voice.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.600
Dealing with, it's been a long time

14:10.600 --> 14:12.400
and we have many things to do

14:12.400 --> 14:15.240
and you are not sure what you are doing.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.280
Stop now.

14:18.680 --> 14:19.720
Stop now.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.960
Tone Brown, is that like the Brown note?

14:21.960 --> 14:23.320
He did say duty.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.560
He just said duty.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.200
Can I do the bird thing into the camera?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.040
Is that how it works?

14:28.040 --> 14:28.860
Yeah, do that.

14:28.860 --> 14:29.700
Let's see if it works.

14:29.700 --> 14:30.640
No one's looking, that's the problem.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.140
We often combat that, yep.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.760
Oh, it worked, it worked.

14:36.760 --> 14:37.920
Saw the bird.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.160
So we, Joe and I like sat there

14:40.160 --> 14:42.320
like rubbing our ears vigorously

14:42.320 --> 14:43.160
for like a minute and a half.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.120
Saw that, yeah.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.600
So we couldn't hear anything

14:45.600 --> 14:48.320
and you two chuckle fuckers are just like sharing memes

14:48.320 --> 14:50.640
and laughing and faking.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.980
Yeah, I wasn't paying attention to you at all.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.260
Luke has some really funny pictures on his phone.

14:56.260 --> 14:57.100
Yeah.

15:01.540 --> 15:02.380
Okay.

15:02.380 --> 15:05.300
Well, that seems ominous.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.860
Yeah, what did you think about the,

15:07.860 --> 15:10.160
do you think he's working on the Brown note,

15:10.160 --> 15:12.660
the tone that makes people shit their pants?

15:12.660 --> 15:14.340
The Brown, what?

15:14.340 --> 15:16.980
I had not, what?

15:16.980 --> 15:17.820
The Brown note.

15:17.820 --> 15:19.300
He said a Brown tone.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.660
No, I didn't hear any, what?

15:21.660 --> 15:23.480
That's not what I heard at all.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.300
What do you mean?

15:25.300 --> 15:26.140
We all heard it.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.380
Play it again.

15:28.380 --> 15:29.220
Here's the deal.

15:29.220 --> 15:34.160
I'm not sure what you're dealing with, but stop now.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:35.840
That's what we heard.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.920
Yeah, we heard a man's voice, right?

15:36.920 --> 15:37.920
It was kind of garbled.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.240
We missed some words.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.060
Right.

15:40.060 --> 15:41.360
But it mostly just said,

15:41.360 --> 15:43.040
you don't know what you're dealing with.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.600
Stop now, stop now, stop now.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.440
What did you hear?

15:46.440 --> 15:47.260
Over and over and over.

15:47.260 --> 15:50.060
Well, we heard some garbled words too, but we,

15:50.060 --> 15:51.640
well, I think you took it down pretty well, huh?

15:51.640 --> 15:53.320
You didn't hear a name.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.360
They said Billy Webb.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.520
No, we heard, we didn't hear no name.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.680
They said a name?

15:58.680 --> 15:59.720
Billy Webb?

15:59.720 --> 16:02.040
Yeah, they talked about duty and they talked about.

16:02.040 --> 16:02.880
A Brown tone.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.280
They said to talk now.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.120
Who's Billy Webb?

16:07.120 --> 16:09.040
Was he on the list of the,

16:09.040 --> 16:11.440
in the notes we got of all the different events?

16:12.480 --> 16:14.920
I just remember Beau Laramie.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.760
Nope.

16:15.760 --> 16:16.600
Doesn't look like it.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.420
Nope.

16:17.420 --> 16:18.880
Billy Webb.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.840
Like a web of Billys.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.220
I don't remember if computers had this kind of stuff

16:24.060 --> 16:25.380
back then, but is there anything that we can click on

16:25.380 --> 16:28.340
that shows us when the file was made, like created?

16:28.340 --> 16:31.220
Yeah, the file is only about three days old.

16:31.220 --> 16:33.100
As far as this audio file goes,

16:33.100 --> 16:36.380
the ranty dream of consciousness file,

16:36.380 --> 16:38.260
that's only about two days old.

16:38.260 --> 16:40.360
That seems to be a little bit more fresh.

16:40.360 --> 16:43.380
And then obviously the notebook is handwritten.

16:43.380 --> 16:45.660
So you'd have no idea exactly when stuff was written.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.420
However, there are various dates

16:47.420 --> 16:49.100
over the last month and a half.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.800
It's tough to say which of those dates were reported to him

16:51.800 --> 16:54.040
or maybe which of those bits of information

16:54.040 --> 16:55.000
he collected himself.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.240
There's nowhere a way to delineate between the two.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.080
Sure.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.760
What did you hear about Billy Webb?

16:59.760 --> 17:00.600
That's it.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.520
Just they said a name.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.320
They said Billy Webb and then they kind of broke up.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.440
And then there was a...

17:06.440 --> 17:08.200
Did Billy Webb used to play center field

17:08.200 --> 17:09.440
for the Ohio state?

17:09.440 --> 17:10.840
University?

17:10.840 --> 17:12.240
USO backwards?

17:14.240 --> 17:18.840
Tan goes to the office and asks Riker for a phone book.

17:18.840 --> 17:19.680
Nice.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.640
And Riker will produce a phone book.

17:22.480 --> 17:26.120
I go to W looking for Billiam Webb.

17:26.120 --> 17:29.280
You can go to W and there are no webs in this town.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.200
What a tangled web we don't weave.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.040
Jeez.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.120
Let's see what he did there.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.440
So is this like one...

17:38.440 --> 17:39.280
Okay.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.040
Why did we play an audio file and we heard one thing

17:43.040 --> 17:44.160
and you heard another?

17:44.160 --> 17:45.440
Well, you misheard obviously.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.920
Yeah, I think you guys are just wrong.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.880
Well, if we don't know what Billy Webb is

17:49.880 --> 17:51.440
and there's no Billy Webb here,

17:51.440 --> 17:54.920
doesn't it probably lend itself to the belief

17:54.920 --> 17:56.800
that we heard the correct thing?

17:56.800 --> 17:58.280
I mean, we all heard the same thing.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.440
You just misheard.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.560
It's not like there are no Billy Webs ever.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.920
It says Laurel just over and over.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.440
Tan who is not a part of this conversation

18:06.440 --> 18:09.520
cause he's in the office asks Riker,

18:09.520 --> 18:11.240
do you know Billy Webb?

18:11.240 --> 18:13.000
Is that, do you know?

18:13.000 --> 18:13.840
No.

18:13.840 --> 18:14.680
Okay, that's it.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.160
Bye.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.360
Bye.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.160
On the computer, is that literally all we find?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.720
Is there anything else that we should look

18:21.720 --> 18:22.680
in this computer for?

18:22.680 --> 18:24.520
That's really all that's relevant.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.760
You can go through all the other notebooks and notes.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.560
He has notebooks for various other towns all over the place.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.360
He's based out of Tennessee.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.560
So most of these towns are all related

18:34.560 --> 18:36.320
to sightings in the area.

18:36.320 --> 18:40.440
However, the Grover's Ville notebook is chock full of stuff.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.120
It's just page after pages.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.880
These are kind of the more recent pages,

18:43.880 --> 18:46.200
but you go back and there are just progressively

18:46.240 --> 18:49.840
more outrageous things that he has records of.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.280
Little gray people walking through Main Street

18:52.280 --> 18:55.240
and sighting of eight flying saucers.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.120
And it goes back years actually of this Grover's Ville stuff.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.440
It's only more recently when you're seeing specific things

19:01.440 --> 19:06.440
about choppers or weird things about pregnant girls.

19:07.380 --> 19:11.360
What is the oldest mention of like an alien occurrence

19:11.360 --> 19:13.240
or sighting in Grover's Ville?

19:13.240 --> 19:15.220
It's probably two or three years,

19:15.220 --> 19:17.140
but it's similar to his other notebooks.

19:17.140 --> 19:19.280
Most other places go back two or three years.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.280
You can reason that's probably

19:20.280 --> 19:21.860
when he kind of got in the UFO game.

19:21.860 --> 19:22.700
Gotcha, okay.

19:22.700 --> 19:27.000
He stopped writing comics and then got into the UFO game.

19:27.000 --> 19:27.840
Good for him.

19:27.840 --> 19:31.040
Tan goes back to the room and signals Cindy

19:31.040 --> 19:32.180
to like come outside.

19:32.180 --> 19:33.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.820
So he doesn't know anything about Webb.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.820
I got an idea though.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.420
Well, that's because Webb wasn't a thing.

19:39.420 --> 19:40.260
What's your idea?

19:40.260 --> 19:41.100
Yeah, I got an idea.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.020
Okay, you know, everybody in the town's weird.

19:44.020 --> 19:44.880
Yeah, for sure.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.240
Probably an alien.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.060
Sure.

19:47.060 --> 19:47.900
They're covering something up.

19:47.900 --> 19:48.920
Yeah, yeah.

19:48.920 --> 19:53.920
What if we parade Jane down Main Street,

19:54.100 --> 19:55.600
make a big scene,

19:55.600 --> 19:58.760
and then we see who comes out to deal with it.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.040
Then we got our main suspect.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.640
That seems horrible to do to this poor girl.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.600
Hearing that through the open door at Joe is like,

20:05.600 --> 20:07.760
yeah, I think everyone would come out

20:07.760 --> 20:09.920
to stop you from doing that, alien or not.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.080
Plus the aliens, their whole deal

20:11.080 --> 20:12.640
is that they're acting like people.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.320
Yeah, but it's gonna piss them off.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.040
They're gonna be really,

20:16.040 --> 20:17.520
they're gonna be blase about it

20:17.520 --> 20:19.800
like they've been blase about everything.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.520
What we need to do is go to who has the most money

20:22.520 --> 20:24.360
in this town and take them out

20:24.360 --> 20:27.120
because they are provoking, they are threatening,

20:27.120 --> 20:29.520
they are going around dealing in stuff

20:29.520 --> 20:31.720
that they don't want other people poking their heads in.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.200
And what do we know, Joe,

20:33.200 --> 20:35.840
about people who don't want people poking their heads in,

20:35.840 --> 20:37.420
who threaten other people?

20:37.420 --> 20:39.620
It's always about...

20:39.620 --> 20:40.460
Money.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.280
Money.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.840
It's always about money.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.680
Joe is like looking at you intently

20:44.680 --> 20:48.480
and he kind of like holds up a cardigan and hands it to you.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.960
She puts on a second cardigan and calms down.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.040
I only got one more, fellers.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.360
As she's calming down,

20:55.360 --> 21:00.080
you hear out in the parking lot a car arrive.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.080
We all turn and look.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.320
Now, before we do that though,

21:04.320 --> 21:05.760
I need to just talk to Joe.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.880
Joe the character or Joe the human?

21:07.880 --> 21:12.360
Sorry, Joe, that was such a bad choice, Thomas.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.640
I think it's a good name.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.480
It is a good name.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.000
I don't fault you for that.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.840
I think, look, do me a favor.

21:20.840 --> 21:24.160
Next time you have a victim like myself

21:24.160 --> 21:26.680
in this similar situation,

21:26.680 --> 21:29.640
only use your four names scrambled between them.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.800
There you go.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.920
There you go.

21:31.920 --> 21:35.440
Send us Troy Lavallee and we will do that to him.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.480
Luke Zach.

21:37.480 --> 21:38.320
Go, Thomas.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.680
I want to talk to Joe the human being.

21:40.680 --> 21:41.640
Real life, Joe.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.760
Everyone else, wait for the bird signal.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.280
It's just me and you, David.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.480
It is just me and you.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.840
And really, you know, I just wanted to take a break.

21:49.840 --> 21:50.680
I'm good with you, yeah.

21:50.680 --> 21:51.880
And really just, yeah,

21:51.880 --> 21:53.600
just relax without those chuckleheads.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.480
That's really kind of the main thing.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.520
What you getting for dinner tonight?

21:56.520 --> 21:58.360
Bad thing about saying that is at some point,

21:58.360 --> 21:59.720
someone's going to be editing this

21:59.720 --> 22:02.360
and I just called them a chucklehead, so, you know.

22:03.640 --> 22:08.080
I hope it's you editing this episode and not anyone else.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.600
However, I have news for you.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.960
And I have news for your character.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.560
I guess not you,

22:14.560 --> 22:18.920
but that news is you feel a little bit different today.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.720
You have no real change in appetite,

22:20.720 --> 22:23.880
but for whatever reason, you're incredibly thirsty.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.400
You just feel like you're always dehydrated.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.400
You always need to be drinking something,

22:28.400 --> 22:30.080
thinking about where you're getting your next drink.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.440
Not necessarily an alcoholic beverage,

22:31.440 --> 22:34.040
just water, coffee, anything,

22:34.040 --> 22:37.240
but you can't quite quench that thirst.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.960
Additionally, speaking of the dumps

22:39.960 --> 22:42.120
we were discussing earlier,

22:42.120 --> 22:43.480
you can still urinate,

22:43.480 --> 22:47.200
but there's no more number two for you in your future.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.080
Is it a constipation thing

22:49.080 --> 22:50.480
or I just don't feel the need to?

22:50.480 --> 22:52.080
You don't feel the need to.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.200
Yes, I'm sorry.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.280
I don't want to make it sound like

22:54.280 --> 22:57.920
you have suddenly just become constipated and you need,

22:57.920 --> 23:00.320
yeah, you need to go to a drug store and get,

23:00.320 --> 23:01.560
no, it's not quite like that.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.240
You have absolutely no urge to.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.160
Okay, cool.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.160
And that's pretty much it.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.280
That's all you know.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.920
Just the standard, last night was thirsty Thursday.

23:08.920 --> 23:09.840
Today's Friday.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.680
You know, it happens.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.440
Some Fridays you just need to drink a lot of fluid

23:13.440 --> 23:16.760
and you can never defecate ever again.

23:16.760 --> 23:17.600
That's it.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.440
You know.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.360
All right, I'll do the bird thing.

23:19.360 --> 23:22.080
It's working, it's working.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.160
We got him.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.200
A car has rolled up into the parking lot.

23:26.200 --> 23:31.200
It is an early nineties Lincoln town car, in fact.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.040
And it rolls up, sees you all

23:34.040 --> 23:38.360
and a sharply dressed individual, a G man, if you will,

23:38.360 --> 23:42.880
hops out of the car with a large duffle bag

23:42.880 --> 23:46.320
and comes up towards the office, towards Riker's office,

23:46.320 --> 23:47.720
kind of asks where you guys are.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.920
Riker's in that office, points kind of down your way

23:50.920 --> 23:53.480
towards the Scott Adams, Jane Allen room.

23:53.480 --> 23:57.120
And he gets there and knocks on the ajar door.

23:57.120 --> 23:57.940
Wait, hello?

23:57.940 --> 24:00.880
He stands like in the middle of all of us,

24:00.880 --> 24:02.600
quiet and then knocks on the door?

24:02.600 --> 24:03.640
I thought you were inside.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.040
You and I are outside.

24:05.040 --> 24:05.880
Yeah, we're outside.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.700
They're inside.

24:06.700 --> 24:07.540
Cindy and Jane are outside.

24:07.540 --> 24:08.380
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.200
I thought everyone was inside.

24:09.200 --> 24:12.360
So we're like waving at him as he comes towards us.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.360
He just walks past you and ignores you.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.200
No, just kidding.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.480
He stops you.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.520
Sorry.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.760
Zach's head whipped to us.

24:18.760 --> 24:19.600
He's like, that's fair.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.440
What's that mean?

24:20.440 --> 24:21.960
Okay, that's wild.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.360
It's a clue.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.960
He can't see you anymore.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.480
You're now invisible.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.960
We're the aliens.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.280
Am I real?

24:29.280 --> 24:32.060
Sorry, I didn't realize you were standing there.

24:32.060 --> 24:32.900
Hello?

24:32.900 --> 24:34.280
And he whips out a badge.

24:34.280 --> 24:35.700
Agent Jordan Cook.

24:35.700 --> 24:37.860
You are the agents, right?

24:37.860 --> 24:40.660
Agent Cindy Wodabaga, DEA.

24:40.660 --> 24:43.700
I'm Agent Tan Loothide, ATF.

24:43.700 --> 24:44.780
Excellent, excellent.

24:44.780 --> 24:49.580
Well, I have a delivery from your handler, if you will.

24:49.580 --> 24:50.420
Thank you.

24:50.420 --> 24:51.540
Yes.

24:51.540 --> 24:54.900
Gives you an envelope and gives you a duffel bag.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.000
Oh, sorry.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.300
I almost forgot something.

24:58.300 --> 25:02.060
He looks around back and forth,

25:02.060 --> 25:04.900
makes sure Riker's not listening or anyone else.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.220
Bubble gum tree.

25:06.220 --> 25:07.780
Nice.

25:07.780 --> 25:08.620
Bubble gum tree.

25:08.620 --> 25:10.140
Bubble gum tree.

25:10.140 --> 25:11.740
And then he turns around and just walks away.

25:11.740 --> 25:14.300
How heavy is the duffel bag that I'm carrying?

25:14.300 --> 25:15.460
Relatively heavy.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.220
It's about 20 pounds.

25:17.220 --> 25:19.180
And then you have one of those envelopes,

25:19.180 --> 25:21.300
kind of an inner office mail sort of envelope.

25:21.300 --> 25:24.860
One of those big yellow ones with like the string.

25:24.860 --> 25:26.020
Manila envelope.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.180
Vanilla envelope.

25:27.180 --> 25:28.460
Vanilla envelope.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.140
It smells like fresh vanilla.

25:30.140 --> 25:32.740
It smells like a Yankee candle, kind of.

25:32.740 --> 25:35.980
These new Limoncello La Croix envelopes

25:35.980 --> 25:38.500
are not that good in my opinion.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.340
I look at them and it's okay.

25:40.340 --> 25:42.340
And then I look at it a little more and I'm like,

25:42.340 --> 25:43.180
I don't like that.

25:43.180 --> 25:44.020
I just don't know about it.

25:44.020 --> 25:46.180
But I go ahead and open it up anyway.

25:46.180 --> 25:48.940
I also unzip the duffel bag a little bit.

25:48.940 --> 25:51.380
We like walk into the room as we do this.

25:51.380 --> 25:52.220
Sure.

25:52.220 --> 25:55.380
So in the envelope is a single piece of paper

25:55.380 --> 25:57.380
with some stuff typed out on it.

25:57.380 --> 26:00.540
And then in the bag is a bunch of liquid.

26:00.540 --> 26:03.260
Six gallons of liquid with two spray bottles.

26:03.260 --> 26:04.620
Almost the same kind of spray bottles

26:04.620 --> 26:06.180
you would use to clean with.

26:06.180 --> 26:07.700
What does the liquid look like?

26:07.700 --> 26:11.060
The liquid is basically colorless.

26:11.060 --> 26:15.420
It just looks to be slightly foamy and bubbly, transparent.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.520
Does anyone else have a high pharmacy?

26:17.520 --> 26:18.700
I have a 50.

26:18.700 --> 26:19.680
I don't know why I'm looking.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.660
I don't have any.

26:20.660 --> 26:22.260
How about you just look at the piece of paper?

26:22.260 --> 26:23.100
Yeah.

26:23.100 --> 26:23.920
In the envelope.

26:23.920 --> 26:24.760
Yeah, maybe we do that.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.160
Let's do some rolls first.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.980
Yeah, let's do some rolls first.

26:27.980 --> 26:29.320
She starts smelling them.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.600
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.700
We read the paper.

26:33.700 --> 26:34.540
Are you sure?

26:34.540 --> 26:35.880
I mean, you can just mess around with the liquids

26:35.880 --> 26:36.720
if you want.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.540
We can also go that route.

26:37.540 --> 26:38.380
Let's talk to the liquid for a while.

26:38.380 --> 26:39.480
Slap these bags real quick.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.520
Let's just start spraying each other with them.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.000
You can.

26:44.000 --> 26:44.840
Spray fight.

26:44.840 --> 26:45.660
You can.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.240
It's gonna be acid to break down a fucking body, dude.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.500
No, as Tan is like reaching into the duffel bag

26:55.220 --> 26:57.820
and about to touch one of the containers.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.620
Yeah, no, go ahead and stop doing that, please.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.140
If your stomach doesn't already hurt

27:03.140 --> 27:06.020
from being aware of what we're about to do,

27:06.980 --> 27:09.940
then I have the unfortunate pleasure to let you know that,

27:10.800 --> 27:12.980
well, you can go ahead and read Harlan.

27:12.980 --> 27:14.060
Your eyes look pretty big.

27:14.060 --> 27:16.060
Go ahead and read that note there.

27:16.060 --> 27:18.740
Okay, I read the note.

27:18.740 --> 27:20.820
Yeah, I'll read the note to you

27:20.820 --> 27:22.220
because there is no note for you to read.

27:22.220 --> 27:24.420
How is it gonna talk to David?

27:25.300 --> 27:26.140
Yeah, let me tell you what it says.

27:26.140 --> 27:29.100
And it's a memo from Derringer, typed out on a typewriter.

27:29.100 --> 27:31.420
He didn't even want this thing to hit the computer network

27:31.420 --> 27:32.820
or be saved anywhere.

27:32.820 --> 27:37.060
The tissue test came back on the muscle tissue

27:37.060 --> 27:38.960
in Billy Ray's body.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.860
And they're not really sure exactly what it is.

27:41.860 --> 27:46.860
It's some sort of matter, extraterrestrial substance

27:47.480 --> 27:50.140
that basically replaced his muscles.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.020
And they're not sure exactly how it works,

27:52.020 --> 27:54.620
but they've developed a detecting compound

27:54.620 --> 27:56.800
that they've rushed together for you.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.300
That's what's in the duffel bag.

27:58.300 --> 28:01.820
You can spray it on things.

28:01.820 --> 28:05.980
And when you spray it and it detects this matter,

28:05.980 --> 28:08.180
things will turn purple.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.380
Oh my God.

28:09.380 --> 28:12.820
We're just gonna spray every folk in this town.

28:12.820 --> 28:16.180
Yeah, Tan sprays his own arm.

28:16.180 --> 28:17.620
Oh yeah, let's spray each other

28:17.620 --> 28:19.140
and make sure we're all clean.

28:19.140 --> 28:20.320
I spray everybody.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.460
Okay.

28:23.460 --> 28:28.460
Cindy, you did your nightly routine, right?

28:28.620 --> 28:29.540
I did indeed.

28:29.540 --> 28:30.380
Last night?

28:30.380 --> 28:31.200
Yep.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.300
Your entire face turns purple.

28:33.300 --> 28:36.980
Harlan, you splashed water under your armpits

28:36.980 --> 28:38.860
and threw on a fresh polo.

28:38.860 --> 28:40.420
Your upper arms turn purple.

28:44.300 --> 28:48.860
Anyone else that had a glass of water, I believe, up front,

28:48.860 --> 28:50.080
your mouth, your lips,

28:50.080 --> 28:51.940
the inside of your mouth turns purple.

28:52.660 --> 28:53.900
Oh shit.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.340
It's all over your hands

28:55.340 --> 28:57.840
if you wash your hands after going to the bathroom.

28:57.840 --> 29:01.060
Joe, I know that you stopped washing your hands

29:01.060 --> 29:03.260
on purple hands years ago.

29:05.100 --> 29:06.820
No, I said he used the bathroom.

29:06.820 --> 29:08.160
I said he has a drink.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.040
I don't know if surely he drank some water,

29:10.040 --> 29:12.260
but we could also just have him back away in terror

29:12.260 --> 29:13.100
from all of you.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.760
It looks like they miscalculated.

29:15.760 --> 29:17.320
It's just picking up sweat.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.620
These are sweat glands, obviously.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.940
Yeah, my face is really sweaty and purple.

29:21.940 --> 29:24.380
Alien sweat glands, you son of a bitch.

29:25.260 --> 29:27.900
I need two sanity rolls right now.

29:27.900 --> 29:32.820
The first sanity roll is the fact that this stuff exists.

29:34.660 --> 29:36.720
I had a fail and a crit fail.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.660
The first one's a fail.

29:39.660 --> 29:42.940
Okay, yeah, let's do the first one first.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.760
On a fail on the first one, you're gonna take one.

29:46.940 --> 29:48.840
I failed as well. Otherwise it's zero.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.880
That's the unnatural though, so no check boxes for that.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.320
The second though, realizing it's in your body

29:54.320 --> 29:56.720
and the fact that to some extent,

29:56.720 --> 29:59.120
you have ingested something in this town,

29:59.120 --> 30:00.880
washed your hands in this town,

30:00.880 --> 30:02.520
it's basically in the water supply.

30:02.520 --> 30:04.680
You know that much so far.

30:07.020 --> 30:12.020
Okay, that's gonna be one on a success, four on a failure.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.380
And what about a crit fail?

30:16.380 --> 30:18.480
I believe that is gonna be eight, no?

30:19.360 --> 30:20.680
You can do whatever you want, dude.

30:20.680 --> 30:21.800
I like that.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.360
Think about, Tan, how you were sick

30:26.360 --> 30:30.000
at the slightest sight of anything so far, right?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.640
First, what was the, I forget the first time you puked.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.600
Was it in?

30:33.600 --> 30:35.480
It was at the office, the first video.

30:35.480 --> 30:36.560
Was it the office, right?

30:36.560 --> 30:37.400
Yeah.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.720
Yeah, it was at the office the first video

30:38.720 --> 30:40.600
and it got progressively worse

30:40.600 --> 30:43.720
when you caught the smell of that dead body.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.920
And now on your very first mission,

30:45.960 --> 30:50.960
you recognize that it's not going particularly great for you.

30:51.720 --> 30:54.800
So with taking eight sanity damage.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.760
Right, I will say obvious.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.200
Did you take one first?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.040
Or did you pass that one?

30:59.040 --> 30:59.880
I did, I took one.

30:59.880 --> 31:00.700
So you took nine total?

31:00.700 --> 31:01.540
I took nine total.

31:01.540 --> 31:02.440
Jeez Louise.

31:02.440 --> 31:07.440
I am at 37 and my breaking point is 43.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.360
Yeah.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.480
So I'm quite a bit past that.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.560
Okay, so technically- And I'm feeling good.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.740
Yeah, feeling good, nothing happens.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.900
Technically losing that five in a clip,

31:16.900 --> 31:19.180
you're gonna go temporarily insane.

31:19.180 --> 31:20.780
You can potentially suppress that

31:20.780 --> 31:23.660
by projecting that onto one of your bonds

31:23.660 --> 31:25.780
if you so choose or not.

31:25.780 --> 31:27.340
You can just go temporarily insane.

31:27.340 --> 31:28.180
It's totally up to you.

31:28.180 --> 31:30.940
Tan really likes his bonds, so he just takes it himself.

31:30.940 --> 31:33.180
Okay, all right, I'm gonna roll a die.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.820
Your temporary insanity is going to manifest

31:37.820 --> 31:40.340
in you fleeing.

31:40.520 --> 31:44.220
Realizing this, you're just going to run away

31:44.220 --> 31:47.180
from the hotel without saying much

31:47.180 --> 31:48.160
while everyone else is there

31:48.160 --> 31:50.260
also feeling pretty bad about things.

31:50.260 --> 31:51.920
You just start to run away.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.980
You will kind of come to after booking it,

31:54.980 --> 31:57.060
losing your breath and kind of turn around

31:57.060 --> 31:58.300
and be able to walk back.

31:58.300 --> 32:03.300
Tan, he chokes down some vomit and then just runs away

32:04.500 --> 32:07.260
and he runs right towards the mega deuce.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.700
You run towards the mega deuce, okay?

32:09.740 --> 32:12.340
Harlan hit a breaking point in that sanity loss also.

32:12.340 --> 32:14.380
So did Joe Dean.

32:14.380 --> 32:17.060
Well, I guess we all need to reset our breaking points.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.340
I didn't hit a breaking point,

32:18.340 --> 32:20.740
but I did lose five sanity.

32:20.740 --> 32:21.740
Okay. Oh, shit.

32:23.060 --> 32:26.400
Cindy is gonna submit, curl up,

32:26.400 --> 32:27.820
just disconnect from everyone,

32:27.820 --> 32:29.300
maybe go back into her room.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.140
Oh, yeah.

32:30.140 --> 32:32.140
Flashback to some of the crazy shit

32:32.140 --> 32:33.780
she's seen in the field.

32:33.780 --> 32:36.740
She goes to start a bath for herself

32:36.740 --> 32:38.760
and as she goes to touch the knob

32:38.760 --> 32:40.120
to turn the hot water on,

32:40.120 --> 32:43.360
she like freaks out, hits the wall behind her.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.400
And as she hits the wall behind her

32:45.400 --> 32:47.800
in this small motel bathroom,

32:47.800 --> 32:51.440
she sent into a flashback of her throwing her husband

32:51.440 --> 32:55.560
up against the wall of a small motel bathroom.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.160
And then she shakes her head

32:57.160 --> 32:58.800
and goes and lays down in the bed.

32:58.800 --> 33:03.800
Everyone else is going to have some anxiety going forward

33:05.020 --> 33:08.200
when it comes to mealtime.

33:08.680 --> 33:12.560
The thought of putting anything in your body at this point

33:12.560 --> 33:16.840
is going to be somewhat anxiety provoking,

33:16.840 --> 33:18.320
at least in the immediate term

33:18.320 --> 33:21.280
before you seek any professional help.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.520
As Tan runs towards the Megaduce,

33:23.520 --> 33:26.960
that hits him and he gets scared again

33:26.960 --> 33:29.120
and runs away from the Megaduce

33:29.120 --> 33:30.520
because there's food there.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.480
You've realized there's some substance out there

33:34.480 --> 33:37.760
that got injected into Billy Ray,

33:38.240 --> 33:40.400
presumably it's elsewhere in this town.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.800
Clearly it's in the water supply

33:43.800 --> 33:45.640
because it's on your hands, your face,

33:45.640 --> 33:47.960
your mouth, your armpits.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.640
Harlan's going to make eyes with Jodine.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.640
It's in the water supply.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.240
That makes sense now.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.080
That's what we saw.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.680
Right, shooting out of the tub.

33:59.680 --> 34:03.040
I kind of fill in Tan and Cindy.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.080
Real quick, I think that makes this the EPA's problem.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.000
Also, Tan is just like wandering

34:11.000 --> 34:12.960
around the parking lot right now.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.800
Oh right, I forgot you were gone.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.020
But it looked like mercury.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.720
But it seemed conscious.

34:21.720 --> 34:25.000
It seemed like it was moving of its own accord, right?

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
It seemed like some kind of unstoppable force to me.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.340
I don't know.

34:30.340 --> 34:31.560
I don't know if what I'd saw,

34:31.560 --> 34:34.560
I'd call consciousness as we know it.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.240
It dodged your glass.

34:38.240 --> 34:41.160
It flattened itself out to break it, right?

34:41.160 --> 34:43.400
Yeah, I guess that is pretty thoughty.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.600
Or reactive at the very least.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.200
Yeah, yeah.

34:48.200 --> 34:50.340
Hey, I don't want to eat anything from the diner.

34:50.340 --> 34:53.560
Should we get just a bunch of like little Debbie's and stuff

34:53.560 --> 34:55.640
that comes in plastic from the gas station?

34:55.640 --> 34:57.840
I want to hit the vending machine.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.200
I'm parched.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.200
The idea of not being able to drink the water here,

35:02.200 --> 35:03.040
that scares me.

35:03.980 --> 35:04.820
I need to top up.

35:04.820 --> 35:05.720
Well, let's get you a Coke.

35:05.720 --> 35:08.220
Everybody knows in 1992 that it's fat that makes you fat,

35:08.220 --> 35:09.060
not sugar.

35:15.420 --> 35:19.520
You can get some Olestra chips out of the vending machine.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.360
You can do that though.

35:20.360 --> 35:23.920
There is a vending machine right near the manager's office.

35:23.920 --> 35:27.580
Soda, little Debbie's, little Dorito bags.

35:27.580 --> 35:31.280
Harlan buys a Coke and he cracks the top on it

35:31.280 --> 35:36.280
and he downs the Coke without it getting away from his lips.

35:36.360 --> 35:39.900
And he tosses it in the trash can and buys two more.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.800
A little thirsty there?

35:41.800 --> 35:44.560
Yeah, I'm thirsty.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.160
I don't want to drink the water here.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.440
We can't drink the water here.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.880
We can't drink the water here.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.680
Yeah, I mean, that's a reasonable conclusion.

35:54.680 --> 35:57.700
Would some of this mealtime anxiety be alleviated

35:57.700 --> 36:00.000
when we do have like these prepackaged foods?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.320
Yes, yes.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.320
You feel safe enough that eating this,

36:04.320 --> 36:08.140
it's more any food that someone else prepared for you.

36:08.140 --> 36:10.120
Would be very suspicious to us.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.560
Yeah, that is not a multinational corporation

36:12.560 --> 36:16.440
trying to jack you full of low quality calories

36:16.440 --> 36:18.300
through advertisement and other things.

36:18.300 --> 36:21.360
Basically, you hate small business food providers.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.520
That's kind of what I'm getting at.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.760
No food trucks, no diners, you know.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.800
All right, yeah, I love little things.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.080
That tracks, dude.

36:28.080 --> 36:32.000
So yeah, Joe Dean gets a couple sprites for himself.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.160
He's like, yeah, maybe I will be thirsty, like Harland.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.600
And then I guess they go back with the others.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.840
Tan is in the parking lot.

36:40.840 --> 36:43.280
He ran towards the Mega Deuce

36:43.280 --> 36:46.440
and then ran away from the Mega Deuce.

36:46.440 --> 36:49.520
And he's still got like one of the spray bottles in his hand

36:49.520 --> 36:52.520
and he's just like spraying cars in the parking lot.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.160
Well, hold Tan, Tan, Tan, Tan.

36:55.160 --> 36:56.960
We don't want to go wasting that.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.240
He stops spraying cars in the parking lot.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.500
As you spray cars, there's not,

37:03.500 --> 37:05.480
nothing's really turning purple.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.460
Cindy Woodabaga walks out of her room,

37:08.460 --> 37:11.560
moves her hands toward her cardigan

37:11.560 --> 37:13.940
to kind of put her hands on her hips,

37:13.940 --> 37:17.600
which reveals the baton and pepper spray she has

37:17.600 --> 37:20.220
on either side on her belt.

37:20.220 --> 37:24.260
And then she says, Merle.

37:25.220 --> 37:28.200
So Cindy, we do need to talk to him,

37:28.200 --> 37:31.060
but you know, you were talking earlier

37:31.060 --> 37:33.020
about just taking him out.

37:33.020 --> 37:35.560
I don't think we're quite at that place yet, are we?

37:35.560 --> 37:36.580
We'll find out.

37:36.580 --> 37:39.380
So Joe Dean has brought back some snacks

37:39.380 --> 37:43.180
and he hands a candy bar to Cindy.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.300
Here, have a Snickers.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.220
You're not you when you're hungry.

37:47.220 --> 37:50.300
Hey, that's a good, they should use that.

37:50.300 --> 37:51.140
That's good.

37:51.140 --> 37:52.340
No, that's nothing.

37:52.340 --> 37:53.260
That won't ever be nothing.

37:53.260 --> 37:54.780
She takes a couple of bites

37:54.780 --> 37:57.040
and the camera whips back up to her face,

37:57.040 --> 38:00.540
which has little granny glasses on it all of a sudden.

38:04.780 --> 38:08.660
Took her down a couple notches, I think.

38:08.660 --> 38:10.820
We just left Jane in that room, right?

38:10.820 --> 38:11.660
You did.

38:11.660 --> 38:12.780
Let's give her some food.

38:12.780 --> 38:16.340
And this dude, the Delta Green, the FBI guy,

38:16.340 --> 38:19.420
he took off once he gave us the duffel bag and the...

38:19.420 --> 38:20.380
Yep.

38:20.380 --> 38:21.580
He just bounced.

38:21.580 --> 38:25.620
Woodabaga will go give some little debbies to young Jane.

38:25.620 --> 38:27.900
Young Jane takes the little debbies

38:27.900 --> 38:29.760
and just starts pounding them.

38:29.760 --> 38:34.700
Much in the same way that Agent Nash just pounded that soda,

38:34.700 --> 38:37.640
she does the same thing with the little debbies,

38:37.640 --> 38:40.740
the Doritos, the Funyuns.

38:40.740 --> 38:42.580
Whatever you put in front of her,

38:42.580 --> 38:44.740
she just houses all of it.

38:44.740 --> 38:46.860
She housed those Funyuns.

38:46.860 --> 38:47.860
Housed them.

38:47.860 --> 38:49.980
I've never heard that, but I like it.

38:49.980 --> 38:50.820
Housing?

38:51.180 --> 38:52.420
There's someone even in charge of it

38:52.420 --> 38:53.260
at a government level.

38:53.260 --> 38:54.500
You live in a house, Luke.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.340
What do you...

38:57.740 --> 38:58.740
You don't know that.

39:01.020 --> 39:03.220
I was all for going to Merle,

39:03.220 --> 39:05.060
but now that I've had the Snickers,

39:05.060 --> 39:07.060
I'm up for whatever you guys are up for.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.140
Well, we should just go to Merle,

39:08.140 --> 39:09.820
but maybe not with murderous intent.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.780
Man, it was just a baton and pepper spray.

39:11.780 --> 39:13.020
During Cindy's rant,

39:13.020 --> 39:15.080
you mentioned that Merle had been harassing people.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.340
Did we get that from somebody?

39:16.340 --> 39:20.220
That is the giant leap that Cindy Woodabaga has drawn

39:21.100 --> 39:24.300
from someone was harassing Scott Adams,

39:24.300 --> 39:27.400
and she just assumes that it's the person

39:27.400 --> 39:31.380
who has the most money at risk and at stake.

39:31.380 --> 39:33.860
So what did we hear on that recording?

39:33.860 --> 39:35.060
It didn't matter.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.180
Billy Webb and something garbled,

39:38.180 --> 39:40.900
and then What Your Duty and something garbled,

39:40.900 --> 39:41.980
and they said, talk now.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.180
It sounded like a command, talk now.

39:44.180 --> 39:47.420
They also said, I'm sorry, I'm talking like Clark.

39:47.460 --> 39:50.760
I've been John for at least an episode and a half.

39:50.760 --> 39:54.480
And that ending, it said Tone Brown.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.740
It wasn't actually Brown Tone.

39:55.740 --> 39:57.220
Do your voice though, I like your voice.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.740
It was Tone Brown.

40:00.340 --> 40:01.740
Tone Brown and Duty.

40:01.740 --> 40:03.340
Do you see how that means nothing?

40:03.340 --> 40:04.380
Well, what did you hear?

40:04.380 --> 40:06.460
We literally heard someone saying,

40:06.460 --> 40:09.780
not sure what you're dealing with, but stop now.

40:09.780 --> 40:10.620
Stop now.

40:10.620 --> 40:11.440
Yeah.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.280
Stop now.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.120
Not sure what you're dealing.

40:13.120 --> 40:13.940
Stop now, stop now.

40:13.940 --> 40:15.840
You're not sure what you're dealing with, stop now.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.600
That makes a lot more sense, doesn't it?

40:17.600 --> 40:18.660
So it does.

40:18.660 --> 40:20.120
Putting our notes together,

40:20.120 --> 40:21.940
one of the things I got was talk now.

40:21.940 --> 40:23.760
So you're hearing stop now.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.160
Yes, we probably just heard it right.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.080
Don't you think?

40:27.080 --> 40:29.320
Yeah, I mean, it's almost like we failed a role

40:29.320 --> 40:30.140
and you passed it.

40:30.140 --> 40:32.120
And I don't wanna, obviously role-playing wise,

40:32.120 --> 40:32.960
it'd be great if we just-

40:32.960 --> 40:33.800
No, I know it's hard for-

40:33.800 --> 40:35.240
I can't believe in that.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.160
But I was wondering if we could put anything together

40:37.160 --> 40:38.960
from it and really glean the truth.

40:38.960 --> 40:39.800
Yeah, sure.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.620
If you wanna try-

40:40.620 --> 40:41.460
But we do gotta keep this moving.

40:41.460 --> 40:43.680
Adult men can never admit that they're wrong.

40:46.840 --> 40:47.680
Yeah, yeah.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.120
Thank you, Cindy, you're right.

40:49.120 --> 40:50.060
We heard it right.

40:52.360 --> 40:53.920
I believe that's a mundane day.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.340
So at least two of you heard it right.

41:03.260 --> 41:04.680
Let's recap where you are now.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.240
You've already gone and questioned

41:07.240 --> 41:08.760
the mother of the missing girl,

41:08.760 --> 41:11.900
who you have found and just happens to be very pregnant.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.100
You've talked to the sheriff.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.840
You've talked to one of the aldermen.

41:14.840 --> 41:18.480
You've talked to the guy who runs the only bar

41:18.480 --> 41:20.480
with a liquor license in town.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.280
You've talked to a bunch of random kids at the reservoir.

41:23.280 --> 41:27.400
You've talked to the manager of this hotel.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.000
We've gotten a lot done.

41:29.000 --> 41:29.840
You got a lot done.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.560
You've talked to, this is only a 1200 person town

41:32.560 --> 41:35.960
and you're starting to near the double digit percentage

41:35.960 --> 41:37.360
of people interrogated.

41:38.360 --> 41:39.800
We're good cops.

41:39.800 --> 41:40.640
Yeah, we are.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.000
Yeah, you should just line the rest up

41:43.000 --> 41:44.680
and we just go down the line.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.400
And we'll parade Jane Allen in front of them.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.380
Shame.

41:51.000 --> 41:51.960
Where do you wanna go?

41:51.960 --> 41:53.020
It's an investigation.

41:53.020 --> 41:53.860
Merle.

41:53.860 --> 41:56.600
Yeah, I think that's our last big.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.020
He's the papa.

41:58.020 --> 41:58.860
You wanna go to Merle?

41:58.860 --> 42:01.680
Billy is not that child's father.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.120
Oh, you think Merle is?

42:03.120 --> 42:04.640
No, I think it's aliens.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.840
Yeah, I think it's aliens too.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.880
That does bring up an interesting question.

42:08.880 --> 42:11.940
What do we do with Jane?

42:11.940 --> 42:13.600
We have to kill her.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.680
That's literally not what I was thinking.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.040
Well, that's why you guys are friendlies

42:17.040 --> 42:18.080
and we're the agents.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.560
Okay, I was thinking maybe.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.920
She kinda puts her hands on Tanner's shoulder

42:22.920 --> 42:26.480
and is like, we have to kill her.

42:27.760 --> 42:31.000
No, we don't have to do that.

42:31.000 --> 42:31.840
Okay.

42:31.840 --> 42:32.680
What?

42:32.680 --> 42:33.500
Then what is your solution?

42:33.500 --> 42:35.960
I was thinking maybe we bring her back

42:35.960 --> 42:38.100
to her parents' house.

42:38.100 --> 42:40.800
And then how would you explain the pregnancy?

42:40.800 --> 42:43.040
We let them explain it to us.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.360
This is a real 12 Angry Men situation

42:45.360 --> 42:47.840
and we got Harlan quick.

42:47.840 --> 42:51.080
I'm still leaning towards parading her down Main Street

42:51.080 --> 42:53.160
and seeing who gets pissed off about it.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.480
Your two options are taking her back to her loving parents

42:55.480 --> 42:57.540
or publicly humiliating her,

42:57.540 --> 42:59.560
but never killing her and the aliens

42:59.560 --> 43:00.660
spawn inside of her.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.840
I don't wanna kill her,

43:01.840 --> 43:04.480
but she's got an alien baby in her,

43:04.480 --> 43:06.360
which basically makes her an alien.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.340
So I don't know if she can feel human emotions.

43:08.340 --> 43:10.660
So who cares if we parade her downtown?

43:10.660 --> 43:12.480
I just think the optics are bad.

43:12.720 --> 43:13.560
I don't think we can-

43:13.560 --> 43:15.400
Yeah, use that same mindset.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.480
But what we can say is that we're gonna do it

43:17.480 --> 43:18.960
and then let everybody line up.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.440
Here's the deal, the optics don't matter

43:20.440 --> 43:22.480
because we're not supposed to even be here.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.720
So nobody's gonna hear.

43:23.720 --> 43:25.720
What, no, just because, no.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.160
Agent Dean, would you like to pull rank?

43:28.160 --> 43:31.960
All I'm saying is I suggested that you told me not to.

43:31.960 --> 43:34.240
I have accepted that we're not gonna do that.

43:34.240 --> 43:37.960
So what, I mean, what, we leave her in the hotel.

43:37.960 --> 43:40.720
I say drop her with me and see.

43:40.720 --> 43:41.560
That's what we're saying.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.240
I say drop her with Nancy.

43:44.320 --> 43:48.480
What if we use our car phone to call our handler

43:48.480 --> 43:49.840
and see what he advises?

43:49.840 --> 43:52.240
He said not to call him.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.080
Oh, I thought he said,

43:53.080 --> 43:55.040
do call me if you have any trouble.

43:55.040 --> 43:55.880
Cause it wouldn't be handy-

43:55.880 --> 43:58.200
He said they would only use a courier.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.200
We should have talked to him.

43:59.200 --> 44:02.240
We should have sent a message to him.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.080
Wait!

44:04.080 --> 44:05.280
He's like, so gone.

44:06.800 --> 44:09.220
We hop in the Bronco and tear off after him.

44:11.600 --> 44:12.440
No.

44:15.960 --> 44:19.400
She was fine in there for the last day, right?

44:19.400 --> 44:21.020
What if we threw in some snack foods

44:21.020 --> 44:21.960
and figured this out later?

44:21.960 --> 44:25.280
She is going to punch someone's head off.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.400
No, I don't think she is.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.480
She doesn't seem to have the muscle stuff going on.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.280
She's just got the alien baby.

44:30.280 --> 44:35.000
That thing is going to put itself in someone's head

44:35.000 --> 44:38.640
if what you told me was true happened in that bathroom.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.680
And then that thing is going to kill someone.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.240
You know, I'm not going to disagree with you there.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.440
That does seem, yeah.

44:44.440 --> 44:48.520
We have to stamp it out at the root.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.880
Oh, I don't like Delta Green.

44:49.880 --> 44:52.160
I refuse to be a part of this.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.480
I refuse to be part of this.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.480
I'll talk to Merle all day long,

44:56.480 --> 44:58.040
but I'm not killing,

44:58.040 --> 45:00.420
even if it's an alien, I'm not killing the baby.

45:00.420 --> 45:01.880
You don't have to.

45:01.880 --> 45:02.860
That's what I'm saying.

45:02.860 --> 45:03.700
I'm not going to.

45:03.700 --> 45:04.920
Go home.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.040
I'm going to go talk to Merle.

45:06.040 --> 45:09.920
You, Tanner leaves the room

45:09.920 --> 45:13.960
and just like sits down on the sidewalk outside the motel

45:13.960 --> 45:15.420
and it's like fucked up.

45:15.420 --> 45:18.280
Jodine follows him out and sits down next to him.

45:18.280 --> 45:21.200
And he lights a cigarette and offers it to Tanner.

45:21.200 --> 45:25.660
Tanner accepts and also pulls out his own pack of cigarettes

45:25.660 --> 45:26.840
and lights one up.

45:26.840 --> 45:28.000
What's your brand?

45:28.000 --> 45:29.660
He smokes Palmalls.

45:29.660 --> 45:31.120
Yeah, me too.

45:31.120 --> 45:35.040
Yeah, Palmall extra, extra red long

45:35.040 --> 45:36.720
for seven teams.

45:36.720 --> 45:37.800
Oh my God.

45:37.800 --> 45:41.680
So Jodine takes a real deep sigh

45:41.680 --> 45:43.720
and then a deep drag on the cigarette.

45:43.720 --> 45:44.560
And he says,

45:45.460 --> 45:48.360
I've had this moment too.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.480
Well, in what sense?

45:51.480 --> 45:52.800
Something real similar happened

45:52.800 --> 45:55.120
on my first time as a friendly.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.740
I'm not having a good time.

45:56.740 --> 45:58.160
It's not a good time.

45:58.160 --> 45:59.200
Nobody said it would be.

45:59.200 --> 46:00.680
Do you want to kill that girl?

46:00.680 --> 46:01.840
Do you want to kill that baby?

46:01.840 --> 46:04.200
I don't want to kill that baby, but we have to.

46:05.400 --> 46:10.100
Tanner, what's inside that girl's belly

46:10.100 --> 46:12.440
is a danger to the entire world.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.320
Our participation in this organization

46:15.320 --> 46:17.760
is kind of precipitated on that understanding.

46:17.760 --> 46:19.520
Tanner is literally just like frowning

46:19.520 --> 46:21.360
and like dry crying.

46:21.360 --> 46:24.960
And not only does she have to die at Tanner,

46:24.960 --> 46:29.960
but if you don't get along with that picture,

46:30.120 --> 46:31.720
Cindy's gonna kill you too.

46:31.720 --> 46:32.560
What?

46:33.480 --> 46:35.220
Cindy's gonna kill me?

46:36.400 --> 46:38.100
She's nice though.

46:38.100 --> 46:40.100
We have tattoos together.

46:40.100 --> 46:41.600
Cindy's not nice.

46:41.600 --> 46:43.160
I'm not gonna do it.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.880
I won't stop you from doing it, but I'm not gonna do it.

46:45.880 --> 46:47.580
That's all we're saying.

46:47.580 --> 46:48.420
Oh, actually, yeah.

46:48.420 --> 46:49.720
You know, you are the youngest rookie.

46:49.720 --> 46:53.140
So you do have, sorry, I forgot the Delta green haze.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.680
You actually do have to kill this alien baby.

46:57.680 --> 46:59.840
There are rules in place, yeah.

46:59.840 --> 47:01.800
So when you guys look up from this conversation,

47:01.800 --> 47:04.880
you see, hopefully, as long as it's cool with you, David,

47:04.880 --> 47:09.700
Cindy walking this girl, Jane Allen, huddled over.

47:09.700 --> 47:13.060
She's got a couple cardigans on this girl,

47:13.060 --> 47:16.020
maybe even the comforter off the motel bed

47:16.020 --> 47:17.280
wrapped around her.

47:17.280 --> 47:21.400
And she's gonna walk her out to the Bronco.

47:21.400 --> 47:24.240
Wait, what about,

47:24.240 --> 47:26.720
and it goes against my Christian faith to say this,

47:26.720 --> 47:30.320
but what about an alien abortion?

47:30.320 --> 47:35.320
I think that it would look really cool

47:36.080 --> 47:39.040
in one of those hardcore metal fonts

47:39.040 --> 47:42.120
where you can't really read what it says.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.280
Yeah, it would be.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.760
We were talking junkie graveyard.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.920
It's junkie graveyard, alien abortion.

47:46.920 --> 47:48.880
These are good things.

47:48.880 --> 47:50.360
Good name.

47:50.360 --> 47:55.240
No, but surely there's a crooked doctor around here,

47:55.240 --> 47:59.480
a midwife who, I mean, look, these, I had a baby.

47:59.480 --> 48:01.680
Does that mean you know how to?

48:01.680 --> 48:04.240
We're in some dangerous territory right here.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.560
This doesn't feel like it was already iffy

48:06.560 --> 48:08.920
when we were killing somebody.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.920
Okay, hold on, hold on.

48:10.920 --> 48:15.520
I know, but you're really like, let's just kill her

48:16.480 --> 48:18.440
instead of trying to save her life at all.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.600
I think that's kind of a Delta Green thing,

48:20.600 --> 48:21.760
isn't it, to cover up?

48:21.760 --> 48:22.840
We gotta cover it, dude.

48:22.840 --> 48:25.680
Okay, but then you can't call the episode alien abortion.

48:26.680 --> 48:30.960
Tan is having like a serious-

48:30.960 --> 48:32.360
I can.

48:32.360 --> 48:35.120
I can call the episode whatever I want, Thomas.

48:37.440 --> 48:40.360
Tan is having like a serious like mental breakdown.

48:40.360 --> 48:43.880
When he sees Cindy Woodabaga walking Jane out,

48:43.880 --> 48:48.880
he's like crying and he pulls the 44 off his hip

48:49.320 --> 48:53.480
and like looks at Joe and like aims it at Jane

48:53.480 --> 48:57.280
and is like looking for some sort of approval.

48:57.280 --> 48:59.880
Yeah, Joe lowers your hand.

48:59.880 --> 49:02.680
I don't trust you not to wing Woodabaga

49:02.680 --> 49:04.820
and then she would kill you.

49:04.820 --> 49:07.880
Yeah, Tan breaks down once again and just starts crying.

49:07.880 --> 49:10.880
You just seem a little shaky in your gun hand right now.

49:10.880 --> 49:12.400
Cindy will get behind the wheel of the car.

49:12.400 --> 49:16.640
This whole time, Harlan has been kinda solemn into himself,

49:16.640 --> 49:20.300
but he is definitely walking toward the Bronco

49:20.300 --> 49:21.440
with no objection.

49:21.440 --> 49:24.640
Kid, why don't you and I go talk to Merle?

49:24.640 --> 49:27.760
We'll take the DEA, the DEA cruiser.

49:30.360 --> 49:31.400
Yeah.

49:31.400 --> 49:34.200
We go out to the middle of a field,

49:34.200 --> 49:37.300
outside of town where there's no one in sight.

49:38.620 --> 49:40.760
And her water breaks and you have to-

49:40.760 --> 49:44.480
You have to deliver the squid, baby.

49:44.480 --> 49:46.720
It's minute black, it's minute black.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.580
I'm not gonna make you roll on that.

49:49.580 --> 49:51.260
Can we just do the thing and they do a movie

49:52.100 --> 49:54.020
sometimes where it's now a shot at the top of trees

49:54.020 --> 49:56.940
and there's the birds fly off, a bunch of birds fly.

49:58.460 --> 49:59.860
Sure, yes.

49:59.860 --> 50:02.240
Just the crack in the distance.

50:02.240 --> 50:06.380
And then it cuts abruptly to the two of you at town hall,

50:06.380 --> 50:09.940
rolling up in that sick DEA cruiser,

50:09.940 --> 50:14.180
the self-driving Knight Rider DEA cruiser.

50:14.180 --> 50:15.980
You've not been using that functionality

50:15.980 --> 50:16.860
for whatever reason.

50:16.860 --> 50:20.180
You have arrived at city hall.

50:20.180 --> 50:21.020
Thank you, CopNet.

50:21.620 --> 50:24.220
Does this have that brand new CopNet feature in it?

50:24.220 --> 50:26.540
Yeah, I think it does, but really the main,

50:26.540 --> 50:29.340
the shining beauty of this particular model

50:29.340 --> 50:31.060
is the garphone.

50:31.060 --> 50:32.140
Hey, have you eaten anything?

50:32.140 --> 50:32.980
Are you hungry?

50:32.980 --> 50:34.660
I was gonna go to the mecaduce,

50:34.660 --> 50:37.540
but it scared me to even think about doing that.

50:37.540 --> 50:39.220
I hand him a couple of moon pies.

50:39.220 --> 50:42.340
I eat both of them very quickly.

50:42.340 --> 50:43.160
Great.

50:43.160 --> 50:46.140
And then I look at myself in like the mirror

50:46.140 --> 50:49.100
and see is there like still purple around my mouth?

50:49.100 --> 50:50.940
You could have wiped it off if you wanted to

50:51.820 --> 50:52.660
or you can just walk around with that.

50:52.660 --> 50:55.660
There is still purple around my mouth and I wipe it off.

50:55.660 --> 50:56.620
And I guess theoretically,

50:56.620 --> 50:58.660
as your tears were streaming down earlier,

50:58.660 --> 50:59.620
as you were crying,

50:59.620 --> 51:03.380
I've got like contact purple like streaks down my face.

51:03.380 --> 51:05.660
A purple rain, if you will, down your face.

51:06.540 --> 51:08.340
30 seconds of silence for Prince.

51:10.940 --> 51:12.220
Fingerprints.

51:12.220 --> 51:13.220
I barely knew him.

51:14.520 --> 51:15.360
I'm surprised.

51:15.360 --> 51:20.360
I'm surprised you didn't do any of that with Ryker yet.

51:21.700 --> 51:26.700
Tan wipes the purple off his face and just looks over at Joe

51:28.340 --> 51:31.420
and well, should we?

51:31.420 --> 51:33.480
No, I kind of just wanted you to calm down.

51:33.480 --> 51:36.260
I don't think their business is gonna take too long.

51:36.260 --> 51:39.140
Why don't you eat another moon pie

51:39.140 --> 51:41.540
and we'll wait for them to roll back into town.

51:41.540 --> 51:43.660
After eating two moon pies,

51:43.660 --> 51:46.620
he takes a third one and just like eats the marshmallow

51:46.620 --> 51:50.460
out of the middle and then contently sits there.

51:50.820 --> 51:53.380
You're gonna wait until they finish their business

51:53.380 --> 51:55.260
out of town and presumably meet you there?

51:55.260 --> 51:58.020
As soon as he eats the marshmallow out of the middle,

51:58.020 --> 52:01.540
they hear a very distant faint gunshot.

52:04.020 --> 52:05.660
Okay, they catch up to you.

52:05.660 --> 52:06.980
You wait long enough,

52:06.980 --> 52:10.220
a Ford Bronco comes speeding into town.

52:10.220 --> 52:14.940
Cindy has dirt all over her cardigans.

52:14.940 --> 52:18.180
Yeah, Harland's not as disheveled.

52:18.180 --> 52:20.420
He's obviously tried to clean himself up a little bit

52:20.420 --> 52:21.260
before getting here.

52:21.260 --> 52:24.660
You see some really like dirty shovels in the back.

52:24.660 --> 52:26.820
Joe takes Cindy aside.

52:26.820 --> 52:28.620
How did Harland do?

52:28.620 --> 52:29.560
He did great.

52:29.560 --> 52:32.100
You eliminated Jane and the Vector.

52:32.100 --> 52:35.500
Vector one down, 1,199 to go.

52:37.260 --> 52:38.960
All right, well, the kid calmed down.

52:38.960 --> 52:40.300
He's doing all right,

52:40.300 --> 52:42.460
but we're gonna have to keep an eye on him.

52:42.460 --> 52:45.220
All right, well, let's get going on to Merle's.

52:45.220 --> 52:47.020
When you go back to the car,

52:47.020 --> 52:49.560
you find Tan just like cleaning,

52:49.560 --> 52:52.660
like taking apart and cleaning his 44.

52:52.660 --> 52:53.900
He's prepared himself.

52:53.900 --> 52:56.540
Should we go to his house or to his office?

52:56.540 --> 52:58.500
Well, they said the aldermen never leave work.

52:58.500 --> 53:00.420
Oh, he's an aldermen, that's right.

53:00.420 --> 53:02.380
And that's where you met us.

53:02.380 --> 53:04.060
So I get out of the car

53:04.060 --> 53:06.100
and I go ring the doorbell of City Hall.

53:07.100 --> 53:12.100
Where we are greeted by, what was her name?

53:12.120 --> 53:13.020
Jennifer Kahn.

53:13.020 --> 53:15.380
Jennifer Kahn.

53:15.380 --> 53:16.220
Got it.

53:17.100 --> 53:19.020
Yep, she's there at the front desk.

53:19.020 --> 53:19.860
Just chilling.

53:19.860 --> 53:22.140
I go pee real quick just in case, you know.

53:22.140 --> 53:24.340
Hey, there's a bathroom right there.

53:24.340 --> 53:25.300
Yes, just in case.

53:25.300 --> 53:27.700
You are more than welcome to go to the bathroom.

53:27.700 --> 53:28.540
And there's still a water.

53:28.540 --> 53:30.420
Should I role play this out?

53:30.420 --> 53:31.700
He walks into the bathroom.

53:31.700 --> 53:32.980
Do you wash your hands?

53:34.180 --> 53:35.140
He does not.

53:35.140 --> 53:37.500
In for a penny, in for a pound.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.780
In fairness, he didn't wash his hands

53:39.780 --> 53:41.300
the first time you were in town hall

53:41.300 --> 53:44.000
and then you shook hands with Bradley Allen

53:44.000 --> 53:47.280
and it was wet and then you tried to lie.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.560
It was horrible.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.800
And he saw right through it.

53:49.800 --> 53:52.100
Cindy loved that so much.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.680
So everyone at this point is assuming

53:55.680 --> 53:56.720
you didn't wash your hands.

53:56.720 --> 53:59.160
So, you know, the aspect of the role play

53:59.160 --> 54:01.400
is strictly if you want to make peace with the fact

54:01.400 --> 54:03.560
that maybe you should start washing your hands

54:03.560 --> 54:05.680
now that you have this stuff all over you.

54:05.680 --> 54:09.080
He thinks about it, but then he just like

54:09.080 --> 54:11.800
imagines purple flowing out of the sink

54:11.800 --> 54:13.280
and he's like, no.

54:13.400 --> 54:14.880
While you guys are waiting for him

54:14.880 --> 54:15.800
to get back from the bathroom,

54:15.800 --> 54:18.200
you look over and Harlan is gulping down

54:18.200 --> 54:19.360
from the water fountain.

54:23.200 --> 54:24.040
Harlan.

54:24.040 --> 54:25.520
Harlan, Harlan, bud, bud, hey.

54:25.520 --> 54:26.360
Oh, shit.

54:26.360 --> 54:27.200
Oh, damn it.

54:27.200 --> 54:28.560
Oh, and he starts wiping his mouth.

54:28.560 --> 54:30.520
Sorry, I forgot.

54:30.520 --> 54:31.360
Fuck.

54:31.360 --> 54:32.360
Here, have another Coke.

54:33.480 --> 54:34.320
Yeah.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.640
Did you like Pavlov-ing him?

54:37.080 --> 54:39.280
Gentlemen, the receptionist sees you.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.680
Merle, Merle, we need Merle.

54:41.720 --> 54:43.480
Let me, let me go get him.

54:43.480 --> 54:46.160
Is there like a directory,

54:46.160 --> 54:49.200
like a map directory thing on the wall anywhere?

54:49.200 --> 54:51.000
All their offices are downstairs.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.800
So you, if you remember,

54:52.800 --> 54:55.760
you're going between the offices to see, you know,

54:55.760 --> 54:57.680
which one had the evasive answers,

54:57.680 --> 55:00.080
which one had the direct answers.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.600
Those are all downstairs.

55:01.600 --> 55:03.560
And there's actually one for each of the aldermen

55:03.560 --> 55:05.280
that were mentioned kind of in that note.

55:05.280 --> 55:07.800
So Merle has one, Bradley Allen.

55:07.800 --> 55:10.160
So Jane's father had another,

55:10.160 --> 55:12.880
that was the room you were in where he used his computer.

55:12.880 --> 55:14.800
So that's one hallway downstairs.

55:14.800 --> 55:18.400
Upstairs is like the conference room,

55:18.400 --> 55:21.480
the big boardroom where all of like the aldermen

55:21.480 --> 55:23.400
kind of bigger meetings happen.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.480
And then kind of the other side of town hall

55:25.480 --> 55:28.280
are the municipal things like the county court

55:28.280 --> 55:29.400
and things like that.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.880
Cindy pushes past Jennifer Kahn and says,

55:31.880 --> 55:33.840
we know the way, sweetie, it's okay.

55:33.840 --> 55:36.200
No, no, please don't.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.200
No, no, no.

55:37.200 --> 55:39.320
We actually like to talk to all the aldermen.

55:39.360 --> 55:40.520
I know they're very busy.

55:40.520 --> 55:42.680
It seems like they almost do nothing but work,

55:42.680 --> 55:44.520
but we should have to take a moment of their time.

55:44.520 --> 55:47.160
Do you guys wanna all flash our badges at the same time?

55:47.160 --> 55:48.000
Yeah.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.840
And we all flash our badges at the same time.

55:49.840 --> 55:50.680
Flip, flip.

55:50.680 --> 55:51.520
US Marshall.

55:51.520 --> 55:52.360
I-T-A.

55:52.360 --> 55:53.200
The E-A.

55:53.200 --> 55:56.200
And what bureau are you with, remind us?

55:56.200 --> 55:59.800
Oh, was that the, that was the county of Grover?

55:59.800 --> 56:02.200
You're not in a bureau, that's right.

56:02.200 --> 56:04.720
Okay, well, Cindy, lead the way.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.600
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

56:06.600 --> 56:08.600
I'm gonna have to ask you to not.

56:08.640 --> 56:10.200
All right, thank you.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.000
Just to freak her out a little bit,

56:12.000 --> 56:15.300
he remembers the name of the color of lipstick

56:15.300 --> 56:17.320
that he found in her purse.

56:17.320 --> 56:20.840
And he's like, oh, yeah.

56:20.840 --> 56:22.720
That's so fucking creepy.

56:22.720 --> 56:26.040
Coral reef looks real good on you.

56:28.560 --> 56:30.240
And she just gets really, really quiet.

56:30.240 --> 56:31.520
And we turn and walk.

56:31.520 --> 56:33.120
And your arm too, right?

56:33.120 --> 56:34.120
We have arms.

56:34.120 --> 56:35.040
You're also, you're-

56:35.040 --> 56:35.880
Two of them.

56:36.880 --> 56:40.360
In my hand, I have my Magnum 40.

56:40.360 --> 56:44.060
Oh my God, so much worse now.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.080
That you demon put away

56:46.080 --> 56:47.760
while you're going to the bathroom.

56:47.760 --> 56:49.280
He's just kind of like,

56:49.280 --> 56:52.880
he's like scratching his temple with like the muzzle.

56:52.880 --> 56:55.480
And he's like, wow, Coral looks real good on you.

56:55.480 --> 56:57.080
Oh, I hate it.

56:57.080 --> 57:00.560
A little drip of piss falls off the barrel of the gun.

57:00.560 --> 57:03.440
Jesus Christ.

57:03.440 --> 57:05.640
Because you pissed in the barrel?

57:06.240 --> 57:07.680
I was holding the gun while I pissed

57:07.680 --> 57:09.840
and it just got a little bit on there.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.200
Oh, we've all been there.

57:12.880 --> 57:15.480
Plaques, go embarrass yourself before this is over.

57:16.680 --> 57:19.360
So you sufficiently freak her out.

57:19.360 --> 57:21.920
She stops in her tracks silently.

57:21.920 --> 57:24.760
Why don't you lead the way, Ms. Khan?

57:24.760 --> 57:25.600
I thought we were gonna-

57:25.600 --> 57:26.920
I said we knew where we were going.

57:26.920 --> 57:28.800
Yeah, we're going to Merle's office.

57:28.800 --> 57:30.360
Cindy.

57:30.360 --> 57:31.200
Are we going to Merle's office?

57:31.200 --> 57:32.760
I just feel like she's kind of on his end.

57:32.760 --> 57:34.440
They're all upstairs.

57:34.680 --> 57:35.920
The offices are all empty.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.160
They all seem to be upstairs.

57:37.160 --> 57:39.600
Just like last night, if you remember.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.840
Bradley Allen came down from that room

57:41.840 --> 57:43.480
and based on what she said here,

57:43.480 --> 57:45.240
she's saying like they're upstairs.

57:45.240 --> 57:46.080
Yeah, we go upstairs.

57:46.080 --> 57:47.440
Yeah, we go upstairs.

57:47.440 --> 57:48.440
Okay.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.560
You get to the conference room.

57:50.560 --> 57:53.140
It's double doors, double wooden doors,

57:53.140 --> 57:56.560
labeled Aldermen Conference Room.

57:56.560 --> 57:57.720
Pretty straightforward.

57:57.720 --> 57:59.320
Hello, Aldermans.

57:59.320 --> 58:00.440
Should we knock?

58:00.440 --> 58:02.360
No, the door's open, we walk in.

58:03.200 --> 58:05.240
Okay.

58:05.240 --> 58:06.400
You walk in and you see a couple.

58:06.400 --> 58:07.400
And I knock anyway.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.400
You knock as you walk in.

58:10.400 --> 58:11.240
It's polite.

58:11.240 --> 58:13.240
Yeah, and I ring the doorbell and ring, ring.

58:13.240 --> 58:16.540
It is polite to call ahead, in particular,

58:16.540 --> 58:18.600
when you're ambushing a bunch of Aldermen.

58:19.760 --> 58:21.200
Especially in this instance,

58:21.200 --> 58:23.380
because as you open the door,

58:23.380 --> 58:26.000
you notice presumably what the conference table was

58:26.000 --> 58:28.720
in the middle of the room has been hacked into pieces.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.400
And those pieces have been put up,

58:30.440 --> 58:32.600
basically boarding up the walls.

58:32.600 --> 58:35.080
All the bookshelves are turned over.

58:35.080 --> 58:38.480
The bookshelves are also used to block the windows.

58:38.480 --> 58:41.880
There's very little light coming into this room.

58:41.880 --> 58:43.160
And in the center of the room,

58:43.160 --> 58:48.120
occupying almost half the floor is a big pile of goo.

58:49.200 --> 58:52.920
And that big pile of goo has about eight bodies

58:52.920 --> 58:54.720
extending out of it.

58:54.720 --> 58:58.220
You see legs kind of coming out of the bottom,

58:58.220 --> 59:00.900
some arms, a few heads.

59:00.900 --> 59:03.580
They look like suited humans,

59:03.580 --> 59:06.180
just stuck in this pile of goo.

59:06.180 --> 59:08.260
And this is a metallic goo,

59:08.260 --> 59:12.300
very similar to the stuff from the water supply.

59:12.300 --> 59:13.680
And outside of that,

59:13.680 --> 59:15.780
the only other thing you see in this room

59:15.780 --> 59:18.080
is a very high-tech looking computer,

59:19.460 --> 59:21.580
up against the wall, plugged in,

59:21.580 --> 59:24.180
and also wired into the internet,

59:24.180 --> 59:27.240
in a giant pile of metallic goo.

59:28.220 --> 59:31.740
Uh, excuse me, Aldermen,

59:31.740 --> 59:33.040
could we interrupt your meeting

59:33.040 --> 59:34.540
to ask you a few questions?

59:34.540 --> 59:39.540
I gotta work in the morning,

59:50.340 --> 59:53.240
and this shit's so important,

59:53.240 --> 59:55.840
so I can't get high.

59:55.840 --> 59:57.300
Can't get high.

59:57.300 --> 59:59.560
No, I can't get high.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.900
Can't get high.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:06.900
I thought this stuff helped anxiety.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.900
It must be something inside of me.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:13.900
Does anybody know why?

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:17.900
I can't get high.
