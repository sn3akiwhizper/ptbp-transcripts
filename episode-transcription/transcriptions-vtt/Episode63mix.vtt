00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Garbage in the morning, garbage in the evening, garbage at suppertime.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.800
When garbage is on a bagel, you can eat garbage anytime.

00:09.800 --> 00:16.720
Welcome my trash bags, it's your dumpster diving daddy, Wolf the dog, and we are broadcasting

00:16.720 --> 00:21.240
live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:21.240 --> 00:26.480
And I am here to eat y'all, because that's just what I do.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.920
Feast on dumpster meats.

00:28.920 --> 00:33.440
Heck, it ain't even gotta have meat in it for me to chow down.

00:33.440 --> 00:38.920
You ever had a waffle that's been soaking in that sinful syrup that collects in the

00:38.920 --> 00:42.560
bottom of an industrial trash compactor?

00:42.560 --> 00:46.040
Five star yelp review every time, baby.

00:46.040 --> 00:52.760
Speaking of hot syrupy trash, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Anissa, aka

00:52.760 --> 01:00.240
ripsawunderdashunicorn, who tweeted about this show and tagged at Pretendin' Pod.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.400
They write, Dear Wolf,

01:02.400 --> 01:08.760
The other day I drove by a steakhouse and saw a crow dipping the french fry in the dumpster

01:08.760 --> 01:09.760
juices.

01:09.760 --> 01:15.080
I couldn't help but think of you, a true creature of culinary sophistication.

01:15.080 --> 01:19.640
Also, I'd like to give my best buddy Mandy a shoutout.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.280
Keep on kickin' ass.

01:21.280 --> 01:27.200
Ah, yes, the finest gourmands, my flyin' rat friends.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.440
Fried roots dipped in a dumpster au jus.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.040
I'll have what he's havin'.

01:33.040 --> 01:38.880
I remember my first serving of that at the Outback Steakhouse, which was just a dumpster

01:38.880 --> 01:41.160
outback of a steakhouse.

01:41.160 --> 01:46.680
I also love the bloomin' onion, which is just when an onion has been sittin' around for

01:46.680 --> 01:50.160
way too long and gets real nasty.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.520
Wolf the dog kinda nasty.

01:54.520 --> 02:00.440
You wanna send your old Wolfie or your best buddy Mandy a message here on 694.2?

02:00.440 --> 02:03.720
Talk about pretending to be people on the internet.

02:03.720 --> 02:10.680
At Pretendin' Pod on Instagram and Twitter, a 5-star review on iTunes also totally works.

02:10.680 --> 02:15.020
If you wanna support the show, but you can't stand the thought of other people finding

02:15.020 --> 02:17.240
out you love this trash.

02:17.240 --> 02:22.520
We'll keep your secret over at patreon.com slash pretendin' pod.

02:22.520 --> 02:29.040
When fake cops in city blues with a few screws loose choose to snooze on clues, I can both

02:29.040 --> 02:31.200
amuse and accuse.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.120
It's the news.

02:33.120 --> 02:38.800
Leon's got the numbers in him, and he is dead set on tearin' up the dance floor.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.840
This gave the gang plenty of time to look over everything on the laptop.

02:42.840 --> 02:49.320
Instead, they read a few screenshots that were saved on the desktop and called it good.

02:49.320 --> 02:54.360
The two videos also saved on the desktop, one of which showing a thumbnail of Harriet

02:54.360 --> 02:57.360
Marks, the student who seemingly caused all this?

02:57.360 --> 03:01.640
Nah, they good, no thanks, no need to watch those.

03:01.640 --> 03:05.640
Too busy textin' the same person from two different phones.

03:05.640 --> 03:11.940
Now don't get me wrong, I love these fuckin' dumb-dumbs, but sometimes you just have to

03:11.940 --> 03:17.820
take a deep breath and focus on kudzu with no backbone.

03:41.940 --> 03:49.100
But, like, doesn't that depend on the family member?

03:49.100 --> 03:53.300
Do you have no one in your family, no cousin, like, who's younger than you or something?

03:53.300 --> 03:55.380
Or you could be like, yeah, bukkake, this is what I'm-

03:55.380 --> 03:58.180
Thomas is always trying to get the younger generations hooked on bukkake.

03:58.180 --> 04:04.100
No, no, I'm trying, I'm, uh, opposite, I'm steering them away from bukkake.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.940
If they know what it is, they'll know how to not see it.

04:06.940 --> 04:08.940
I've been burned in the past.

04:08.940 --> 04:12.940
All of my younger cousins are, like, six years old.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.940
Oh, fuck.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.940
Jesus Christ.

04:16.940 --> 04:21.940
So in fact, they grew up in a bad area, so yes.

04:21.940 --> 04:24.940
Are you the youngest, like, youngest period?

04:24.940 --> 04:26.940
That is how it happens, Justin.

04:26.940 --> 04:29.940
Other than me, my sister is the youngest over-

04:29.940 --> 04:31.940
What did you say when your sister said, Luke, what is bukkake?

04:31.940 --> 04:35.940
Well, my sister knows what bukkake is.

04:35.940 --> 04:37.940
Yeah, she does.

04:39.940 --> 04:45.940
Literally, before the sentence even left my mouth, I'm like, oh, goddammit.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.940
Do you care to elaborate on that sentence that came out of your mouth?

04:48.940 --> 04:52.940
One time on this podcast, I said, call my mama bitch, so I understand.

04:52.940 --> 04:56.940
And I kept it, just like I'm keeping all of this.

04:56.940 --> 04:59.940
Well, good thing my sister doesn't listen to this shit.

04:59.940 --> 05:04.940
But we can say hello to Luke's dad, who is up to episode 14 as of recording.

05:04.940 --> 05:06.940
18, I think, right?

05:06.940 --> 05:14.940
Well, yeah, 18, because his theory was that the little girl that died in the fiery car crash was Contingent's savior.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.940
Well said.

05:16.940 --> 05:18.940
Which I thought should be canon.

05:18.940 --> 05:22.940
Yeah, absolutely. But if you make it this far, welcome-

05:23.940 --> 05:25.940
To the lab!

05:26.940 --> 05:30.940
Before we start this episode, I think we should talk out of character.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.940
Luke, say what you said again about bukkake.

05:33.940 --> 05:36.940
I think that it's really helped my skin out.

05:41.940 --> 05:42.940
It would, right?

05:42.940 --> 05:44.940
I haven't had acne in a long time.

05:45.940 --> 05:48.940
Also, I make some extra money on the side, so it's kind of win-win.

05:48.940 --> 05:49.940
Gotta buy a lot of towels.

05:49.940 --> 05:50.940
Because people cum on my face.

05:50.940 --> 05:52.940
Okay, yeah, there it is.

05:54.940 --> 05:56.940
And they pay you for that, seemingly.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.940
Well, I mean, we make royalty money.

05:59.940 --> 06:02.940
Like, from the king and queen, or Prince Andrew specifically?

06:02.940 --> 06:05.940
No, the king of queens.

06:07.940 --> 06:09.940
Hey, Kevin can wait. I just want to think that we should all-

06:09.940 --> 06:10.940
Kevin can wait.

06:10.940 --> 06:11.940
Leah Remini?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.940
Alright, so if we could all go clear for a second here.

06:14.940 --> 06:15.940
She was the real boss on that show.

06:15.940 --> 06:16.940
I got the joke, it was good.

06:16.940 --> 06:17.940
Thank you.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.940
Let's talk out of character about what's happening.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.940
I don't really, honestly, know.

06:22.940 --> 06:23.940
Same.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.940
I know, people, and it-

06:25.940 --> 06:28.940
It feels like deliberately I know what's going on.

06:28.940 --> 06:29.940
Let's take that again.

06:29.940 --> 06:32.940
No, no, no, it feels deliberately humiliating when Zach was like,

06:32.940 --> 06:34.940
yeah, listeners know what's going on.

06:34.940 --> 06:35.940
That was a little deliberate.

06:35.940 --> 06:38.940
And I feel bad, over the past week, obviously,

06:38.940 --> 06:40.940
I've felt pretty bad about doing that.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.940
So this time, I'm just going to say-

06:42.940 --> 06:44.940
That you made it all up and no one knows what's going on?

06:44.940 --> 06:45.940
Not even you?

06:45.940 --> 06:46.940
I know that you-

06:48.940 --> 06:49.940
I know you just make it up.

06:49.940 --> 06:53.940
No, those people who came into the studio last week,

06:53.940 --> 06:54.940
they weren't real.

06:54.940 --> 06:56.940
I know, I played one.

06:56.940 --> 06:57.940
Wait, what?

06:57.940 --> 07:00.940
Afterwards, Joe totally conned one.

07:00.940 --> 07:03.940
He was like, hey, if you give me $50,

07:03.940 --> 07:05.940
I'll give you $200 in three weeks.

07:05.940 --> 07:07.940
Oh, those people.

07:07.940 --> 07:09.940
There was that one guy that talked like an old man,

07:09.940 --> 07:11.940
but he didn't look that old?

07:11.940 --> 07:12.940
There you go, you got me.

07:12.940 --> 07:14.940
Yeah, that was the one that you played.

07:14.940 --> 07:15.940
Right.

07:15.940 --> 07:17.940
How did you play him after he left?

07:17.940 --> 07:18.940
How did you play him?

07:18.940 --> 07:20.940
What do you mean, how did I play him?

07:20.940 --> 07:21.940
Joe played his guy.

07:21.940 --> 07:24.940
How did you play the one dude who walked out,

07:24.940 --> 07:25.940
your dude?

07:25.940 --> 07:27.940
Now I get the joke you're making.

07:27.940 --> 07:29.940
How did you play the old man?

07:29.940 --> 07:32.940
Did you call him acting like his son and say,

07:32.940 --> 07:33.940
hey, I'm in prison.

07:33.940 --> 07:35.940
I need you to wire me money.

07:35.940 --> 07:36.940
Oh, my God.

07:36.940 --> 07:37.940
That's exactly what I did.

07:37.940 --> 07:38.940
That happened to my grandma.

07:38.940 --> 07:39.940
That happened to my grandma.

07:39.940 --> 07:40.940
I was sitting in high school.

07:40.940 --> 07:41.940
What?

07:41.940 --> 07:42.940
This is not a joke.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.940
This is actually a solid story.

07:44.940 --> 07:46.940
I'm sitting in high school English class

07:46.940 --> 07:48.940
and my cell phone is ringing incessantly

07:48.940 --> 07:49.940
and I'm like, what the fuck?

07:49.940 --> 07:50.940
I keep looking.

07:50.940 --> 07:52.940
It's my dad.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.940
The third phone call, I looked at my teacher

07:54.940 --> 07:55.940
and I was like, hey, my dad's calling.

07:55.940 --> 07:57.940
My grandma probably died.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.940
And she was like, hell yeah.

07:59.940 --> 08:00.940
Yes.

08:00.940 --> 08:01.940
Because you just sucked in high school.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.940
Yes, and still.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.940
And so I go out in the hallway

08:05.940 --> 08:06.940
and I answer the phone call

08:06.940 --> 08:08.940
and my dad's like, where are you?

08:08.940 --> 08:10.940
I'm like, I'm at school.

08:10.940 --> 08:11.940
And he's like, don't lie to me, Zach.

08:11.940 --> 08:13.940
Where are you?

08:13.940 --> 08:14.940
I'm in English class.

08:14.940 --> 08:16.940
I can put you on the phone with my teacher

08:16.940 --> 08:17.940
if you want.

08:17.940 --> 08:18.940
And I'm like, I was a good kid.

08:18.940 --> 08:19.940
My parents trusted me.

08:19.940 --> 08:20.940
Where were you actually though?

08:20.940 --> 08:21.940
I was in English class.

08:21.940 --> 08:23.940
I was gone in my grandma in Philadelphia.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.940
Skipping a candlelight vigil

08:25.940 --> 08:28.940
and drinking with a homeless person.

08:28.940 --> 08:29.940
Arrestees.

08:29.940 --> 08:32.940
So he then proceeds to tell me

08:32.940 --> 08:34.940
that my grandma got a phone call

08:34.940 --> 08:36.940
from someone who sounded enough like me

08:36.940 --> 08:39.940
to trick her into almost wiring

08:39.940 --> 08:42.940
$1,000 as my bail.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.940
And he called me thinking that I was in jail.

08:45.940 --> 08:47.940
And I was like, dad, how old were you?

08:47.940 --> 08:48.940
Would they give me my cell phone?

08:48.940 --> 08:49.940
I was a senior in high school.

08:49.940 --> 08:51.940
The same thing happened to my grandma.

08:51.940 --> 08:52.940
Tell the same story.

08:52.940 --> 08:53.940
Well, it's a little different.

08:53.940 --> 08:55.940
Different enough to be interesting.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.940
That's what's important, baby.

08:57.940 --> 08:59.940
I was traveling.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.940
I was in Boston for two weeks

09:01.940 --> 09:04.940
house-sitting for a relative.

09:04.940 --> 09:07.940
My grandma vaguely knew that I was traveling.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.940
But she got a call from somebody who was just like,

09:09.940 --> 09:11.940
hello, grandma?

09:11.940 --> 09:13.940
And she was like, yeah?

09:13.940 --> 09:16.940
And he was like, I'm in Philadelphia

09:16.940 --> 09:19.940
and I need $300 or whatever.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.940
And she was like, oh, okay.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.940
And anyway, she knew it was weird enough

09:24.940 --> 09:25.940
to talk about it.

09:25.940 --> 09:26.940
She called me.

09:26.940 --> 09:27.940
Weird enough to talk about.

09:27.940 --> 09:29.940
Yeah, she knew it was weird enough to talk about.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.940
She was like, if I saw something,

09:31.940 --> 09:32.940
I'm going to say something.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.940
And she did.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.940
Thankfully, my grandma wasn't scammed.

09:36.940 --> 09:39.940
But now I know every time I talk to my grandma

09:39.940 --> 09:43.940
on the phone now, I'm like, grandma, it's me.

09:43.940 --> 09:44.940
You say your middle name?

09:44.940 --> 09:47.940
I say my middle name, which is embarrassing.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.940
And also vagina.

09:50.940 --> 09:52.940
No relation.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.940
No relation.

09:54.940 --> 09:55.940
No what?

09:55.940 --> 09:58.940
Thomas Vagina Cox.

09:58.940 --> 10:01.940
No relation.

10:01.940 --> 10:02.940
Wait, don't dox me.

10:02.940 --> 10:03.940
Fuck you.

10:03.940 --> 10:04.940
Have we said our last names?

10:04.940 --> 10:05.940
Probably.

10:05.940 --> 10:06.940
Yeah.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.940
Okay, I'm Thomas Cox and I'm proud of you.

10:09.940 --> 10:13.940
So outside of me saying that you guys are dumb.

10:13.940 --> 10:14.940
No, no, no.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.940
Don't include my last name in that

10:16.940 --> 10:19.940
in case somebody actually does then try to dox my grandma.

10:20.940 --> 10:22.940
And her name is, what is her full name?

10:27.940 --> 10:30.940
You will obviously bleep that one.

10:30.940 --> 10:31.940
Yeah, but that's it.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.940
Also, if you give me her phone number,

10:33.940 --> 10:35.940
I need to give her a call.

10:37.940 --> 10:39.940
Grandma, it's Luke.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.940
I mean, Thomas.

10:41.940 --> 10:42.940
Thomas Vagina Cox.

10:42.940 --> 10:43.940
Thomas Vagina Cox.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.940
I'm in a lot of trouble.

10:45.940 --> 10:46.940
A lot of relation.

10:46.940 --> 10:47.940
You're my grandma.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.940
Do you know what bukkake is?

10:51.940 --> 10:53.940
She said, she said,

10:53.940 --> 10:56.940
yeah, it saved me a lot of money on facial care.

10:56.940 --> 10:59.940
My grandma knows what bukkake is.

10:59.940 --> 11:02.940
Don't treat her like some kind of ignorant.

11:02.940 --> 11:03.940
How do we recover from that?

11:03.940 --> 11:06.940
Well, I'd just like to shout out my grandfather who

11:06.940 --> 11:08.940
got your grandma into bukkake.

11:08.940 --> 11:09.940
My God.

11:09.940 --> 11:11.940
There's a place to cut in there somewhere.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.940
There's gotta be, right?

11:13.940 --> 11:14.940
Yeah.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.940
It's just gonna be like cut and paste it together words

11:17.940 --> 11:18.940
like a serial killer.

11:18.940 --> 11:22.940
Like, I think that show is good.

11:22.940 --> 11:27.940
Well, I was gonna say I have theories of what is going on.

11:27.940 --> 11:28.940
Oh, how many?

11:28.940 --> 11:29.940
Like two.

11:29.940 --> 11:30.940
Two.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.940
And the more I think about both of them,

11:33.940 --> 11:36.940
I start poking holes in my theories.

11:36.940 --> 11:37.940
You floated one.

11:37.940 --> 11:38.940
So I don't think, but yeah,

11:38.940 --> 11:40.940
we talked about this last week.

11:40.940 --> 11:43.940
We were driving home last week and you floated the idea

11:43.940 --> 11:46.940
that maybe people killing themselves is their goal.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.940
Like us offing people is maybe-

11:49.940 --> 11:50.940
Counter productive.

11:50.940 --> 11:51.940
Counter productive.

11:51.940 --> 11:52.940
That it's helping them achieve whatever goal

11:52.940 --> 11:54.940
that they're trying to.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.940
I think, I don't know if it was on the podcast

11:56.940 --> 11:58.940
or just in conversation with you,

11:58.940 --> 12:02.940
but talking about how when, because like when people chant

12:02.940 --> 12:05.940
in most like Delta green things,

12:05.940 --> 12:07.940
it's typically something bad.

12:07.940 --> 12:10.940
Chant that for the listeners just to get the words out

12:10.940 --> 12:12.940
as broadly as possible, Zach.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.940
Tawil Alakol.

12:14.940 --> 12:16.940
Tawil Alakol.

12:16.940 --> 12:17.940
I punch him.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.940
Yeah, I'm gonna roll.

12:22.940 --> 12:23.940
Yeah, Zach.

12:23.940 --> 12:24.940
40 on a 70, I shoot you in the face.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.940
We rolled unarmed combat against you

12:26.940 --> 12:28.940
and we kicked your ass.

12:28.940 --> 12:29.940
But no, I was saying like,

12:29.940 --> 12:32.940
usually I hear a chant like that and I'm like,

12:32.940 --> 12:33.940
okay, if something's about to be summoned,

12:33.940 --> 12:35.940
it's gonna hurt us, it's gonna be bad.

12:35.940 --> 12:36.940
Let's stop it.

12:36.940 --> 12:40.940
But so far when the chanting has happened,

12:40.940 --> 12:42.940
it's just been people killing themselves.

12:42.940 --> 12:44.940
That's another thing,

12:44.940 --> 12:46.940
is that we haven't actually killed either one.

12:46.940 --> 12:47.940
We've heard two, right?

12:47.940 --> 12:49.940
We've heard the guy in the mall, the Santa mall,

12:49.940 --> 12:52.940
and then we've heard your brother's partner, Bruce Robin.

12:52.940 --> 12:53.940
We killed Santa, right?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.940
We shot him, but he impaled his own head.

12:55.940 --> 12:57.940
I shot him, he didn't die and he killed himself

12:57.940 --> 12:59.940
and then everybody else that we didn't kill

12:59.940 --> 13:01.940
started killing themselves.

13:01.940 --> 13:02.940
Enchanting.

13:02.940 --> 13:03.940
Enchanting, yeah.

13:03.940 --> 13:05.940
Everyone in that room was chanting.

13:05.940 --> 13:06.940
Did they start chanting after he killed himself?

13:06.940 --> 13:07.940
Enchantment, yes they did.

13:07.940 --> 13:09.940
Right around the time that he killed himself.

13:09.940 --> 13:11.940
And Bruce Robin started chanting that

13:11.940 --> 13:14.940
and I think we shot him and beat him up

13:14.940 --> 13:16.940
and then he killed himself.

13:16.940 --> 13:18.940
We didn't get a shot in on him.

13:18.940 --> 13:19.940
He punched him.

13:19.940 --> 13:20.940
Somebody shot him in the gut.

13:20.940 --> 13:21.940
I shot him in the gut.

13:21.940 --> 13:22.940
Oh, did you really?

13:22.940 --> 13:23.940
One of us did.

13:23.940 --> 13:24.940
Somebody did.

13:24.940 --> 13:25.940
Probably Keith.

13:25.940 --> 13:26.940
But yeah, he shot himself.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.940
He killed himself.

13:27.940 --> 13:28.940
In the heat of the moment,

13:28.940 --> 13:30.940
who knows who shot who in the gut.

13:30.940 --> 13:34.940
But yeah, so my theory now is maybe next time

13:34.940 --> 13:35.940
it starts happening,

13:35.940 --> 13:38.940
could it be some sort of protection spell

13:38.940 --> 13:41.940
or I don't know, I don't know if it's like something

13:41.940 --> 13:44.940
that's like, I don't think it's a bad thing.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.940
I think my initial thought is,

13:46.940 --> 13:50.940
oh, it's gonna summon an elder god demon thing,

13:50.940 --> 13:52.940
but I don't think that's the case anymore.

13:52.940 --> 13:53.940
Well, okay, but what we were just saying,

13:53.940 --> 13:55.940
the path we were kind of heading down just now

13:55.940 --> 13:57.940
was that when you do the taui ala coal,

13:57.940 --> 14:01.940
that if you kill yourself then, it then spreads, right?

14:01.940 --> 14:04.940
In that kind of way we just stumbled on

14:04.940 --> 14:05.940
as we were talking.

14:05.940 --> 14:06.940
Or if you're killed maybe.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.940
Well, after Bruce Robin killed himself,

14:08.940 --> 14:12.940
we blacked out, woke up naked writing numbers in blood.

14:12.940 --> 14:15.940
And who's to say that we weren't chanting that

14:15.940 --> 14:16.940
while we did it?

14:16.940 --> 14:17.940
Because we don't know.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.940
I don't remember doing that.

14:19.940 --> 14:22.940
When the audience, when they started chanting,

14:22.940 --> 14:25.940
did they start then doing numbers also

14:25.940 --> 14:27.940
or were they just chanting?

14:27.940 --> 14:28.940
They were just chanting at the end,

14:28.940 --> 14:32.940
but they were like all mumbling to themselves

14:32.940 --> 14:33.940
throughout the process.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.940
And you had the one guy mopping numbers

14:36.940 --> 14:38.940
onto the ground with paint.

14:38.940 --> 14:39.940
And he was naked.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.940
Well, and then you also got to remember

14:41.940 --> 14:43.940
throughout the entire campus of CSU,

14:43.940 --> 14:47.940
numbers everywhere written all over everything.

14:47.940 --> 14:50.940
And why is the fucker who's with us immune to it?

14:50.940 --> 14:51.940
That's a good question.

14:51.940 --> 14:53.940
As we all look at Justin.

14:53.940 --> 14:55.940
I don't know.

14:55.940 --> 14:56.940
He really doesn't.

14:56.940 --> 14:57.940
I don't know.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.940
That'd be fucked up if I was like,

14:59.940 --> 15:00.940
well, Zach told me.

15:00.940 --> 15:01.940
Here's why.

15:01.940 --> 15:04.940
Zach told me not to tell you guys this, but.

15:04.940 --> 15:06.940
It's because, what is your name?

15:06.940 --> 15:07.940
Donovan West Haven.

15:07.940 --> 15:08.940
Haven.

15:08.940 --> 15:13.940
He uses Roman numerals, not Arabic numerals.

15:13.940 --> 15:15.940
And so he's not affected.

15:15.940 --> 15:17.940
That doesn't sound right.

15:17.940 --> 15:18.940
Numerals?

15:18.940 --> 15:20.940
Donovan, yeah.

15:20.940 --> 15:21.940
Numbers?

15:21.940 --> 15:23.940
Roman numerals, right?

15:23.940 --> 15:24.940
Well, but people are.

15:24.940 --> 15:25.940
Roman numbers?

15:25.940 --> 15:26.940
Yeah.

15:26.940 --> 15:27.940
They're Roman numbers?

15:27.940 --> 15:30.940
Luke, they're called Roman numbers.

15:30.940 --> 15:31.940
You idiot.

15:31.940 --> 15:34.940
Did you think it was Roman numerals?

15:34.940 --> 15:35.940
Roman numbers.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.940
You guys can gaslight me way too easily.

15:38.940 --> 15:39.940
Clearly not.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.940
No, we can't.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.940
Luke is like, oh yeah, right, right.

15:44.940 --> 15:45.940
Roman numbers.

15:45.940 --> 15:46.940
Roman numbers, yeah.

15:46.940 --> 15:49.940
I was like, man, I must have made that word up.

15:49.940 --> 15:50.940
I'm like, fuck you.

15:50.940 --> 15:51.940
No, I didn't.

15:51.940 --> 15:52.940
All right.

15:52.940 --> 15:53.940
What else?

15:53.940 --> 15:55.940
Any other theories of what the hell?

15:55.940 --> 15:57.940
Because you guys are so stupid.

15:57.940 --> 15:58.940
What else?

15:58.940 --> 16:01.940
Any other theories of what the hell could be possibly going on?

16:01.940 --> 16:06.940
The other theory that we've been kind of operating under is that it transfers like in a chain-like

16:06.940 --> 16:07.940
fashion.

16:07.940 --> 16:08.940
Right.

16:08.940 --> 16:12.940
I think I said this last episode was my initial thought was, you know, Harriet Marks died

16:12.940 --> 16:18.940
and then Bruce Robin is saying her name and then Bruce Robin dies and we're saying numbers

16:18.940 --> 16:20.940
that translate to his name.

16:20.940 --> 16:23.940
You know what we never looked into is his connection to her.

16:23.940 --> 16:24.940
Do we know that?

16:24.940 --> 16:27.940
I don't think we have, we haven't looked into it.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.940
How did Bruce get infected, yeah?

16:29.940 --> 16:33.940
I don't think we've looked into it, but I also, I couldn't tell you the first step in

16:33.940 --> 16:34.940
doing that.

16:34.940 --> 16:36.940
And the name Bruce Robin was writing was?

16:36.940 --> 16:37.940
Harriet Marks.

16:37.940 --> 16:38.940
But then Leon.

16:38.940 --> 16:40.940
A powerful businessman.

16:40.940 --> 16:46.940
But then Leon was reciting numbers that translate to Ben Smith, who was the muscular manny,

16:46.940 --> 16:47.940
Santa guy, right?

16:47.940 --> 16:50.940
No, well, he was just the one who was doing squats on Santa's throne.

16:50.940 --> 16:52.940
He wasn't one of the like hot Santas.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.940
He was the first person that I shot.

16:54.940 --> 16:55.940
Yes.

16:55.940 --> 16:59.940
That was, uh, started chanting tall will Alec Cole or whatever.

16:59.940 --> 17:00.940
Yeah, there we go.

17:00.940 --> 17:03.940
Do you have a question for me, Zach?

17:03.940 --> 17:04.940
Oh, right.

17:04.940 --> 17:09.940
So you guys were just talking about what, what is the connection between Harriet Marks

17:09.940 --> 17:10.940
and Bruce Robin?

17:10.940 --> 17:11.940
Right.

17:11.940 --> 17:18.940
Well, so in Harriet Marks's desk, um, I found a to do list with two, just only two items

17:18.940 --> 17:19.940
on it.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.940
Investigate the most corrupt.

17:22.940 --> 17:30.940
The first is research research, most unethical corporation in the city in the city to was

17:30.940 --> 17:32.940
who is the overseer?

17:32.940 --> 17:38.940
So Harriet was looking into, was Harriet involved with any, like, uh, was she involved with

17:38.940 --> 17:40.940
the student paper or was she a journalism student?

17:40.940 --> 17:43.940
She was more of a pro union activist.

17:43.940 --> 17:48.940
So she was looking into the overseer, which may, well, she might not have been looking

17:48.940 --> 17:49.940
into it.

17:49.940 --> 17:52.940
She, she stumbled upon something that the overseer.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.940
So she was like, I got to research what this is.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.940
First is research.

17:56.940 --> 18:03.940
The most unethical corporation in the city, which is, I assume surprisingly not unethical.

18:03.940 --> 18:04.940
What is it?

18:04.940 --> 18:07.940
B and R or what was bar Corp bar Corp.

18:07.940 --> 18:10.940
I was thinking beans and Robin, but you got it.

18:10.940 --> 18:12.940
Bar Corp beans and Robin.

18:12.940 --> 18:17.940
I was thinking not a, she might've been killed by Bruce Robin.

18:17.940 --> 18:23.940
If she was poking into, into the corporation, it's definitely how she met Bruce Robin.

18:23.940 --> 18:24.940
I think.

18:24.940 --> 18:25.940
I don't know if she got killed.

18:25.940 --> 18:26.940
She killed herself.

18:26.940 --> 18:27.940
Right.

18:27.940 --> 18:28.940
We knew that too.

18:28.940 --> 18:29.940
Yeah, she did.

18:29.940 --> 18:30.940
Okay.

18:30.940 --> 18:31.940
Which is a common theme of this whole thing.

18:31.940 --> 18:36.940
So could she have, uh, she didn't, we found out she like fell out of a fell out of her

18:36.940 --> 18:37.940
dorm window.

18:37.940 --> 18:38.940
Was that it?

18:38.940 --> 18:41.940
How'd she, how'd she kill herself from the pictures that you saw that were given to you

18:41.940 --> 18:44.940
by Leon Simpson of the crime scene.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.940
It seemed to be a gunshot wound.

18:46.940 --> 18:47.940
Oh really?

18:47.940 --> 18:51.940
There was a blood splatter behind on her a wall of her dorm.

18:51.940 --> 18:53.940
So she, she killed herself by shooting herself.

18:53.940 --> 18:55.940
Well now that's, that's a baby.

18:55.940 --> 18:57.940
Bruce Robin shot himself.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.940
I mean, I don't know if that was, if there's a link there.

19:00.940 --> 19:05.940
Like, I mean, obviously Bruce had a gun on him and was trying to kill himself at it.

19:05.940 --> 19:10.940
I don't know if there's a link there or if it just is circumstantial that they both shot

19:10.940 --> 19:11.940
themselves.

19:11.940 --> 19:12.940
Are we sure they're crime scene photos?

19:12.940 --> 19:14.940
Of Harriet Marks?

19:14.940 --> 19:17.940
We, we looked at, yeah, we, we looked at the crime scene photos.

19:17.940 --> 19:19.940
What if Leon shot her and took photos?

19:19.940 --> 19:21.940
Why would he have us investigated?

19:21.940 --> 19:22.940
Bruce did, you mean?

19:22.940 --> 19:23.940
What would that imply?

19:23.940 --> 19:24.940
I don't know.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.940
Figure it out.

19:26.940 --> 19:27.940
I know.

19:27.940 --> 19:28.940
Tell me.

19:30.940 --> 19:31.940
Let's get into the game.

19:31.940 --> 19:32.940
Yeah.

19:32.940 --> 19:36.940
I think we've covered a lot here and we've got a lot of good things being brought to

19:36.940 --> 19:37.940
the forefront.

19:37.940 --> 19:39.940
I don't feel any more clear.

19:39.940 --> 19:42.940
I'm only maybe a little bit more.

19:42.940 --> 19:47.940
I feel like the listeners are only talking to us even more.

19:47.940 --> 19:48.940
Yeah.

19:48.940 --> 19:52.940
If you are one of the people that supposedly know what's going on, hit me up.

19:52.940 --> 19:53.940
Hit me up.

19:53.940 --> 19:54.940
Tell me what's going on.

19:54.940 --> 19:55.940
Fuck you.

19:55.940 --> 19:56.940
Fuck you.

19:56.940 --> 19:57.940
Fuck you.

19:57.940 --> 19:58.940
Okay.

19:58.940 --> 20:06.940
As you guys come back to this place where you're all standing there, you were standing

20:06.940 --> 20:13.940
around, Clark was looking at his phones and you would all know that the things that you

20:13.940 --> 20:19.940
have not looked at that you've come across since this epidemic has ended are the two

20:19.940 --> 20:23.940
videos on the laptop that Amelia Locke was throwing in the air.

20:23.940 --> 20:24.940
Fuck you guys.

20:24.940 --> 20:25.940
I got it right that time.

20:25.940 --> 20:26.940
Did you?

20:26.940 --> 20:28.940
There are two videos that I honestly don't know.

20:28.940 --> 20:29.940
Did you?

20:29.940 --> 20:31.940
I think you did for the first time.

20:31.940 --> 20:32.940
Think about it.

20:32.940 --> 20:33.940
Really get in your head about it.

20:33.940 --> 20:34.940
What would you like to do?

20:34.940 --> 20:35.940
I want to go to the lab.

20:35.940 --> 20:36.940
I want to go to the lab too.

20:36.940 --> 20:37.940
Yeah.

20:37.940 --> 20:39.940
Wanting that, John head stores the lab.

20:39.940 --> 20:41.940
Donovan, we're going to the lab.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.940
We're going to see if those people are still in there.

20:43.940 --> 20:44.940
Can you lead the way?

20:44.940 --> 20:49.940
I look at John as he's turning down a hallway that is the incorrect direction and just walking

20:49.940 --> 20:50.940
with a lot of confidence.

20:50.940 --> 20:54.940
I'm like, hey, we're going this way.

20:54.940 --> 20:59.940
Life is a garden of forking paths, but they all lead to our ultimate destination.

20:59.940 --> 21:01.940
If you want to go to the lab, though, we got to go this way.

21:01.940 --> 21:07.940
I know, but John picks a beautiful flower out of a little pot that was in the hallway

21:07.940 --> 21:10.940
that he walked down and then he heads back towards you.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.940
Each petal has a different number written on it.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.940
I was going to ask if it had a number on it.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.940
He says, what does this mean?

21:16.940 --> 21:17.940
And he hands it to you.

21:17.940 --> 21:18.940
It's a plastic plant.

21:18.940 --> 21:19.940
It's a fake indoor plant.

21:19.940 --> 21:20.940
It's cheap.

21:20.940 --> 21:21.940
Is it?

21:21.940 --> 21:23.940
What are the numbers?

21:23.940 --> 21:25.940
You have nothing.

21:25.940 --> 21:27.940
It spells out flower.

21:27.940 --> 21:29.940
You cheap.

21:29.940 --> 21:30.940
You have nothing.

21:30.940 --> 21:33.940
You're like, the flower has fucking numbers on it.

21:33.940 --> 21:34.940
Fuck you.

21:34.940 --> 21:39.940
I said, I said my news resolution.

21:39.940 --> 21:40.940
I look at the flower.

21:40.940 --> 21:44.940
I'm like, it's just a flower.

21:44.940 --> 21:46.940
I picked it because it was beautiful.

21:46.940 --> 21:50.940
And because I look at flower and I look at John, I'm like, we're wasting time here.

21:50.940 --> 21:53.940
We there's people that have been in there for days.

21:53.940 --> 21:54.940
Let's go.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.940
John puts the flower in your ear and walks.

21:57.940 --> 21:59.940
I feel a little bit prettier.

21:59.940 --> 22:02.940
Clark is still carrying the laptop and he's holding it up as he walks along.

22:02.940 --> 22:03.940
How are you holding it up?

22:03.940 --> 22:04.940
It's open.

22:04.940 --> 22:05.940
It's open?

22:05.940 --> 22:06.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:06.940 --> 22:07.940
It's open.

22:07.940 --> 22:11.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:11.940 --> 22:13.940
Okay, cool.

22:13.940 --> 22:18.940
When you guys go out into the campus, you hear these screams and noises that you've

22:18.940 --> 22:21.940
heard previously all throughout the campus.

22:21.940 --> 22:22.940
It's college, baby.

22:22.940 --> 22:36.940
Are we cops or are we fucking experts on youth music?

22:36.940 --> 22:37.940
Come on.

22:37.940 --> 22:42.940
If I look over towards the bell tower, is Shamwell Chameleon still up there?

22:42.940 --> 22:47.940
Shamwell Chameleon is on top of the minion.

22:47.940 --> 22:49.940
Shamwell Chameleon is on top of the minion.

22:49.940 --> 22:51.940
The minion was on top of the bell tower?

22:51.940 --> 22:52.940
Uh-huh, yeah.

22:52.940 --> 22:53.940
Yeah.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.940
Dude, hey, good for Shamwell, first of all.

22:56.940 --> 23:02.940
And she's just up there and you can hear her in the distance screaming, I gotta get higher.

23:02.940 --> 23:03.940
Higher.

23:03.940 --> 23:04.940
Higher.

23:04.940 --> 23:09.940
I look at these guys and I'm like, I think we did a good thing while I pointed her.

23:09.940 --> 23:14.940
And you can see behind her in the distance, there are black unmarked helicopters coming

23:14.940 --> 23:15.940
into the city.

23:15.940 --> 23:19.940
Those are probably there for her because it went viral that she wanted to get higher.

23:19.940 --> 23:24.940
I prod Donovan in the back and I'm like, hurry up, let's go.

23:24.940 --> 23:25.940
Okay.

23:25.940 --> 23:26.940
Pick up the pace.

23:26.940 --> 23:27.940
Okay.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.940
Donovan, there are two routes to get to the lab.

23:29.940 --> 23:30.940
Mm-hmm.

23:30.940 --> 23:33.940
One is more direct, but it is not lit and the other one is-

23:33.940 --> 23:36.940
Is totally fucking awesome.

23:36.940 --> 23:43.940
Honestly, this whole situation is not lit right now.

23:43.940 --> 23:44.940
No, yeah.

23:44.940 --> 23:47.940
None of this has been lit, Zach.

23:47.940 --> 23:48.940
The other one is well lit.

23:48.940 --> 23:52.940
The British person would say it's really cool.

23:52.940 --> 23:54.940
It's well lit.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.940
Which one do you want to, which one do you lead them down?

23:56.940 --> 24:00.940
I think I'd lead them down whatever I feel is the safest because Donovan's feeling like

24:00.940 --> 24:04.940
endangered now, especially after seeing the one person be like, turn the lights off.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.940
He's like freaked out about that shit.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.940
Is it the well lit one?

24:08.940 --> 24:12.940
Oh, we're going to go down the proper lit one.

24:12.940 --> 24:15.940
So you guys don't go down the proper lit one.

24:15.940 --> 24:16.940
Well lit.

24:16.940 --> 24:21.940
It's lit by street lights, the tall lights that light paths and he's going to stop under

24:21.940 --> 24:24.940
one and just stare up at it for a minute or two.

24:24.940 --> 24:26.940
How lit is a street light?

24:26.940 --> 24:27.940
That's pretty pedestrian.

24:27.940 --> 24:31.940
Keith comes up next to you and looks up and I'm like, remember Harry Potter?

24:31.940 --> 24:32.940
That thing?

24:32.940 --> 24:33.940
Anyway.

24:33.940 --> 24:34.940
De-luminator?

24:34.940 --> 24:35.940
De-luminator.

24:35.940 --> 24:36.940
That thing's awful.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.940
Good thing we don't have one because I would have clicked it a bunch of times.

24:38.940 --> 24:39.940
Anyway.

24:39.940 --> 24:40.940
That would have been terrible.

24:40.940 --> 24:43.940
It would have been a terrible moment in a podcast for sure.

24:43.940 --> 24:44.940
Got him.

24:45.940 --> 24:47.940
Fucking Ben Dan.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.940
And you hear down this path.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.940
It's channel of the day guys.

25:09.940 --> 25:13.940
And as you guys are walking in that direction, it's getting louder and louder and you can

25:13.940 --> 25:19.940
kind of hear that it's coming from this bench that is just around a corner.

25:19.940 --> 25:21.940
You can only see the edge of the bench.

25:21.940 --> 25:24.940
You can't see the fullness of the bench.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.940
It's like in an enclave of a building that's well lit but you just can't see around the

25:28.940 --> 25:29.940
corner.

25:29.940 --> 25:30.940
It's tight.

25:30.940 --> 25:31.940
But you can't see it.

25:31.940 --> 25:33.940
What do you mean we can't tell what kind of bench it is?

25:33.940 --> 25:35.940
No, I mean the bench is like hidden.

25:35.940 --> 25:38.940
You can see the corner of a bench but you can't see the full bench because you haven't

25:38.940 --> 25:39.940
gotten that far yet.

25:39.940 --> 25:41.940
The cleaning lady comes in on Monday.

25:41.940 --> 25:42.940
Is it around?

25:42.940 --> 25:44.940
How much more bench could there be?

25:44.940 --> 25:45.940
She sweeps.

25:45.940 --> 25:47.940
Is it around the building we're going to?

25:47.940 --> 25:49.940
No, there's just a building on the way.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.940
I prod Donovan in the back.

25:51.940 --> 25:52.940
I'm like, okay, really hurry up.

25:52.940 --> 25:53.940
Let's go.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.940
Donovan starts kind of rearing back a little bit.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.940
Are we like super close to this?

25:57.940 --> 25:59.940
Yeah, you're probably like 20 feet away.

25:59.940 --> 26:00.940
It's coming up hot.

26:00.940 --> 26:04.940
Should someone go ahead and see what this is all about?

26:04.940 --> 26:08.940
Donovan, you've seen, think about what we just left.

26:08.940 --> 26:11.940
Do you really want to go check out that sound?

26:12.940 --> 26:20.940
Okay, it's straight ahead, but you guys, I'll walk behind you guys and guide you.

26:20.940 --> 26:21.940
That doesn't make any sense.

26:21.940 --> 26:22.940
Just go.

26:22.940 --> 26:23.940
Just keep going straight.

26:23.940 --> 26:25.940
I'll be behind you for sure.

26:25.940 --> 26:27.940
I push Donovan along.

26:27.940 --> 26:31.940
While your path may not be apparent.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.940
Clark, I need you to help.

26:33.940 --> 26:34.940
I'm pushing you through this.

26:34.940 --> 26:35.940
Clark, you know me, please.

26:35.940 --> 26:37.940
Don't make me go ahead.

26:37.940 --> 26:38.940
Sure, sure, Donovan.

26:38.940 --> 26:39.940
Of course.

26:40.940 --> 26:42.940
I guess if he nears the bench, he's going to say hello.

26:42.940 --> 26:48.940
And as you near the bench and say hello, turning the corner, you see there's an old man who

26:48.940 --> 26:56.940
is huddled into the corner of this enclave of this building and he's crouched over and

26:56.940 --> 27:01.940
he's got his left hand out and he's holding a citrus peeler in his other hand.

27:01.940 --> 27:08.940
And he's slowly dragging the peeler down each of his fingers and moaning as the skin comes

27:09.940 --> 27:11.940
off like a lime zest.

27:11.940 --> 27:13.940
Fuck off, Zach.

27:15.940 --> 27:18.940
Roll sanity, Joe.

27:18.940 --> 27:19.940
Oh, fuck.

27:19.940 --> 27:20.940
See you, boys.

27:22.940 --> 27:23.940
I fail.

27:23.940 --> 27:24.940
Roll a D4.

27:24.940 --> 27:25.940
Oh my God.

27:25.940 --> 27:29.940
So I had two sanity points and I rolled a one.

27:29.940 --> 27:30.940
So I've got one sanity.

27:30.940 --> 27:31.940
Okay.

27:31.940 --> 27:32.940
You're clinging on.

27:32.940 --> 27:33.940
You're fine.

27:33.940 --> 27:34.940
I join him.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.940
That sounds way more rational than anything.

27:41.940 --> 27:43.940
There is actually a light coming down on him.

27:43.940 --> 27:45.940
I get up real close to him.

27:45.940 --> 27:47.940
He found a nice little spot here, it looks like.

27:51.940 --> 27:55.940
And he's just turning his fingers into those of a skeleton.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.940
I go up and I kick him in the shin.

27:58.940 --> 27:59.940
Okay.

27:59.940 --> 28:02.940
Roll sanity when you turn the corner and see what's happening here.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.940
I pass 24 on 26.

28:04.940 --> 28:05.940
Wow.

28:05.940 --> 28:07.940
Oh no, I have 23.

28:07.940 --> 28:09.940
I fail 24 on 23.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.940
Oh, fuck.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.940
I thought I had 23.

28:13.940 --> 28:14.940
That sucked.

28:14.940 --> 28:15.940
So yeah, I fail.

28:15.940 --> 28:16.940
Okay.

28:16.940 --> 28:17.940
Sounds good.

28:17.940 --> 28:20.940
I need you to leave the room.

28:20.940 --> 28:22.940
Get the fuck out of here.

28:22.940 --> 28:26.940
You're not welcome to hear this next part.

28:26.940 --> 28:27.940
Bye bye.

28:38.940 --> 28:46.940
John Lee Pettymore and Donovan Westhaven, you see Keith Vigna turn the corner where

28:46.940 --> 28:52.940
Clark has disappeared to and then Keith Vigna immediately turns around and comes walking

28:52.940 --> 28:56.940
back and he is repeating the numbers for Bruce Robin.

28:56.940 --> 29:00.940
I grab Donovan by the chest, or by his shoulders, and I'm like, let him go.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.940
There's nothing you can do for him.

29:02.940 --> 29:03.940
For who?

29:03.940 --> 29:04.940
Him.

29:04.940 --> 29:06.940
Okay, I wasn't going to do it.

29:06.940 --> 29:07.940
Don't.

29:07.940 --> 29:08.940
I wasn't going to do anything.

29:08.940 --> 29:09.940
But don't.

29:09.940 --> 29:11.940
What the fuck is happening right now?

29:11.940 --> 29:18.940
Clark is going to yell from the alcove, hey, uh, you fellas, this is, uh, you know, Donovan

29:18.940 --> 29:20.940
especially, you're not going to want to see what's going on over here.

29:20.940 --> 29:23.940
I just, uh, just put up the blinders and keep walking.

29:23.940 --> 29:24.940
Okay.

29:24.940 --> 29:25.940
Okay, Clark.

29:25.940 --> 29:26.940
Thank you.

29:26.940 --> 29:28.940
Do you join them to continue down this path?

29:28.940 --> 29:29.940
No, I'm going to linger here for a second.

29:29.940 --> 29:33.940
And I want to say to the man, why are you, why are you doing that?

29:33.940 --> 29:39.940
Oh yeah, feels good.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.940
Are there any numbers around him?

29:41.940 --> 29:42.940
Oh yeah.

29:42.940 --> 29:44.940
Can I discern any words that I would know?

29:44.940 --> 29:46.940
He's writing in blood.

29:46.940 --> 29:55.940
Clark would see the numbers four, one, one, four, eight, five, one, one, eight, two, zero,

29:55.940 --> 29:57.940
written all around him.

29:57.940 --> 30:03.940
Oh, got to become bone.

30:03.940 --> 30:05.940
Yeah.

30:05.940 --> 30:08.940
Keith's always the one who's good at doing the numbers.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.940
Uh, so if they're just single integers, it doesn't spell anything.

30:11.940 --> 30:15.940
It's D A A D H E A A H B.

30:15.940 --> 30:19.940
And then I don't know what zero is, but then if, hold on, let me see the numbers.

30:19.940 --> 30:22.940
Four eleven, I could be, I guess it's 20.

30:22.940 --> 30:29.940
So it might be four, one, 14, eight, five, 11, eight, 20.

30:29.940 --> 30:30.940
It's my guess.

30:30.940 --> 30:31.940
Let me write down the numbers.

30:31.940 --> 30:32.940
Okay.

30:32.940 --> 30:33.940
We're not recording.

30:33.940 --> 30:34.940
Okay.

30:34.940 --> 30:35.940
We are.

30:35.940 --> 30:36.940
That's fun.

30:36.940 --> 30:37.940
People like this.

30:37.940 --> 30:38.940
Four, one, one, four.

30:38.940 --> 30:41.940
You don't have to say that cause I edit the podcast.

30:41.940 --> 30:42.940
Eight, five.

30:42.940 --> 30:43.940
People like this.

30:43.940 --> 30:45.940
Four, one, one, four, eight, five.

30:45.940 --> 30:47.940
Eleven, eight, two, zero.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.940
Eight, two, zero.

30:49.940 --> 30:51.940
Uh, I figured out the numbers.

30:51.940 --> 30:53.940
Actually, I'm not talking to anybody.

30:53.940 --> 30:54.940
I figured out the numbers.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.940
Uh, it spells Dan Hart.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.940
D A N H E A R T.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.940
I want to say that name to him.

31:00.940 --> 31:01.940
Oh.

31:01.940 --> 31:03.940
Does that mean anything to you, sir?

31:03.940 --> 31:05.940
Co worker.

31:05.940 --> 31:07.940
Oh yeah.

31:07.940 --> 31:10.940
Do you work at a bar corp?

31:10.940 --> 31:11.940
No.

31:11.940 --> 31:16.940
And he's wearing like a CSU janitorial uniform.

31:16.940 --> 31:17.940
Dan Hart was a coworker.

31:17.940 --> 31:18.940
Oh yeah.

31:18.940 --> 31:19.940
Oh yeah.

31:19.940 --> 31:25.240
And he's just like peeling and just the thinnest layer of old man paper thin skin is coming

31:25.240 --> 31:26.940
off each finger as he does it.

31:26.940 --> 31:27.940
Is it dead skin?

31:27.940 --> 31:28.940
No.

31:28.940 --> 31:29.940
Damn it.

31:29.940 --> 31:30.940
Did Dan die?

31:30.940 --> 31:31.940
Yeah.

31:31.940 --> 31:32.940
How'd he die?

31:32.940 --> 31:33.940
Oh God.

31:33.940 --> 31:34.940
Yeah.

31:34.940 --> 31:40.060
And he finishes and it just, the skin hits the ground and he looks up at you and looks

31:40.060 --> 31:45.940
dead in your eyes and he says, hung himself in front of me.

31:45.940 --> 31:46.940
Oh yeah.

31:46.940 --> 31:47.940
How long ago?

31:47.940 --> 31:49.940
Oh no time.

31:49.940 --> 31:50.940
Well that's true.

31:50.940 --> 31:51.940
Agreed.

31:51.940 --> 31:52.940
Oh yeah.

31:52.940 --> 31:53.940
Oh there it is.

31:53.940 --> 31:54.940
That's the good stuff.

31:54.940 --> 31:59.300
Well you have a fun night.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.260
Carry on citizen.

32:01.260 --> 32:07.580
And as you guys move through, Keith Vigna is coming with you if you'd bring him essentially.

32:07.580 --> 32:14.020
This is the first time I think that Clark has been, has witnessed one of the crew doing

32:14.020 --> 32:15.060
this.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.420
So he wants to turn around on Keith.

32:17.420 --> 32:18.420
Keith.

32:18.420 --> 32:19.420
Keith.

32:19.420 --> 32:20.420
Nothing.

32:20.420 --> 32:21.420
He's just mumbling these.

32:21.420 --> 32:22.420
I'm going to smack him.

32:22.420 --> 32:23.420
Doesn't even face him.

32:23.420 --> 32:24.420
John.

32:24.420 --> 32:25.420
Yeah.

32:25.420 --> 32:26.880
Like John moves to stop his hand as he goes to smack him.

32:26.880 --> 32:29.420
He gets through because he already did it.

32:29.420 --> 32:35.340
But John moves to stop it and he's like, do not disturb the traveler in his moment of

32:35.340 --> 32:37.260
passage.

32:37.260 --> 32:38.260
The traveler.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.420
Is he the...

32:39.420 --> 32:40.420
You are the traveler.

32:40.420 --> 32:41.420
I thought he was.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.420
I don't understand, John.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.420
Keith.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.420
Wake up, dammit.

32:46.420 --> 32:52.140
I turned to Donovan, Donovan, is this, is this what we were like?

32:52.140 --> 32:57.140
Leon was on the floor, but yeah, you guys were just mumbling, mumbling numbers.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.140
You're unresponsive.

32:58.140 --> 32:59.140
Do you remember?

32:59.140 --> 33:00.820
Keith tried to shake you and nothing happened.

33:00.820 --> 33:03.180
Do you remember how long we were like that?

33:03.180 --> 33:04.180
Couple minutes maybe.

33:04.180 --> 33:07.900
All right, then I'm just going to have to hope that Keith snaps out of it in a couple

33:07.900 --> 33:08.900
minutes, I suppose.

33:08.900 --> 33:09.900
Yeah.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.300
All right, let's just continue on then if he's going to follow.

33:12.300 --> 33:15.340
Keith, just, just hold onto my shirt.

33:15.340 --> 33:16.340
Does he?

33:16.340 --> 33:17.340
Sure.

33:17.340 --> 33:18.340
Sure.

33:18.340 --> 33:38.820
And as you guys are nearing the glass hall, Keith comes to.

33:38.820 --> 33:44.900
You guys are approaching glass hall and Keith's eyes kind of stop glazing over.

33:44.900 --> 33:45.900
Keith.

33:45.900 --> 33:46.900
Are you, are you with us?

33:46.900 --> 33:47.900
Can you hear me?

33:47.900 --> 33:48.900
Yeah.

33:48.900 --> 33:49.900
Why wouldn't I be?

33:49.900 --> 33:50.900
It was those numbers again.

33:50.900 --> 33:51.900
They got you.

33:51.900 --> 33:52.900
What?

33:52.900 --> 33:57.460
Well, what was I, which numbers?

33:57.460 --> 33:58.460
Which numbers was he doing?

33:58.460 --> 33:59.460
Bruce Robin.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.880
You were doing Bruce Robin's numbers.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.860
Did I, I mean, I've seen you guys do this before.

34:05.860 --> 34:09.300
Was I just saying them or what kind of stuff was I doing?

34:09.300 --> 34:10.300
Like you're in a trance.

34:10.300 --> 34:13.340
You're just saying the numbers and wouldn't respond to anything.

34:13.340 --> 34:15.700
And I slapped Keith and it didn't work.

34:15.700 --> 34:22.260
I rub my face and I think back to just minutes ago when I slapped his face, I'm like, I wouldn't

34:22.260 --> 34:23.260
have done the same thing.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.260
Clark.

34:24.260 --> 34:25.260
I did do the same thing.

34:25.260 --> 34:29.580
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

34:29.580 --> 34:39.060
Is this the start of Tyler, the creator's, let the needle shine in the light of the moon

34:39.060 --> 34:44.180
until I put them in your eyes.

34:44.180 --> 34:45.580
It is the start of Tyler.

34:45.580 --> 34:48.460
I look at Clark's, what did I miss?

34:48.460 --> 34:49.460
That's new.

34:49.460 --> 34:55.900
And you hear from the entrance to glass hall, seemingly standing like right in front of

34:55.900 --> 34:56.900
the entrance.

34:56.900 --> 35:05.940
There is a college student dude who's dressed in like athletic shorts and slides and a t-shirt

35:05.940 --> 35:11.940
even in all this snow or slides, the slip on slides are like the slip on sandals.

35:11.940 --> 35:14.840
That's such a cool thing to call them.

35:14.840 --> 35:22.460
And that guy is standing completely still in this pose with like his right fist up to

35:22.460 --> 35:27.260
his cheek and then his left hand like flat and up in the air.

35:27.260 --> 35:28.780
What would that pose be called?

35:28.780 --> 35:32.060
It's like the Mr. Alice pose, right?

35:32.060 --> 35:35.940
You're flexing on one side and the other side is a dab.

35:35.940 --> 35:36.940
Yep.

35:36.940 --> 35:42.940
Oh, Joe did it with the little mannequin in here.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.220
We'll put that on Twitter.

35:45.220 --> 35:50.740
He won't bend enough to do it, but dabbing with one arm.

35:50.740 --> 35:59.780
And then, more importantly, there is a young boy in choir robes singing softly and methodically

35:59.780 --> 36:05.420
sticking syringes into this dude who's just standing there.

36:05.420 --> 36:13.180
And as he sings, he's putting a syringe directly into this guy's eye.

36:13.180 --> 36:15.260
Come on, Zach.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.260
You're off the podcast.

36:16.260 --> 36:17.820
Get out of here.

36:17.820 --> 36:18.820
Done.

36:18.820 --> 36:19.820
It's our podcast now.

36:19.900 --> 36:25.060
And it's fucking about just being friends and hanging out and being nice.

36:25.060 --> 36:26.620
It's about being nice.

36:26.620 --> 36:28.300
So get the fuck out of here, Zach.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.580
Zach didn't make it happen.

36:29.580 --> 36:31.900
He's just telling us what happened, guys.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.900
No, no, Justin.

36:33.900 --> 36:34.900
That's just a thing.

36:34.900 --> 36:36.300
He's gaslighted you in the blue.

36:36.300 --> 36:37.300
Zach propaganda.

36:37.300 --> 36:38.300
Yes.

36:38.300 --> 36:39.300
That's Zach-a-ganda.

36:39.300 --> 36:40.300
Zach-a-ganda.

36:40.300 --> 36:45.620
Wait, Zach, go home.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.620
Quick question.

36:46.620 --> 36:48.820
This is just in the lobby of Glass Hall?

36:48.820 --> 36:51.540
This is right in front of the front door of Glass Hall?

36:51.540 --> 36:52.540
Yes.

36:52.540 --> 36:53.540
Outside.

36:53.540 --> 36:54.540
Outside.

36:54.540 --> 36:58.220
I'm imagining the look at me on the captain now, but instead of him pointing at his eyes,

36:58.220 --> 37:02.540
it's just two syringes sticking out of his eyeballs.

37:02.540 --> 37:03.940
You're welcome for that one.

37:03.940 --> 37:06.140
Yeah, Luke should be the DM.

37:06.140 --> 37:10.380
Look at me on the DM now.

37:10.380 --> 37:11.380
I like playing.

37:11.380 --> 37:17.100
I'm going to have everyone roll intelligence because you're all super fucked up right now,

37:17.100 --> 37:20.820
but if you pass an intelligence check, you're going to have to roll sanity.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.740
Hey, I failed.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.740
Yay.

37:23.740 --> 37:25.540
I crit pass with a 22.

37:25.540 --> 37:26.540
Oh my God.

37:26.540 --> 37:27.540
What does that mean?

37:27.540 --> 37:28.540
I crit pass too.

37:28.540 --> 37:29.540
No fucking way.

37:29.540 --> 37:32.700
I got a 66 and yeah, my intelligence is 75.

37:32.700 --> 37:33.700
Hell yeah.

37:33.700 --> 37:34.700
What are the chances?

37:34.700 --> 37:36.700
So you guys auto fail your sanity checks for sure.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.300
My intelligence is not that high, but I...

37:38.300 --> 37:42.020
Go ahead and roll that intelligence for Donovan there, Justin.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.020
48.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.020
I assume a failure.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.020
That is a failure.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.020
Oh really?

37:46.020 --> 37:47.580
I'm dumb and I'm 55.

37:47.580 --> 37:48.580
I'm dumb and I'm 50.

37:48.580 --> 37:49.580
You're not.

37:49.580 --> 37:50.580
You're even lower.

37:50.580 --> 37:51.580
You guys aren't dumb.

37:51.580 --> 37:52.580
Well, you are.

37:52.580 --> 37:53.580
You played dumb.

37:53.580 --> 37:54.580
He's a college student.

37:54.580 --> 37:55.580
Come on.

37:55.580 --> 37:56.580
He is a fifth year senior though.

37:56.580 --> 37:57.580
The standards are higher.

37:57.580 --> 38:00.340
He's a fifth year senior that has only online classes.

38:00.340 --> 38:05.540
No, Donovan is like way too concerned with his own life to pay attention to it.

38:05.540 --> 38:09.660
He like glanced up and was like, ah, it's probably fucked up and immediately went back

38:09.660 --> 38:12.180
to his phone, which is what Justin just did.

38:12.180 --> 38:15.740
Take a note.

38:15.740 --> 38:21.340
So with Luke and Thomas crit succeeding on those intelligence checks, we'll call that

38:21.340 --> 38:29.060
an automatic fail and I need an automatic fail on your sanity check that you would have

38:29.060 --> 38:30.060
had to take.

38:30.060 --> 38:31.340
But what knowledge do we claim?

38:31.340 --> 38:34.740
Well, actually, no, I crit failed.

38:34.740 --> 38:37.820
I'm just kidding.

38:37.820 --> 38:56.220
So I'm going to have the two of you leave the room.

38:56.220 --> 38:58.700
Clark Bishop, Donovan West Haven.

38:58.700 --> 38:59.700
Yes.

38:59.700 --> 39:00.700
Nailed it.

39:00.700 --> 39:01.700
First try.

39:01.700 --> 39:02.700
So proud of you.

39:02.700 --> 39:07.500
The two of you notice as soon as this awful vision is approached.

39:07.500 --> 39:13.580
You see that Keith Vigna and John Lee Pattymore immediately go into themselves and begin chanting

39:13.580 --> 39:15.500
the numbers of Bruce Robin.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.180
God damn it, Donovan, they're gone again.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.180
What's happening?

39:19.180 --> 39:20.180
I don't understand.

39:20.180 --> 39:22.460
Has this always been happening to them lately?

39:22.460 --> 39:24.420
I think it's what's happening to everybody around here.

39:24.420 --> 39:26.260
I mean, you've seen people chanting numbers.

39:26.260 --> 39:28.300
I think I have some connection.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.460
For some reason, we're able to snap out of it appear.

39:30.460 --> 39:31.700
It appears and others aren't.

39:31.700 --> 39:32.700
I don't, I don't know.

39:32.700 --> 39:33.700
I don't either.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.860
I do little snappy fingers in front of Keith and John.

39:36.860 --> 39:37.860
Nothing.

39:37.860 --> 39:38.860
Since I'm not there.

39:38.860 --> 39:39.860
I can't see this building.

39:39.860 --> 39:43.860
Is there, is there an entrance into this building that isn't with these freakos in front of it?

39:43.860 --> 39:46.340
They are far enough away from the entrance that you could go around.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.340
I can skirt around.

39:47.340 --> 39:48.340
That's exactly what I want to do.

39:48.340 --> 39:49.340
Donovan.

39:49.340 --> 39:51.420
I mean, I think we got to keep our eye on the prize.

39:51.420 --> 39:52.740
These guys are going to snap out of it soon.

39:52.740 --> 39:56.940
I got, we just have to wrangle up your three other friends that are all in a trance right

39:56.940 --> 39:57.940
now.

39:57.940 --> 39:58.940
Oh yeah.

39:58.940 --> 39:59.940
Leon's with us still too, isn't he?

39:59.940 --> 40:00.940
No.

40:00.940 --> 40:01.940
Oh yes.

40:01.940 --> 40:02.940
Oh my God.

40:02.940 --> 40:13.020
Why is, why do you think he's not snapping out of it?

40:13.020 --> 40:14.860
That's a goddamn good question, Donovan.

40:14.860 --> 40:16.420
I don't know why he's not snapping out of it.

40:16.420 --> 40:17.420
I do.

40:17.420 --> 40:20.060
I, I go back to Leon again, do a couple of snaps in front of his face.

40:20.060 --> 40:21.060
Leon!

40:21.060 --> 40:22.060
Leon, get back here!

40:22.060 --> 40:23.540
He is just boogying on down.

40:23.540 --> 40:24.540
Can't stop, won't stop.

40:24.540 --> 40:25.540
I don't know, Donovan.

40:25.540 --> 40:26.540
I don't know.

40:26.540 --> 40:27.540
I don't know.

40:27.540 --> 40:28.540
Why is this not happening to me?

40:28.540 --> 40:29.540
I don't understand.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.500
I'm starting to think that you're the key to all this.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.900
I just don't understand what to do with that.

40:33.900 --> 40:36.880
The lights inside glass hall are on.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.820
If you want to go around the back, I know, I know a good way.

40:39.820 --> 40:41.960
I took it because I was always running late.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.460
Whatever it gives us to the lab sooner.

40:43.460 --> 40:47.300
Donovan, I don't even know what we're going to find there, but it is the task we've set

40:47.300 --> 40:50.020
before us and I think we need to just stay the course.

40:50.020 --> 40:52.080
Whatever you say, Clark, I'll follow you.

40:52.080 --> 40:56.740
So do you guys want to skirt around this site and get into these front doors or do you want

40:56.740 --> 40:59.940
to go around the side down an alleyway into the back?

40:59.940 --> 41:01.140
No, the lights are on, right?

41:01.140 --> 41:02.140
Yeah.

41:02.140 --> 41:04.780
I'm going, I'm beelining for the door with the lights on.

41:04.780 --> 41:05.780
I'll lead them to the side entrance.

41:05.780 --> 41:08.980
Okay, and you lead the other three in, wait, what?

41:08.980 --> 41:09.980
Donovan, over here.

41:09.980 --> 41:10.980
These, these here.

41:10.980 --> 41:11.980
These are the doors.

41:11.980 --> 41:13.580
I'm like, I'm slowly walking away.

41:13.580 --> 41:15.140
You were walking with the other three.

41:15.140 --> 41:18.580
Yeah, I have the other three like dog leashes with me.

41:18.580 --> 41:20.500
Clark's like, hey, hey, come back over here.

41:20.500 --> 41:27.060
And as soon as you guys walk into glass hall, you see it's a nice like big entry foyer into

41:27.060 --> 41:32.380
this and there are stairs immediately in front of you that lead down and there's a

41:32.380 --> 41:36.020
sign that says biology lab in the basement.

41:36.020 --> 41:41.260
As that happens, you hear, go ahead and roll alertness, both of you for me.

41:41.260 --> 41:43.880
I pass a 27 on a 70.

41:43.880 --> 41:49.140
I got a 44, so either a crit fail or a crit success.

41:49.140 --> 41:56.740
You guys both hear the slapping of feet coming around the corner and heading down a hallway

41:56.740 --> 41:59.140
toward you on your left side.

41:59.140 --> 42:05.980
And you hear a woman's voice saying two, five, one, four, one, oh, got to get the gifts.

42:05.980 --> 42:06.980
Got to get.

42:06.980 --> 42:07.980
Oh yeah.

42:07.980 --> 42:12.480
And then, uh, and then that's where he just got and just like running while just like

42:12.480 --> 42:15.620
slurring and saying these numbers as they're coming.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.560
Clark is basking in the light.

42:17.560 --> 42:21.100
He's uh, arms outstretched, looking up at the fluorescent lights above him.

42:21.100 --> 42:22.500
Donovan, didn't that just feel good?

42:22.500 --> 42:24.220
Clark, what are you, what's going on?

42:24.220 --> 42:25.220
What are you doing?

42:25.220 --> 42:26.220
Just doesn't it feel good?

42:26.900 --> 42:27.900
What feels good?

42:27.900 --> 42:28.900
The light.

42:28.900 --> 42:31.860
It feels like, it doesn't feel like anything.

42:31.860 --> 42:32.860
It's fluorescent lighting.

42:32.860 --> 42:33.860
It feels bad.

42:33.860 --> 42:34.860
Just stretch them out.

42:34.860 --> 42:35.860
To my eyes.

42:35.860 --> 42:36.860
Just stretch them out, Donnie.

42:36.860 --> 42:37.860
Just stretch out those arms.

42:37.860 --> 42:40.900
Donovan like does like a weird, like very slight stretch.

42:40.900 --> 42:43.220
Clark stands a little straighter, pops his neck.

42:43.220 --> 42:44.880
All right, where's his lab?

42:44.880 --> 42:47.060
Is it back down that way where the voices are?

42:47.060 --> 42:50.900
You do, you see a sign that says biology lab in the basement.

42:50.900 --> 42:54.900
The footsteps and the words mumbling weren't coming from any direction near there.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.460
No, they were coming from a hallway.

42:56.460 --> 42:57.460
Yeah, okay.

42:57.460 --> 43:02.700
I think we should just go down and not engage with this other person.

43:02.700 --> 43:04.500
I'm with you Don, let's go.

43:04.500 --> 43:10.220
And as you guys head down the stairs, you hear the footsteps turn around and head back

43:10.220 --> 43:11.460
the opposite way.

43:11.460 --> 43:15.220
You notice John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna snap out of it.

43:24.900 --> 43:28.980
What's up everybody?

43:28.980 --> 43:35.020
Wolf the dog here.

43:35.020 --> 43:37.540
Don't use this.

43:37.540 --> 43:42.500
Every time you're on mic, what you're saying is being recorded.

43:42.500 --> 43:43.740
We know that's not true.

43:43.740 --> 43:44.740
You come to-

43:44.740 --> 43:46.220
Because you leave so much gold on the floor.

43:46.220 --> 43:51.500
You're standing on the stairs of a building that you don't remember walking into and you

43:51.500 --> 43:57.980
look over and you see Donovan Westhaven and Clark Bishop staring at you.

43:57.980 --> 44:03.420
And right behind you is Leon Simpson, still just grooving and grinding and bumping and

44:03.420 --> 44:04.420
dapping.

44:04.420 --> 44:07.380
Are we on the inside of this building or-

44:07.380 --> 44:12.980
You are on the inside of this building and as you all look down, you see that these stairs

44:12.980 --> 44:20.260
are covered in a trail of blood that is leading down into the basement and there are loose

44:20.260 --> 44:23.780
screwdrivers that have been spilled onto these stairs.

44:23.780 --> 44:26.580
So are we on the stairs that we're on are descending?

44:26.580 --> 44:27.580
Yes.

44:27.580 --> 44:31.700
Can we see where they might have been secured before they were strewn across these stairs?

44:31.700 --> 44:32.700
No.

44:32.700 --> 44:33.700
I know.

44:33.700 --> 44:34.700
That's a joke.

44:34.700 --> 44:35.700
Oh, it was good.

44:35.700 --> 44:36.700
It's not.

44:36.700 --> 44:37.700
I'm sorry.

44:37.700 --> 44:38.700
Welcome back, fellas.

44:38.700 --> 44:39.700
See the light in your eyes now.

44:39.700 --> 44:40.700
What?

44:40.700 --> 44:41.700
It happened again.

44:41.700 --> 44:42.700
I know.

44:42.700 --> 44:49.460
I feel every time I wake up from something like that, I don't feel like I've lost anything

44:49.460 --> 44:54.900
but when I look at you and you've got this weird look on your face, I realize that-

44:54.900 --> 45:00.820
You haven't lost anything nor have they gained anything while seemingly you were gone.

45:00.820 --> 45:02.240
Quick question for you, Zach.

45:02.240 --> 45:05.260
Did we gain anything from those intelligence rules?

45:05.260 --> 45:06.260
Nope.

45:06.260 --> 45:07.260
God damn it.

45:07.260 --> 45:09.880
Can we gain any unnatural for being knocked out all these times?

45:09.880 --> 45:12.700
You do lose a D4 of sanity.

45:12.700 --> 45:14.980
So if you want to each roll a D4-

45:14.980 --> 45:15.980
Oh, cool.

45:15.980 --> 45:17.620
I wanted to roll.

45:18.620 --> 45:19.620
I got a four.

45:19.620 --> 45:20.620
Tight.

45:20.620 --> 45:21.620
Me too.

45:21.620 --> 45:23.620
This is fucking crazy.

45:23.620 --> 45:24.620
All right.

45:24.620 --> 45:26.020
So you each lose four sanity.

45:26.020 --> 45:27.900
That brings me down to four sanity.

45:27.900 --> 45:29.060
Where are you at, Luke?

45:29.060 --> 45:30.180
I'm at 19.

45:30.180 --> 45:32.940
My breaking point is 18.

45:32.940 --> 45:35.540
You're the sane one here, man.

45:35.540 --> 45:39.300
I also didn't recalculate my breaking point.

45:39.300 --> 45:42.300
You hit your last breaking point exactly so it's minus your power.

45:42.300 --> 45:43.300
Yeah.

45:43.300 --> 45:44.300
There's no more breaking points for me.

45:44.300 --> 45:45.300
All right.

45:45.300 --> 45:50.940
I tried to write on this soft desk and instead of a nine, I just ripped the paper.

45:50.940 --> 45:52.460
So give me a sec.

45:52.460 --> 45:53.460
Character sheets, baby.

45:53.460 --> 45:56.020
You're insane.

45:56.020 --> 46:01.100
As you guys come to as you're walking down these stairs, you notice that there is a young

46:01.100 --> 46:08.940
small ugly child wearing a backpack that is cleaning the baseboards with the veracity

46:08.940 --> 46:10.820
of the veracity?

46:10.820 --> 46:12.820
What's veracity?

46:12.820 --> 46:15.140
Veracity is truthfulness.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.440
Veracity is speed.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.540
So somewhere in the middle there.

46:19.540 --> 46:25.460
I think veracity is like how- Veracity is how velociraptory you are.

46:25.460 --> 46:26.460
Oh yeah.

46:26.460 --> 46:27.460
No.

46:27.460 --> 46:31.440
The kid has his arms tucked in real tight and is just on his back haunches cleaning

46:31.440 --> 46:33.580
the shit out of these baseboards.

46:33.580 --> 46:35.220
Real velociraptory.

46:35.220 --> 46:39.860
I pull my gun out and shoot him.

46:39.860 --> 46:40.860
I do not do that.

46:40.860 --> 46:42.860
You're the one at 19.

46:42.860 --> 46:44.860
I don't do that.

46:44.860 --> 46:46.220
I'm at four.

46:46.220 --> 46:52.100
But the trail of blood moves past this child and into the floor below that you cannot see

46:52.100 --> 46:53.100
yet.

46:53.100 --> 46:54.100
I look at Clark.

46:54.100 --> 46:55.100
Do you know what this blood is from?

46:55.100 --> 46:56.100
I don't.

46:56.100 --> 46:59.820
There was a sign up at the top up there that the biology lab was down this way.

46:59.820 --> 47:01.900
So we just started moving down this way.

47:01.900 --> 47:08.280
It doesn't look good, but I think, I mean- The trail of blood is leading to the lab?

47:08.280 --> 47:09.280
To or from.

47:09.280 --> 47:10.280
Can we tell?

47:10.280 --> 47:11.280
Yeah.

47:11.280 --> 47:12.280
Can we tell?

47:12.280 --> 47:13.280
He said it was going down there.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.280
It is moving toward.

47:14.700 --> 47:18.480
It's moving from the stairs the way that the blood is tripping and the way that the blood

47:18.480 --> 47:19.480
is like slid.

47:19.480 --> 47:20.480
Are there any footprints?

47:20.480 --> 47:21.480
It's being slid.

47:21.480 --> 47:27.720
No, it seems to have been like, actually, go ahead and roll forensics.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.080
I have a zero.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.720
Do I even need to roll?

47:30.720 --> 47:31.720
No.

47:31.720 --> 47:32.720
I failed.

47:32.720 --> 47:33.720
A 58 on a 50.

47:33.720 --> 47:34.720
I got an 88.

47:34.720 --> 47:35.720
Is that a 50?

47:35.720 --> 47:36.720
I got a 20.

47:36.720 --> 47:37.720
I got a 40.

47:37.720 --> 47:38.720
Okay.

47:38.720 --> 47:44.080
John Lee Pettymore would know that the blood is a person's body that was army crawling.

47:44.080 --> 47:46.840
Away from there or down the stairs?

47:46.840 --> 47:51.160
Someone in great pain crawled this way.

47:51.160 --> 47:55.240
I just look at Clark and Donovan and wait for their next move.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.840
I look at Donovan.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.280
Where's that lab?

47:59.280 --> 48:00.280
It's down here.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.280
It's just to the right.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.280
We're almost there.

48:02.280 --> 48:03.640
Clark, I'm scared.

48:03.640 --> 48:11.760
As I'm walking down the stairs, my pants have become uncuffed, and so they're draping around

48:11.760 --> 48:13.520
my shoes a little bit.

48:13.520 --> 48:18.720
And I slip, and I fall, and I just slide down the rest of the stairs.

48:18.720 --> 48:28.880
And then I need everyone to leave the room real quick, except for Luke.

48:28.880 --> 48:44.200
Luke, due to the sanity mechanics of this arc of the campaign, I need you to roll a

48:44.200 --> 48:48.920
D100 three times for me, and tell me the three numbers that you roll.

48:48.920 --> 48:53.760
A 6, a 52, and a 74.

48:53.760 --> 48:59.120
You are going to choose between three manias, and this mania that you choose is going to

48:59.120 --> 49:06.080
take over your entire personality, who you are, and everything goals-wise, what your

49:06.080 --> 49:08.840
character is oriented towards.

49:08.840 --> 49:14.480
Number 6 is agromania, the intense desire to be in open spaces.

49:14.480 --> 49:23.120
52 is habromania, an abnormal tendency to create pleasant delusions in spite of reality.

49:23.120 --> 49:26.800
So you would see something good, even when it's bad.

49:26.800 --> 49:27.800
Exactly.

49:27.800 --> 49:36.440
And 74 is onomamania, which is an obsession with names, people, places, things.

49:36.440 --> 49:40.080
I'm going to go with the second one.

49:40.080 --> 49:47.720
Yes, 52, which is habromania, which is an abnormal tendency to create pleasant delusions

49:47.720 --> 49:49.600
in spite of reality.

49:49.600 --> 49:54.600
As you're walking down the stairs, you slip and you fall to the bottom.

49:54.600 --> 50:01.160
You see that there is just a trail of money from where you fell further into the basement

50:01.160 --> 50:06.240
level, and there's just a pile of cash sitting there.

50:06.240 --> 50:12.880
As I'm following the trail of money, I'm picking up every dollar, stuffing it into my, as we

50:12.880 --> 50:14.880
know at this point, big britches.

50:14.880 --> 50:16.160
Yo, huge.

50:16.200 --> 50:21.960
Once I get up to the pile of money, I am standing there and I'm just handfuls of cash, shoving

50:21.960 --> 50:22.960
them into my pockets.

50:22.960 --> 50:23.960
Fantastic.

50:23.960 --> 50:25.160
I'm going to get the other boys.

50:25.160 --> 50:46.480
As Donovan Westhaven, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore, and a groovin' Leon Simpson make

50:46.480 --> 50:53.420
their way down the stairs, you see Keith Vigna slips, falls, and at the bottom of the stairs,

50:53.420 --> 51:00.100
he lands in this pile of blood and loose screwdrivers, and he begins grabbing these screwdrivers

51:00.100 --> 51:05.420
and putting them in his pockets, and then he's like grabbing up some of the blood, putting

51:05.420 --> 51:12.860
it in his pockets, and as you guys continue down, I look at Clark, Clark, once this is

51:12.860 --> 51:21.380
all over, I'm going to buy you as many TV dinners as you want, as many as you want.

51:21.380 --> 51:24.660
You're going to buy me, I'll buy them all for you.

51:24.660 --> 51:26.980
And then I continue shoving.

51:26.980 --> 51:35.660
And well, see the thing is that as you continue shoving, they see you approach this flaccid,

51:35.660 --> 51:43.300
bloody pile of an elderly woman's body that has screwdrivers just jutting out of it all

51:43.300 --> 51:48.700
over the place, and Keith Vigna is grabbing these screwdrivers and pulling them out of

51:48.700 --> 51:52.420
this lady and putting them in his giant britches.

51:52.420 --> 51:55.420
Keith, what the fuck are you doing?

51:55.420 --> 51:56.420
Are you kidding?

51:56.420 --> 51:59.820
I mean, how are you guys not excited?

51:59.820 --> 52:01.820
Oh my god!

52:01.820 --> 52:02.820
Excited about...

52:02.820 --> 52:04.820
Keith, stop picking us up!

52:04.820 --> 52:05.820
We're rich!

52:05.820 --> 52:06.820
We're rich!

52:06.820 --> 52:07.820
Rich?

52:07.820 --> 52:08.820
Yeah!

52:08.820 --> 52:09.820
Oh my god!

52:09.820 --> 52:12.540
Don't, don't get excited.

52:12.540 --> 52:16.220
All material gain is merely temporary.

52:16.220 --> 52:17.220
It's impermanent.

52:17.220 --> 52:18.220
Keith, you're-

52:18.740 --> 52:19.740
I'm just a fool.

52:19.740 --> 52:23.660
These, these riches are merely illusory.

52:23.660 --> 52:27.780
I look back at you, I'm like, I don't know why I'm even, I don't need to be here anymore.

52:27.780 --> 52:31.300
I don't, this was my job, but I don't need one anymore.

52:31.300 --> 52:37.420
And I look at Clark and I put my finger in my nose.

52:37.420 --> 52:40.580
We're going to have a hell of a life.

52:40.580 --> 52:43.020
Is that a Kanye reference?

52:43.020 --> 52:44.900
It wasn't, but yeah, now it is, yes.

52:44.900 --> 52:48.660
I need Thomas, Joe, and Justin to roll Sanity for me.

52:48.660 --> 52:52.460
Did you hear me say it's a one?

52:52.460 --> 52:53.460
Oh shit.

52:53.460 --> 52:55.980
Uh, 26 on a one.

52:55.980 --> 52:57.860
70 on a four.

52:57.860 --> 52:58.860
I passed mine.

52:58.860 --> 52:59.860
Okay, cool.

52:59.860 --> 53:00.860
As is tradition.

53:00.860 --> 53:01.860
Good for you.

53:01.860 --> 53:03.860
Good for you, Justin.

53:03.860 --> 53:08.300
Okay, so Clark, you're gonna lose your last Sanity.

53:08.300 --> 53:11.620
Can I play it out, or do you have something else?

53:11.620 --> 53:15.180
Yes, but real quick, John Lee Pettymore, roll a D4 for me.

53:15.180 --> 53:16.180
Please roll a four.

53:16.180 --> 53:17.180
Actually, roll a D6.

53:17.180 --> 53:18.180
No, fuck you.

53:18.180 --> 53:22.380
I've got a D4 in my hands, and I rolled a two.

53:22.380 --> 53:27.420
You can, I'm not taking your shit this year, Zach.

53:27.420 --> 53:28.420
2020.

53:28.420 --> 53:29.420
2020.

53:29.420 --> 53:33.900
2020, lose two Sanity.

53:33.900 --> 53:36.060
I'm at two and I'm doing fine.

53:36.060 --> 53:38.340
Yeah, you are, baby.

53:38.340 --> 53:40.180
You do run the shit.

53:40.180 --> 53:43.020
You do immediately start chanting numbers, however.

53:43.020 --> 53:45.420
Those aren't numbers.

53:45.420 --> 53:48.100
They might as well represent numbers, right?

53:48.100 --> 53:51.700
Joe, if you would like to fully lose your Sanity.

53:51.700 --> 53:52.700
I didn't have a big thing.

53:52.700 --> 53:58.540
I was just gonna wide-eyed look at Keith and say, can I help you carry some of those?

53:58.540 --> 54:03.780
I remove my finger from my nose and I offer it to him.

54:03.780 --> 54:09.140
I don't know what it means, but- I shove it up his nose and I hold my thumb

54:09.140 --> 54:13.100
like I'm shooting a finger gun and I...

54:13.100 --> 54:20.140
And a fat bump of cocaine goes straight up into your dome.

54:20.140 --> 54:21.260
Of real cocaine?

54:21.260 --> 54:24.460
Real cocaine, out of Keith Vigna's finger.

54:24.460 --> 54:27.420
Which the Patreon subscribers paid for.

54:27.420 --> 54:33.620
And in that exact moment, Clark Bishop's eyes go blank and he begins chanting,

54:33.620 --> 54:38.900
Ta-way alico, ta-way alico, ta-way alico, ta-way alico.

54:38.900 --> 54:40.420
He's feeling it.

54:40.420 --> 54:41.420
He's feeling it.

54:41.420 --> 54:45.220
I look over at John and Donovan and I'm like, he's feeling it.

54:45.220 --> 54:47.900
John leans into your finger.

54:47.900 --> 54:52.040
I am the universe experiencing myself.

54:52.040 --> 54:57.140
And I finger gun up into him as well.

54:57.140 --> 54:58.220
What's Donovan doing?

54:58.220 --> 55:00.100
Freaking the fuck out.

55:00.100 --> 55:03.340
Donovan, this is college, baby.

55:03.340 --> 55:05.340
This is college, baby.

55:33.340 --> 55:41.340
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

55:41.340 --> 55:52.340
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

55:52.340 --> 56:04.340
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
