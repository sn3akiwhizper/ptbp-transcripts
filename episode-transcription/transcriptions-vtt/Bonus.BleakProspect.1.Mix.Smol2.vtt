00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What's snazzy, my pips?

00:02.000 --> 00:08.500
It's your knobby, sloppy, off-the-cobby, radio host with the absolute most.

00:08.500 --> 00:13.800
Your butter and egg man with jams and toast, it's Wolf the dog.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.300
If you're not yet big, then you may be a grower,

00:17.300 --> 00:21.300
cuz I'm blowin' your wig from my radio blower.

00:21.300 --> 00:29.300
Here on 694.2 PTBP, the internet's oldest and only radio station.

00:29.300 --> 00:36.800
This installment of Howlin' with Wolf is from The Duckman in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.800
They write,

00:37.800 --> 00:40.000
To the boys of Best Korea,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.300
Wibble Wobble Dingle Chungus,

00:42.300 --> 00:44.600
Wumbo Dingo Tringus,

00:44.600 --> 00:47.500
and a whole lotta love to you, Wolf,

00:47.500 --> 00:52.300
for introducing me to the magical musicians of Missouri known as Kudzu.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.800
No backbone is the bee's knees.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.300
You're the top dog in my books, Wolf.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.800
Keep up that good work,

00:58.800 --> 01:03.800
and I hope you find some extra good scraps in tonight's trash can.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.800
You shred it, Wheat.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.300
Remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,

01:09.300 --> 01:10.800
tag us on the internet,

01:10.800 --> 01:12.800
uh-uh, fuck Mark Zuckerberg,

01:12.800 --> 01:16.800
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.

01:16.800 --> 01:21.300
All the links are in the damn show notes like they always have been.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.800
Why don't y'all take a look for one second?

01:23.800 --> 01:24.800
I'll wait.

01:25.800 --> 01:31.800
I found a handy-dandy little book here of common phrases used back in the 1930s

01:31.800 --> 01:36.800
to set the stage for the special presentation I have for you today.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.800
So, uh, shake a leg,

01:38.800 --> 01:40.800
split with those getaway sticks,

01:40.800 --> 01:44.800
and grab a swell glass of city juice with your meat paws.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.800
In my cave, it's all wet to be dried out,

01:48.800 --> 01:51.800
so double down on your dog soup.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.800
I might be behind the grind,

01:53.800 --> 01:57.800
but these fine expressions from the time of Great Depression,

01:57.800 --> 01:59.800
they align with wolf's obsessions.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.800
Now, time to perform my midnight profession.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.800
So unwind from uniform strife and oppression,

02:07.800 --> 02:11.800
and mainline this newfangled warm-life lesson.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.800
It's Grady Philip Drug with Real Life.

02:23.800 --> 02:28.800
Easy times feel less than serene

02:28.800 --> 02:35.800
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings

02:35.800 --> 02:41.800
So we long for days gone past

02:41.800 --> 02:45.800
As grief and strife

02:45.800 --> 02:51.800
Bloody, that's real life

02:54.800 --> 02:57.800
Moment of silence, 30 seconds of silence

02:57.800 --> 03:02.800
for our nearly departed dipshit in the Oval Office.

03:02.800 --> 03:08.800
I said silence, Joe.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.800
Don't make jokes, Zach.

03:23.800 --> 03:33.800
That's, that's 30, right?

03:33.800 --> 03:36.800
That was close.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.800
Zach, Zach, before you clarified Oval Office,

03:41.800 --> 03:43.800
when you said nearly departed dipshit,

03:43.800 --> 03:48.800
I thought you were talking about Luke.

03:48.800 --> 03:54.800
Oh, no!

03:54.800 --> 03:57.800
His Scott is our, he is our dipshit.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.800
We love him a lot.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.800
Oh, we miss you, Luke.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.800
Luke isn't here with us today,

04:04.800 --> 04:10.800
but who is with us today is a man who I've spent a lot of time

04:10.800 --> 04:15.800
listening to and learning from about Call of Cthulhu

04:15.800 --> 04:18.800
and other horror gaming in general,

04:18.800 --> 04:22.800
Mr. Scott Dorward, whose credits include

04:22.800 --> 04:26.800
working on Cubicle Seven's World War Cthulhu line,

04:26.800 --> 04:29.800
let's see, working on Dead of Night,

04:29.800 --> 04:31.800
Cthulhu Dark,

04:31.800 --> 04:34.800
Pulp Cthulhu's first campaign, the Two-Headed Serpent,

04:34.800 --> 04:38.800
and of course, he is one of the good friends of Jackson Elias

04:38.800 --> 04:42.800
over on the absolutely delightful podcast,

04:42.800 --> 04:45.800
The Good Friends of Jackson Elias.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.800
Thanks for joining us, Scott.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.800
Oh, well, thank you so much for inviting me, Zach.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.800
This is a great pleasure,

04:52.800 --> 04:55.800
and I am looking forward to putting you through hell.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.800
Yeah, that's what we like to hear.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.800
Ooh, love being on the other side of it.

05:01.800 --> 05:06.800
Can you give us a quick rundown of who you are

05:06.800 --> 05:10.800
for the people listening at home and what you do?

05:10.800 --> 05:12.800
Yes, okay.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.800
Or I can just say everything I just said again.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.800
No, no, I can introduce myself.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.800
I'm a big boy.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.800
Yes.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.800
So, yes, I'm Scott Dorward.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.800
I am a writer and editor.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.800
I've worked primarily on Call of Cthulhu products,

05:34.800 --> 05:38.800
but done work on a number of other RPGs.

05:39.800 --> 05:44.800
I do a bunch of podcasting,

05:44.800 --> 05:46.800
as well as The Good Friends of Jackson Elias,

05:46.800 --> 05:48.800
which Zach mentioned.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.800
I'm also a cast member on the How We Roll podcast

05:51.800 --> 05:56.800
and a semi-regular on Ain't Slayed Nobody.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.800
So, yeah, I am.

06:00.800 --> 06:05.800
I get around, but yes, it is.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.800
Well, we're glad to have you as our bedfellow this evening

06:08.800 --> 06:11.800
running The Bleak Prospect here.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.800
To lead our nightmares.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.800
Yes. Well, thank you very much.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.800
Yeah, this scenario, Bleak Prospect,

06:17.800 --> 06:21.800
comes from the Chaosium publication Nameless Horrors,

06:21.800 --> 06:25.800
which was the first book that Matt Sanderson, Paul Fricker,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.800
and I, The Good Friends of Jackson Elias,

06:27.800 --> 06:30.800
did for Chaosium some years back.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.800
And, yeah, this is not a happy scenario,

06:35.800 --> 06:38.800
but I'm sure we can find a few laughs in there,

06:38.800 --> 06:43.800
even if they're just sort of bitter laughs of despair.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.800
You can rely on us for those, for sure.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.800
Excellent.

06:47.800 --> 06:53.800
So the scenario takes place in November of 1932.

06:53.800 --> 06:58.800
The setup is that you are all residents of the same shanty town

06:58.800 --> 07:03.800
on the outskirts of a town called Crawley in Massachusetts.

07:03.800 --> 07:09.800
The residents of the shanty town, or Hooverville as it's often known as,

07:09.800 --> 07:13.800
are all people who have fallen through the cracks of society

07:13.800 --> 07:15.800
in the Great Depression.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.800
The Great Depression has been going on for a couple of years now

07:17.800 --> 07:20.800
and things are bleak.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.800
This shanty town is perhaps a little more afflicted than most, however,

07:24.800 --> 07:31.800
because as well as the normal depredations of poverty and homelessness,

07:31.800 --> 07:35.800
you're also having to contend with a mystery disease

07:35.800 --> 07:38.800
that is going through the camp as well.

07:38.800 --> 07:45.800
The illness is proving hard to pin down.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.800
Dr. Coombs, who we'll get to in a moment,

07:47.800 --> 07:52.800
has been doing some work on trying to research it and understand it

07:52.800 --> 07:56.800
and maybe find some way of helping the people who are afflicted.

07:56.800 --> 08:04.800
The main symptoms seem to be lethargy, muscle wasting,

08:04.800 --> 08:12.800
perhaps flaking skin, and just general sickness.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.800
People are just run down.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.800
The effect on the camp is varied.

08:18.800 --> 08:24.800
Some people, like the player characters, are very much in the walking wooded category.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.800
They're still functioning, even if they're not feeling tip-top.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.800
Others, however, are beginning to suffer quite badly.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.800
There are one or two, in fact one in particular,

08:35.800 --> 08:42.800
who we'll come to when we introduce Dr. Coombs, who is doing very badly indeed.

08:42.800 --> 08:47.800
On top of all this, there are all sorts of weird stories going around the camp.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.800
There are a few kids who live in the camp, and they tell odd stories

08:50.800 --> 08:55.800
of how there are things going on at night,

08:55.800 --> 09:00.800
that people have been seen in the camp at night who don't live there,

09:00.800 --> 09:05.800
strange people, people who don't have faces.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.800
But this is the kind of story that kids tell,

09:08.800 --> 09:12.800
so I'm sure there's nothing to it and you have nothing to worry about.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.800
You usually don't in these kind of games.

09:17.800 --> 09:22.800
And I think this probably gives us a good opportunity to introduce the player characters.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.800
Shall we go around in turn and just say who you're playing

09:25.800 --> 09:30.800
and what has brought you to living in the shanty town?

09:30.800 --> 09:32.800
Do you want to start, Zach?

09:32.800 --> 09:35.800
My name is Frederick Mellon I,

09:35.800 --> 09:40.800
and I've been living in this Hoover town pretty much since its inception.

09:40.800 --> 09:45.800
I was a very, very bitter old man,

09:45.800 --> 09:49.800
just living in the city scrounging about my way,

09:49.800 --> 09:55.800
spending my time sending my fingers into another men's pockets,

09:55.800 --> 09:59.800
and just trying to get by as best that I could.

09:59.800 --> 10:04.800
But now, now I live in the same world as everybody else,

10:04.800 --> 10:08.800
and it's nice, they've seen my side of things,

10:08.800 --> 10:11.800
and I'm showing them the dark ways of the world as well.

10:11.800 --> 10:18.800
So I'm here in this little Hooverville just trying to teach my fellow man how to scrape by,

10:18.800 --> 10:24.800
by digging into all those around who have so, so much.

10:24.800 --> 10:28.800
Because the world, it's a terrible fucking place.

10:28.800 --> 10:34.800
But if you put a smile on, you just forget and forget about it,

10:34.800 --> 10:38.800
then everything's gonna be okay, okay, all right, hey!

10:40.800 --> 10:41.800
Perfect.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.800
Can we see if Zach's character has a face?

10:51.800 --> 10:54.800
I'm not entirely convinced that it's not just a mask or painted on,

10:54.800 --> 10:57.800
but yeah, he has what appears to be a face.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.800
So, Joe, do you want to introduce your character next?

11:02.800 --> 11:03.800
Sure.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.800
Say exactly what I said.

11:05.800 --> 11:06.800
Yeah.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.800
I'm Frederick Mellon the First.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.800
Fuck, this is embarrassing.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.800
I'm a burglar.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.800
Shit.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.800
Don't you hate it when that happens?

11:19.800 --> 11:20.800
Yeah.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.800
I'm Nathaniel Coombs.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.800
I'm the local, I guess, doctor around here.

11:27.800 --> 11:32.800
I was the head of the Bentham Hospital back in the day,

11:32.800 --> 11:39.800
and then the crash hit, and I fell with it, man.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.800
I ended up right there at the bottom.

11:41.800 --> 11:46.800
And if things weren't bad then, I got sick, I got this thing,

11:46.800 --> 11:48.800
I got this thing I just can't figure out.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.800
It's making me, it's giving me blackouts.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.800
I can't find the will to move around some days.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.800
It's just, and everybody here, everybody seems to be getting it,

12:01.800 --> 12:03.800
and I just, I can't figure it out.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.800
I just, I wish I was better.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.800
I wish I could just figure it out.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.800
I wish I could help them all, but I just can't get it.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.800
I don't know what it is.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.800
I spend my day doing what I can with nothing,

12:16.800 --> 12:21.800
and my old protégé, Dr. Cavendish, he comes and helps sometimes,

12:21.800 --> 12:23.800
and there's, of course, Billy.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.800
He keeps everybody's spirits up around here as much as he can,

12:26.800 --> 12:31.800
but I just, I wish I could lick this thing.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.800
I don't know what to do.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.800
Nice.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.800
Lethargy, blacking out?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.800
Do I have this disease?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.800
Oh, boy.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.800
Oh, and finally.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.800
Yeah, if you've been hanging around the shantytown a while,

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
you probably know me.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.800
I'm Thomas Dolan.

12:51.800 --> 12:57.800
My story's not too dissimilar from Nathaniel's, from Dr. Coombes.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.800
I was doing good before the Depression.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.800
I had worked my way out of poverty.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.800
I'm a second-generation Irish immigrant,

13:08.800 --> 13:12.800
and I built more than my father had before me.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.800
I did it straight, unlike a lot of people in my neighborhood,

13:14.800 --> 13:16.800
and things were going good.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.800
I weathered the storm a little better than most.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.800
I was crawling my way back up.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.800
I was almost living like normal again,

13:23.800 --> 13:26.800
and then, like Nathaniel, I came down.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.800
I came down with this sickness,

13:29.800 --> 13:31.800
and it just took everything from me.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.800
It weakened me.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.800
At that point, it was almost like my partner,

13:35.800 --> 13:37.800
my business partner, was energized.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.800
He started succeeding in everything I failed at,

13:41.800 --> 13:44.800
and, well, he's got the business now,

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
and here I am sitting with all of you.

13:46.800 --> 13:51.800
So, yeah, I kind of want to help the doctor here in any way I can,

13:51.800 --> 13:54.800
because what's eating away at me on the inside

13:54.800 --> 13:56.800
is eating away at a lot of people in this camp,

13:56.800 --> 13:58.800
and it's not right.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.800
Nice.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.800
Well, it is a cold November morning.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.800
The camp is beginning to come to life.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.800
People are getting up and about

14:09.800 --> 14:12.800
and performing their morning routines, such as they are.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.800
There's a group of people who are out making a campfire

14:16.800 --> 14:19.800
where they're going to boil up some used coffee grounds

14:19.800 --> 14:21.800
and possibly some old roots that they've dug up

14:21.800 --> 14:24.800
to make what passes for coffee around here.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.800
There are a few people who are cooking

14:26.800 --> 14:28.800
what supplies they've managed to salvage

14:28.800 --> 14:34.800
or, in some cases, buy to make some breakfast.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.800
And in the medical shack,

14:37.800 --> 14:42.800
Dr. Coombs is busy looking after a patient.

14:42.800 --> 14:47.800
For the last couple of days, you've had Harold Priestley there.

14:47.800 --> 14:54.800
He is a former journalist who worked at the Crawl Examiner,

14:54.800 --> 14:59.800
but he and his wife have been at the camp for some time,

14:59.800 --> 15:03.800
and Harold, out of all the patients you've had here,

15:03.800 --> 15:06.800
has been the worst hit with whatever this disease is.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.800
This morning, you're fairly certain

15:08.800 --> 15:12.800
that this is going to be his last day.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.800
His breathing has been extremely labored.

15:16.800 --> 15:24.800
You can hear, oh, maybe what sounds like a death rattle in his lungs,

15:24.800 --> 15:30.800
but it's not quite like any death rattle you've heard before.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.800
It doesn't have that wet, phlegmy sound.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.800
It's a more dry, rasping rattle.

15:35.800 --> 15:40.800
Which seems to correspond with all the other symptoms you've seen recently.

15:40.800 --> 15:45.800
He is not just dehydrated.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.800
I mean, you've had trouble getting him to retain fluids,

15:48.800 --> 15:50.800
but it's more than dehydrated.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.800
He's desiccated.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.800
His skin is flaking.

15:55.800 --> 16:00.800
And this morning, you swear a couple of the times

16:00.800 --> 16:03.800
when he's had trouble breathing and coughed,

16:03.800 --> 16:07.800
you've seen a little cloud of dust come out of his mouth.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.800
Has Nathaniel seen other people die from this disease yet,

16:11.800 --> 16:13.800
or is this the first time it's actually...

16:13.800 --> 16:15.800
No.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.800
Yeah, it looks like this is the first patient

16:18.800 --> 16:20.800
you're going to lose to whatever this is.

16:20.800 --> 16:27.800
Wow, you must feel like a real shitty doctor, Joe.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.800
But at this stage, there's not really much else you can do for him

16:30.800 --> 16:32.800
other than palliative care.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.800
He is beyond any help.

16:35.800 --> 16:44.800
His wife has been sitting in a little chair beside him

16:44.800 --> 16:46.800
for most of the night.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.800
And she's fallen asleep at this stage, and the exhaustion has just got to her.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.800
But with the noise outside, she's beginning to stir.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.800
Her name's Agatha.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.800
They're both actually fairly young,

16:58.800 --> 17:00.800
though you wouldn't think of it to look at Harold at the moment.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.800
They're both in their 30s.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.800
But he looks like, if you didn't know otherwise,

17:05.800 --> 17:07.800
you'd think that he was in his 60s at least,

17:07.800 --> 17:12.800
just from the effect on his skin.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.800
Yeah, as he goes into this latest coughing fit,

17:16.800 --> 17:23.800
she stirs and she takes hold of his hand.

17:23.800 --> 17:28.800
There's this sort of cracking sound,

17:28.800 --> 17:30.800
and she jumps back in alarm,

17:30.800 --> 17:34.800
and you can see a couple of his fingers just drop to the ground

17:34.800 --> 17:37.800
and bounce across the floor.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.800
Holy shit.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.800
OK, before you've had a chance to do anything else, let's have a sand roll.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.800
I dig it.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.800
Start as we mean to go on.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.800
I pass a 30 on a 40.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.800
OK, you're a doctor.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.800
You have seen some weird shit over the years.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.800
Maybe not this weird.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.800
He's got the old dropy fingers.

18:00.800 --> 18:05.800
Yeah, he's seen lots of fingers just drop to the floor.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.800
But yeah, you can see that his hand has actually fractured slightly,

18:09.800 --> 18:14.800
that there's bits of bone fragment poking out through this desiccated flesh,

18:14.800 --> 18:17.800
his hands trembling a little bit.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.800
One of the fingers where it's dropped on the ground,

18:19.800 --> 18:22.800
the desiccated flesh has dropped away from it a bit,

18:22.800 --> 18:25.800
revealing bone there.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.800
Harold Priestley himself just doesn't seem to have noticed any of this.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.800
He's still staring up at the ceiling.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.800
I want to lean over him, and do I have anything I can shine a light?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.800
I want to see if he responds to light.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.800
Harold, are you still in there?

18:38.800 --> 18:42.800
Yeah, you don't have the proper medical equipment that you used to have,

18:42.800 --> 18:47.800
but you've certainly got an electric flashlight that you can shine in there.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.800
It's a bit brute force, but it's better than nothing.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.800
And yeah, you shine that.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.800
And not only do his eyes not respond,

18:55.800 --> 18:59.800
but you see with all this dust that he's been coughing up,

18:59.800 --> 19:03.800
that there is actually a thin patina of dust across his corneas

19:03.800 --> 19:05.800
that he's not blinking off.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.800
But he's still breathing at this point?

19:07.800 --> 19:08.800
Yeah.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.800
I'll check if he's breathing at this point.

19:10.800 --> 19:18.800
Yeah, it is very, very labored, but he is breathing.

19:18.800 --> 19:22.800
Agatha, understandably at this stage, is freaking the fuck out.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.800
She is screaming, she is crying,

19:25.800 --> 19:28.800
she is demanding to know what the hell is going on with her husband.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.800
I want to try and calm her down,

19:31.800 --> 19:33.800
but my point in calming her down is to say,

19:33.800 --> 19:38.800
Agatha, I'm sorry to say this might be your last chance

19:38.800 --> 19:41.800
to say anything you need to say to Harold.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.800
He doesn't have much longer.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.800
If you'd like to say anything, now would be the time.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.800
Oh, God. Oh, God.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.800
If you say so, Doctor.

19:52.800 --> 19:58.800
And she leans over him, and she's obviously trying very gingerly

19:58.800 --> 20:02.800
to find some way of holding onto him without damaging him further.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.800
And you can see, I mean, as she's leaning over him,

20:06.800 --> 20:08.800
there's tears dropping off her face,

20:08.800 --> 20:10.800
and where they're dropping onto his skin,

20:10.800 --> 20:14.800
they're just leaving little gouges as they run down.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.800
Oh, wow. Holy shit.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.800
So, while you're dealing with that situation,

20:20.800 --> 20:25.800
let's cut outside to...

20:25.800 --> 20:29.800
Yeah, let's go to Frederick, first of all.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.800
So, what's Frederick's morning routine?

20:31.800 --> 20:35.800
What does he normally do when he first gets up?

20:35.800 --> 20:38.800
The camera kind of pans across the Hoover Town,

20:38.800 --> 20:41.800
and you see some children playing.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.800
You don't see Frederick Mellon the first

20:44.800 --> 20:51.800
because he is hiding inside a half-rotted-out metal barrel

20:51.800 --> 20:55.800
that they used to make fires for some time

20:55.800 --> 20:58.800
until it eventually disintegrated and was no longer useful,

20:58.800 --> 21:00.800
so it's kind of half-rolled over.

21:00.800 --> 21:06.800
And he is inside waiting for these kids

21:06.800 --> 21:11.800
to get just close enough for him to just pop out

21:11.800 --> 21:14.800
and scare the shit out of them.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.800
He's just trying to really, really give them a show.

21:18.800 --> 21:23.800
And as soon as their eyes are massive,

21:23.800 --> 21:25.800
he holds out a single-dollar bill.

21:25.800 --> 21:30.800
Hey, my kiddies, kiddies, kiddies, hey, hey, hey.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.800
The world has joy.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.800
Joy for you, joy for me.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.800
Okay, now, I want you to take this dollar, okay?

21:38.800 --> 21:40.800
Mister, that's a whole dollar.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
Yes, take it.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.800
That's a whole dollar.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.800
Yeah.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.800
And with that...

21:46.800 --> 21:48.800
Yeah, that's right.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.800
With that, the three kids start fighting over the dollar

21:51.800 --> 21:57.800
in a very spirited way.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.800
You notice, actually, that with the group of kids,

22:00.800 --> 22:04.800
I mean, there are kids of various ages throughout the camp,

22:04.800 --> 22:07.800
and there's normally four of them

22:07.800 --> 22:09.800
who travel around in this particular group.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.800
I mean, the camp's only got about 15 people in it,

22:11.800 --> 22:12.800
so there aren't that many kids.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.800
But there's a group of four kids

22:14.800 --> 22:17.800
that normally go around and do all the mischief,

22:17.800 --> 22:21.800
and there only seem to be three of them here today.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.800
There's one of the girls, Esther.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.800
Hey, wait, hey, where's Benji?

22:25.800 --> 22:26.800
It's Esther who's missing.

22:26.800 --> 22:27.800
Oh, where's Esther?

22:27.800 --> 22:31.800
Yeah, the other kids look up

22:32.800 --> 22:34.800
and sort of half pay attention to what he's saying.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.800
I always get her and Benji confused.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.800
And then go back to fighting over the dollar

22:38.800 --> 22:39.800
because they haven't seen the whole dollar

22:39.800 --> 22:41.800
for a very long time.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.800
So he kind of raises it up, and he's like,

22:43.800 --> 22:45.800
okay, okay, I was gonna give it to you,

22:45.800 --> 22:47.800
but now you gotta work for it

22:47.800 --> 22:49.800
by answering me a question, all right?

22:49.800 --> 22:50.800
Now, where is this Esther?

22:50.800 --> 22:52.800
Where's your friend who runs around with you?

22:52.800 --> 22:53.800
Haven't seen her yet, Mister.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.800
Oh, you mean you haven't seen her yet?

22:55.800 --> 22:57.800
You've been going around the town with her every day,

22:57.800 --> 23:00.800
and now just today she's gone.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.800
Yeah, do you like that change?

23:05.800 --> 23:07.800
One of the little boys looks up and says,

23:07.800 --> 23:09.800
oh, maybe she's sick, Mister.

23:09.800 --> 23:10.800
Give us the dollar.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.800
He looks off into the distance,

23:13.800 --> 23:16.800
kind of coughing slightly to himself

23:16.800 --> 23:19.800
as he just holds the dollar out and hands it to him.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.800
A smile just grows across his face

23:22.800 --> 23:24.800
as he watches the kids.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.800
Yeah, well, little Benji grabs the dollar bill

23:26.800 --> 23:28.800
out of your hand

23:28.800 --> 23:30.800
and goes running off down the camp

23:30.800 --> 23:33.800
with the other two kids chasing him

23:33.800 --> 23:36.800
in, let's say, a playful manner,

23:36.800 --> 23:38.800
but the same kind of playful manner

23:38.800 --> 23:41.800
as you'd expect from hungry dogs.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.800
Yeah.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.800
He's optimistic.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.800
Well, yeah, the way our own children

23:47.800 --> 23:49.800
might play someday if we're lucky.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.800
Whoa!

23:56.800 --> 24:00.800
But the girl that you noticed was missing, Esther,

24:00.800 --> 24:04.800
she lives with her mother,

24:04.800 --> 24:06.800
a woman called Mrs. Frain,

24:06.800 --> 24:08.800
who you may know as Maureen,

24:08.800 --> 24:11.800
is in one of the tents nearby.

24:13.800 --> 24:17.800
The mother, Mrs. Frain, is a widow.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.800
Her husband killed himself a little while back.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.800
She used to come from money,

24:22.800 --> 24:25.800
and you know that she's very protective of her daughter,

24:25.800 --> 24:27.800
but at the same time, she's been quite ill

24:27.800 --> 24:30.800
with the disease that's going on around here.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.800
I mean, Esther, as far as you know,

24:33.800 --> 24:35.800
has been one of the healthier people in the camp,

24:35.800 --> 24:38.800
and it's really unusual not to see her up and about.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.800
I mean, her mother's been bedridden for a little while,

24:41.800 --> 24:44.800
but Esther definitely should be up and about at this stage.

24:44.800 --> 24:49.800
Frederick Mellon I will go check in just to say hello.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.800
Kind of, he's curious, so he's just going to kind of poke around

24:52.800 --> 24:53.800
where his nose shouldn't be.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.800
Well, you go over to the tent,

24:55.800 --> 24:59.800
and the flap on the tent is open slightly.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.800
They never see me coming in.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.800
I'm very stealthy.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.800
So Luke can't make it to one game,

25:06.800 --> 25:08.800
and you're like, we need a monster.

25:09.800 --> 25:13.800
I am playing a nice, optimistic,

25:13.800 --> 25:21.800
old man who joyfully slinks and creeps through the shadows

25:21.800 --> 25:24.800
and pits children against each other.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.800
He's practically a Disney character.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.800
I've been watching, and I enjoy the way Luke plays a game.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.800
Have you watched the way it affects the other players?

25:50.800 --> 25:53.800
Well, I'm currently progressing the story.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.800
Thank you, Tommy.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.800
That's true.

25:57.800 --> 26:02.800
So, yes, you take a look inside the tent,

26:02.800 --> 26:09.800
and in there you can see that there are two cots that have been set up.

26:10.800 --> 26:11.800
Well, I say cots.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
I mean, they're fairly makeshift things

26:13.800 --> 26:18.800
that have been cobbled together out of spare wood and whatever cloth

26:18.800 --> 26:21.800
and, in some cases, newspaper they've managed to get hold of.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.800
But let's call them cots.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.800
And one of them is empty.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.800
In fact, it looks almost undisturbed.

26:29.800 --> 26:34.800
The other one has got Maureen Frayn lying in it.

26:34.800 --> 26:38.800
And you're not sure whether she's alive or dead.

26:38.800 --> 26:43.800
She is, at the very least, badly injured.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.800
There is blood down her face,

26:46.800 --> 26:49.800
and it looks like someone has bludgeoned her.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.800
There's blood splattered all over her sheets.

26:52.800 --> 26:56.800
And, yeah, she does not look in a good way.

26:56.800 --> 27:02.800
Frederick Mellon is frozen in the doorway when he sees this,

27:02.800 --> 27:05.800
unable to decide what to do.

27:05.800 --> 27:10.800
He is just going to give the room a quick once-over

27:10.800 --> 27:17.800
to decide, A, if there is any, like, fight put up,

27:17.800 --> 27:22.800
any sort of distress actions happening in this room,

27:22.800 --> 27:26.800
and B, to see if anyone other than her body is still in here.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.800
Okay, I mean, this is a comparatively small tent,

27:29.800 --> 27:32.800
so it would be very difficult for someone to be hiding in here

27:32.800 --> 27:34.800
and for you not to see them.

27:34.800 --> 27:39.800
But as far as trying to discern the details of what happened goes,

27:39.800 --> 27:42.800
let's have a spot hidden role.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.800
This seems like the perfect opportunity for a spot hidden role.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.800
16 on a 55.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.800
Okay, yeah, that's a hard success.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.800
So, yeah, you notice a few things then.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.800
As far as the state of Maureen is concerned,

27:57.800 --> 28:00.800
you reckon, for a start, that she's still alive.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.800
You can see her chest rising and falling slightly,

28:04.800 --> 28:09.800
but there's, like I say, a fairly nasty head wound.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.800
The other things you clock are that Esther's bed,

28:13.800 --> 28:16.800
like I say, I mean, seems to be largely unmade,

28:16.800 --> 28:22.800
but perhaps more unusually, the thick winter coat that she had

28:22.800 --> 28:26.800
that is obviously fairly vital at this time of year

28:26.800 --> 28:30.800
is still there beside her bed, as are her shoes.

28:30.800 --> 28:36.800
So, you know, if she is up and about or outside the tent,

28:36.800 --> 28:41.800
on a cold November morning like this without her coat and shoes,

28:41.800 --> 28:43.800
that's not going to be good for her.

28:43.800 --> 28:47.800
The other thing you notice, seeing as you've got a hard success,

28:47.800 --> 28:53.800
is there is something tucked underneath Maureen Frayn's bed,

28:53.800 --> 28:59.800
and it's wrapped up in cloth, but it must have been disturbed

28:59.800 --> 29:02.800
when whatever happened last night happened,

29:02.800 --> 29:07.800
and you can see that she does have what looks like a fairly nice,

29:07.800 --> 29:11.800
a very expensive-looking shotgun tucked under her bed.

29:11.800 --> 29:15.800
Yeah, he's going to leave that be.

29:15.800 --> 29:20.800
See, Thomas? Not necessarily playing the exact same way

29:20.800 --> 29:23.800
as one Luke might.

29:23.800 --> 29:27.800
No, no, I was just saying you're playing a character who's a dickhead.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.800
Oh, he's so nice, though. You'll get to know him.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.800
You'll get to know him. It'll be fine.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.800
Definitely should have grabbed the shotgun just now.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.800
He is going to just kind of slink back out

29:39.800 --> 29:44.800
and walk quickly toward the doctor's abode.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.800
Okay, yeah, yes, the medical shack that he's...

29:47.800 --> 29:48.800
Wherever he might be working.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.800
There is a shack that Dr. Coombs has set up.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.800
It's not where he lives. He lives in a tent just next to it,

29:54.800 --> 30:01.800
but he's got a shack which serves as, I guess, a sort of field hospital

30:01.800 --> 30:04.800
that has got a couple of cots in it

30:04.800 --> 30:07.800
and has got what equipment he's managed to salvage

30:07.800 --> 30:13.800
or get from various sources, what medical equipment and drugs and so on.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.800
And so, yeah, you can make your way over there.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.800
Before we deal with that, however, let's check in with Mr. Dolan.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.800
Thomas Dolan, how you doing?

30:22.800 --> 30:27.800
What's Thomas Dolan's morning routine?

30:27.800 --> 30:29.800
Is he up and about at this time?

30:29.800 --> 30:31.800
In his old life, he would have been,

30:31.800 --> 30:35.800
but he's tired in the mornings a lot of times,

30:35.800 --> 30:42.800
so he might be just dragging himself out of his shack right about this time

30:42.800 --> 30:46.800
and seeing if anybody around the campfires has some extra coffee.

30:46.800 --> 30:52.800
Okay, yeah. I mean, the campfire is pretty much outside your shack,

30:52.800 --> 30:54.800
and you make your way over there,

30:54.800 --> 30:57.800
and there are only a couple of people sitting there.

30:57.800 --> 31:05.800
There's Dr. Rothstein, who you know was some kind of university lecturer,

31:05.800 --> 31:07.800
who's sitting there, warming his hands.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.800
He's making the coffee at the moment.

31:09.800 --> 31:14.800
And also sitting opposite him is a young woman who you know.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.800
Her name is Nancy, Nancy Carver.

31:17.800 --> 31:25.800
And she worked in a lawyer's office, you think, before everything went south.

31:25.800 --> 31:32.800
And she is sitting there with an absolutely vacant look in her eyes.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.800
She's just looking at the flames,

31:34.800 --> 31:41.800
and you can see that there is actually, in the back of her hair and on her coat,

31:41.800 --> 31:43.800
there are some ice crystals there

31:43.800 --> 31:47.800
that suggest that she might actually have been sitting there all night.

31:47.800 --> 31:52.800
Nance, are you all right there? Nance?

31:52.800 --> 32:00.800
She doesn't look at you, but she starts just twitching a little bit.

32:01.800 --> 32:07.800
Her eyes just go a bit wider, and she looks at the fire more,

32:07.800 --> 32:13.800
and then she forces herself to look up and looks over at you.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.800
What happened? Why is it light?

32:16.800 --> 32:21.800
Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?

32:21.800 --> 32:23.800
You're in the Hooverville, Nance. You're around the fire.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.800
There's me, Thomas Dolan, and there's Rothstein right there.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.800
What do you think you are?

32:28.800 --> 32:32.800
Rothstein looks up and just sort of grunts and then goes back to making the coffee.

32:32.800 --> 32:37.800
I was here. I was here. I was here last night.

32:37.800 --> 32:42.800
Why can't I remember? Why can't I remember, Thomas?

32:42.800 --> 32:45.800
Why can't I remember? What do they do to me?

32:45.800 --> 32:47.800
Who? Who, Nance? Who did what to you?

32:47.800 --> 32:51.800
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

32:51.800 --> 32:56.800
They were here last night. They did something, Thomas.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.800
They did something, Thomas.

32:57.800 --> 32:58.800
Those little fucking urchins.

32:58.800 --> 33:02.800
I don't know. Are they? Oh, God.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.800
I didn't have faces. I didn't have faces.

33:06.800 --> 33:10.800
Rothstein, are you hearing what she's saying?

33:10.800 --> 33:12.800
Has she been like this all morning?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.800
Oh, yes. Yeah, she's been like this all morning.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.800
She just taps the side of his head and then goes back to making the coffee.

33:18.800 --> 33:22.800
Can I do a, I was going to say a psychology check, but I don't know if that would.

33:22.800 --> 33:27.800
Do I, this, I mean, it sounds fantastical. Do I believe her?

33:27.800 --> 33:31.800
Oh, I see. Yeah, that would be psychology, definitely. Yeah.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.800
No, 76 on a, I think it's a 40.

33:34.800 --> 33:40.800
Okay. I mean, yeah, she is obviously upset.

33:40.800 --> 33:46.800
I mean, even without the role, I mean, it seems unlikely that she'd be lying about something like this.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.800
I mean, she seems genuinely upset, but.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.800
Yeah, but it's the 30s, so we don't believe victims yet.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.800
There is that.

33:55.800 --> 33:59.800
Shit, fucking Rothstein, she's been like this all fucking morning and you've just been sitting here making coffee?

33:59.800 --> 34:02.800
Look at this, there's ice all over the back of her fucking head.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.800
I've just been here 10 minutes. I'm making the coffee.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.800
I went and got, I got some roots. I added them to the coffee.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.800
You know, the grounds are, grounds are all moldy today.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.800
Grounds are all moldy.

34:13.800 --> 34:19.800
All right, Rothstein, I go and I grab a blanket to put around her, around her back where all the ice is.

34:19.800 --> 34:24.800
And yeah, she's, she's muttering, she's muttering something about a puppet now.

34:24.800 --> 34:29.800
Do I, do I know anything about her, her life? Does she have any puppets?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.800
Was she in vaudeville?

34:31.800 --> 34:33.800
No, no, like I say, she works in the lawyer's office.

34:33.800 --> 34:38.800
Nance, what do you, what do you mean puppets? What are you talking about? These fucking puppets?

34:38.800 --> 34:46.800
They had a puppet. Yeah, it was a puppet, wasn't it? They had a puppet last night.

34:46.800 --> 34:54.800
And my God, Thomas, they made it sing. And she just bursts into floods of tears.

34:54.800 --> 34:58.800
At this point, I feel like I'm convinced she's talking about a vaudeville show.

34:58.800 --> 35:07.800
It's like, all right, well, Nance is off a rocker. I don't know if that's, you know, so out of character.

35:07.800 --> 35:08.800
It is, actually.

35:08.800 --> 35:12.800
Well, these are hard times. Everybody gets a little weird.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.800
Oh, yeah.

35:13.800 --> 35:21.800
Dolan is definitely confused by this, but I don't think he clocks it as, as supernatural or anything.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.800
It just seems like a drunk woman in the depression.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.800
Yeah, that seems entirely reasonable.

35:26.800 --> 35:36.800
And at this point, you see Mellon walking past you, would it be fair to say with purposeful stride, heading towards the medical tent?

35:36.800 --> 35:42.800
Rarely. Is he purposeful? So in this moment, it seems strange.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.800
Freddie, where are you going?

35:44.800 --> 35:51.800
I gotta go say hi to Dr. Combs. Maureen got hit on the head.

35:51.800 --> 35:55.800
Maureen got hit on the head. I think Nance might have got hit on the head, too. She's being fucking wacky.

35:55.800 --> 35:56.800
Why don't I...

35:56.800 --> 35:58.800
Take her or leave her. Let's go tell him.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.800
Let's walk her on down there.

36:00.800 --> 36:11.800
So Mellon will kind of bow very deeply and tip his cap to the woman that Dolan is helping up.

36:11.800 --> 36:16.800
And then we'll try to hold her arm up on the other side to help her walk.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.800
And we skip away.

36:19.800 --> 36:33.800
And you lead her into the medical shack where you can see Agatha Priestley leaning over the very badly ill-looking form of her husband.

36:33.800 --> 36:43.800
You can see what appear to be a couple of fingers lying on the ground. The side of Priestley's face is melting slightly.

36:43.800 --> 36:50.800
There is a death rattle coming from his lungs. And what's Dr. Combs doing while all this is happening?

36:50.800 --> 36:56.800
If he sees them walk in, he would like to try and create a privacy barrier if there's a curtain or something I can draw.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.800
Yeah, sure.

36:57.800 --> 37:02.800
To try and pull that closed and meet them past the curtain. Give Agatha and Harold privacy.

37:02.800 --> 37:03.800
Okay.

37:03.800 --> 37:08.800
Thomas Dolan even is just looking at the fingers that are peeking out under the privacy curtain.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.800
Yes. They're hard to miss.

37:13.800 --> 37:17.800
Gentlemen, how can I help you? I'm in the middle of something back here.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.800
Doc, are those his fucking fingers?

37:19.800 --> 37:22.800
He turns around and looks and sees that they're pretty clearly visible.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.800
The curtain hangs like a foot off the ground.

37:26.800 --> 37:42.800
Yeah, those are his face. He's not long for this world. Let's give them some privacy and I'll try and usher them a little further away from that area.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.800
What's going on here, guys?

37:44.800 --> 37:49.800
Well, Nancy's gone wackadoodle and Freddie says, what'd you see, Freddie?

37:49.800 --> 37:59.800
Yeah, well, I was just saying that, you know, my pals, my pallys, they were hopping about around the camp and Esther wasn't with them.

37:59.800 --> 38:08.800
So I went to see if she was home with Maureen and turns out Maureen, big old gash on her head.

38:08.800 --> 38:13.800
You know, so definitely needs to be checked out for sure. But, you know, not awake maybe.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.800
Was she, she was still alive when you saw her, though?

38:16.800 --> 38:18.800
I think her chest was moving with breath.

38:19.800 --> 38:27.800
Nathaniel's going to start gathering up a doctor's bag. And Nance, why are you here? Are you feeling all right?

38:27.800 --> 38:30.800
The short answer is no, doctor.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.800
They made it sing.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.800
They made what sing, Nance?

38:34.800 --> 38:38.800
Doc, maybe you ought to put that puppet behind you out of view.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.800
I think that thing's going to freak her out.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.800
Little Gregory? What's the problem with Little Gregory?

38:47.800 --> 38:52.800
Well, I mean, we can see the fingers under the curtain and then Little Gregory's just staring right at her.

38:52.800 --> 38:57.800
And she's had a fairly traumatic puppet-related experience in the past.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.800
And also, just having a puppet of Rasputin seems very strange.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.800
It's a little old-fashioned at this point.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.800
Nathaniel grabs a little towel and throws it over Little Gregory.

39:11.800 --> 39:15.800
All right, Nance, let's get you warmed up. Let's have you get over here by this fire.

39:15.800 --> 39:21.800
And he goes and grabs an unused blanket to wrap around her and gets her right up close to the fire.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.800
Is my little buddy Billy in the tent right now?

39:24.800 --> 39:26.800
No, he hasn't turned up yet this morning.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.800
Is that your other puppet?

39:32.800 --> 39:39.800
Is there anybody in the medical tent that I could, like, leave to keep an eye on things here if I left?

39:39.800 --> 39:49.800
No, it would just be Agatha, Harold, and, well, Nancy. So, just patience and, well, and Agatha.

39:49.800 --> 39:56.800
I'm going to pop my head into the privacy curtain and tell Agatha, Agatha, I gotta run out for a second.

39:56.800 --> 40:00.800
It sounds like somebody's hurt. I'll be back as soon as I can.

40:00.800 --> 40:08.800
If anything happens, you can come and find me. I'm going to be over at Maureen's place.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.800
Nancy's sitting in here. She's going to warm up a little bit. I'll be back as soon as I can.

40:12.800 --> 40:16.800
Yeah, she doesn't seem to have noticed a single word you said.

40:16.800 --> 40:25.800
Okay. And then, yeah, just set up my sign that's like the doctor will be back in five minutes or whatever, ten minutes.

40:25.800 --> 40:33.800
And I'll let the guys lead me to, or whoever wants to go with me, lead me to Maureen's tent.

40:33.800 --> 40:39.800
With my doctor's bed, whatever I can, whatever I have that I would take to a little field call.

40:39.800 --> 40:46.800
Call it a hunch, but I think we should maybe stick together from this point on out.

40:46.800 --> 40:58.800
Frederick Mellon will lead you guys into the tent and as he walks in, he's going to kind of push the gun more out of sight with his foot.

40:59.800 --> 41:08.800
As he kind of lays his hand about to show off the body of Maureen and be like,

41:08.800 --> 41:15.800
look, this is exactly how I found her and look over there, points at the jacket and the shoes of Esther.

41:15.800 --> 41:24.800
I have no words. I mean, Esther doesn't have another pair of shoes. She doesn't have another coat.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.800
That is the most alarming thing about this site.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.800
Where is she though? Thomas.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.800
Thomas Dolan is crossing himself.

41:30.800 --> 41:37.800
Nathaniel looks over to Thomas and says, you didn't happen to see Esther on your way to get me this morning, did you?

41:37.800 --> 41:38.800
I surely did not.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.800
And then he's going to, yeah, Nathaniel is going to start doctoring Maureen.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.800
Okay.

41:43.800 --> 41:48.800
Trying to stabilize her and see if I can tell what happened and all that kind of stuff.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.800
Yeah, give me a first aid roll then.

41:51.800 --> 41:56.800
That's a pass of 45 on a 70.

41:56.800 --> 42:02.800
Okay. So, yeah, you can stabilize her. She is going to need proper medical attention.

42:02.800 --> 42:07.800
She has taken a very nasty head wound. At the very least, she's got a concussion.

42:07.800 --> 42:13.800
She's drifting in and out of consciousness and she's not really with it at the moment.

42:14.800 --> 42:21.800
Ideally, she should be in the hospital, but you know the hospital will take her.

42:21.800 --> 42:32.800
But at the very least, you reckon you're going to have to take her back to the shack and try to get her into some kind of decent condition.

42:32.800 --> 42:40.800
Maureen, can you hear me? Can you walk? Are you able to walk? You're taking a nasty blow to the head here. We need to get to my tent.

42:40.800 --> 42:46.800
She just groans and then says, Esther, where's Esther?

42:46.800 --> 42:51.800
We don't know, Maureen. Have you seen her? When's the last time you saw her?

42:51.800 --> 43:06.800
No, no. I don't know. I woke up last night and there were men in the tent and, oh God, she puts her hand up towards her head.

43:06.800 --> 43:08.800
Did you recognize these men, Maureen?

43:08.800 --> 43:15.800
No, no. And she reaches her hand up towards her head and then just passes out again.

43:15.800 --> 43:20.800
I turn to Frederick and Thomas. I'm going to need to get her back to the medical tent.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.800
Help me carry her back to the tent, Mr. Mellon.

43:23.800 --> 43:24.800
Done.

43:24.800 --> 43:32.800
When you get there, Agatha is sitting back down in the chair and she's in floods of tears.

43:32.800 --> 43:38.800
I peek behind the curtain to see, is Harold still with us?

43:38.800 --> 43:54.800
Yeah, you take a look and you can check his life signs, I guess. If you'd listen with a stethoscope, there's no breathing, there's no heartbeat.

43:54.800 --> 44:02.800
You'd listen for a few moments just to make sure. There's definitely no heartbeat.

44:02.800 --> 44:10.800
And then as you listen, you hear a sort of scratching sound.

44:10.800 --> 44:18.800
I listen more intently, trying to locate where that scratching sound's coming from.

44:18.800 --> 44:26.800
Yeah, you move the stethoscope down a little bit, and as you move it down towards the abdomen, the scratching gets louder.

44:26.800 --> 44:31.800
Medical training never trained me for inner scratching. Hang on one second.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.800
What is a ringtone?

44:33.800 --> 44:35.800
It's Joe's doorbell.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.800
Oh.

44:37.800 --> 44:44.800
Sure thing, give me one second. Oh, can you just leave it at the stoop there? Thank you very much.

44:44.800 --> 44:45.800
Sorry about that.

44:45.800 --> 44:46.800
Who's coming by?

44:46.800 --> 44:53.800
It was a package. I don't know. That's never happened to me before. They don't ever ring my bell to deliver me a package.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.800
Do you need to go and pick it up?

44:55.800 --> 44:56.800
No, I'm good for now.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.800
Are you sure? What if it's really cool?

44:59.800 --> 45:04.800
Yeah, I'll go get it. I think it might be dice, actually.

45:04.800 --> 45:09.800
Oh shit, go get him and I'll go to the bathroom real quick. You go get your dice.

45:09.800 --> 45:11.800
All right, I'll run down real quick.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.800
Let's get him.

45:12.800 --> 45:15.800
This is so spooky.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.800
Good, good, good, good.

45:17.800 --> 45:18.800
Yeah, this is excellent.

45:18.800 --> 45:19.800
Oh, glad you're enjoying it.

45:19.800 --> 45:20.800
I really am.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.800
We were in a very heated moment before my bell rang.

45:23.800 --> 45:29.800
I was hearing a scratching and scratching from inside a thing I should not be hearing a scratching and scratching coming from.

45:29.800 --> 45:33.800
Scratching and a scratching.

45:33.800 --> 45:37.800
Moving down the abdomen.

45:37.800 --> 45:48.800
So, yes, as you move the stethoscope down the abdomen, that sound of scratching gets louder and more distinct.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.800
Not knowing anything about scratching and scratching coming from inside the body.

45:51.800 --> 45:58.800
He's going to look for external sources and maybe like under the bed and see if that's if there's something underneath there or something.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.800
No, no, of course not.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.800
It's coming from inside the body.

46:03.800 --> 46:04.800
It definitely is.

46:04.800 --> 46:08.800
The call is coming from inside the body.

46:08.800 --> 46:12.800
Can I see any like protrusion or anything like any from the outside?

46:12.800 --> 46:15.800
No, no, you can't.

46:15.800 --> 46:25.800
One of the side effects really of this desiccation of Priestly's flesh is that even prodding it and poking it.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.800
Yeah, there's no elasticity.

46:27.800 --> 46:28.800
It's quite rigid now.

46:28.800 --> 46:32.800
I'm going to try and tell Agatha to leave the room.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.800
She's in this room with us, right?

46:34.800 --> 46:35.800
Oh, absolutely.

46:35.800 --> 46:36.800
Yeah. Yeah.

46:36.800 --> 46:42.800
She's sitting down in a chair, but behind the privacy barrier that you've erected.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.800
And so she's on the same side as you and the body at the moment.

46:46.800 --> 46:51.800
Agatha, if you could step out of the room, please.

46:51.800 --> 46:55.800
I'll make sure that Harold here is cared for.

46:55.800 --> 46:59.800
We'll arrange funeral arrangements together here in just a bit.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.800
Just step outside that curtain there for me.

47:01.800 --> 47:05.800
Freddie, could you see the widow Priestly out?

47:05.800 --> 47:07.800
I mean, Mrs. Priestly?

47:07.800 --> 47:09.800
I am Mrs. Priestly.

47:09.800 --> 47:13.800
Agatha does not seem to be aware of anything that's going on around her at the moment.

47:13.800 --> 47:15.800
She has shut down completely.

47:15.800 --> 47:16.800
Does she...

47:16.800 --> 47:17.800
This is kind of...

47:17.800 --> 47:18.800
I should have asked this a long time ago.

47:18.800 --> 47:23.800
Is she terribly affected by this disease also or is she kind of doing okay?

47:23.800 --> 47:27.800
She's affected by it, but nowhere near as badly as her husband was.

47:27.800 --> 47:28.800
Right. Okay.

47:28.800 --> 47:32.800
Yeah, fellas, if you could try to get her out of here.

47:32.800 --> 47:36.800
Yeah, let's take Mrs. Priestly out of here.

47:36.800 --> 47:41.800
And I grab one arm and wait for Mr. Mellon to grab the other.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.800
We're getting pretty good at this, yeah?

47:43.800 --> 47:44.800
Yeah.

47:44.800 --> 47:49.800
We could maybe pull off, you know, some kind of weekend-up-and-nod situation after this.

47:49.800 --> 48:05.800
When they get her out of the room, my doctor's curiosity is going to grab a scalpel and see if I can find out what's going on with that scrichin inside there.

48:05.800 --> 48:18.800
So, yeah, you sort of hitch up his pajama top and you can isolate, using the stethoscope, the area where the scratching is coming from.

48:18.800 --> 48:28.800
Now, when it comes to cutting into the area, because of the desiccated nature of the flesh, it's not like cutting into flesh normally is.

48:28.800 --> 48:31.800
It's cracking and crumbling as you're doing so.

48:31.800 --> 48:44.800
Yeah, there's no blood, there's no fluid coming out, and there's just chunks of what was his abdominal wall falling away.

48:44.800 --> 48:51.800
And inside you catch sight, first of all, of something colorful.

48:51.800 --> 49:04.800
I mean, you think perhaps initially it's one of his internal organs because it is sort of glistening and iridescent, but no, it's not that.

49:04.800 --> 49:08.800
And there's another one, another one, these little round things.

49:09.800 --> 49:18.800
And then in amongst this clutch of these little iridescent round objects, you can see something wriggling.

49:18.800 --> 49:30.800
Something, I mean, it's only a couple of inches long, but it's sort of cucumber shaped, but there are little barbs or spikes coming off it.

49:30.800 --> 49:43.800
And it lifts its front end up towards you and the whole thing irises out, and you can see this sort of mouth with all these little sharp teeth.

49:43.800 --> 49:48.800
And suddenly this sound that sounds an awful lot like a baby crying coming from it.

49:49.800 --> 49:51.800
Let's have a sound roll.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.800
No!

49:54.800 --> 49:56.800
What?

49:59.800 --> 50:01.800
No, Scott, what?

50:01.800 --> 50:06.800
That's a good old fashioned fail on that sound roll, baby. 64 on a 40.

50:08.800 --> 50:14.800
OK, so I'll roll you a sand loss here because I enjoy this.

50:14.800 --> 50:30.800
So you only lose three points of sand, but I think as an involuntary action, you stagger back and just, you can't help yourself.

50:30.800 --> 50:39.800
You stagger back and unconsciously just try to support yourself by grabbing onto the nearest thing you can, which unfortunately is the privacy curtain that you set up.

50:39.800 --> 50:44.800
And as you put your weight on it, you just crack the pole that it was on. The whole thing comes down.

50:44.800 --> 50:52.800
As you land down heavily on the ground, crushing one of the fingers beneath you as you do so.

50:52.800 --> 50:57.800
And the rest of you from outside can hear this cracking wood sound.

50:58.800 --> 51:11.800
And then a moment later from the other side of the privacy curtain, the sound of Nancy Carver screaming as she can see the things wriggling around inside the remains of Harold Priestley's abdomen.

51:11.800 --> 51:24.800
Oh, shit. I mean, Nathaniel's going to try his hardest to regain composure and get people out away from that crazy, scary stuff, like ushering people out of the tent.

51:25.800 --> 51:28.800
Nancy has had such a bad 24 hours.

51:33.800 --> 51:40.800
Okay. So, yeah, it doesn't take a lot to convince Nancy to get out of the medical shack at this stage.

51:40.800 --> 51:42.800
Oh, fuck.

51:42.800 --> 51:44.800
Where's Maureen? We brought her in.

51:44.800 --> 51:48.800
Yeah. Have we successfully gotten her out the door?

51:48.800 --> 51:54.800
Yes. Well, no, no. It was Agatha you took out. I assume Maureen is lying down on the other cot at the moment.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.800
It's too late for you!

52:00.800 --> 52:03.800
Mercifully, at this stage, Maureen seems to be unconscious.

52:03.800 --> 52:07.800
Are the wriggling things moving anywhere or are they just staying inside the body cavity?

52:07.800 --> 52:11.800
Well, there's one wriggling thing and it's clutch.

52:11.800 --> 52:24.800
Well, looking around inside, yeah, it's not crawling out of the abdomen yet. It's not moving particularly fast.

52:24.800 --> 52:33.800
And you can see the ruptured remains of one of these, what you realize are now eggs, which seems to be what this has come out of.

52:33.800 --> 52:40.800
And as you're looking around at the other sort of iridescent shapes there, you can see dark shapes moving around within those.

52:40.800 --> 52:51.800
Oh, no. How big are your boots? Start stomping.

52:51.800 --> 53:05.800
Yeah, I could like tip him over, I guess. Yeah, I want to try that. I want to try and tip him over onto his front so that those things are kind of captured in his body cavity. They can't get out.

53:05.800 --> 53:20.800
You start trying to tip him a bit and almost immediately you can hear the cracks and crunches from his desiccated flesh.

53:20.800 --> 53:27.800
You tip him up slightly and his right arm just breaks off and lands on the ground.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.800
Fingers scattering everywhere.

53:29.800 --> 53:41.800
Oh, shoot. I'm going to yell out for Frederick and Dolan.

53:41.800 --> 53:47.800
Because why should you be the only one to lose that?

53:47.800 --> 53:53.800
That is the true motto of the Call of Cthulhu player.

53:54.800 --> 54:00.800
Fellas, I need help in here. We have a problem. I need help. I need help.

54:00.800 --> 54:03.800
Oh, yeah. Let's go help the duck.

54:03.800 --> 54:10.800
We both promptly drop Agatha Priestly on the ground.

54:10.800 --> 54:13.800
Sorry. Sounds like an emergency.

54:13.800 --> 54:18.800
There is an apple crate you can sit her down on if you want to be more gentlemanly about the whole thing.

54:18.800 --> 54:27.800
No time. The duck sound panicked.

54:27.800 --> 54:32.800
Hurriedly walk her over, sit her down, jump cut.

54:32.800 --> 54:36.800
Yeah. It's us bursting through the door. What's up, duck?

54:36.800 --> 54:43.800
Got it. There's some sort of parasite here and it's nothing like I've ever seen before, but we got to keep it contained. We can't let it get into the community.

54:44.800 --> 54:48.800
Like worms. All the kids here got worms. I got worms.

54:48.800 --> 54:49.800
You have a basement?

54:49.800 --> 54:57.800
Nathaniel wide-eyed is saying, yeah, worms. Sure, worms is it. Yeah, something like it.

54:57.800 --> 55:03.800
Freddy, it looks like from the doctor's eyes, these are bad worms. Not just regular worms.

55:03.800 --> 55:07.800
All right, duck. What can we do? What can we do to help the community?

55:07.800 --> 55:20.800
Do we, do I, does Nathaniel know, how do we have, have we disposed of other kinds of bodies or things here before? Is there a, is there a, is there a crematorium or a place that we can burn a body or something? Destroy a body?

55:20.800 --> 55:32.800
There is no, not destroy a body. There's a potter's field in Crawley for paupers burials where when people have died at the camp before they've been buried there.

55:32.800 --> 55:39.800
Probably just crawling with aliens.

55:39.800 --> 55:52.800
But yeah, I mean, if it comes to safely disposing of what you'd consider perhaps to be a biohazard, the only facility you know of to do that is the, the incinerator at the hospital.

55:52.800 --> 55:58.800
So doc, do you think we got to get this whole guy incinerated or just these worms?

55:58.800 --> 56:08.800
I kind of investigate the body, but I, but Joe thinks just the, just the eggs and the, but I don't know what a doctor would say if maybe they've taken root elsewhere in the body.

56:08.800 --> 56:15.800
It just looks like he's really fallen apart. Maybe we can stick them all in a bag.

56:15.800 --> 56:21.800
I thought Agatha was in pieces.

56:21.800 --> 56:28.800
We just, uh, we've, we've, we've got to, we've got to get these. It looks like, it looks like eggs of some kind. We just got to, we got to destroy these somehow.

56:28.800 --> 56:32.800
And, uh, and look out for that, that one. It's got teeth.

56:32.800 --> 56:33.800
Which one?

56:33.800 --> 56:38.800
And he's, he's pointing to the one that's still, I think, warming around in the body cavity.

56:38.800 --> 56:44.800
Yeah. And as you point that out to the others, that's a good opportunity for both of you to make sand rolls.

56:44.800 --> 56:48.800
Come with me.

56:48.800 --> 56:50.800
Ooh, 32 on a 40.

56:50.800 --> 56:55.800
Yeah, 15 on a 75. Thomas Dolan crosses himself and it works.

56:55.800 --> 57:01.800
Okay. So neither of you lose any sand. You're both reacting to this much better than the doctor did.

57:01.800 --> 57:02.800
Gross.

57:02.800 --> 57:09.800
Yeah, it's real gnarly doc, but, uh, like I said, all the kids poop poop shit about that gnarly every other day around here.

57:09.800 --> 57:12.800
So the world is disgusting.

57:12.800 --> 57:25.800
Uh, so yeah, Nathaniel's going to start trying to find maybe a, like a bag that he would use for like biohazard type stuff, uh, in trails or whatever, a way to dispose and start trying to shove.

57:25.800 --> 57:26.800
I don't know. I mean,

57:26.800 --> 57:30.800
No, Thomas Dolan just passes you his, uh, his hobo bindle.

57:30.800 --> 57:40.800
Nathaniel's kind of scared of the, not kind of very scared of the thing with teeth. So like, is there a way that I can scoop these eggs carefully? Does it, does it seem aggressive if I get near it?

57:40.800 --> 57:51.800
Aggressive. I mean, it's difficult to tell. I mean, it's not moving that fast, but you know, as you examine it, it certainly seems to take an interest in you in return.

57:51.800 --> 58:02.800
I'm going to, I'm going to try and just pick, pick eggs quickly as if, as if, I don't know, like, uh, if I was trying to grab something from behind a spider, I'm trying to just really quickly grab things and get my fingers away from it.

58:02.800 --> 58:04.800
You know, like a spider's gold.

58:04.800 --> 58:24.800
While you don't have a lot of medical equipment here, I mean, it is fair to say that you probably got something like tweezers and forceps and stuff like that you can use so you don't, so you don't have to use your bare hands.

58:24.800 --> 58:25.800
Sure.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.800
More like a scalpel to stab the little fucker.

58:27.800 --> 58:38.800
I don't, I don't know if I'm murderous of it yet. I think there's still a part of me that's wondering about this could be the key to solving whatever this parasite I now think is a parasite in the community is.

58:38.800 --> 58:46.800
And if you wanted to keep the samples, I mean, you've got your Mason jars and stuff like that. So you could, you could certainly keep them.

58:46.800 --> 58:48.800
Let's do that. Let's do a Mason jar.

58:48.800 --> 59:11.800
So as Frederick Mellon, the first and Thomas Dolan are like, I'm picturing us kind of on opposite sides, walking in circling it with, uh, with our, with our knapsacks combs is quickly darting his fingers in trying to grab it, uh, and then decides in that split second to, to collect.

59:11.800 --> 59:15.800
And so we'll kind of back off or help you with the Mason jars.

59:15.800 --> 59:22.800
Yeah. So I mean, yeah, between using forceps and a Mason jar, you can gather up the specimens without any real risk.

59:22.800 --> 59:41.800
And yeah, I mean, without fully dissecting or demolishing the remains of, uh, of Mr. Priestly, there's no real way of telling whether you've got all the eggs, but you've certainly got a fair number of them.

59:41.800 --> 59:46.800
You've got about a half dozen plus this hatch specimen. Gross.

59:46.800 --> 59:56.800
I hold up the jar to the guys. Fellas, this, this, this, uh, this could be the key. This could be, this could be what it is. This could be the thing that is afflicting us all.

59:56.800 --> 01:00:04.800
You're saying that's what's inside of me right now? That's why I feel like shit and I lost my business? Is that little fucker right there?

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.800
It's, it's now, it's now my newest theory. Yeah.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.800
Can I squash it?

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:18.800
And I don't, I don't know. I need to run some tests. I need to, I need to know if there's a way to make these not be.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:24.800
All right, doc. Well, as sure as, as soon as you're sure of that, just let me know when I can squash that.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:36.800
OK, so, yeah, I mean, you put the jar down and at the same time, obviously, you know, Maureen Frayn is drifting in and out of consciousness.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:46.800
You've got Agatha Priestly, who's outside, who is now just wandering around, just trying to get her bearings.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.800
You've got Nancy Carver, who is still in some kind of fugue state.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:01:01.800
But yeah, as I mentioned before, I mean, there's also perhaps the, the dawning awareness that you have not seen Billy Spitzer this morning at all.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.800
Where, where, where's, where's Billy?

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.800
I could, I could use, I could use help here today of all days.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.800
Frederick, Dolan, have you, you guys, you guys seen Billy today?

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.800
Uh, no, a lot of people, uh, nobody's seen around the camp today, so.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.800
He might be with, with Esther, perhaps. Where, where would they have gone?

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.800
Do you want me to go check his tent or?

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.800
Yeah, yeah, let's do that, let's see, let's.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:37.800
Wherever they must, well, I, if Esther didn't need shoes or a coat, then if we get there and Billy's shoes and coat are also there, then we know they're together, right?

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:47.800
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a fucking Sherlock Holmes. I'm a successful textile industrialist. I'll defer to the experts.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:58.800
If, uh, if, if, if Billy's, if Billy's at home, then this is, he'll be able to come over here, help me out. We can make some headway here.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:04.800
Yeah, like I said, I'm not a fucking detective, but it seems like going to Billy's house would be a really good first step.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.800
Let's go, yeah, let's, let's go, let's go check on Billy.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:23.800
Okay, yeah, you go over to Billy's tent and, again, it looks like there's been a struggle. There's no blood here, but, you know, the insides of it look like it's been ransacked and there's no sign of Billy.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:39.800
Mellon is, like, very perplexed and is just eyeing everything in this tent, trying to figure out what went down, seeing if there's anything out of place, looking for any, any sort of evidence that might lead us to discover who had been here.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.800
Okay, you will give me a spot hidden role, then.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.800
Uh, that would be a 97.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.800
That sounds good. It's high.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:03:08.800
At least because your spot hidden's pretty good, that's not a fumble, but you are just blundering around at the moment. You could, you could, if you want, find some way of pushing the role.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:19.800
So then, Mellon reaches into his coat and puts on his glasses?

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.800
Okay. Yeah.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.800
Is that a way to push a role?

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.800
Yeah, I think so. And yeah, I think if you fail here, you, you end up scoring.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:35.800
Can we just say I was playing my character at 40% before this?

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:40.800
What happens? How, how would a push role fail in this scenario with what, with glasses?

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:50.800
Well, it wouldn't be that directly. I think, I think that you would, actually, yeah, I'd be up for the, for you just breaking your glasses.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.800
Take them out and they're cracked.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.800
Yeah.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:59.800
Yeah, that's a, that's a fail. That's a 73 on a 55.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:09.800
You shouldn't have spent so much time hiding in burn barrels trying to scare children.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:24.800
Then, yeah, you pull your glasses out and it looks like, it looks like you slept on them last night. And as you pull them out, you know, the one good lens on there just falls out and lands on the ground.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:33.800
Frederick Mellon I falls to his knees as one of the former relics of, of, of his, his time on top.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800
Oh, is that your little artifact?

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:50.800
It comes to be as, as he, and he sees, he sees in the, in the broken shards of glass, the reflections of his days gone by when he could burgle people all over the city and not feel any remorse.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:58.800
But now he can burgle so few because there are only so few who actually have anything to burgle.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:14.800
Seeing this very human moment, Thomas Dolan takes out his grandfather's fiddle and plays, plays a mournful tune, but I'm pretty sure he only has 30 in fiddling.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:18.800
So let's see how well he does.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.800
It's an 11.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.800
He plays a legitimately mournful tune.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:39.800
Oh, and not something that sounds sarcastic.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:52.800
Nathaniel doesn't have great investigation skills, but could he maybe take track? Is there, is there any kind of blood spatters? Can I maybe get a feel of maybe a direction that the scuffle took place heading toward?

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:58.800
Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean, I, I, either spot hidden or track would help there.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.800
I'm going to do a spot hidden.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.800
I hit it. I don't know how that works in this game. I hit, it's 25 on a 25.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.800
Okay. That's fine. That's good.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:28.800
So yeah, there's nothing that you can spot within the tent itself, but looking around, you can see that, yeah, there does seem to be a bit of a scuffle and certainly drag marks in the now frozen mud outside that indicate that Billy was dragged out of the tent.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:37.800
I point that out to my compatriots here. It looks like a, it looks like they went this direction, which I think we should, I think we should see where it leads.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:48.800
Wipes a single tear away from his eye, turns around, stands up, gets back down, stands back up.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:57.800
Thomas Dolan realizes this old fucker needs help and he helps him get up off the ground.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:10.800
Thank you. Oh, I really appreciate that. That's, that's really nice. You're such a wise guy. You're just emotionally intelligent.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:16.800
Thomas Dolan plays a brief song of thanks.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:26.800
Oh God, your party's got a bard now, hasn't it?

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.800
Yeah. Do we get advantage when he's playing?

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:38.800
I've never been a bard, but this might be my only chance.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:55.800
So Dr. Coombes can see, like I say, the drag marks outside and because the ground has frozen overnight, you can actually see the drag marks preserved and you can follow them if you want.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.800
I assume you want to. Yeah.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:08.800
Yeah. I mean, the drag marks, they meet up with a number of other sets of footprints. You reckon there were maybe like three or four people in the camp last night.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:15.800
The footprints, they look like men's shoes and I mean, definitely shoes and not boots.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:25.800
And from the general footprints that you can see, they look like they were probably in relatively good condition, which is unusual for people in the camp.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:37.800
Yeah, there's a couple of sets of drag marks, like they dragged two people out, and as you follow them, they go up towards the main road, the road that runs between Crawley and Arken.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:48.800
And you can see that there are some tire tracks there. It looks like there was a car that was parked just off the side of the road that drove off.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:09:00.800
And from the angle of the tire tracks, it probably drove off towards Arken or at least away from Crawley, away from the town, out of town.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:06.800
Damn. It looks like Billy was taken. Why would they take Billy?

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.800
Hey, didn't Dr. Rothstein used to work in Arken?

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.800
He did.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:16.800
Well, maybe we can show him around. I mean, maybe he can show us around.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.800
I thought that was just like an old timey phrase.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:27.800
Is Arken, is it walkable? We would have to have a vehicle to get to Arken, right?

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:43.800
Arken is probably 20 or 30 miles from here. So it's called the Arken Road because that's the direction it heads in. But, you know, Crawley is just like a mile down the road from here, but Arken is a fair way off.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:50.800
There are a number of things on this road closer than Arken itself.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.800
But the tracks lead off on the Arken Road.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.800
That's right, yeah.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.800
We just don't know that they go all the way.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:10.800
Yeah, you don't know how far they go. The nearest place on the road from here down that way is the Blue Star Diner, which is where you get your used coffee grounds.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:19.800
The woman who runs it, Ida, I think she doesn't really like it when people from the Hooverville turn up there.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:30.800
She certainly won't serve you there because you drive away paying customers. But on the other hand, if she's throwing food and old coffee grounds and stuff like that out, she'll generally let you have it for free.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:43.800
And then beyond there, there are a number of, I guess, private houses, country houses, whatever you'd want to call them, but the more upmarket houses on the outskirts of town.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.800
What do you think they would have taken Billy and Esther?

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.800
I don't know. Did Billy have gambling debts?

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:56.800
I don't think Billy was wrapped up in anything like that. He's kind of been the heart and soul of the place these days.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:02.800
I mean, he's 14. He's unlikely to have serious gambling debts, but you never know.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:09.800
Kids grow up fast these days.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.800
How far away is the diner?

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.800
The diner's fairly close. I mean, it's like, you know, five minutes walk down the road from here.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.800
And they're open late, I assume?

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.800
Oh, yeah.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:26.800
I suppose we could go see if Ida saw anything last night. Try to get some intel on that since she's close.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.800
That's a good idea.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.800
We can at least see if the tracks, you know, go past there or stop somewhere before there.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.800
Even if not, we can see if she's got any grounds at all.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:42.800
Because in between here and 30 miles away and last night, there's only going to have been one car that traveled down that road.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.800
So the tracks are going to be really obvious.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:53.800
Well, one thing that does perhaps stand out is the tracks, or at least the tire marks that you can see.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:12:00.800
They're probably not big enough to be a truck, but they certainly look like they're from a car that's bigger than your average car.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:07.800
Didn't there was that guy in camp who always bragged about his Rolls Royce Phantom?

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.800
Oh, yeah. Hyrum. Hyrum Melnick.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.800
Hyrum Melnick.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:20.800
Should we go see Boston? Should we go see him and see if...

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.800
Let's go ask him if those are Rolls Royce Phantom tracks.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.800
Or a big nice car.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:36.800
You know, I did do a fair amount of brick putting, you know, laying cars upon bricks after taking the tires.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:42.800
And, you know, I'm fairly well versed in the thick and thin of a tire.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:53.800
So I could perhaps, you know, maybe put my fingers in this dirt, in this frozen, frozen ice, and just kind of poke around.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.800
And just kind of poke around, poke around, poke, poke.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:03.800
You've really got to decide where you're from. Or not. It's fine.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:13.800
I'm from anywhere. I'm from nowhere. I'm Frederick Mellon the foist and I'm from hell. I am going to roll a praise.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.800
You're from Whitechapel via the Bronx.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:21.800
Yeah, exactly.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:29.800
Yeah, just gonna roll a praise and see if I... Oh, 32 under 30.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:40.800
Well, I'll tell you what. I'd actually accept education on that because, you know, this seems to come under your general sort of professional skills.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.800
Well then, that is a 32 on a 75.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.800
Okay, so that's a hard success.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.800
So it's going to be difficult to tell a specific make and model from just looking at the tire tracks.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:59.800
But on the other hand, yeah, I mean, you know, you mentioned Hiram's old Rolls Royce.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.800
Yeah, I mean, this could be a Rolls Royce. It could be a big model Cadillac.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.800
I mean, whatever it is, you're fairly certain that, I mean, it's from a luxury car of some kind.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.800
The kind of car that really would stand out.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.800
A big, nice sedan. Not big enough to be a truck, but too big for a Model T.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800
Yeah.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.800
Well, now we got something to ask our idea about.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.800
Yeah, that's good information. We can check in with Ida to see if she's seen a car like that in the last 24 hours.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.800
Fancy cars parked in the yard.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:29.800
There it is.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.800
Nice.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:41.800
We could just go around back. That way we're not bothering her or any of her customers and we could just kind of knock on the door and say what's up.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:49.800
Yeah, you go down to the Blue Star Diner. This is a classic roadside diner. It's made from a converted railway car.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:55.800
Yeah, it's obviously open. There's a few cars parked outside.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:00.800
And you can see that there are people eating, being served in there.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.800
But yeah, going around the back and knocking on the door.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:09.800
Yeah, Larry, the short older cook, comes and opens up the back door and just goes,

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.800
Hey, Larry, Larry.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:20.800
Why don't we let the doc take this one? I think they might, you know.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.800
Doc, they're nice to you. They give you, you know, they feed you here.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.800
Hey, Larry, it's Dr. Coons.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.800
Yeah.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:35.800
I was wondering if I could, were you here last night? You might be able to help me.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.800
I was going to talk to Ida, but if you were here last night, I could ask you too.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.800
No.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.800
Would you run and grab Ida for me?

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:48.800
And he shuts the door and goes back inside.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.800
Was that a yes?

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:57.800
For a couple of minutes, you've got no idea whether that was a yes, no, fuck off, whatever.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.800
But then about two minutes later, Ida comes to the back door. She's looking a bit harried.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.800
There's a pencil tucked, and she's got her hair up in a bun, her graying hair.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.800
And she's a fairly round, ruddy-faced woman. She's got a pencil tucked behind her ear,

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:20.800
looking a bit flustered, and says, You're too early for the leftovers and coffee grounds.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.800
Look, come back, come back, say five o'clock. I'll give you what I can then, okay?

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.800
Sorry.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.800
Ida, Ida, it's the doc. It's not bum business.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:36.800
That's not why I'm here, Ida. I'm sorry to bother you. I know you don't like us coming around in the daytime like this,

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.800
but we're missing a couple people from camp. We have reason to believe they came up this way.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:48.800
You didn't happen to see, I guess, anything strange, but especially a pretty nice car come through here last night?

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.800
A big one.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:57.800
Yeah, I mean, I was up late doing the books last night, and yeah, I guess, I guess.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:06.800
I mean, there was a big black car that drove up. Yeah, yeah, I didn't really think much of it at the time.

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:12.800
It wasn't much traffic, but yeah, it was a Cadillac, I think. Big Cadillac.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.800
Did they come in here? Did you see who was driving it?

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:22.800
No, no, no, but I know I've seen that before. I've seen it go up and down the road here before.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:31.800
I think it belongs to the man who bought Greenleys. Is that right? Greenleys?

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.800
I mean, you know that's one of the estates just up the road from here.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.800
And that's Hiram's old place.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:39.800
Yeah.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.800
I thought about being him. That's why I know.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:50.800
He certainly talked about it enough.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:57.800
So, yeah, all right. Up there, that was Hiram's old place. Yeah, that's not too far from here, right?

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.800
That's just up the road, right?

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.800
Yeah, it's like a mile up the road.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:06.800
All right. Ida, thank you. That helps us a lot, actually. That points us in a pretty concrete direction.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.800
We were never here.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.800
You fellas, you don't get yourself in any trouble now.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:20.800
I'm thinking now that I maybe shouldn't have told you that if you're going to go around and cause trouble with the good man who lives there.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.800
Don't let me be hearing from the police that you've gone up there and done something stupid, all right?

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.800
Absolutely not, Ida. This is back of house only.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:38.800
We're not going to be dealing with anybody in society who might get the feathers ruffled. This is bum business.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:45.800
It's just hobo nonsense.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:52.800
Yeah, if you don't say our names, we won't have your name in our mouth either, Ida.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:19:00.800
Yeah, she's really looking like she's regretted saying anything at all to you now.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:08.800
Anyway, if you fellas will excuse me, I've got paying customers to deal with and a whole lot of things to reconsider.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:15.800
You personally have been a huge help. Thank you so much for everything you've done and told us.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.800
Love's not the right word, but something similar.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800
Affection.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.800
Yeah, yeah, she says, and shuts the door on your face.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.800
I'm going to take a restroom break real quick.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:33.800
You think you can use the bathroom at the Blue Star Diner?

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.800
You guys distract Ida. It's a number one, I promise.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.800
You can piss in the hole in the ground like everyone else.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.800
I'm going to do that as well.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:51.800
Piss in the hole in the ground.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.800
This is great so far, Scott. Thanks for doing this.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.800
Oh yeah, no, my pleasure.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.800
For starters, it's really great to have an opportunity to play with you guys.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.800
It's great to have a chance to run this game because it's been a long time since I've done so.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.800
I've never actually recorded this one.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:11.800
It's got a creepy flavor, man.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.800
Scritching and scratching got me.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.800
I think this is one of the darker things I've written.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.800
Okay, I think we were going to head down to...

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.800
And one of the players...

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.800
Sorry, no, go ahead.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.800
No, no, no, no, Kerry.

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.800
Yeah, we could use a Hyrum right now.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.800
Thomas Dolan.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.800
So, are you heading...

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.800
Zach, were you suggesting that we go back to get Hyrum?

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.800
The question on everyone's mind is that we either...

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.800
Oh, it's every single time.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:48.800
Every single time from three continents.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.800
Yeah, I know.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:56.800
We got lag working all over the place.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.800
I'm not going to say shit.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.800
But yeah, so are you heading straight to Green Lees?

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:08.800
Are you going back to the camp for any reason?

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.800
What's your plan here?

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:17.800
Maybe go ask Hyrum some questions about his business partner who now owns Green Lees.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800
Yeah.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.800
At the very least, he could give us a lay of the land, maybe tell us about the house.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.800
Ideally, we'd bring him with us to act as a guide.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:32.800
If you're going to sneak into a place and you know someone who used to live there,

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:38.800
it's smart to ask him questions about doors and windows and other holes.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.800
Just any holes.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.800
Yeah, let's do that.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.800
General, yeah.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.800
General holery.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.800
All the holes of a home.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.800
All the house holes.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:53.800
No one knows it like a former homeowner.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800
Boston.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.800
Okay, so you head back.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.800
You head back to the camp.

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:05.800
Oh, God.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:08.800
Sorry, Scott.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:18.800
Please paint your word picture for us.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.800
So you head back.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.800
I'll say that again with that.

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:27.800
So you head back into the Hoveville.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:37.800
At this stage, when you get back to the camp, Hyrum has gone over to the medical tent.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:44.800
Having heard that Nancy is there, he's basically kneeling on the ground beside Nancy,

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.800
just talking to her, comforting her.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:52.800
And when you come into the shack, he looks up and says,

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.800
what the hell happened last night?

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.800
Nancy, I mean, what happened to her?

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.800
She's just, I don't know.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.800
We're looking into it.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:11.800
She's saying all sorts of crazy things about men with no faces and puppets and, yeah,

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.800
something about a singing puppet.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:18.800
As far as we can tell, a very experimental vaudeville show.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800
But it is weird.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.800
A lot of weird things are going on.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.800
Hyrum, we need to ask you about your old estate.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:29.800
I'm starting to say with 100% confidence that the people who did this,

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.800
who came into our Hoveville and took our little Esther and our medium-sized Billy,

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:40.800
and took them all out, they took them to Greenlee's, the place that you used to own.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:46.800
And now the livers in there, the people, the internal organs who do their business

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:50.800
inside the house that you once called your own abode,

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.800
they're the ones who came in here and they might not have faces from what she's saying,

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:00.800
but we're not sure about that, but we can be positive that it's those,

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:06.800
those are the ones who did then do this to us and we're gonna fight back,

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.800
not only gonna fight back with guns and with fists,

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.800
but we're not gonna do either one of those things.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.800
We're gonna fight back with stealth.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.800
They're not gonna know we were there. We were never there.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.800
We were there and then we were gone.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.800
And we'll come back with our people and they won't know it.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.800
Or, you know, we go in right off the bat with whatever you think

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.800
Because it used to be your home, you tell us what you think.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.800
Right, questions.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.800
You think we should do the stealth or the guns, yeah.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:40.800
So what, you're saying that you think, what, Caspar Brink's got something to do with taking the kids?

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.800
No.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.800
That's, yeah, that's crazy.

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:49.800
I mean, you know, the man's an animal, he's, you know, he's a thief,

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.800
he's the scum of the earth, but kidnapping kids?

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.800
Does he have a big black car?

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:59.800
Yeah, he's got plenty of cars.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:06.800
He bought my old cars along with the house and, yeah, he always had cars of his own.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.800
A big black Cadillac?

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.800
Yeah, yeah, he's got a caddy.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.800
We don't exactly have time to, like, clue you in on everything,

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:18.800
but Billy and Esther were, like, 100% seen taken away from here

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.800
in a big black caddy towards your estate.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.800
Son of a bitch.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:30.800
As I say, I always knew Caspar was a thief, but stealing children?

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.800
Yeah, well, yeah, you got to go get him back.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:38.800
I mean, look, I'll tell you what, if you want to get in there, take him by surprise,

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.800
you go around the back, there's some old servants' quarters around there.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.800
I mean, I never had anyone there, but there's old servants' quarters.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.800
And yeah, I mean, I don't know if he's had any work done,

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:58.800
but there's a window just by the back door that the lock on that is terrible, terrible, terrible lock.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.800
I was meant to get it fixed.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.800
Even if it was a wonderful lock, I'm not worried about it.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.800
But yeah, yeah, you break in there and, yeah, you should be fine.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.800
That's helpful, Hiram.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.800
Yeah, we really appreciate your help, Hiram.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:18.800
Hiram, put yourself in these shoes for a second, if you will.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.800
You've got two kids and you're trying to hide them, and you live in your old house.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.800
Where would you put them?

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.800
I guess down to the cellars.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.800
That, I mean, guys, you might think this a little bit weird at this point in my narrative,

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:37.800
but that also answers my next question, which is where would be the best place to sacrifice two children in your old estates?

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:44.800
Just call it a hunch, Freddie and Doc, but that's the vibe I'm getting.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.800
Anyway, we should think, Hiram, you've been a big help.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.800
Let's go, right guys?

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:50.800
Hiram, do you want to come?

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.800
He said, no, no, no, I'll stay here and look after Nancy.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.800
You know, the state she's in.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:00.800
Yeah, she, no, I'll stay here with her.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.800
That's wicked smart.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:11.800
The doctor's going to go to go around to his personal tent, his living quarters, and grab his little .38 revolver.

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.800
Okay.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.800
Freddie, you didn't come across any amazing guns today.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.800
As Thomas says that, Frederick Dolan I, Frederick Mellon I, oh, we got married.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.800
Frederick Dolan I, I took your name.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.800
You took my first.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.800
So now we're both Freddie Dolan.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.800
Mr. Freddie Dolan, the first.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:50.800
He's like patting off Hiram's shoulders of any dust or anything on his shoulders and kind of touching at his cap and pulling up his shirt and making him look nice.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.800
And he's just saying, thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.800
Now look under your hat.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.800
And he's going to try to have a 50 cents sitting on top of Hiram's head.

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.800
Give me a slot of hand roll to see whether you pull that off.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:06.800
Yes.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.800
I rolled an ought seven on a 50.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.800
Oh, wow.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.800
Okay.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.800
Yeah.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:12.800
Extreme success.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.800
So yeah.

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.800
Yeah.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:15.800
He takes his hat off.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.800
You got to tell me how you do that someday, man.

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.800
He says, he just waggles his fingers in Hiram's face.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:29.800
And then he, uh, he dips off and says, uh, I'll meet you guys, uh, up there at the front.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:30.800
I'll be just a second.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.800
Uh, and when he comes back, he comes back with a, with a shotgun, hopefully.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.800
Yeah.

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:37.800
And about half a dozen shells.

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.800
Have you guys ever fired one of these things?

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.800
I have only shot it like twice.

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.800
Sarah, it's just, um, I was just studying Thomas Dolan's character profile.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.800
Does he have any weapons around the camp?

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.800
Would that, would it be realistic to say he has a pistol stowed away or something?

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.800
Um, probably not.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.800
Yeah.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:57.800
You don't need a gun.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:58.800
You got to fiddle.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.800
That's fucking true.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.800
I'm the bard.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.800
I've got to start acting like it.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:12.800
So, um, yeah, Thomas Dolan plays a mournful, but, um, but hopeful tune, bittersweet would

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.800
be the best word for it as we set out on the road for our adventure.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:25.800
Uh, by the way, just before you go, I mean, one thing as, as Coombes is just sort of finishing

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:31.800
up in the, the medical shack before you head out, one thing you notice, the Mason jar that

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:36.800
you left with the, the eggs and the, the specimen in it.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.800
The eggs are still there.

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.800
The specimen isn't.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.800
Uh oh.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:49.800
Uh, boys, I think we got to maybe deal with, yeah, we got to deal with some local issues

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.800
before we hit off that trail.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:56.800
Do we see a little, a slime trail or anything leading out of the jar?

01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:57.800
You do.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.800
Is there a hole where it's drilled through?

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.800
Yeah, there is no hole in the jar.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:10.800
The, the lid of it is still sealed, but there does seem to be a little trail of slime coming

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:11.800
out the side of it.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.800
How did it, how did it get out of the, out of the jar?

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.800
It's, and I, I hold it up and kind of shake it a little.

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800
It's intact.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:23.800
As you shake it, one of the other eggs ruptures slightly and something begins to wriggle out

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:24.800
of it.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:25.800
Oops.

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.800
Oops.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:27.800
And he sets it down carefully.

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.800
Guys, obviously it took the lid off, put the lid back on.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.800
It's lit away.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.800
Not that hot.

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.800
Let's look for, let's look for where it's livid.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800
Yeah.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:47.800
As you follow the slime trail, it moves over to the cot that Maureen Frayn is sleeping

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.800
on at the moment.

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:51.800
Naturally, yeah.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:55.800
That's what it's going to want to do.

01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:59.800
My medical opinion now is that this thing is a parasite of some kind.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:06.800
Maybe I can sedate Agatha for, for a while, just until we figure out a way to destroy

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:07.800
Maureen Frayn.

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:08.800
I'm sorry, Maureen.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:09.800
Yeah.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.800
Doc, no offense.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.800
That sounds overly cautious.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:18.800
I don't think anybody in the future is going to judge you if we eliminate this host right

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:21.800
now in an abundance of caution.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.800
Oh, that's not necessary.

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.800
I could say I could save her potentially.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.800
We could figure this out and I could save her.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.800
We just need to make sure she doesn't leave here while we're gone.

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.800
Can we see where it went in?

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:35.800
Does it look like it crawled through a nostril or a mouth or something or did it bury like

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.800
right into her abdomen?

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.800
It looks like it crawled towards her abdomen.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.800
Maybe we can pull it out of there.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.800
Poke around, Doc.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.800
See what you find.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.800
Maybe, I mean, like pull her shirt up above her belly button, see if it's still trying

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:48.800
to crawl in.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800
Right.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.800
Exactly.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:55.800
You kind of pull her shirt up and there is, yeah, that little trail of slime that then

01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:04.800
goes to pretty much just above her navel and then disappears.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:13.800
But there's no hole or wound or even there's nothing on the body, no mark on the body?

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:21.800
Well, as Dr. Coombs examines and looks for a wound or any mark, you press her abdomen

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:29.800
just where that trail ends and your finger just sinks in through her flesh.

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:34.800
It's like sticking your finger into a bowl of warm porridge.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:40.800
And you can feel something wriggling around down to the bottom.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.800
Let's have a sanity roll.

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:43.800
Okay.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:44.800
Yeah.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.800
Appropriate.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.800
I pass really, really well.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.800
It's a 9 on a 37.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.800
Yeah, you're fine then.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:59.800
Keeping your composure even as your finger is sticking into her abdomen.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:07.800
And what's really, really weird about this is there doesn't seem to be a wound.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:15.800
As you pull your finger out, there is no indication that you even broke the skin.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:16.800
Wow.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.800
Holy shit.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.800
Maureen isn't conscious, right?

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.800
Mercifully, no.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:24.800
Fellas, I felt it in there.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:25.800
It's in there.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.800
I felt it wriggling around.

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:31.800
There's a chance I could get it with my tweezers.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.800
Do you think I should or do you think we should?

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:37.800
Thomas Dolan is shakily handling you, your surgical tongs.

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:43.800
I take them and that's my goal now is to try and use my surgical tongs to try and grab

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.800
the wriggling creature that I felt a second ago.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.800
My goal is to pull it out.

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.800
Frederick, get the jar ready.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.800
The jar didn't do fucking nothing last time.

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:57.800
Well, let's have a Dex roll to see how well you pull this off.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:02.800
Oh, it's a 71 on a 70.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.800
Oh, no.

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.800
Push it, push it.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.800
Well, you've got a couple of options.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.800
I'm going to pull this off.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.800
Oh, no.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.800
Push it, push it.

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.800
Well, you've got a couple of options.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:20.800
You could spend a point of luck on changing that to a 70.

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:26.800
Alternatively, you could push the roll so that you haven't quite managed to get an angle

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:35.800
in there with the forceps, but if you really push, you could try to force me.

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.800
I'm going to use the luck spend.

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:45.800
I'm going to spend a point of luck to get the...

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.800
I'm so disappointed in you.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.800
You're no fun.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:57.800
This is a woman's life, Scott.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.800
That brings my luck down to 19.

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:08.800
You manage to force the forceps in through the comparatively small area of her abdomen

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.800
that's permeable.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.800
But, yeah, you manage to get hold of the wriggling creature and pull it out.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.800
And, yeah, it's writhing around within the forceps and screaming again.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:28.800
Now that you've got it out, it does look significantly larger than when you saw it before.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.800
It's pretty much doubled in size.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:39.800
Doc, I know you're on Team Ja, but what if you just let us smash this thing right now?

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:44.800
Is he Rasta?

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:45.800
Team Ja.

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:46.800
Team Ja.

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:57.800
I was actually really proud of how I managed to make that Boston.

01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.800
Dr. Coombes is like, no, you're right.

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.800
We can't risk it getting out again.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.800
Let's destroy this one.

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:07.800
And I've got the eggs that I can run my tests on.

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.800
So how are you destroying it?

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:10.800
Boot it.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.800
Yeah, I'm going to drop it on the ground and try and step on it.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.800
Okay.

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.800
Give me a luck roll.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.800
Maybe don't drop it.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.800
Maybe just place it under your boot.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.800
Dudes, I failed with a 100.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.800
It's a zero, zero, zero.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.800
Okay, so you drop it on the ground and you stamp on it.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:36.800
And there's no resistance, no squishing sound, nothing like that.

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.800
And when you bring your boot back up, there's no trace of it.

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:54.800
No.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.800
I'm lifting up my foot.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.800
Did you get out from under it?

01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.800
I don't see it.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.800
It's not, where is it?

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:06.800
I'm shaking my head and looking at you sideways and passing the tongs to you.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.800
It's like your foot was the jaw.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.800
I'm not pulling this thing out of your foot.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:11.800
You mean?

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:18.800
What do you feel though, as you realize that this thing has crawled inside your flesh,

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.800
is perversely, you have a sense of immense wellbeing.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:33.800
For some reason, your spirits are lifted and yeah, you feel almost a surge of hope

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:40.800
and just this lightness in your heart that hasn't been there for a long time.

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.800
And yeah, let's break there.

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.800
Oh my God.

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.800
Holy shit.

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:53.800
Scott, this is dope.

01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:00.800
Life surreal, in retrospect a dream.

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:06.800
Easy times, feel less than serene.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:14.800
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:20.800
So we long for days gone past us.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:29.800
Grief and strife, bloody, that's real life.
