00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
Howdy-do, my wolf pups.

00:02.700 --> 00:06.500
It's your rootin' tootin' DJ Wolf the dog.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.660
Emphasis on the tootin'.

00:08.660 --> 00:11.500
I have horrible bowel issues.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.780
Please send some tootin' medicine

00:13.780 --> 00:17.560
into the interdimensional hallways, I wonder.

00:17.560 --> 00:22.360
But I will not let my passive massive gas emissions

00:22.360 --> 00:24.400
ruin this transmission,

00:24.400 --> 00:29.400
which is broadcastin' live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:30.560 --> 00:35.080
I think I smell somethin' funky.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.720
We must have a new Howlin' with Wolf.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.440
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Mason

00:40.440 --> 00:43.960
in Orlando, Florida, who tweeted about the show

00:43.960 --> 00:46.320
and tagged that pretending pod,

00:46.320 --> 00:49.100
a thing you will also do the next time

00:49.100 --> 00:50.740
you are on the Twitter.

00:50.740 --> 00:55.120
Mason writes, the Yatil Arts Foundation

00:55.120 --> 00:58.700
would like to invite you for a one-night-only performance

00:58.700 --> 01:01.580
of the show that everyone is talkin' about,

01:01.580 --> 01:04.460
Leroy and Juwan.

01:04.460 --> 01:09.220
Join classically trained performers like Liberty Siegel,

01:09.220 --> 01:13.900
Isa Al-Barsoumi, and Craig O'Doul

01:13.900 --> 01:18.540
as they transport you to the magical realm of Carcosa

01:18.540 --> 01:20.620
through the unforgettable songs

01:20.620 --> 01:25.620
and legendary choreography of the 1895 classic.

01:26.060 --> 01:27.780
Tickets are goin' fast,

01:27.780 --> 01:31.200
so hurry to your local performin' arts center.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.620
If you see the yellow sign, you're in the right place.

01:35.620 --> 01:39.460
Huh, well, Mason, I think I'm gonna have to start

01:39.460 --> 01:41.700
gettin' my producer to start proofin'

01:41.700 --> 01:44.020
some of these Howlin' with Wolfses,

01:44.020 --> 01:46.900
because some of y'all just send the wildest shit

01:46.900 --> 01:49.020
and it truly does scare me.

01:49.020 --> 01:52.100
Mason, I hope your weird performin' arts thing

01:52.100 --> 01:54.060
is fun and not creepy.

01:54.060 --> 01:57.400
It better not be creepy and weird, Mason.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.180
If you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,

02:00.180 --> 02:03.020
tag at PretendingPod on the internet

02:03.020 --> 02:05.980
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

02:05.980 --> 02:07.560
and let us know about it.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.780
If you wanna find Scott on Twitter

02:09.780 --> 02:13.860
or hang out with the cast and other listeners on Discord

02:13.860 --> 02:17.260
or listen to some of Justin's incredible score,

02:17.260 --> 02:20.000
then friendship ended with Zelda,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.480
now Link is my best friend,

02:22.480 --> 02:26.000
and all the Links are in the show notes.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.480
And what does Link say when he meets one of a set

02:29.480 --> 02:32.640
of explicit or understood regulations

02:32.640 --> 02:34.840
or principles governing conduct

02:34.840 --> 02:38.600
within a particular activity or sphere?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.320
Hi, rule.

02:40.320 --> 02:45.160
Fuck Ganondorf Dragmire, it's time for the news.

02:45.160 --> 02:49.260
Last time, Elden Ring ended up dancin' with a woman

02:49.260 --> 02:53.060
whose mind was already owned by some force greater

02:53.060 --> 02:57.000
than Elden had ever met, such force that Chequers,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.040
Elden's leader, had to pull out smell insults

03:00.040 --> 03:02.680
to bring the psychic back to reality.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.980
Lafayette J. Honeycutt teased his own invention

03:06.980 --> 03:09.900
as he and his man, Harvey Brewer,

03:09.900 --> 03:13.380
climbed up a frozen ladder to the top of the tower

03:13.380 --> 03:18.040
adorned with Cicero Mordaunt's strange aerial antennae.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.480
While up there, Harvey saw somethin' indescribable

03:21.480 --> 03:24.580
flyin' through the winter storm and toward the house.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.840
But at the very end of the last episode,

03:27.840 --> 03:30.640
Elden Ring basically pledged allegiance

03:30.640 --> 03:33.760
to this unimaginable power that has taken hold

03:33.760 --> 03:37.960
of the guests here, and when Chequers brought him back again

03:37.960 --> 03:41.560
the changed psychic stared into the pitch black eyes

03:41.560 --> 03:44.240
of Reverend Nye, who winked.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.520
If that doesn't give you shivers,

03:46.520 --> 03:48.520
then you need to release the tension

03:48.520 --> 03:50.520
in your jaw and shoulders.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.800
Here, maybe this'll help.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.740
It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.

03:57.480 --> 04:02.480
I didn't know a body could be hollow

04:04.200 --> 04:08.200
before its blood ran cold.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.200
I didn't know that the wind could sew

04:16.200 --> 04:21.200
through tissue and faggot bone.

04:23.200 --> 04:28.200
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

04:31.200 --> 04:36.200
Hollow when you sang.

04:39.200 --> 04:44.200
I thought you might be starvin'

04:46.200 --> 04:51.200
so I gave you everything.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.200
Who would like to recount what happened last time?

04:58.200 --> 05:01.200
Oh shit, welcome to pretending to be people!

05:01.200 --> 05:04.200
Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack!

05:05.200 --> 05:09.200
If it's dark, look in the window and there's a face there.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.200
If you're stoned right now and it's dark outside,

05:13.200 --> 05:15.200
don't look in the window.

05:15.200 --> 05:19.200
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.200
There's not someone in your closet you don't have to check.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.200
But there is somebody in the backseat of your car.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.200
Oh!

05:28.200 --> 05:31.200
That's why the car behind you keeps flashing their brides.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.200
Oh no.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.200
Listen to podcasts while driving, cut this bit.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
No!

05:36.200 --> 05:39.200
Put in honking noises.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
Yeah, put in sirens.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
Sirens.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.200
Oh my god, that happened to me the other day.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.200
It made me so angry and it was another actual play.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.200
That wasn't fun for me.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.200
It scared me.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.200
I don't like cops.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.200
Alright, so...

05:52.200 --> 05:54.200
Yeah, in the words of John Lennon,

05:54.200 --> 05:58.200
Get a job, cop!

05:58.200 --> 06:04.200
And we are here in the pretending to be people episode

06:04.200 --> 06:07.200
with a special guest named Scott Dormerd.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.200
Scott, thank you for joining us once again.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.200
Oh, my pleasure, gents. My pleasure.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.200
How do you think it's going so far?

06:13.200 --> 06:17.200
It's accelerating nicely and I am looking forward to doing horrible things to all of you.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.200
Nice!

06:18.200 --> 06:19.200
Yeah, we're gonna die.

06:19.200 --> 06:23.200
Our bodies are ready.

06:23.200 --> 06:28.200
Hey, Zach, big thanks for taking that huge luck hit for me in the last one.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
I'm a team player.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.200
What are you at now?

06:30.200 --> 06:32.200
I am down to two.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.200
No, I'm just kidding. I have 51.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.200
Oh, shit.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
After all that?

06:36.200 --> 06:37.200
You'll be fine.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.200
You had mad luck.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.200
Okay.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.200
Yeah, 65 luck.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.200
Wow.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.200
You won't need luck for anything else in this scenario.

06:43.200 --> 06:51.200
I'm at 32 right now, so I could still survive an atomic blast, but just barely.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.200
I would have been at 32 if you hadn't taken it for me.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.200
Oh, well, you're welcome, my dear sir.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.200
I'm still sitting pretty at 65.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.200
You need to start doing more crazy shit.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.200
I'm currently wrecking alien technology.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.200
I think I'm gonna start having to use some luck.

07:05.200 --> 07:09.200
So, yeah, last time we left off, you guys were in the tower.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.200
Destroying.

07:10.200 --> 07:14.200
We had discovered the secret of Mordent's Tower thanks to Zach's luck sacrifice,

07:14.200 --> 07:19.200
and the secret was it was set up to receive some kind of alien transmissions.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.200
Or send, I think.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
Send, okay, yes.

07:22.200 --> 07:27.200
Possibly some sort of psychic thing, encouraging people to enjoy the invention.

07:27.200 --> 07:33.200
Yeah, meanwhile, Checkers is chatting it up with an heiress to a fortune.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.200
A real Greg over there.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.200
I'm pulling a Greg, and then...

07:39.200 --> 07:41.200
Succession reference.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.200
Yeah, the senator still haven't talked to him.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.200
Have yet to talk to the senator from Vermont.

07:47.200 --> 07:53.200
I doubt that we'll be able to get to a psychic attack, psychic attack on him, because...

07:53.200 --> 07:54.200
Why, Zach?

07:54.200 --> 07:57.200
Well, Elden Ring, which is my full name.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.200
Use it or lose it.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.200
He's like, losing is an option. Please, please, lose it.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.200
I think it's a really fun joke.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.200
Scott, what would you have my name be?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.200
I mean, literally anything else.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.200
All right, I'll be literally anything else.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.200
He's now Link from Zelda.

08:23.200 --> 08:29.200
When we go back and listen to this, every time Elden Ring is said, it's just Scott introducing himself.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.200
It's like, yeah, I'm Scott Dorward.

08:34.200 --> 08:38.200
Every time Elden Ring is said, it's replaced with, it's a me.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.200
It's a me.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.200
Or you could just call me Kief, since that's like...

08:42.200 --> 08:48.200
Yeah, we can spoil maybe at this point that your character is inspired by Kief from The Righteous Gemstones.

08:48.200 --> 08:55.200
If you have been hitting some character moments with that in mind that have made Joe and I almost wet our pants.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.200
It's been a really fun experience.

08:57.200 --> 09:01.200
I'm happy to have such a delightful cult leader to be playing alongside,

09:01.200 --> 09:10.200
as well as a crew of two that no one should outdo the brewer and whichever name you're going by.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
Dave Ellington!

09:12.200 --> 09:14.200
Dave Ellington, isn't that a pretty good fake name?

09:14.200 --> 09:15.200
It's fucking great.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.200
David Ellington, or is he just Birth Dave?

09:18.200 --> 09:21.200
Oh yeah, I am going by David Ellington.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.200
Yeah, it's very familiar for you two to call me Dave.

09:26.200 --> 09:34.200
But where we really ended off is that Elden Ring here reached into the depths of part of your mind,

09:34.200 --> 09:37.200
specifically Margaret Payne, the philanthropist,

09:37.200 --> 09:45.200
reached into her mind and was met once again with a voice that basically enlisted Elden Ring

09:45.200 --> 09:50.200
to make sure that the partygoers know that nothing should go off without a hitch this evening,

09:50.200 --> 09:54.200
that Mardant's new invention should be well received,

09:54.200 --> 10:00.200
and that everyone should know it's going to change the world, you know.

10:00.200 --> 10:10.200
And so, then he comes to and sees the fucking religion man with black eyes.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.200
Did you forget the word reverent?

10:15.200 --> 10:16.200
Yeah.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.200
The fucking religion man.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.200
But yeah, then you looked at Checkers and said,

10:22.200 --> 10:26.200
Are you excited for Mardant's new invention? It's going to change the world, you know.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.200
See, isn't that a great Keef, everybody?

10:28.200 --> 10:31.200
Doing Keef from the Righteous Gemstones.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.200
When he says that to Checkers, immediately he's-

10:37.200 --> 10:39.200
Psychic attack! Psychic attack! Psychic attack!

10:39.200 --> 10:41.200
Are you really attacking him?

10:41.200 --> 10:42.200
Okay.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.200
Isn't that how I would put it in your head?

10:44.200 --> 10:47.200
Yeah, it kinda is. You know what? You said you wouldn't.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
I did say that.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.200
And you meant it, but now you have no choice.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.200
I really don't.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.200
Okay, so is it a power contest?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.200
Scott, is this cool?

10:56.200 --> 11:01.200
If you're both happy with this, I am absolutely ecstatic.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
I'm fine with it, yeah.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.200
Oh shit.

11:06.200 --> 11:10.200
I succeeded with a 38 on a 90, and I got a 31.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.200
And what is Checkers' power?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.200
90 as well.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.200
Oh god, so you're both tied.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.200
We're in a minelock!

11:21.200 --> 11:24.200
Yeah, I mean, normally it goes to the person with the higher power,

11:24.200 --> 11:27.200
but you've both got the same power.

11:27.200 --> 11:33.200
So I'm happy, I think, to treat this as a stalemate, so yes.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.200
Checkers can feel, yeah, for some reason,

11:37.200 --> 11:40.200
Eldin has turned against you, it seems.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.200
He is trying to implant these thoughts in your head.

11:43.200 --> 11:47.200
But at the same time, he has at least implanted some of them

11:47.200 --> 11:53.200
so that perhaps you can feel that he really wants you to go out there

11:53.200 --> 11:59.200
and convince everyone else at the party that Mordin's adventure

11:59.200 --> 12:01.200
is going to change the world, you know?

12:01.200 --> 12:04.200
Yeah, so I can feel that he's done this to me.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.200
Eldin Ring starts crying.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
Eldin!

12:10.200 --> 12:12.200
Eldin, what is the invention?

12:13.200 --> 12:16.200
It's going to change the world, you know?

12:16.200 --> 12:19.200
Checkers starts backing up a little bit,

12:19.200 --> 12:21.200
and he wants to get the fuck out of this room.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.200
He doesn't want to be around psychic attacks.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
Checkers!

12:25.200 --> 12:27.200
Yeah, Checkers runs out the front.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.200
It's going to change the world, you know?

12:29.200 --> 12:32.200
He runs out the front into the snow.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.200
How far away is the tower from me right now?

12:35.200 --> 12:37.200
A couple of minutes walk.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.200
Yeah, you can see the outline of it.

12:39.200 --> 12:45.200
It's quite dark out here now, and there is really quite heavy snow.

12:45.200 --> 12:49.200
If you're looking around just trying to get your bearings there in the snow,

12:49.200 --> 12:51.200
you can give me a spot to hit and roll.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.200
There you are.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.200
No, I mean, you can remember roughly where you came from,

12:57.200 --> 13:00.200
but you can't even make out the outline of the tower now.

13:00.200 --> 13:05.200
There's a few feet of snow, it seems, that have fallen since you've been in there.

13:05.200 --> 13:10.200
The cars are partly buried under the snow now,

13:10.200 --> 13:14.200
and you can't even see any footprints out here now.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.200
It's all been covered up.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.200
Yeah, since I didn't grab my coat or anything, I'm cold already,

13:19.200 --> 13:23.200
and Checkers is thinking, I just need to get inside,

13:23.200 --> 13:27.200
but not around all the crazy people that are in there.

13:27.200 --> 13:31.200
He remembers when he got poked in the eye by his pencil

13:31.200 --> 13:34.200
that they were passing a tower,

13:34.200 --> 13:38.200
so he wants to go in the direction that he thinks the tower is.

13:38.200 --> 13:43.200
Well, seeing as you're doing this blind, let's have a luck roll.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.200
Pass. 17.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
Fuck yeah.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.200
So, yeah, even though you can't see the tower,

13:51.200 --> 13:56.200
you make your way through the whipping snow,

13:56.200 --> 14:03.200
and you do eventually find yourself at the base of this structure.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.200
You can make out the general shape of it now that you're underneath it,

14:06.200 --> 14:10.200
but the visibility has dropped almost nothing now.

14:10.200 --> 14:15.200
He reaches out to the rungs of the ladder,

14:15.200 --> 14:18.200
and he's like, oh, I think there might be ice on this,

14:18.200 --> 14:21.200
so he gives it a little lick, and yeah, sure enough.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.200
It tastes cold.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.200
Sure enough, it tastes like cold, and there is ice on it,

14:26.200 --> 14:30.200
but he's going to try to carefully make his way up

14:30.200 --> 14:32.200
because he's freezing cold right now,

14:32.200 --> 14:34.200
so he just wants to get inside somewhere.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.200
Yeah, you make your way out.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.200
It is not a pleasant climb.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.200
Every rung is now more and more slippery as you're going up,

14:42.200 --> 14:46.200
and the wind is pulling at your clothing a couple of times.

14:46.200 --> 14:50.200
You're really having to hold on tight to stop yourself being blown off,

14:50.200 --> 14:54.200
but somehow you do make it up to this trapdoor,

14:54.200 --> 14:57.200
and from the other side of the trapdoor,

14:57.200 --> 15:00.200
you can hear the sound of things being smashed.

15:00.200 --> 15:06.200
Yeah, intense clanging and genteel screams

15:06.200 --> 15:09.200
and the grunts of a brute.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.200
Yeah, that terrifies Checkers,

15:13.200 --> 15:18.200
but he's freezing cold, and the only option is climbing back down this,

15:18.200 --> 15:20.200
and he's not going to do that, so he...

15:20.200 --> 15:25.200
I think you might recognize this Lafayette in the screens.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.200
As I'm trying to decide whether I climb back down

15:28.200 --> 15:32.200
to get away from this scary sound, I hear him say something.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.200
I'm like, oh, I think that's the scientist,

15:34.200 --> 15:36.200
and I pop in.

15:36.200 --> 15:41.200
We comically stop in mid-motion of our smashing and see him standing there.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.200
Oh, Checkers.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.200
Fellas?

15:47.200 --> 15:49.200
Enjoying the party?

15:49.200 --> 15:52.200
Harvey, have you thought any more about that pamphlet I gave you?

15:54.200 --> 15:56.200
I haven't got a chance to read it yet.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.200
We're kind of busy here.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.200
You can read, though, right?

15:58.200 --> 15:59.200
Of course.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.200
Okay, great.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.200
Checkers, be a lad and grab something blunt and heavy

16:03.200 --> 16:05.200
and start smashing all of this, would you?

16:05.200 --> 16:07.200
I'm going to look around.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.200
That's a fail on my spot hidden, so I'm going to grab...

16:10.200 --> 16:12.200
What's something shitty that would be up here?

16:12.200 --> 16:14.200
Just kick something, Checkers.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.200
I don't know, just smash, smash, Checkers, smash.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.200
I start using my fists and feet to...

16:19.200 --> 16:23.200
I'm not really sure what I'm doing, but there's a big guy.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.200
There's these two guys and a really big one telling me to do this.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.200
I'm just going to do it.

16:27.200 --> 16:35.200
Did you see two guys in tuxedos just kicking weird science machinery?

16:35.200 --> 16:38.200
This is what the liberal elite do at parties.

16:38.200 --> 16:44.200
Yeah, I'm going to start smashing stuff, but also there's a lot of cool gadget-looking shit here,

16:44.200 --> 16:48.200
so I'm going to start flipping switches while I'm punching buttons and stuff.

16:48.200 --> 16:53.200
Okay, yeah, flipping switches doesn't really do much at the moment because...

16:53.200 --> 16:54.200
Yeah, there's no power.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.200
Yeah, we smashed it up good.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.200
Did anything happen when we smashed the big bulb?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.200
It broke.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.200
Nice!

17:03.200 --> 17:05.200
Cool, I bet that was loud.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.200
I bet it was like...

17:10.200 --> 17:13.200
Checkers is starting to really get into it.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.200
He hasn't really had an outlet for his frustration in a while,

17:17.200 --> 17:21.200
so in his coked-up brain, he's like, yeah, fuck this place,

17:21.200 --> 17:23.200
and he pulls out a lighter.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.200
He's going to try to just set something on fire.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
Oh, that's the spirit, boyo.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.200
Can you give me a luck roll, please?

17:31.200 --> 17:35.200
Scott did say earlier that the flaming tower could fall and you guys could all live.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.200
Yeah, 25 on a 32.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.200
So you two managed to start a couple of small fires,

17:41.200 --> 17:44.200
but at the moment, they haven't gone completely out of control.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.200
Perfect.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.200
You set an attainable goal and you achieved that goal.

17:51.200 --> 17:56.200
Yeah, as I continue kicking the stuff in here and I look at Harvey,

17:56.200 --> 17:59.200
I'm like, look, and just point at one of the fires.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.200
Harvey looks over and is surprised how into it you've gotten,

18:02.200 --> 18:04.200
but then notices the fire.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.200
Whoa, buddy, maybe too much there.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.200
We're still up here. If this thing goes up, we gotta go down.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.200
Yeah, fuck this place.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.200
The fire is slowly spreading.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.200
It's caught onto some of the insulation of the wiring

18:17.200 --> 18:23.200
and there's a bit of thick black smoke that is now pooling into the air,

18:23.200 --> 18:26.200
but it's not out of control yet.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.200
Lafayette, he sees that. He's taking a break.

18:29.200 --> 18:34.200
He's taking a heavy breather, and he thinks it's hilarious that...

18:36.200 --> 18:38.200
I keep wanting to call you Chuckles.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.200
You surely can.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.200
Chuckles, I think it's hilarious what you've done in this tower,

18:44.200 --> 18:48.200
but I do think we should probably get a move on pretty quickly now.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.200
He takes a moment to look around,

18:50.200 --> 18:55.200
and he wants to steal the most advanced thing, intact thing he can,

18:55.200 --> 18:58.200
like an antenna, maybe the most alien-looking deal.

18:58.200 --> 19:02.200
He's like, fuck you, Cicero, I'll burn your tower down

19:02.200 --> 19:05.200
and I'm going to reverse-engineer your technology.

19:05.200 --> 19:10.200
The really alien-looking antennae are actually on the outside of the tower.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.200
I mean, you've smashed the place up.

19:12.200 --> 19:16.200
You could open up a window and lean out and try to unscrew one of them,

19:16.200 --> 19:22.200
but the wind is really high at the moment, so this is not without risk.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.200
Harvey?

19:29.200 --> 19:33.200
Hey, boy, Harvey, would you please lean out the window there

19:33.200 --> 19:36.200
and grab me one of those antennae before this place burns to the ground?

19:36.200 --> 19:39.200
Harvey's just going to do a smash with a fist through a window

19:39.200 --> 19:43.200
and try and reach out and grab ahold of the nearest antennae

19:43.200 --> 19:45.200
and just yank as hard as he can.

19:45.200 --> 19:50.200
I'd say give me a combined strength and luck roll

19:50.200 --> 19:54.200
to see whether you can do this without destroying the antenna

19:54.200 --> 19:58.200
and without cutting your arms to shreds on the broken window.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.200
I rolled a 71. My strength is 90, but my luck is only 65.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.200
Okay, so that is a failure.

20:07.200 --> 20:11.200
So I think what that means is, yes, you've punched through the window.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.200
You've managed to wrench this antennae away.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.200
I mean, you've got bits of it in your hand,

20:17.200 --> 20:20.200
but you have cut your arm in the process.

20:20.200 --> 20:24.200
I'll say that you take only one hit point of damage from this,

20:24.200 --> 20:28.200
but there is blood that is now running down your hand,

20:28.200 --> 20:30.200
or at least running down your arm,

20:30.200 --> 20:33.200
and your hand's getting a bit sticky and slick from it.

20:33.200 --> 20:37.200
It might occur to you that this is perhaps suboptimal

20:37.200 --> 20:40.200
for your climb down again.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.200
Can I attempt a first aid roll on him real quick?

20:43.200 --> 20:45.200
I mean, you can try.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.200
It'll take you a bit of time to bind the wound,

20:47.200 --> 20:50.200
and that fire is beginning to spray.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.200
If you want to take the time out in the burning building

20:53.200 --> 20:56.200
to bind the wound up, you certainly can.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.200
At the very least, it'll be entertaining.

20:59.200 --> 21:03.200
When Checkers sees this happening and sees him cut,

21:03.200 --> 21:08.200
with his 1% in medicine, he holds his lighter up.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.200
Got to cauterize it.

21:12.200 --> 21:16.200
No, why don't you hold off on the cauterization?

21:16.200 --> 21:19.200
Lafayette is looking at the briefcase

21:19.200 --> 21:22.200
that's never left his hand this whole time,

21:22.200 --> 21:25.200
and he's looking at the flames, and he's like,

21:25.200 --> 21:29.200
I think we should probably move it pretty quick.

21:29.200 --> 21:33.200
He runs down the ladder without further consideration.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.200
Oh, you're such a tease!

21:35.200 --> 21:37.200
Well, seeing as you're doing this in a hurry now,

21:37.200 --> 21:40.200
fleeing the burning cabin,

21:40.200 --> 21:42.200
you're perhaps not getting the opportunity

21:42.200 --> 21:45.200
to be quite as cautious as you were on the way up,

21:45.200 --> 21:48.200
so I think this is where I start asking for rolls.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.200
Okay.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.200
I'll give you a choice as to whether to make a dex

21:52.200 --> 21:54.200
or a climb roll, whichever is better,

21:54.200 --> 21:56.200
but what I will say is that,

21:56.200 --> 21:59.200
as Lafayette is carrying his suitcase,

21:59.200 --> 22:02.200
I'm going to ask for a hard dig.

22:02.200 --> 22:06.200
Well, my dex is 30, and I rolled a 36.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.200
So you missed by 21 here.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.200
You've got a number of rungs down,

22:11.200 --> 22:15.200
but now that you're trying to get down fast,

22:15.200 --> 22:17.200
these rungs are really quite slick,

22:17.200 --> 22:21.200
and you realize that you're not going to be able to get down

22:21.200 --> 22:27.200
before the flames start spreading to the actual structure

22:27.200 --> 22:29.200
if you're carrying the suitcase.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.200
Oh!

22:30.200 --> 22:33.200
Well, then my only option is to open it,

22:33.200 --> 22:36.200
strap on the jet pack inside.

22:36.200 --> 22:39.200
Yes!

22:39.200 --> 22:42.200
Bow, bow, bow, bow.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.200
And rocket man away from the fucking conflagration.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.200
Rocket man!

22:48.200 --> 22:51.200
So you are trying to, while in, you know,

22:51.200 --> 22:53.200
50 or 60 mile per hour winds,

22:53.200 --> 22:57.200
on this icy ladder under a burning building,

22:57.200 --> 22:59.200
you're trying to strap on a jet pack.

22:59.200 --> 23:03.200
Well, when you put it like that, Scott.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.200
Sounds simple, easy, and yeah, that's what he does.

23:06.200 --> 23:10.200
His design is as ergonomic as it is brilliant.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.200
Okay.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.200
In which case, I think just for slipping this on in a big hurry,

23:15.200 --> 23:17.200
let's just make this an ordinary Dex roll.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.200
Okay.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.200
Oh, you better fucking make it 26.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.200
Yes!

23:21.200 --> 23:23.200
On a 30.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
Okay.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.200
So yes, you can strap that on.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.200
And what is your plan?

23:28.200 --> 23:30.200
Are you just leaping into the wind from there,

23:30.200 --> 23:33.200
or are you trying to just slow your descent?

23:33.200 --> 23:34.200
What are you doing?

23:34.200 --> 23:37.200
He licks a finger and holds it out and gauges, like,

23:37.200 --> 23:41.200
before it gets, like, whipped away by the 50 mile an hour wind.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.200
He says, it is cold.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.200
Your finger tastes cold.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.200
He gauges the direction of the wind and leaps off with it

23:53.200 --> 23:58.200
and ignites the jet pack and tries to, you know,

23:58.200 --> 24:00.200
he doesn't want to fight the storm.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.200
He wants to rise with it into the air.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.200
Riders on the storm.

24:05.200 --> 24:11.200
So you are completely at the mercy of this jet pack.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.200
So I think we'll come back to you in a moment.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.200
Okay, perfect.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.200
Fuck, yes, dude.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.200
That was amazing.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.200
But let's deal with the other two first.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.200
So you're in this burning structure,

24:24.200 --> 24:29.200
and you've just seen Lafayette down below you on the ladder

24:29.200 --> 24:32.200
strap something onto his back and then just jump off the ladder.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.200
Yeah, Lafayette is like, we gotta get out of here.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.200
Deuces.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.200
Can I assume that it's on fire enough that, like,

24:38.200 --> 24:39.200
it's a pretty well lit...

24:39.200 --> 24:40.200
It's well lit.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.200
I'm well lit, bro.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.200
Yeah, yeah.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.200
I think the darkness is the least of your problems.

24:45.200 --> 24:50.200
Yeah, so I see that happen, and I look around the room,

24:50.200 --> 24:54.200
and I look at Harvey before we can even have the conversation

24:54.200 --> 24:55.200
about who goes first.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.200
I'm going down.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.200
Harvey is standing there a bit odd watching the rocket pack

24:59.200 --> 25:02.200
light up and start to take off, and he's,

25:02.200 --> 25:04.200
the madman did it.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.200
The madman did it.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.200
It's working.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.200
It's working.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.200
Goodbye, Harvey.

25:11.200 --> 25:15.200
As he watches wherever that starts to take him,

25:15.200 --> 25:18.200
Harvey's going to start trying to get down the ladder also.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.200
Yeah, as soon as I go down, I...

25:20.200 --> 25:22.200
Get your ass down here.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.200
We need you in the group.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.200
Yeah.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.200
Like, I can't lose a cult member.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.200
Yeah.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.200
So I think checkers, first of all,

25:33.200 --> 25:35.200
let's have a dex roll from checkers to see how well you're

25:35.200 --> 25:37.200
clambering down the ladder.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.200
That's a 36 on a 50.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.200
OK, so you're going down fine.

25:41.200 --> 25:45.200
I mean, it's slow going because, again, you're having to,

25:45.200 --> 25:47.200
every now and then, just hug onto the ladder for dear life

25:47.200 --> 25:49.200
to stop being blown off.

25:49.200 --> 25:53.200
But you are getting down without falling off, which is good.

25:53.200 --> 25:56.200
On the other hand, Harvey and his wounded arm now,

25:56.200 --> 25:59.200
I'm going to ask for a hard dex roll because of the injury.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.200
It's a fail fail.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.200
62 on a 50.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.200
You're making your way down, but at the moment,

26:07.200 --> 26:11.200
the blood's dripping down off your arm and your hand's slick.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.200
Every now and then, because of the blood in your hand,

26:13.200 --> 26:14.200
it's actually freezing.

26:14.200 --> 26:17.200
I was going to say, I'm getting stuck to it every now and then.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.200
And when you're pulling us away, you can feel skin coming

26:20.200 --> 26:23.200
away as you're getting your hand free.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.200
Who's hungry?

26:27.200 --> 26:31.200
He's going to try and rip off his sleeve of that arm and try

26:31.200 --> 26:34.200
and pull it down further so that he's not having the blood

26:34.200 --> 26:36.200
contact with the rail.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.200
I'll tell you what, let's be generous here.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.200
Let's treat this as a push roll so there will be really bad

26:41.200 --> 26:43.200
consequences if you fail.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.200
But I'll say it because you're doing that.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.200
This sounds more like brute strength than dexterity.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.200
If you want to make a strength roll.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.200
Yeah, I would like to do that.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.200
You got this.

26:54.200 --> 26:58.200
It's a 64 on a 90, so I pass, but not a hard pass.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.200
No, this just needed to be a hard.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.200
So yes, you do manage to tug it down.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.200
I mean, that's not quite stopped the bleeding, but it

27:08.200 --> 27:11.200
slowed it down enough that the blood isn't going to be quite

27:11.200 --> 27:13.200
as much of an impediment.

27:13.200 --> 27:17.200
So yeah, with that, you can clamp your way carefully and

27:17.200 --> 27:19.200
painfully down to the ground.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.200
Do I lose any hit points in the process?

27:21.200 --> 27:22.200
Is it that kind of damage?

27:22.200 --> 27:24.200
No, you lost the one before for slashing your arm up,

27:24.200 --> 27:25.200
but that's it.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.200
But the rest of it, I mean, it's largely cosmetic damage.

27:28.200 --> 27:31.200
Your hand hurts a bit from endorsing a bit of the skin off

27:31.200 --> 27:36.200
your palm and your fingertips, but yeah, that's just uncomfortable.

27:36.200 --> 27:39.200
Oh, you got a bright future ahead of you though.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.200
No fingertips.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.200
You could do some stuff.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.200
Crime.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.200
Crime for sure.

27:47.200 --> 27:51.200
Also in 1937, do they have that kind of forensics?

27:51.200 --> 27:52.200
Google it.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.200
Oh yeah.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.200
Google it.

27:54.200 --> 27:59.200
Yeah, fingerprint technology came in about 1900 and even

27:59.200 --> 28:03.200
from the 1930s, they could do latent fingerprints off fabrics

28:03.200 --> 28:04.200
and stuff like that.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.200
I'm just saying this because I researched it for a different project.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.200
No, that's awesome.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.200
No, that's really cool.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.200
It's nice to have someone knowledgeable on the podcast.

28:11.200 --> 28:15.200
I guarantee I've Googled this before and then learned it and

28:15.200 --> 28:17.200
then immediately forgot the information.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.200
So that's not learning, is it?

28:19.200 --> 28:22.200
I'll forget in a week's time, but I was just recording something

28:22.200 --> 28:25.200
else two days back that required that knowledge, so nice.

28:25.200 --> 28:32.200
So let's cut back to the inside of the manor where Mr.

28:32.200 --> 28:37.200
Ring had been given a new mission in life.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.200
It's going to change the world, you know?

28:39.200 --> 28:42.200
While you're wandering around the crowd and I mean,

28:42.200 --> 28:44.200
most of the people that you're telling that to are telling

28:44.200 --> 28:45.200
the same G5 back.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.200
He's stuck in the loop of the three guys.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.200
Yeah, when we cut back, I'm the fourth in the acapella group.

28:53.200 --> 28:57.200
It's going to change the world, you know?

28:57.200 --> 29:02.200
It's going to change the world, you know?

29:02.200 --> 29:08.200
It's going to change the world, you know?

29:08.200 --> 29:09.200
Wait, I'm sorry.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.200
Can we actually try this?

29:10.200 --> 29:11.200
This is bullshit.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.200
When he and my baby see more dense inventions.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.200
This is dumb.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.200
We can do this.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.200
Yeah, we can do it.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.200
No, we can't.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.200
It's going to change the world.

29:19.200 --> 29:22.200
It's going to change the world.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.200
It's going to change the world.

29:24.200 --> 29:34.200
It's going to change the world, you know?

29:34.200 --> 29:37.200
Bubble, bubble down.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.200
Well, you have your new theme song.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.200
OK, that was good.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.200
I just love to think that the swing band up on stage

29:44.200 --> 29:47.200
is so taken with your number that they're actually joining in.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.200
Yes.

29:48.200 --> 29:55.200
They're waving us up.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.200
God.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.200
So are there people that I see who are not

29:58.200 --> 30:00.200
under the same thrall that I'm under?

30:00.200 --> 30:02.200
I mean, it's difficult to tell.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.200
I mean, you're sort of sounding people out.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.200
Totally.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.200
It's through your call and response method.

30:08.200 --> 30:14.200
But while you're doing this, Margaret Payne grabs your arm.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.200
Money.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.200
Oh, hi.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.200
I'm sorry.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.200
I don't know who else to ask,

30:20.200 --> 30:24.200
but I'm getting more and more worried about Cicero.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.200
How's he going to be able to change the world

30:26.200 --> 30:28.200
with his invention?

30:28.200 --> 30:29.200
And it is going to change the world, you know.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.200
Oh, of course.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.200
It's going to change the world, you know.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.200
But how's he going to be able to change the world

30:33.200 --> 30:37.200
with his invention if he isn't actually here?

30:37.200 --> 30:38.200
Where is he?

30:38.200 --> 30:39.200
I'm getting worried.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.200
I mean, what, two hours into the party now?

30:41.200 --> 30:44.200
He puts his hands on either side of her shoulders

30:44.200 --> 30:46.200
and says, we must go find him.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.200
We must.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.200
We must.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
We must.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.200
Let's.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.200
And she grabs you by the hand

30:52.200 --> 30:54.200
and leads you out to the ballroom.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.200
Perfect.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.200
Quick question.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.200
Like the people in the house,

30:57.200 --> 31:00.200
are there like windows that they would be seeing,

31:00.200 --> 31:03.200
like the fire?

31:03.200 --> 31:04.200
Yeah.

31:04.200 --> 31:09.200
And I mean, maybe, maybe if they weren't,

31:09.200 --> 31:11.200
you know, so distracted by the party

31:11.200 --> 31:15.200
and if it weren't so difficult to see it through

31:15.200 --> 31:19.200
the really thick snowstorm that's going on outside,

31:19.200 --> 31:20.200
they might've noticed.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.200
But as it is at the moment, no.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.200
As she's whisking him away, he's like,

31:24.200 --> 31:26.200
I just lost my best friend, you know,

31:26.200 --> 31:29.200
so it's nice to have someone new so quickly.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.200
Oh, you poor thing, she says.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.200
Puts a protective arm around your shoulder.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.200
He nuzzles.

31:36.200 --> 31:39.200
Unbeknownst to Elden Ring,

31:40.200 --> 31:42.200
as Checkers is going down the ladder,

31:42.200 --> 31:45.200
he's thinking, we could pivot, we could pivot.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.200
You're thinking jet packs now.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.200
No, he's thinking, he's like,

31:52.200 --> 31:55.200
the cult can just be whatever his invention is.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.200
Oh, nice.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.200
Like, I don't care.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.200
I don't believe in the bullshit I'm peddling.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.200
Because today's going to change the world, you know.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.200
Yeah, exactly.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.200
Oh shit, he got Scott.

32:05.200 --> 32:10.200
So, she says, I've had a look around downstairs,

32:10.200 --> 32:13.200
and I haven't managed to find him yet.

32:13.200 --> 32:16.200
I was going to check upstairs,

32:16.200 --> 32:23.200
but I just, I wanted some company because, well.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.200
I fear nothing in the physical realm.

32:26.200 --> 32:31.200
Good, because, this is going to sound very strange,

32:31.200 --> 32:35.200
but I saw one of the maids upstairs,

32:35.200 --> 32:38.200
just in the glooms, I was heading upstairs,

32:38.200 --> 32:41.200
and there was something very wrong with her.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.200
Wrong how?

32:43.200 --> 32:46.200
The way she was walking, she was hunched over,

32:46.200 --> 32:50.200
and, oh, this is going to sound mad.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.200
You can tell me, Margaret Payne.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.200
It looked like she had too many legs.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.200
I'm sorry, what did you just say, Margaret Payne?

32:56.200 --> 32:57.200
She had too many legs.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.200
She had two legs?

33:00.200 --> 33:01.200
That's completely normal.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.200
Too many legs.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.200
Oh, too many, that is.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.200
Oh, how, oh.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.200
Yeah, that's a spooky name.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.200
And he starts picturing a maid with multiple legs.

33:12.200 --> 33:16.200
I think you triggered something in me.

33:16.200 --> 33:21.200
Yeah, there's a lot of that online.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.200
I'm thinking like the lusty Argonian maid.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.200
I don't know what that is.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.200
Do you have a book in Skyrim?

33:30.200 --> 33:32.200
Okay, well, that's okay.

33:32.200 --> 33:35.200
Sometimes we see things that don't look right,

33:35.200 --> 33:37.200
and our brain rationalizes them

33:37.200 --> 33:40.200
so that we can understand the physical realm

33:40.200 --> 33:42.200
as it is in the spiritual.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.200
You'll be okay.

33:43.200 --> 33:48.200
Yes, of course, as you say, as you say.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.200
And if this leggy maid gets anywhere near us,

33:51.200 --> 33:56.200
I'll call into her brain to ward her away.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.200
Yes, you do that, she says,

33:58.200 --> 34:03.200
and pats you on the back of the hand.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.200
And he kind of like, he does the thing where his fingers,

34:06.200 --> 34:08.200
where he's got two fingers up on either hand,

34:08.200 --> 34:12.200
and he's like putting them to his temples.

34:12.200 --> 34:17.200
And he's going like, wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo.

34:17.200 --> 34:20.200
Yeah, the two of you head up the stairs,

34:20.200 --> 34:25.200
Margaret taking the lead, and the hallway up above,

34:25.200 --> 34:27.200
I mean, there's a landing, first of all,

34:27.200 --> 34:30.200
but there's a hallway that runs along for the landing

34:30.200 --> 34:32.200
that goes down the main wing of the house.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.200
Be careful, Margaret Payne.

34:33.200 --> 34:36.200
I will go ahead and make sure the coast is clear.

34:36.200 --> 34:39.200
Yes, yes, I'll be right behind you.

34:39.200 --> 34:41.200
You can hold on to my shirt.

34:41.200 --> 34:47.200
That's very generous of you, she says.

34:47.200 --> 34:49.200
And he'll continue down the hall,

34:49.200 --> 34:51.200
slow enough so that she doesn't fall behind,

34:51.200 --> 34:53.200
you know, with the shirt holding.

34:53.200 --> 34:58.200
It's the 30s, so people have fewer but nicer shirts.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.200
So it is.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.200
So you see, down the end of the corridor,

35:04.200 --> 35:07.200
there's a set of double doors that look like they're

35:07.200 --> 35:10.200
probably to the master bedroom,

35:10.200 --> 35:13.200
and one of them is slightly ajar,

35:13.200 --> 35:16.200
and you can see there's some light coming out of that.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.200
You could give me a listen roll as well, if you want.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.200
I'd love that.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.200
I rolled a 73 over 50,

35:23.200 --> 35:27.200
and I would not like to spend the luck,

35:27.200 --> 35:32.200
but I would like to get on my hands and knees

35:32.200 --> 35:36.200
and crawl at a brisk pace to try to get closer,

35:36.200 --> 35:38.200
undetected, to listen better.

35:38.200 --> 35:42.200
Okay, yeah, if you want to push the roll.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.200
I would like to do that.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.200
I think there's a good chance you might get caught

35:46.200 --> 35:49.200
in the act then, because that looks a bit suspicious.

35:50.200 --> 35:53.200
Oh, 25 on a 50. Hard success.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.200
Okay.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.200
Nice.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.200
Then, yeah, you get down on your hands and knees,

35:58.200 --> 36:02.200
and Margaret looks a bit confused by this

36:02.200 --> 36:05.200
and then gets down on her hands and knees as well.

36:05.200 --> 36:09.200
You form your little quadrupedal conga line down the corridor.

36:11.200 --> 36:14.200
As you're passing by one of the doors,

36:14.200 --> 36:17.200
you can hear what sounds like howling wind

36:17.200 --> 36:19.200
from the other side of the door.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.200
I mean, you've obviously heard some of the windows rattling

36:22.200 --> 36:25.200
and there's the sound of wind outside,

36:25.200 --> 36:29.200
but it sounds like maybe there's a window open in this room

36:29.200 --> 36:33.200
and the wind's got in, the door itself is shaking.

36:33.200 --> 36:37.200
Margaret Payne, the window in this room is open.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.200
Well, that's unfortunate.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.200
Shall we peek in together,

36:41.200 --> 36:43.200
or would you like to continue to stay behind me?

36:44.200 --> 36:46.200
I suppose we could.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.200
I mean, that's Cicero's room up ahead, she says.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.200
Do you think it's important that the window's open?

36:53.200 --> 36:55.200
I don't know, Scott, is it?

37:00.200 --> 37:01.200
Fucking DMs, man.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.200
I turn back and I say,

37:06.200 --> 37:08.200
well, he might not be in his room,

37:08.200 --> 37:10.200
and if the window is open here,

37:10.200 --> 37:12.200
it might lead us to learn more,

37:12.200 --> 37:15.200
to be able to help him or find him,

37:15.200 --> 37:17.200
so I think we should open up the door.

37:17.200 --> 37:20.200
I think the brain of the house is behind the double doors.

37:21.200 --> 37:24.200
And it's the bug brain from Starship Troopers,

37:24.200 --> 37:26.200
and Neil Patrick Harris touches it and says,

37:26.200 --> 37:27.200
it's afraid.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.200
I'm doing my part.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.200
That's also from that movie.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.200
I haven't seen it.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.200
So yeah, we're going to creep into the door.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.200
I know, I haven't seen it.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.200
Oh, you're going to love it.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.200
You're going to creep into the room

37:38.200 --> 37:39.200
while you heard the wind.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.200
Yeah, still on hands and knees.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.200
Nice.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.200
Okay, so yeah, you open up the door

37:44.200 --> 37:46.200
and there is a bit of resistance.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.200
And yeah, as you push it open,

37:49.200 --> 37:51.200
you realize, yeah, it is because there's wind

37:51.200 --> 37:52.200
blowing in from outside.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.200
There's also snow on the ground.

37:55.200 --> 37:58.200
With the window open, snow has been coming in,

37:58.200 --> 37:59.200
and there's a fair bit of it.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.200
This looks like it's probably a guest bedroom.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.200
It's made up as such.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.200
I mean, it's certainly a bedroom

38:05.200 --> 38:07.200
and there are sheets on the bed.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.200
Everything's dark, however,

38:09.200 --> 38:12.200
and you can only make out vague shapes of furniture

38:12.200 --> 38:14.200
and the snow on the ground.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.200
Don't worry about me, Margaret Payne.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.200
My warmth is on the inside.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.200
Good, she says.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.200
It doesn't seem like anyone is in here,

38:27.200 --> 38:29.200
so he's just going to kind of get up and pop around.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.200
It's difficult to tell because it is dark.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.200
Gotcha.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.200
So he's going to whisper into the darkness,

38:34.200 --> 38:36.200
is anyone cold?

38:37.200 --> 38:39.200
And Margaret from behind, he says,

38:39.200 --> 38:41.200
I'm a bit chilly.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.200
Okay, forget my ignorance,

38:45.200 --> 38:50.200
but in 1937, would you be able to just turn the lights on?

38:50.200 --> 38:51.200
Yes.

38:51.200 --> 38:55.200
Okay, that helps me going into more of this.

38:57.200 --> 39:01.200
If no one responds to my query other than Margaret Payne,

39:01.200 --> 39:03.200
Elden Ring stands up.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.200
All right, well, if anyone is cold in here

39:06.200 --> 39:08.200
and needs help, maybe closing the windows,

39:08.200 --> 39:11.200
that would be good, but if not, I mean, Cicero,

39:11.200 --> 39:14.200
if you're, okay, we're just going to,

39:14.200 --> 39:16.200
bye, bye, I'm talking to no one.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.200
He's, Margaret Payne, I'm speaking to no one,

39:18.200 --> 39:21.200
and he heads back out into the hallway.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.200
I mean, the only thing is,

39:22.200 --> 39:23.200
you could give me a spot hidden role

39:23.200 --> 39:25.200
to see whether you notice anything in the gloom.

39:25.200 --> 39:28.200
Fail, 37 on a 25.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.200
Cicero successfully hides in the corner.

39:32.200 --> 39:36.200
I will use my 12 luck to make that a success.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.200
As your eyes adjust to the gloom,

39:41.200 --> 39:44.200
you can see that over by the window,

39:44.200 --> 39:48.200
one of the things that you thought was snow

39:48.200 --> 39:52.200
that had blown in, a mound of snow on the ground.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.200
It's the cocaine that I've been looking for.

39:54.200 --> 39:59.200
That's, yeah, that's not snow.

39:59.200 --> 40:03.200
That is someone lying there very still.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.200
Oh, whoops, I did not see you.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.200
Are you cold?

40:08.200 --> 40:10.200
You've got like a Mitch Hedberg.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.200
I did not see you.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.200
I am so sorry, I did not see you.

40:17.200 --> 40:20.200
They don't move or they don't react.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.200
Huh, all right.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.200
Escalators cannot be broken.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.200
And he's gonna, he's just gonna stare.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.200
Temporarily?

40:31.200 --> 40:34.200
At the body for a little bit.

40:34.200 --> 40:36.200
Temporarily.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.200
Sorry for the convenience, podcast listeners.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.200
Margaret Payne, I'm going to approach this body.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.200
Do you know anything about the first aid skills?

40:47.200 --> 40:49.200
Not really.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.200
Well, maybe if you didn't spend all of your money

40:51.200 --> 40:54.200
paying other people to be good at helping others,

40:54.200 --> 40:57.200
then you would know how to help someone yourself.

40:57.200 --> 41:01.200
And he moves on to the body.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.200
Very judgmental, she says.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.200
You cut her pretty deep on that one.

41:07.200 --> 41:10.200
Scott, weren't you the one talking about her lazy eye?

41:12.200 --> 41:15.200
He's judgmental now.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.200
That's a physical description.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.200
He didn't apply any emotions to the eye.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.200
Yeah, but he dragged her ass.

41:25.200 --> 41:28.200
Thanks for coming back on the podcast, Scott.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.200
Yeah, any time, I guess.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.200
Any time, I guess.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.200
So what's up with this body? I'm gonna poke it.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.200
Okay, yeah, you creep forward.

41:42.200 --> 41:46.200
In the gloom, you can make out that it does seem to be

41:46.200 --> 41:48.200
the body of a young woman.

41:48.200 --> 41:51.200
She just seems to be in her undergarments

41:51.200 --> 41:54.200
lying there in the snow,

41:54.200 --> 41:57.200
and you can see that there's blood

41:57.200 --> 41:59.200
soaked into the snow around her head.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.200
You should look her to see if she's cold.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.200
I think that she's just crying.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.200
Oh, my God.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.200
This dead girl tastes cold.

42:10.200 --> 42:13.200
To solve this mystery, I'm gonna need two things.

42:13.200 --> 42:16.200
A hammer and a whole army.

42:17.200 --> 42:21.200
So I'm not gonna lick the body.

42:21.200 --> 42:26.200
I'm going to grab some cloth drapes

42:26.200 --> 42:30.200
if I see anything around to just throw over the body immediately.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.200
Yeah, I mean, there's bed linens

42:33.200 --> 42:36.200
that you can easily grab and throw on her.

42:36.200 --> 42:38.200
Margaret Payne, could you please close the window

42:38.200 --> 42:41.200
while I connect with this lady intellectually?

42:41.200 --> 42:43.200
Is that young woman dead?

42:43.200 --> 42:45.200
Yeah, I think so. There's only one way to find out.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.200
So I'm gonna...

42:46.200 --> 42:49.200
Psychic attack! Psychic attack!

42:52.200 --> 42:55.200
You took the words right out of my mouth.

42:55.200 --> 42:58.200
Dude, if she's dead, you're gonna kick her ass.

42:58.200 --> 43:01.200
I don't know how the psychic attack works,

43:01.200 --> 43:03.200
but maybe you'll die.

43:03.200 --> 43:06.200
You finally met someone you can beat.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.200
God damn it, I thought you were supposed to feel cool

43:09.200 --> 43:12.200
in Pulp Cathedral.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.200
You're a loser.

43:15.200 --> 43:18.200
Your character is the vessel through which this story

43:18.200 --> 43:21.200
gets to feel very cool, but yeah,

43:21.200 --> 43:25.200
you are whatever dark force is working through this home,

43:25.200 --> 43:27.200
absolute bitch.

43:27.200 --> 43:32.200
Yep, just gonna psychic attack this probably dead body

43:32.200 --> 43:34.200
to see if she's still alive,

43:34.200 --> 43:36.200
because I don't know anything about first aid.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.200
Yeah, well, actually roll,

43:39.200 --> 43:41.200
just in case you rolled a double zero.

43:41.200 --> 43:44.200
I did not, I rolled a 42, thankfully.

43:44.200 --> 43:47.200
Okay, yeah, she's dead.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.200
There's nothing there to probe.

43:49.200 --> 43:51.200
You just see a blue error screen.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.200
Yeah, 404.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.200
Margaret Payne.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.200
Margaret Payne, there's nothing for us in this room.

43:58.200 --> 44:00.200
But that young woman's dead.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.200
Oh my god.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.200
Now we really need to find Mordaunt.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.200
Yeah, there's a murderer.

44:05.200 --> 44:07.200
Maybe Cicero's in danger as well.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.200
Oh my goodness.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.200
We need to find Mordaunt now more than ever.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.200
Let's go.

44:11.200 --> 44:15.200
Yes, yes, and she scurries out of the room.

44:15.200 --> 44:19.200
Do you think we should alert someone about the dead girl?

44:19.200 --> 44:23.200
Only when we found Cicero Mordaunt.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.200
That is our first priority.

44:25.200 --> 44:28.200
Why was she in her undergarments?

44:28.200 --> 44:32.200
Hopefully because she was warm.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.200
Well, when you get hypothermia,

44:34.200 --> 44:37.200
sometimes they find people have taken their clothes off.

44:37.200 --> 44:39.200
Well, Margaret Payne,

44:39.200 --> 44:42.200
sometimes when people are dying of hypothermia,

44:42.200 --> 44:44.200
like she did in the cold,

44:44.200 --> 44:47.200
they have a strange reaction that makes them take off their clothes.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.200
It's science.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.200
I'm not sure it's real.

44:50.200 --> 44:54.200
Does hypothermia make you bleed from head wounds?

44:54.200 --> 44:56.200
In rare occasions.

44:56.200 --> 44:59.200
Such as this one.

44:59.200 --> 45:05.200
If you die of hypothermia and fall and hit your head.

45:05.200 --> 45:08.200
Oh, that's clearly what happened.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.200
You should just go back to the party.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.200
Sherlock Holmes says,

45:12.200 --> 45:16.200
whatever isn't true is.

45:22.200 --> 45:26.200
So, I think we're on the right path here.

45:26.200 --> 45:29.200
Yes, I hope Cicero is alright.

45:29.200 --> 45:33.200
His invention is going to change the world, you know.

45:33.200 --> 45:37.200
I know, it's going to change the world, you know.

45:38.200 --> 45:42.200
And they're just crying as they walk down the hall toward Mordhaupt's bedroom.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.200
Holding each other.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.200
You want to get on all fours again?

45:50.200 --> 45:52.200
We can crawl if you want to.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.200
We can leave that old corpse behind.

45:54.200 --> 45:57.200
Because if the old corpse isn't necessary to the mission,

45:57.200 --> 45:59.200
then it's no friend of mine.

45:59.200 --> 46:07.200
Okay, so you crawl your way down the corridor towards Mordhaupt's room.

46:07.200 --> 46:11.200
And, yeah, as I said, the door is slightly ajar.

46:11.200 --> 46:13.200
You can see inside, obviously, the lights are on,

46:13.200 --> 46:15.200
because that's where the lights are coming from.

46:15.200 --> 46:19.200
Yeah, I doubt you've seen Mordhaupt's bedroom before,

46:19.200 --> 46:23.200
but it's as tastelessly furnished as everything else.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.200
It's got garish wallpaper,

46:26.200 --> 46:31.200
a big four-poster bed with colorful drapes hanging from it.

46:31.200 --> 46:35.200
And one of his inventions was to make the bed, like, rotate.

46:37.200 --> 46:40.200
No, he's the first person to hang a mirror above the bed.

46:40.200 --> 46:42.200
To do coke off of.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.200
The rotisserie bed.

46:46.200 --> 46:49.200
But it just fell off because of these shitty dimensions.

46:49.200 --> 46:53.200
Well, he hasn't invented the anti-gravity coke mirror machine.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.200
No one has.

46:56.200 --> 46:59.200
It's a shame. It's our last great frontier.

47:00.200 --> 47:06.200
But one thing you can see is over behind the bed, just poking out from it,

47:06.200 --> 47:12.200
you can see a pair of men's feet wearing socks,

47:12.200 --> 47:19.200
just sticking out as if someone's lying on the ground just behind the bed.

47:19.200 --> 47:22.200
Hey, Mr. Mordaunt. Mr. Cicero Mordaunt.

47:22.200 --> 47:24.200
Party time's gotta go smooth, right?

47:24.200 --> 47:26.200
That's what's most important to religion, man.

47:26.200 --> 47:29.200
So let's carry on and talk to you now.

47:29.200 --> 47:33.200
You just hear a weak groan from the other side of the bed.

47:33.200 --> 47:35.200
Help me.

47:35.200 --> 47:38.200
Oh, time for those first aid skills, Margaret.

47:40.200 --> 47:45.200
Margaret's on her feet and she scurries around the bed.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.200
Are you following her?

47:46.200 --> 47:47.200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:47.200 --> 47:52.200
As you go around, you can see that there is something else unusual in the room as well,

47:52.200 --> 47:58.200
in that there's a big sort of freestanding wardrobe up against one wall.

47:58.200 --> 48:02.200
And the doors are open, but you can see that there's light coming out of it.

48:02.200 --> 48:09.200
And from somewhere apparently deep within it, you can hear what sounds like an electrical buzzing.

48:09.200 --> 48:11.200
Wow, what a fascinating wardrobe.

48:11.200 --> 48:14.200
Is Mordaunt okay, he says, as he's just staring into the light?

48:14.200 --> 48:22.200
As you go around, you can see that Cicero is lying there in this long shag pile carpet.

48:22.200 --> 48:28.200
He's wearing a silk dressing gown, garishly patterned.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.200
He looks pale.

48:29.200 --> 48:38.200
He's sweating profusely and his eyes, they've got deep rings under them and they seem quite sunken.

48:38.200 --> 48:46.200
His hair is matted with sweat and they're lying just a couple of feet away from him.

48:46.200 --> 48:54.200
You can see that there's a bottle that has got some kind of yellowish liquid in it.

48:54.200 --> 48:59.200
And next to it, there's a fairly large hypodermic needle,

48:59.200 --> 49:05.200
a glass hypodermic needle that's half full of the same liquid that's just lying on the ground.

49:05.200 --> 49:10.200
And you can see his trembling fingers, they're reaching out towards the syringe.

49:10.200 --> 49:12.200
Oh, wow. Hi.

49:12.200 --> 49:15.200
Help me. Help me.

49:15.200 --> 49:20.200
Mr. Cicero Mordaunt, it looks like you pre-gamed a little bit too hard for your party.

49:20.200 --> 49:22.200
Need medicine.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.200
Oh, yes, of course.

49:24.200 --> 49:27.200
And I'll jam that fucker full of whatever's in this syringe.

49:28.200 --> 49:32.200
Okay. Yeah. I mean, as you grab it and look for somewhere to inject him,

49:32.200 --> 49:36.200
you can see that there are track marks and weeping wounds,

49:36.200 --> 49:40.200
infected pus-filled wounds all down both of his arms.

49:40.200 --> 49:42.200
Gross. Cauterize it.

49:44.200 --> 49:49.200
But, I mean, it probably doesn't take you long to find a vein to stick this in.

49:49.200 --> 49:53.200
All right. On the count of three, think about your favorite Bible verse, Mr. Mordaunt.

49:53.200 --> 49:57.200
To overcome the spider's curse, simply quote a Bible verse.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.200
What's your middle name? What's your favorite color?

50:03.200 --> 50:05.200
And then he sticks them.

50:05.200 --> 50:09.200
Almost immediately you can see he shudders and convulses a bit.

50:09.200 --> 50:15.200
And then there's a deep sigh. Oh, that's much better.

50:15.200 --> 50:18.200
Mr. Cicero Mordaunt, you have a lovely home here.

50:18.200 --> 50:20.200
Thank you so much for inviting me to your party.

50:20.200 --> 50:23.200
Yes, yes, of course, of course.

50:23.200 --> 50:28.200
I have no idea who you are, but I can't have you thrown out yet.

50:28.200 --> 50:32.200
Well, of course, because I'm here because your invention is going to change the world, you know.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.200
It's what?

50:33.200 --> 50:37.200
Your invention. It's going to change the world, you know.

50:37.200 --> 50:43.200
I suppose it is, yes. I wouldn't have put it quite like that, but yes.

50:43.200 --> 50:44.200
What is it, by the way?

50:44.200 --> 50:48.200
Well, I'll show you when I unveil it all downstairs.

50:48.200 --> 50:51.200
I should have been downstairs a long time ago.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.200
Oh, Margaret, Margaret!

50:53.200 --> 50:59.200
He pushes himself up, grabbing hold of the side of the bed, and says,

50:59.200 --> 51:05.200
Oh, Margaret, it's good to see you. I wish it were under better circumstances.

51:05.200 --> 51:10.200
From the open wardrobe, you can hear that buzzing sound again.

51:10.200 --> 51:14.200
It sounds like it might be electrical sparking. It might not be.

51:14.200 --> 51:20.200
There's something about that sound that you can hear that, yeah, that's not electrical.

51:20.200 --> 51:25.200
It sounds maybe like a beehive.

51:25.200 --> 51:36.200
Cicero's just shaking. You can see his eyes are looking a bit clearer, though, and he's standing up unsteadily.

51:36.200 --> 51:41.200
There's a big vein down his forehead that is just pulsing violently.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.200
Should have stuck him there.

51:42.200 --> 51:44.200
Yeah, I think I found a better vein.

51:46.200 --> 51:49.200
Well, no, I'll let you two talk. You can catch up.

51:49.200 --> 51:56.200
Yes, yes. Well, I need to get ready. I need to get my invention ready.

51:56.200 --> 52:01.200
But he looks over at Mr. Ring.

52:01.200 --> 52:09.200
Friend, you cannot tell anyone of what you've seen here. You do understand that...

52:09.200 --> 52:14.200
I promise not to tell anyone if you tell me what was in that syringe that I plunged you full of.

52:14.200 --> 52:22.200
It is a special serum I use to enhance my mental faculties. It gives me...

52:22.200 --> 52:24.200
Mordaunt's special sauce.

52:26.200 --> 52:30.200
Yes, I suppose he could call it that, if you were an idiot.

52:34.200 --> 52:37.200
Psychic attack! Psychic attack! Psychic attack!

52:40.200 --> 52:41.200
Are you psychic attacking me?

52:41.200 --> 52:43.200
Fuck yeah! Fuck this dude!

52:45.200 --> 52:47.200
Everything's gotta go off without a hitch.

52:47.200 --> 52:49.200
Including Mordaunt himself!

52:51.200 --> 52:54.200
In which case, yeah, give me a roll.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.200
41 on a 90, hard.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.200
Oh yeah, he actually failed.

52:59.200 --> 53:00.200
Fuck you!

53:01.200 --> 53:10.200
So, I mean, you get that sort of simultaneous feeling of looking at him, but also looking inside him, and you're reaching deep inside him.

53:10.200 --> 53:18.200
And yeah, there's none of this kind of protection or darkness or anything that you've seen in other people there.

53:18.200 --> 53:24.200
I mean, this is just an unprotected human psyche for you to do with as you will.

53:24.200 --> 53:35.200
He really digs his claws into this mind space and just tries to plant exactly what the religion man planted in his mind.

53:35.200 --> 53:38.200
He's just trying to be a vessel to pass on.

53:38.200 --> 53:43.200
He's not even trying to do it himself, he's trying to open up himself to Margaret.

53:43.200 --> 53:52.200
He's gonna use Margaret as a conduit to get to the thing on the other side so that it can push through him into Mordaunt.

53:52.200 --> 53:58.200
Oh, okay. Well, I mean, you're trying to do this, you're trying to make the connection to Margaret.

53:58.200 --> 54:05.200
But Margaret, the conscious part of your mind, you can hear that she actually sounds quite alarmed and frightened.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.200
I mean, you can hear her going,

54:07.200 --> 54:12.200
Cicero, are you alright? You're frightening me, Cicero, you're frightening me.

54:12.200 --> 54:14.200
At the same time, you can hear Cicero's voice saying,

54:14.200 --> 54:19.200
Yes, yes, I understand. Yes, it is going to change the world.

54:19.200 --> 54:23.200
It's going to change. Yes, yes, it's going to change the world.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.200
I must do as you will. I must do.

54:25.200 --> 54:36.200
And then there is this noise, a loud banging sound, a loud wet sound.

54:36.200 --> 54:43.200
And from the distant place you are within your own psyche, you can suddenly feel something warm and wet.

54:43.200 --> 54:46.200
Splashing all over you.

54:46.200 --> 54:49.200
Did I just pee?

54:49.200 --> 54:57.200
Almost immediately, you're broken out of the connection you had, and you can see Cicero standing there,

54:57.200 --> 55:02.200
just wavering backwards and forwards. The top of his head is largely missing.

55:02.200 --> 55:07.200
There's fragments of blood splattered all over the place.

55:07.200 --> 55:10.200
His mouth is just gawping open.

55:10.200 --> 55:14.200
And then he falls heavily down on the ground.

55:14.200 --> 55:18.200
Margaret Payne turns running, crying out.

55:18.200 --> 55:23.200
And from the open wardrobe, you can just hear this buzzing voice, screaming angrily,

55:23.200 --> 55:26.200
Release me!

55:27.200 --> 55:29.200
Let's cut over to...

55:33.200 --> 55:34.200
Oh my gosh.

55:34.200 --> 55:36.200
Holy shit.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.200
Wow.

55:38.200 --> 55:52.200
I didn't know a body could be hollow before its blood ran cold.

55:52.200 --> 56:06.200
I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and faggot bone.

56:06.200 --> 56:12.200
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

56:14.200 --> 56:19.200
Hollow when you sang.

56:21.200 --> 56:34.200
I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.

56:36.200 --> 56:47.200
Thorns and rocks and devils glow, brides and dried red clay.

56:47.200 --> 56:57.200
Crocus blossoms in February and I live in May.

56:58.200 --> 57:07.200
Time between a mother's fingers and spit off of a bridge.

57:07.200 --> 57:16.200
Restless legs at 3pm while waiting for a fix.

57:27.200 --> 57:39.200
I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.

57:39.200 --> 57:49.200
I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.

57:49.200 --> 58:03.200
So come back here and see what's left of me.

58:03.200 --> 58:13.200
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

58:14.200 --> 58:24.200
My voice is nothing now but the howl of the wind.

58:24.200 --> 58:32.200
Come closer dear in my teeth, thread her in my jaw.

58:32.200 --> 58:48.200
Come closer dear in my teeth, thread her in my jaw.
