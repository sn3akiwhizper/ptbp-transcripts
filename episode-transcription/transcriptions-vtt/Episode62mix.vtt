00:00.000 --> 00:14.160
Oh, I didn't see you there my babies, come on in.

00:14.160 --> 00:21.080
I was just reading this amazing book by a bright new genius author called Finding Your

00:21.080 --> 00:29.760
Inner Clam Gravy, Diving Through This Dumpster We Call Life, written by me, Wolf the Dog.

00:29.760 --> 00:37.920
It's an autobiography by me, Wolf the Dog, about me, Wolf the Dog, I'll probably never

00:37.920 --> 00:39.460
release it though.

00:39.460 --> 00:45.800
This book holds far too much knowledge and power, but then again, money does let a dog

00:45.800 --> 00:51.120
get closer to his dream of opening a trash can centric theme park.

00:51.120 --> 00:58.240
Speaking of trash, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from jdg222 on Instagram, who wrote

00:58.240 --> 01:05.560
a 5-star review on iTunes, which is apparently a great way to help guide my dulcet tones

01:05.560 --> 01:11.500
into ears that have not yet had my pleasure, mmm delicious.

01:11.500 --> 01:18.200
Jeff writes, If Wolf could give a shout out to my companions at The Traveler's Path, that

01:18.200 --> 01:19.760
would be amazing.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.400
They've been with me through thick and thin.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.080
Our handler Alan has given us weeks of adventure.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.560
My friends have become brothers and sisters in arms.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.840
I can't wait to share more adventures with them.

01:32.840 --> 01:42.000
Aaron, Bob, Justin, Willis, Nick, Connor, Victoria, Emma, and Tony, I love you guys

01:42.000 --> 01:44.440
and will see you next session.

01:44.440 --> 01:53.520
Now I most certainly will not give a shout out to Aaron, Bob, Justin, Willis, Nick,

01:53.520 --> 02:00.920
Connor, Victoria, Emma, and Tony, there's just no way you can make me do it.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.040
Never in a million years, Jeff from Instagram.

02:05.040 --> 02:11.080
I appreciate you writing though, even if I definitely did not honor your request.

02:11.080 --> 02:15.680
Remember, if you want to write up something for your Walter Hal, tag at PretendingPod

02:15.680 --> 02:21.880
on Instagram or Twitter, tag Pretending to be People on Facebook, or write a five-star

02:21.880 --> 02:28.200
review on iTunes, baby, and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.960
I agree with you that Mark Zucker Buttface should be reprimanded for falsifying numbers

02:33.960 --> 02:36.360
to pull in more native content.

02:36.360 --> 02:40.760
If you would like to spit in his face, you can support this show financially over on

02:40.760 --> 02:44.720
patreon dot com slash pretending pod.

02:44.720 --> 02:50.600
Five dollars a month instantly unlocks access to exclusive bonus episodes.

02:50.600 --> 02:56.400
The most recent one is a delta green one shot based on a Wikipedia article sent in by one

02:56.400 --> 02:59.120
of our dear honorary police officers.

02:59.120 --> 03:04.980
A big difference between contention police officers and our honorary police officers

03:04.980 --> 03:12.100
over on patreon is Wolf the dog loves his honorary police officers.

03:12.100 --> 03:17.160
Wolf the dog ain't never been hassled while diving snout first into a dumpster filled

03:17.160 --> 03:23.460
with wet sloppy Mississippi roast by one of his honorary police officers.

03:23.460 --> 03:27.920
Jesus, last time was grievous.

03:27.920 --> 03:34.880
The reason for the season is seemingly malfeasance for the sake of convenience.

03:34.880 --> 03:39.360
Given credence to the frequently indecent, it's time for the news.

03:39.360 --> 03:44.640
This segment of the news comes in the form of a multiple choice question.

03:44.640 --> 03:51.320
The question is this, if someone begins chanting and you would like them to stop, you should

03:51.320 --> 03:52.320
a.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.640
Ask them to stop b.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.300
Cover the mouth c.

03:57.300 --> 04:04.240
Use that cool gun Leon had that Clark is holding which knocks people unconscious or d.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.680
Immediately shoot them.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.920
If you answer d.

04:07.920 --> 04:12.120
You might be a contention police officer.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.260
Everyone is dead.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.160
So let's spread some dread.

04:15.160 --> 04:21.200
I got something around here that will fit this somber mood orgastically.

04:21.200 --> 04:26.400
It's kudzu with no backbone.

04:51.200 --> 05:01.160
Do you have your car back yet?

05:01.160 --> 05:02.160
Are we recording?

05:02.160 --> 05:05.160
We're always recording.

05:05.160 --> 05:12.500
I woke myself and my girlfriend up in the middle of the night screaming Luke no because

05:12.500 --> 05:18.560
I was having a dream where I was riding shotgun with you and we were having this discussion

05:18.560 --> 05:22.960
and we were trying to prove points on our phones or whatever basically and you got super

05:22.960 --> 05:30.200
distracted from driving and I noticed I look up and I see this young woman in the middle

05:30.200 --> 05:34.640
of the road right in front of us that you're about to just plow over and I screamed Luke

05:34.640 --> 05:41.040
no in real life and woke myself and my girlfriend and the cats up.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.040
What did she look like?

05:42.040 --> 05:44.080
She was wearing a white dress.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.880
I bet that symbolizes something.

05:45.880 --> 05:50.400
Well I did recently murder somebody but just not with my car.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.760
It's weird that there was a car in the dream.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.240
I was driving a van so it's totally different.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.360
Luke what was she wearing?

05:56.360 --> 06:03.240
Oh I don't know I was in a blind fury so I don't remember.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.560
I only see her face when I close my eyes.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.840
She just looked like my dad.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.760
Luke I thought your new year's resolution was to not murder anyone this year.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.760
Well you know how new year's resolutions go.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.660
By the wayside quickly.

06:19.660 --> 06:22.160
Did anyone else make any new year's resolutions?

06:22.160 --> 06:23.840
I never do and I didn't.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.640
Hey Kameel good job.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.000
Perfect as it is.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Justin?

06:31.000 --> 06:35.240
Oh I got way too many rezzies when I get fit-ish not like jacked.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.240
Go Kameel.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.240
Not like Zach.

06:37.240 --> 06:43.080
I don't want to be as fit as Zach.

06:43.080 --> 06:47.200
For the listeners who don't know Zach is just fucking ripped.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.200
Just pumping iron.

06:49.200 --> 06:55.480
Honestly when I stand next to Zach it's like Kevin Hart standing next to The Rock.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
That is true.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.480
A lot like that.

06:57.480 --> 07:04.360
The other day I went into work and one of my fellow co-workers who does go to the gym

07:04.360 --> 07:10.160
greeted me by grabbing my bicep and then immediately looked me in the eyes and said did I just

07:10.160 --> 07:13.720
touch bone on both sides?

07:13.720 --> 07:14.720
Did he?

07:14.720 --> 07:15.720
Oh yeah he got bone baby.

07:15.720 --> 07:16.720
What do you mean?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.040
Of course you can do that.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.040
Who was it?

07:19.040 --> 07:20.040
It was Phil.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.040
Doxum.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.040
There's no way I could feel bone in his arm.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.520
Well it's a good thing because I didn't feel emasculated at all.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.520
So it makes sense.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.040
I felt really normal about it.

07:29.040 --> 07:37.680
Oh no you can't feel bone you're... it's too much fat.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.480
Thomas was just groping me that whole time.

07:39.480 --> 07:43.840
A few weeks ago I was talking to Phil I forget where we were but I was talking to him.

07:43.840 --> 07:47.720
I was just saying like yeah the first time I met you I knew you were going to be a douchebag

07:47.720 --> 07:50.680
and then like you weren't and it's crazy to me still.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.120
You said that to him or he said that to you?

07:52.120 --> 07:53.120
I said that to him.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.080
That could go either way in my opinion.

07:55.080 --> 07:59.600
But he was like oh yeah like I get that a lot it kind of sucks but I and then he like

07:59.600 --> 08:04.640
looks down at himself it's like it's because I look like this I'm like well kind of kind

08:04.640 --> 08:05.640
of proved my point.

08:05.640 --> 08:06.640
Confirmed.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.640
Confirmed.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.360
That's two douchebags talking to each other right after that day.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.080
I'm just a small douchebag.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.440
Kevin Hart size douchebag.

08:15.440 --> 08:20.480
That's my New Year's resolution is go get as jacked as Ferri and also probably grow

08:20.480 --> 08:23.200
six inches would be nice too.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.720
My New Year's resolution is to stop taking Zach's shit in this fucking game.

08:27.720 --> 08:32.440
Well the intro we have today is gonna maybe go opposite to that.

08:32.440 --> 08:38.040
Let's go ahead and recap what happened last time so that Thomas cannot take my shit.

08:38.040 --> 08:41.120
The five of you approached the jingle ball.

08:41.120 --> 08:46.120
You find students there and faculty there acting strangely and a man began begins screaming

08:46.120 --> 08:49.120
of the familiar phrase towel a la coal.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.360
What was going through your guys's mind at that moment?

08:52.360 --> 08:54.020
Like what what uh?

08:54.020 --> 08:57.100
Same shit different day.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.160
Mine was stop them immediately.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.000
Yeah that dude sounds like he's casting a spell.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.560
And I don't like spells.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.520
I've heard enough spells to know they ain't usually good.

09:06.520 --> 09:13.480
So Keith shot him and these students and faculty, Thomas's great school shooting joke from last

09:13.480 --> 09:19.200
week aside, they all see this chanting man get shot probably for the first time.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.200
Not a joke.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.480
I just listened to this episode.

09:21.480 --> 09:25.400
I legitimately suggested hey maybe we don't shoot up this fucking school.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.880
I thought it was hilarious.

09:27.880 --> 09:31.600
We found very funny and then immediately discarded that thought.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.720
So everyone in this room starts acting even stranger.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.720
Thoughts?

09:36.720 --> 09:43.640
Hey, that's a I just find that kind of language like pretty derogatory thoughts anymore.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.240
I kind of felt gross coming out of my mouth.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.240
Yeah.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.240
Them hoes.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.240
We're just kidding.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.240
I forgot.

09:50.240 --> 10:03.980
I'm uh taking the word back so I'm empowering it.

10:03.980 --> 10:04.980
You are a thought.

10:04.980 --> 10:05.980
Wow.

10:05.980 --> 10:06.980
Never mind.

10:06.980 --> 10:07.980
I don't like it.

10:07.980 --> 10:16.200
That did not last long.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.480
Justin took it and then gave it right back.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.440
Released it back to the universe.

10:21.440 --> 10:26.800
So then John shot and killed a girl and he also shot two reindeer.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.800
His idea.

10:27.800 --> 10:33.400
It was totally on purpose.

10:33.400 --> 10:38.360
Keith shot a young muscular man dressed as Santa Claus right between the eyes and these

10:38.360 --> 10:44.500
students and faculty all see this and begin acting violently towards themselves and they

10:44.500 --> 10:48.580
begin chanting and then the original chanting guy killed himself.

10:48.580 --> 10:49.580
After I shot him though.

10:49.580 --> 10:50.660
I want to make that clear.

10:50.660 --> 10:51.660
Yes.

10:51.660 --> 10:52.660
Yes, of course.

10:52.660 --> 10:54.700
He was dying and then he killed himself.

10:54.700 --> 10:59.700
That's college, baby.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.920
So where do we stand?

11:01.920 --> 11:03.900
Any final thoughts there?

11:03.900 --> 11:06.700
Anything you want to talk about?

11:06.700 --> 11:11.500
I don't know that we did the right thing, but guess what?

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
Can't change the past.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.540
And the best we can.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.540
I mean, yeah.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.740
Not for lack of trying.

11:16.740 --> 11:19.220
That's all anyone can expect of us, right?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.860
With the information we've been presented.

11:21.860 --> 11:22.860
We did our best.

11:22.860 --> 11:23.860
We did.

11:23.860 --> 11:24.860
So I was thinking a lot about that.

11:24.860 --> 11:25.860
Okay, wait.

11:25.860 --> 11:26.860
Hold on.

11:26.860 --> 11:30.020
This lady was shaving reindeer, sharpening their horns.

11:30.020 --> 11:34.120
Animal abuse was happening and everybody seemed to be on her side.

11:34.120 --> 11:37.660
And those elves looked at me wrong.

11:37.660 --> 11:41.260
And I think hot Santa made us all feel kind of bad about our bodies.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.260
Yeah.

11:43.020 --> 11:46.020
He had to die.

11:46.020 --> 11:52.660
Well, I was kind of getting worried that maybe I hadn't given you guys enough information.

11:52.660 --> 11:57.680
So I reached out to a few listeners and just kind of asked them a couple of questions about

11:57.680 --> 12:03.140
what they thought was going on and they all get it.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.700
At least most of the ones that I talked to understand where we're at.

12:06.700 --> 12:10.520
So now I don't feel bad about what I've done to you and the choices that you've made and

12:10.520 --> 12:11.520
I'm very happy.

12:11.720 --> 12:17.680
You know what, hypothetical listeners out there that Zach may or may not have conjured

12:17.680 --> 12:18.680
up out of his own.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.680
Listeners like Deborah.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.680
Deborah, stand up.

12:20.680 --> 12:21.680
Oh shit.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.680
He brought him.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
Hey.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.680
Hey Deborah.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
Well, that's one.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.680
Sup.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.680
And Jamie.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.680
Hey.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.680
Fuck.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.680
I love the podcast.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.680
Okay.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.920
Two doesn't prove anything.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.120
Listeners like these can prove many things.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.120
No, no, no.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.520
I'm not impressed unless you bring in at least one more listener.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.920
Well, Jared's here.

12:43.920 --> 12:44.920
Here's the deal.

12:44.920 --> 12:45.920
Some listeners have listened to...

12:45.920 --> 12:46.920
Jared.

12:46.920 --> 12:47.920
Hold on.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.920
Jared's trying to talk.

12:48.920 --> 12:49.920
Hey.

12:49.920 --> 12:50.920
It's Jared here.

12:50.920 --> 12:51.920
I totally have this whole podcast figured out.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.640
I don't know why you guys don't know what's going on.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.640
It's obvious.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.640
What can you tell us, Jared?

12:55.640 --> 12:57.640
I'm not going to fall for that one.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.640
See?

12:58.640 --> 12:59.640
See?

12:59.640 --> 13:00.640
Yeah.

13:00.640 --> 13:04.840
He's not going to fall for it because it'll be more fun when you guys figure it out eventually.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.840
Okay.

13:05.840 --> 13:10.360
I just want to tell the three of you who just stepped into this room that when you're playing

13:10.360 --> 13:19.760
in the moment and drunk and kind of high and also doing these mysteries two, three weeks

13:19.760 --> 13:22.200
apart sometimes, it's hard.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.200
It's hard to keep track of those things.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.200
Excuse me.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.200
Excuse me.

13:25.200 --> 13:29.200
I was going to say there are some people that have listened to 60-ish hours of this podcast

13:29.200 --> 13:30.200
in a row.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.200
In a row.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
We like you.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.080
In one day.

13:34.520 --> 13:38.440
I have listened to this podcast only twice.

13:38.440 --> 13:45.120
Every episode I've heard of twice, well, the first time is playing it and making it and

13:45.120 --> 13:48.320
the second time is week by week for what are we at?

13:48.320 --> 13:56.080
Like a thousand weeks now, you know, a thousand weeks since we started pushing this boulder

13:56.080 --> 13:57.080
up the hill.

13:57.080 --> 14:10.260
A thousand weeks if I could just ... Was that Bernie doing it?

14:10.260 --> 14:14.160
If you did a thousand miles but you had two people, you could break it up and you could

14:14.160 --> 14:16.640
each do 500 miles each.

14:16.640 --> 14:20.760
Remember five minutes ago when we almost started the episode for the listeners and then we

14:20.760 --> 14:21.760
just went back to that bullshit?

14:21.760 --> 14:23.760
Zach, can you draw up your room?

14:23.760 --> 14:24.760
Yeah, Zach.

14:24.760 --> 14:30.120
It pains me to only now realize that there was a jingle ball playlist thumping for the

14:30.120 --> 14:32.920
entire duration of the last episode.

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
Not canon.

14:33.920 --> 14:34.920
Not canon.

14:34.920 --> 14:39.180
Retroactively, I would like to say that blaring the entire time during all that super fucked

14:39.180 --> 14:44.680
up shit was the classical Paul McCartney Christmas hit, Wonderful Christmas Time, but someone

14:44.680 --> 14:49.360
had mashed it up so Danny Brown was rapping Grown Up over the top of it.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.360
That sounds amazing.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.880
Can I just say that song gets so much fucking shit and I love it.

14:53.880 --> 14:54.880
I know.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.880
I'm with you too.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.320
Wait, the Paul McCartney song or the Danny Brown song?

14:58.320 --> 14:59.400
The Paul McCartney song.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.280
It's one of the most hated Christmas songs.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.280
It's a great song.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.280
Really?

15:03.280 --> 15:04.280
Yeah.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.280
People fucking hate that song.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.280
People really fucking hate it.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.080
It's just because they go to the mall and then they hear it 17 times and it's not all

15:09.080 --> 15:11.440
I want for Christmas is you.

15:11.440 --> 15:15.560
I'm not trying to say that, but it's cool.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.560
It's weird.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.560
It's like Paul.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.560
Yeah.

15:18.560 --> 15:19.560
I like it.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.220
Did you see the tweet that talked about how it was a guy who thought for sure that that's

15:22.220 --> 15:26.500
a song about a guy who is doing a ritual and gets walked in on.

15:26.500 --> 15:31.780
The first lyric is like, the moon is up, the something something and then he have been

15:31.780 --> 15:32.780
a wonderful Christmas.

15:32.780 --> 15:38.820
And then he's like, oh, hey, simply having a wonderful Christmas.

15:38.820 --> 15:40.200
The moon is right.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.820
The spirits up.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.180
We're here tonight.

15:43.180 --> 15:44.180
And that's enough.

15:44.180 --> 15:49.880
And then a guy walks in a wonderful Christmas time.

15:49.880 --> 15:56.360
So as that beautiful, meaningful mashup concludes, the playlist cross fades into the new version

15:56.360 --> 15:59.800
of Santa Baby by Tyler, the creator.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.160
And the camera slowly pans around to survey the aftermath.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.160
Is that real?

16:04.160 --> 16:05.160
No, but I wish it was.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.640
I was like, I've never heard that.

16:06.640 --> 16:10.060
I was like, that sounds amazing.

16:10.060 --> 16:15.140
The camera pans around to survey the aftermath of these last three minutes.

16:15.140 --> 16:21.340
We see two lifeless, partially shaved reindeer next to a dead college student, all sharing

16:21.340 --> 16:24.260
all mercy killings of dark red blood.

16:24.260 --> 16:29.500
We see a Santa Claus who has been shot in the head laying next to two well wrapped person

16:29.500 --> 16:31.540
shaped Christmas presents.

16:31.540 --> 16:37.220
We see a man impaled on the elf's four poster chair and beyond him in Santa's throne.

16:37.220 --> 16:43.400
A woman in a bathrobe is splayed headfirst neck snapped in the throne's belly button.

16:43.400 --> 16:48.360
Her legs limply akimbo on either side of the armrests.

16:48.360 --> 16:54.000
The elves blood has frozen their corpses to the skating rink that has become their grave

16:54.000 --> 16:58.280
in the regular place of a mop connected to a mopstick.

16:58.280 --> 17:05.640
An upside down naked man is slumped face first and lungs full in the mop bucket.

17:05.640 --> 17:11.160
Next to due to a past luck roll by Joe a very sturdy laptop.

17:11.160 --> 17:18.400
Emilia Clark breathes her last breath in the arms of Clark Bishop.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.400
Is her name Emilia Clark?

17:19.400 --> 17:20.400
It wasn't Emilia Clark, right?

17:20.400 --> 17:21.400
I'm sorry?

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
We went over the fact that I wasn't.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
What was her actual name?

17:23.400 --> 17:24.400
Locke.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
Emilia Locke.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.400
Oh, motherfucker.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.400
I even wrote Emilia Locke.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.680
You have fucked that up literally every single time.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.880
I don't think you've said it correctly once.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.840
Thomas just tried to look at my notes.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.000
I just wanted to look at that one word and then I was like, oh, that's dumb.

17:40.040 --> 17:46.000
I sit next to Zach now and I could theoretically blow this game wide open if I just leaned

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
a little bit to the right.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.640
But I'm not going to do that.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.640
That's appreciated.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.200
So I need everyone to roll sanity.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.800
Well, I ain't got none of that.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.800
Oh, shit.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.800
I pass.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.800
Six.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.800
I fail.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.800
Fail.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.800
Pass.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.800
Actually, I don't know how much sanity I...

18:03.800 --> 18:04.800
Oh, I do pass.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.800
Barely though.

18:05.800 --> 18:06.800
Okay.

18:06.800 --> 18:07.800
So I am going to need...

18:07.800 --> 18:08.800
Oh, I need a...

18:08.800 --> 18:09.800
Thanks, baby.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.600
John and Clark to roll a D6.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.600
Fuck.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.600
Five.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
Fuck.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.600
Six.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.600
Joe!

18:19.600 --> 18:24.600
God damn it.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.520
And everybody needs to leave the room.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.920
Everyone except me needs to leave the room.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.200
When you're at your breaking point, that's...

18:33.200 --> 18:35.120
When you're at that number, you hit it, right?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.120
Yes.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.120
Okay.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.120
I exactly hit my breaking point.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.120
I'm down to eight sanity.

18:39.440 --> 18:43.000
I hit my breaking point also, and I am at two sanity now.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Damn.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Holy shit, y'all.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.240
How did you lose so much?

18:46.240 --> 18:47.240
I had a...

18:47.240 --> 18:48.240
I forget.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.200
There was some reason I had a really low amount really early on.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.200
Like I got really screwed.

18:52.200 --> 18:56.760
I guess mine doesn't go down too often because I don't care when violence happens.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.160
You adapted to that.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.160
Yeah.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.160
What is your sanity?

19:00.160 --> 19:01.760
My current sanity is 23 right now.

19:01.760 --> 19:02.760
Fuck you.

19:02.760 --> 19:03.760
What was your max sanity?

19:03.760 --> 19:04.760
50.

19:04.760 --> 19:05.760
Oh, damn.

19:05.760 --> 19:06.760
I started at 60, apparently.

19:06.760 --> 19:07.840
I started at 60.

19:07.840 --> 19:13.000
But when we woke up in the mausoleum the second time, actually the first time we were there,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.960
I think I was down to already like 16 or something like that.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.320
I've been real low since we started this whole second life.

19:19.320 --> 19:23.800
I think, yeah, my saving grace is that I have no empathy, so...

19:23.800 --> 19:28.920
I also got ripped out of my own spine and put myself into my daddy's spine.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.320
I don't think that helped.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.320
I don't think it would.

19:31.320 --> 19:36.320
I went ahead and rolled sanity for Leon Simpson, and Joe, can you see what I rolled?

19:36.320 --> 19:37.320
He rolled an 88.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
Ooh.

19:38.800 --> 19:42.800
Which Leon obviously has 100, so that's a crit success.

19:42.800 --> 19:48.080
All right, let's get some of you out of here and keep some of you.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.160
I'm going to hold on to Joe first.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.120
Everybody else, leave the room.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.120
Hold on to me.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.120
Oh, fuck.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.120
Okay, I was...

19:55.120 --> 19:56.120
I watched...

19:56.120 --> 19:57.120
Oh, we were watching.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
Oh, actually, hold up.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.120
Sorry.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.120
I'm going to hold on to Luke and Justin.

20:07.320 --> 20:23.360
Luke and Justin, Keith Vigna, where are you standing in this room at the end of all this

20:23.360 --> 20:24.360
chaos?

20:24.360 --> 20:26.520
I think I was running back up the stairs.

20:26.520 --> 20:31.360
I think you were running back up the stairs, which is where you would see Donovan, and

20:31.400 --> 20:40.240
The very first person you notice is Leon Simpson, who immediately falls to the ground and starts

20:40.240 --> 20:47.160
writhing all over the floor of the Accord Student Union, and he starts chanting.

20:47.160 --> 20:53.480
And as he's chanting these numbers, two, five, one, four, one, nine, one, three, nine, two,

20:53.480 --> 20:59.840
zero, eight, oh, one, two, five, one, four, one, oh, one, nine, one, three, nine, two,

20:59.840 --> 21:05.120
zero, eight, and then he immediately goes and just starts running around trying to find

21:05.120 --> 21:06.160
something to write with.

21:06.160 --> 21:11.320
He's spreading out any liquid on the floor and drawing these letters out, these numbers

21:11.320 --> 21:12.480
all over the ground.

21:12.480 --> 21:16.400
I pull my phone out and I start writing down the numbers that he's saying.

21:16.400 --> 21:21.720
I look at it and I'm immediately like, oh, hell yeah, I'll have to look at this later.

21:21.720 --> 21:28.960
And as you do that, you notice that Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore are also drawing

21:29.360 --> 21:30.760
numbers on the ground.

21:30.760 --> 21:31.760
Are they the same numbers?

21:31.760 --> 21:32.760
I'm chanting.

21:32.760 --> 21:37.040
No, they are the numbers earlier that you would recognize as Bruce Robin.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.040
Okay.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.640
Is Leon still occupied with this?

21:40.640 --> 21:41.640
Very occupied.

21:41.640 --> 21:47.000
I want to go over and just give him just a slap on the face to like snap out of it.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.320
He does not pay attention whatsoever to the slap.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.280
Donovan, what did you do to him?

21:52.280 --> 21:54.160
I didn't do anything.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.680
Donovan's just like freaking out.

21:55.680 --> 22:01.640
Just eyes super wide, looking around, just like, uh, like it's frozen, just paralyzed.

22:01.640 --> 22:05.520
I've never experienced this before, so he's just like, uh, very scared.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.080
I grabbed Donovan by the shoulders.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.400
I'm like, are you okay?

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
Here.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.400
You didn't kill anybody, did you?

22:10.400 --> 22:11.400
No, no.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
Thank God.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.440
It's kind of a great feeling sometimes, but if you've never done it before, I wouldn't

22:15.440 --> 22:17.560
want to help you handle this.

22:17.560 --> 22:18.560
I didn't want to.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.460
Leon just tried to help me though.

22:20.460 --> 22:22.200
Was he acting like this the whole time or?

22:22.200 --> 22:24.240
No, he just now dropped.

22:24.240 --> 22:29.600
I go over to Clark and try to slap him and slap him out of it too.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.600
Same thing.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.600
Nothing.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.960
Are Leon's headphones on?

22:32.960 --> 22:34.480
Leon's headphones are on.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.640
That would have been the only idea Donovan had.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.240
I guess I'll take them off, see if it does anything.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.240
It does not.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.240
Okay.

22:42.240 --> 22:47.600
So right now the five of us are the only people live in this room.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
That is correct.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.520
I don't fucking know.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.480
I get on my phone and I start trying to decode this number.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.480
It says Ben Smith.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.480
That was easy.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.920
Thanks for not making me do it.

22:58.920 --> 22:59.920
You've done it before.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.920
Ben Smith.

23:00.920 --> 23:01.920
Have I ever heard that name before?

23:01.920 --> 23:02.920
No.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.920
I Google it.

23:04.920 --> 23:05.920
Okay.

23:05.920 --> 23:06.920
Yeah.

23:06.920 --> 23:07.920
You Google it and you find...

23:07.920 --> 23:09.880
I Google Ben Smith CSU.

23:09.880 --> 23:15.840
When you Google Ben Smith CSU, you find a student profile and you recognize the student

23:15.840 --> 23:23.200
Ben Smith as the one who was standing doing squats on Santa's throne, who initially started

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
the chant.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.520
I'm going to go over to...

23:25.520 --> 23:29.040
Is he on Santa's throne or what did he impale himself on?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.440
On the elf's four poster chair.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.440
Downstairs?

23:32.440 --> 23:33.600
Down the stairs from the throne, yeah.

23:33.600 --> 23:38.600
I'm going to go grab his wallet and just kind of like check and see what's on his person.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.600
Yeah.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
Ben Smith, student ID.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.200
He's been a CSU student for two years now.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.520
Nothing out of the ordinary in his pockets or anything?

23:46.520 --> 23:53.960
There is a piece of paper that has the math that led to 330 Gift's house and then there's

23:53.960 --> 23:59.400
another piece of paper that he wrote out the letters to play on the Casio keyboard.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.880
So he got here the same way we did just by following the scavenger hunt?

24:02.880 --> 24:03.880
Must have.

24:03.880 --> 24:07.760
Since I don't find anything else of interest on him, I want to go over to Clark.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.240
Does he have the laptop still?

24:09.240 --> 24:11.000
The laptop is on the ground, yeah.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.480
I'm going to open the laptop up and power it on.

24:13.480 --> 24:18.320
When you open up the laptop and power it on, you see that it is still kicking due to that

24:18.320 --> 24:21.320
successful luck roll last game.

24:21.320 --> 24:25.400
And there are a few things open on the desktop.

24:25.400 --> 24:29.200
There are three screenshots from Twitter and two videos.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.320
What are the screenshots of?

24:31.320 --> 24:36.920
The screenshots are all from the CSU biology department and I'm going to send you a message

24:36.920 --> 24:38.080
right now.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.080
With those on?

24:39.080 --> 24:40.080
Okay, sweet.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.160
Just like text tweets?

24:41.160 --> 24:44.640
Yes, but I made fake ones so it'll be fun.

24:44.640 --> 24:45.640
Tight.

24:45.640 --> 24:49.840
So the three screenshots from Twitter and two videos are open.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.220
What are those entitled?

24:51.220 --> 24:57.280
They are not titled, but one is of a young woman that you recognize from pictures as

24:57.280 --> 25:03.960
Harriet Marks sitting in her dorm room and the other is a very dark and distorted picture

25:03.960 --> 25:08.160
and you can only make out a candle in the middle of the frame.

25:08.160 --> 25:13.800
The one with the candle, does it remind me of like the pictures that we took with the

25:13.800 --> 25:14.800
camera?

25:14.800 --> 25:18.060
You know, where everything was black except certain...

25:18.060 --> 25:19.800
Only in the sense that it's dark.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.380
But it doesn't have that same like feel to it.

25:22.380 --> 25:23.380
It does not.

25:23.380 --> 25:24.380
And the only thing I can see is a candle.

25:24.380 --> 25:25.380
Yes.

25:25.380 --> 25:26.380
Okay.

25:26.380 --> 25:28.360
Go ahead and check out those tweets I just sent.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.180
Justin, do you want to read what's going on there?

25:31.180 --> 25:36.320
We got who the tweet came from, what time it was sent, what day it was sent, and what

25:36.320 --> 25:37.320
it says.

25:37.320 --> 25:41.300
CSU Biology Department at CSU Bio.

25:41.300 --> 25:45.960
This seems crazy, but a few of us who are not infected have quarantined ourselves in

25:45.960 --> 25:46.960
the lab.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.360
Please call 911.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.160
Our calls are not going through.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.680
1036 p.m. December 3rd.

25:52.680 --> 25:53.780
Call 911.

25:53.780 --> 25:54.780
Call 911.

25:54.780 --> 25:55.780
Emergency.

25:55.780 --> 25:58.760
CSU campus is infected with some sort of virus.

25:58.760 --> 25:59.760
Please help us.

25:59.760 --> 26:00.900
We are trapped in the lab at CSU.

26:00.900 --> 26:01.900
Please call 911.

26:01.900 --> 26:05.020
2 48 a.m. 4th of December.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.920
We're still quarantined in the lab.

26:06.920 --> 26:10.760
If you're the person or entity scrubbing this page, please have a heart.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.600
We are running low on supplies.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.560
2 48 p.m. 6th of December.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.840
And today's date is?

26:16.840 --> 26:18.480
The 6th of December.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.240
And it is, what time is it now?

26:20.240 --> 26:21.500
Like evening?

26:21.500 --> 26:22.500
Almost 9 o'clock.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.880
It's like 8 30.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.800
Where did it say they're quarantined at?

26:25.800 --> 26:26.800
The lab.

26:26.800 --> 26:34.520
Like in our travels to find the Accord Student Union, did I happen to see a biology hall?

26:34.560 --> 26:37.040
Donovan would know where the biology lab is.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.040
Okay.

26:38.040 --> 26:43.800
Okay, so I look at the laptop and I yell up to Donovan like, what do you study here?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.440
I'm a communications major.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.080
Have you ever taken a science class?

26:48.080 --> 26:50.720
Yeah, you have to.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.120
They wouldn't let me not take it.

26:52.120 --> 26:57.000
We need to go to the science hall and then I run up the stairs and I show him the tweets

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
from the laptop.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.420
Donovan, you would know that the science hall is called Glass Hall.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.360
That's where all my classes are this semester.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.360
Glass Hall?

27:06.360 --> 27:07.360
Oh my God, there's one at MSU.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.900
Yeah, that's what I thought you were doing.

27:09.900 --> 27:12.220
So at Missouri State University, we have a glass hall.

27:12.220 --> 27:16.620
I forgot about that because I only went for five semesters.

27:16.620 --> 27:21.480
This is my last semester and I'll finally, you know, I did it pretty quickly, but seven

27:21.480 --> 27:24.180
years for a bachelor's is pretty, pretty average.

27:24.180 --> 27:25.180
Well done, sir.

27:25.180 --> 27:26.660
Eight years, baby.

27:26.660 --> 27:28.540
Hell yeah.

27:28.540 --> 27:31.060
We all took a while to do it, but hey.

27:31.060 --> 27:32.060
We did it.

27:32.060 --> 27:33.060
Luke hasn't done it yet.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.180
I focused on booze a little harder than my classes sometimes.

27:36.180 --> 27:41.340
So in the city, CSU's glass hall is named that because a certain amount of money was

27:41.340 --> 27:47.180
given by a certain person and at that moment I'm going to get Thomas and Joe to join us

27:47.180 --> 27:50.180
back in the room and in fact, you guys won't be here.

27:50.180 --> 27:51.180
Cool.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.980
Cause I have to take a tinkle time.

28:03.060 --> 28:12.660
Hey Joe, hello Zachary.

28:12.660 --> 28:18.700
So on this arc of pretending to be people, I'm running the sanity mechanics slightly

28:18.700 --> 28:19.700
different.

28:19.700 --> 28:24.100
However, this seems to line up perfectly with you hitting your breaking point.

28:24.100 --> 28:29.660
So as we've done in the past, I'm going to have you roll a D100 three times and we will

28:29.660 --> 28:37.020
choose a mania and this mania will need to overtake all of your decisions, all of your

28:37.020 --> 28:41.540
words, all of your role-playing actions for the duration.

28:41.540 --> 28:43.340
Holy shit.

28:43.340 --> 28:45.820
Roll them up.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.820
I got an 82.

28:47.820 --> 28:48.820
82?

28:48.820 --> 28:49.820
No.

28:49.820 --> 28:50.820
Oh.

28:50.820 --> 28:52.140
Get out of here.

28:52.140 --> 28:56.420
Thomas just walked in like he was supposed to be in here, that goofball.

28:56.420 --> 28:58.740
I got a 49.

28:58.740 --> 29:02.740
49 and what is that last one?

29:02.740 --> 29:04.020
A 48.

29:04.020 --> 29:05.020
48.

29:05.020 --> 29:06.420
Thankfully close.

29:06.420 --> 29:12.180
So 82 is photomania, the pathological desire for light.

29:12.180 --> 29:13.180
That's fun.

29:13.180 --> 29:14.180
Interesting.

29:14.180 --> 29:20.580
49 is goatomania, obsession with witches and witchcraft.

29:20.580 --> 29:28.620
And geolomania, the uncontrollable compulsion to laugh.

29:28.620 --> 29:31.620
Well, the left one is the easiest one to do.

29:31.620 --> 29:34.940
Does Joe have a compulsion to laugh?

29:34.940 --> 29:36.460
I have that in real life.

29:36.460 --> 29:39.460
I have geolomania.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.540
As we both laugh at that.

29:41.540 --> 29:43.460
I think I would take the light thing.

29:43.460 --> 29:47.980
I think that's interesting that I'm always searching for the light.

29:47.980 --> 29:50.860
Obsessed and searching for light.

29:50.860 --> 29:55.540
So when you say it takes over my character, can I be involved in discussions now or do

29:55.540 --> 29:59.420
I have to be trying to get away from the group to find the light source at all times?

29:59.420 --> 30:05.660
You know how Thomas has been kind of off topic but still going with what's happening in the

30:05.660 --> 30:06.660
group?

30:06.660 --> 30:07.660
Uh huh.

30:07.660 --> 30:08.660
Like that.

30:08.660 --> 30:09.660
Okay.

30:09.660 --> 30:12.860
So obsessed but also, you know, don't ruin the podcast.

30:12.860 --> 30:13.860
Yeah.

30:13.860 --> 30:14.860
Okay.

30:14.860 --> 30:15.860
Yeah.

30:15.860 --> 30:16.860
I think I can do that.

30:16.860 --> 30:17.860
All right.

30:17.860 --> 30:18.860
Sounds good.

30:18.860 --> 30:19.860
I'm going to grab no one.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.860
I'm going to get everyone and then we're going to happen.

30:22.860 --> 30:23.860
Okay.

30:23.860 --> 30:39.060
I'm going to get everyone and then we're going to happen.

30:39.060 --> 30:44.220
Keith Vigna and Donovan Westerfuck, you guys, what's your last name?

30:44.220 --> 30:45.220
West Haven.

30:45.220 --> 30:52.300
In Donovan West Haven, the two of you notice the eyes light back up in Clark Bishop and

30:52.300 --> 30:56.140
John Lee Pettymore and even in Leon Simpson.

30:56.140 --> 31:01.980
And as you notice that happening, Leon Simpson gets up and starts boogieing down.

31:01.980 --> 31:07.700
He's shaking his hips, he's snapping his fingers and he starts dancing down the stairs.

31:07.700 --> 31:08.700
Okay.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.940
So you said that people have figured this out, out of character.

31:12.940 --> 31:16.900
One thing I have thought is that maybe some of your inspiration for this was like dancing

31:16.900 --> 31:17.900
sickness.

31:17.900 --> 31:20.580
I don't know what that is to me either.

31:20.580 --> 31:25.940
It's what the movie Joker is about.

31:25.940 --> 31:26.940
Didn't see it.

31:26.940 --> 31:27.940
You should.

31:27.940 --> 31:28.940
It's really good.

31:28.940 --> 31:35.100
So I see them wake back up and I run over to Clark and I shove the laptop in his hands

31:35.100 --> 31:36.540
and I'm like, look at this.

31:36.540 --> 31:40.060
And the glow of the laptop illuminates your face.

31:40.060 --> 31:41.060
I just stare at the laptop.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.060
Sorry.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.060
I meant dancing mania.

31:43.060 --> 31:44.060
Have you heard of that?

31:44.060 --> 31:45.060
Yes, for sure.

31:45.060 --> 31:47.540
And that is what this is all based off of.

31:47.540 --> 31:50.740
I've only seen the parody Dirty Dancing Mania.

31:50.740 --> 31:55.920
The dancing plague or dance epidemic of 1518 was a case of dancing mania that occurred

31:55.920 --> 32:02.620
in Strasbourg, Alsace, now modern day France, and the Holy Roman Empire in July, 1518.

32:02.620 --> 32:06.700
Around 400 people took to dancing for days without rest and over the period of about

32:06.700 --> 32:11.540
one month, some of those affected collapsed or even died of heart attack, stroke or exhaustion.

32:11.540 --> 32:12.540
Do they know what?

32:12.540 --> 32:13.540
Dancing mania.

32:13.540 --> 32:14.540
Do they know what happened?

32:14.540 --> 32:16.580
Well, let me go to the page for dancing mania.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.980
Wait, that wasn't the page for dancing mania?

32:18.980 --> 32:22.740
That's the page for the dancing plague of 1518, which is one of the most famous.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.220
My guess is of the dancing prion.

32:24.220 --> 32:26.740
Well, I think it's kind of related to like speaking in tongues.

32:26.740 --> 32:28.860
It's just like a social like, oh, they did it on purpose.

32:28.860 --> 32:30.460
I thought it was like a sickness.

32:30.460 --> 32:33.140
I never spoke on tongues on purpose.

32:33.140 --> 32:35.420
I've seen people speak.

32:35.420 --> 32:36.420
Have you spoken in tongues?

32:36.420 --> 32:37.420
Yes.

32:37.420 --> 32:38.420
Yes.

32:38.420 --> 32:40.420
No, I've seen people speak in tongues and I don't think they're doing it on purpose.

32:40.420 --> 32:41.900
I always threw in the F word.

32:42.220 --> 32:51.780
I'd be like, are you speaking in tongues when you do tall?

32:51.780 --> 32:57.220
As a sixth grader, I realized I was an atheist when I went to James river church camp and

32:57.220 --> 33:02.940
they made us speak in tongues and I was like, oh, this isn't real.

33:02.940 --> 33:09.300
So I just sent you guys screenshots of three tweets that were screenshotted and saved onto

33:09.300 --> 33:11.300
the desktop of this computer.

33:11.300 --> 33:17.980
The other two things on this desktop are videos and the like screenshot, the screen cap of

33:17.980 --> 33:19.180
each video.

33:19.180 --> 33:23.180
One is of a woman, the young woman that you recognize as Harriet marks.

33:23.180 --> 33:24.420
She's sitting in her dorm room.

33:24.420 --> 33:31.140
It looks to be like a webcam video and the other is a video that is very dark and distorted

33:31.140 --> 33:35.580
looking and you can only make out a candle in the middle of the frame.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.580
Go ahead and read those tweets cause that's our next step.

33:39.580 --> 33:44.580
Clark is staring at the laptop and slowly his face is getting closer and closer to the

33:44.580 --> 33:47.460
screen until his forehead is just touching the screen.

33:47.460 --> 33:48.900
I look at him do this.

33:48.900 --> 33:52.540
I'm like, his forehead is touching the screen for like five or six seconds.

33:52.540 --> 33:56.980
And I'm like, Clark, what, what do you, what are you doing?

33:56.980 --> 33:59.740
Just uh, just getting, getting closer to it.

33:59.740 --> 34:00.740
That's all.

34:00.740 --> 34:01.940
Can you read those?

34:01.940 --> 34:02.940
Read what?

34:02.940 --> 34:07.460
Oh, those, those pictures, those screenshots of tweets.

34:07.460 --> 34:08.460
Right.

34:08.460 --> 34:09.460
Sure, sure, sure.

34:09.460 --> 34:10.460
Yeah.

34:10.460 --> 34:13.580
And he moves the laptop to a reading distance and reads them.

34:13.580 --> 34:19.340
Uh, the first one says, this seems crazy, but a few of us, I'm sorry, these are tweets.

34:19.340 --> 34:24.180
They're screenshots of tweets from the CSU biology department says, uh, this seems crazy.

34:24.180 --> 34:29.260
Real quick, kudos to Zach for apparently learning Photoshop or maybe GIMP and putting these

34:29.260 --> 34:30.260
together.

34:30.260 --> 34:31.260
Maybe you had Justin do it.

34:31.260 --> 34:33.980
This is a lot of, uh, this is a lot of work as well.

34:33.980 --> 34:36.900
GIMPs transfer, um, pneumatic image processing.

34:37.340 --> 34:38.340
Uh, I don't remember.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.780
It's, it's a free, it's a free alternative to Photoshop.

34:40.780 --> 34:41.780
That's fairly popular.

34:41.780 --> 34:42.780
Doesn't pneumatic start with a P?

34:42.780 --> 34:43.780
Wouldn't it be PIMP?

34:43.780 --> 34:44.780
It's new.

34:44.780 --> 34:45.780
It's GNU.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.900
It's some fucking freeware shit.

34:47.900 --> 34:48.900
I don't know, man.

34:48.900 --> 34:49.900
But it is GNU.

34:49.900 --> 34:51.020
What do the tweets say?

34:51.020 --> 34:55.500
The first one says, this seems crazy, but a few of us who are not infected have quarantined

34:55.500 --> 34:56.740
ourselves in the lab.

34:56.740 --> 34:57.740
Please call 911.

34:57.740 --> 35:01.380
Our calls are not going through and they didn't finish writing the word through.

35:01.540 --> 35:04.900
Uh, the second one says in all caps, call 911, call 911.

35:04.900 --> 35:08.900
Emergency CSU campus is infected with some sort of virus.

35:08.900 --> 35:09.900
Please help us.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.400
We are trapped in the lab at CSU.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.400
Please call 911.

35:12.400 --> 35:16.940
And the third and last tweet says, we're still quarantined in the lab.

35:16.940 --> 35:20.820
If you are the person or entity scrubbing this page, please have a heart.

35:20.820 --> 35:22.500
We are running low on supplies.

35:22.500 --> 35:26.260
If you pay attention, the last tweet was sent out this afternoon.

35:26.260 --> 35:27.260
Oh yeah.

35:27.260 --> 35:30.640
So the first, the first tweet is dated December 3rd.

35:30.640 --> 35:35.600
The second tweet is dated December 4th and the third tweet is dated December 6th.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.800
So we should stay away from the lab, right?

35:37.800 --> 35:40.080
This ain't really dramatic.

35:40.080 --> 35:43.800
Well, I was, I was talking to Donovan.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.640
He knows where the lab is.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.920
It's in, it's in glass hall.

35:47.920 --> 35:52.080
Not the one at Missouri state university, but the one at city state university.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.080
Exactly.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.680
Uh, apparently Marvin has something to do with it.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.800
Well, finance it.

35:56.800 --> 36:00.400
But anyway, I was thinking, I think we got to go help.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.400
See what's going on there.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.400
Yeah.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.880
I think we should, uh, we should investigate the lab.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.200
I mean, if they're survivors.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.200
Yeah.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.200
Well that's what I'm thinking.

36:07.200 --> 36:11.780
They probably have, I mean, Donovan's a survivor and he's not, hasn't tried to hurt us yet.

36:11.780 --> 36:15.080
So I think we might as well try to go help some other people.

36:15.080 --> 36:17.120
Everybody roll alertness for me.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.120
Donovan.

36:18.120 --> 36:22.920
You probably have pretty low alertness.

36:22.920 --> 36:23.920
I pass.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.920
Oh fuck.

36:24.920 --> 36:25.920
Yeah.

36:25.920 --> 36:26.920
I pass a 54 and a 60.

36:26.920 --> 36:28.580
I got a 36 on a 60.

36:28.580 --> 36:35.040
I was a 47 on a 70, 64 on what I assume is not.

36:35.040 --> 36:41.020
So as the beautiful rendition of Santa baby by Tyler, the creator finishes, can you give

36:41.020 --> 36:49.180
us just a little, uh, don't Justin will work on it.

36:49.180 --> 36:50.740
We'll drop it later.

36:50.740 --> 36:52.020
Well, actually, you know what?

36:52.020 --> 36:56.820
Uh, we'll just message Tyler and see if he'll just, we're like, Hey Justin, we just mentioned

36:56.820 --> 36:59.980
that in the art podcast world and Justin, sorry.

36:59.980 --> 37:03.740
He's like, why are you calling me Justin in our world?

37:03.740 --> 37:04.740
You're just in the grid.

37:04.740 --> 37:08.020
You know, my secret name, I must do what you say.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.660
I found out his last name isn't the creator.

37:10.660 --> 37:11.660
That's wild.

37:11.660 --> 37:12.660
It is wild.

37:12.660 --> 37:13.980
No, they can't just, you can't just lie like that.

37:13.980 --> 37:14.980
Apparently he does.

37:14.980 --> 37:15.980
No, it's not bad boy.

37:15.980 --> 37:16.980
Legal.

37:16.980 --> 37:17.980
Yeah.

37:17.980 --> 37:20.580
Well he would have had to change his name.

37:20.780 --> 37:26.180
The room goes completely silent as the song ends and looking over, the only thing you

37:26.180 --> 37:33.020
hear is the tapping feet of Leon Simpson as he is just fucking grinding and getting it

37:33.020 --> 37:36.860
on the dance floor that no longer exists.

37:36.860 --> 37:41.900
But you also hear the phone in his pocket is buzzing incessantly.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.780
Leon, Leon, your phone, your phone's ringing.

37:45.780 --> 37:55.020
Oh, two, five, one, four, one nine, one, three, nine, two, zero, okay.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.020
Oh yeah.

37:56.020 --> 37:57.020
I got it already.

37:57.020 --> 37:58.020
Don't worry.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.020
Get down.

37:59.020 --> 38:03.340
As he's doing that, I gather Clark and John and I'm like, Hey, Donovan just watches.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.540
I kind of like look at Donovan and I like wave him over.

38:05.540 --> 38:10.580
I'm like, he can come over if he wants.

38:10.580 --> 38:14.700
So you guys were, you guys were just out of it.

38:14.700 --> 38:21.420
Like you, Leon, you were reciting the numbers that was for Robin and uh, no, I was, I was

38:21.420 --> 38:27.580
carrying the laptop and the girl that I was just, you were at, you don't, you try to understand

38:27.580 --> 38:28.580
what I'm doing.

38:28.580 --> 38:34.300
Well, you guys were saying the words for Robin, for Bruce Robin and Leon was reciting those

38:34.300 --> 38:39.940
same numbers and I looked it up and uh, it's for a name, Ben Smith.

38:39.940 --> 38:43.820
And uh, I looked it up and it's, it's that one right there.

38:43.820 --> 38:50.140
And he points to the man who was previously doing squats on Santa's throne and was the

38:50.140 --> 38:58.380
first to chant Tawa Alakol before diving neck first on the four poster chair that the elf

38:58.380 --> 39:01.020
might sit in for picture time.

39:01.020 --> 39:07.860
You guys, we, we've been, you know, chanting and writing numbers that are for Bruce Robin

39:07.860 --> 39:13.780
and Bruce was doing it for Harriet Marks, but Leon's doing it for Ben Smith.

39:13.780 --> 39:18.260
How I'm just trying to wrap my mind around what, what's it mean?

39:18.260 --> 39:20.540
Did Leon do anything with Ben's body?

39:20.540 --> 39:21.540
Did he?

39:21.540 --> 39:25.500
No, I, I shot Ben and then Ben jumped off and killed himself.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.700
Donovan, you were with him last, right?

39:27.700 --> 39:29.460
What was he, was he doing anything?

39:29.460 --> 39:31.100
He just crumpled to the ground.

39:31.100 --> 39:35.420
He started chanting the numbers and writhing like he was in pain.

39:35.420 --> 39:36.420
Just all of a sudden.

39:36.420 --> 39:37.420
Just out of nowhere.

39:37.420 --> 39:38.420
Yeah, out of nowhere.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.420
I saw it.

39:39.420 --> 39:42.540
I thought it was having a seizure at first until he started talking and, and uh, he was

39:42.540 --> 39:46.340
chanting the numbers and, and, and right, like trying to write them down on the ground.

39:46.340 --> 39:50.220
It was, I don't know how these numbers affect us.

39:50.220 --> 39:51.220
That's evident.

39:51.220 --> 39:57.860
I do, but it's not my time to tell you, John, if you know, you gotta, you gotta tell us.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.820
That's basically our whole job here.

39:59.820 --> 40:00.820
Clack.

40:00.820 --> 40:01.820
Clack.

40:01.820 --> 40:05.020
Dear Clack, I don't know right now.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.020
I will know.

40:06.020 --> 40:09.180
Well, that's, that's how information works.

40:09.180 --> 40:10.180
Yes.

40:10.180 --> 40:13.100
All right, Keith, you got any ideas?

40:13.100 --> 40:23.780
I was thinking, I was thinking up until, I was thinking up until this point we were saying

40:23.780 --> 40:29.540
Bruce Robin's numbers because, well, I mean, we didn't kill him, but I mean, basically

40:29.540 --> 40:30.540
we did.

40:30.540 --> 40:35.220
So I was thinking that he might've killed Harriet Marks, but now that doesn't make any

40:35.220 --> 40:39.060
sense cause, cause Leon didn't kill Ben Smith.

40:39.060 --> 40:40.540
Bruce Robin killed himself.

40:40.540 --> 40:41.540
That's right.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.540
That's yeah.

40:42.540 --> 40:47.260
So in our, in our presence, is it when I was doing numbers just now, was I doing Ben Smith?

40:47.260 --> 40:49.540
No, you were doing Bruce Robin still.

40:49.540 --> 40:54.740
So maybe if you're in proximity of somebody who's doing the Talia Lecourt thing, you start

40:54.740 --> 40:56.260
saying the numbers of their death?

40:56.260 --> 40:58.580
Maybe, but I still just don't know what it means.

40:58.580 --> 41:03.080
I'm thinking maybe Bruce Robbins is the one that's infected me and I can't be reinfected

41:03.080 --> 41:04.080
by a new one.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.080
Could be.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.080
You're not, you're not doing numbers.

41:06.080 --> 41:12.580
Donovan was, I was, I woke up, I woke up doing Bruce Robbins, but I mean, I, I haven't done

41:12.580 --> 41:13.580
it recently.

41:13.580 --> 41:17.740
I just haven't, both times that you guys have done it when I've seen you, you just, it was

41:17.740 --> 41:20.380
like you left for a little bit.

41:20.380 --> 41:21.460
It's like checked out.

41:21.460 --> 41:25.060
It's like you've passed some kind of test that we've failed.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.060
Seemingly.

41:26.060 --> 41:27.060
I don't know.

41:27.060 --> 41:33.460
And I look, I look down and I look down at Leon and yell, Leon, what are you doing?

41:33.460 --> 41:35.620
He's fucking getting it.

41:35.620 --> 41:36.620
That's the electric slide.

41:36.620 --> 41:43.260
Does he not pay attention to, to the left, to the left, to the left, to the left, to

41:43.260 --> 41:44.260
the right.

41:44.780 --> 41:48.660
John and I, when we, when we do this, how do you snap us out of it?

41:48.660 --> 41:49.660
I tried.

41:49.660 --> 41:55.940
Well, Zach just yells and we come in the room.

41:55.940 --> 41:59.620
All three of you guys just kind of like at the same time, just like, it was almost like

41:59.620 --> 42:03.780
you were just not in reality and I slapped Leon and nothing happened.

42:03.780 --> 42:07.340
I came up and I slapped you to try to get you out of it and nothing.

42:07.340 --> 42:11.820
You just kept on and both times it's happened that I've seen, I just wait for you to snap

42:11.820 --> 42:12.820
back into it.

42:13.380 --> 42:14.660
My face hurts.

42:14.660 --> 42:16.220
Please stop slapping us.

42:16.220 --> 42:19.980
Well, that's odd cause I only slapped Clark.

42:19.980 --> 42:23.060
I feel the pain of all crashes.

42:23.060 --> 42:25.800
I think Leon might be a lost cause at this point.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.580
I think we need to get over to that lab.

42:27.580 --> 42:30.420
I don't know if we should bring Leon with us or the agony.

42:30.420 --> 42:33.180
Clark is going to walk over to Leon and try and shake him.

42:33.180 --> 42:36.620
I'm not going to hit him, but I'm going to like shake him by the shoulders.

42:36.620 --> 42:39.740
Roll luck.

42:39.740 --> 42:41.940
I pass a 48.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.900
I've been rolling 48 and 47s on different dice all night.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.900
How much luck do you have?

42:46.900 --> 42:47.900
65.

42:47.900 --> 42:48.900
Damn.

42:48.900 --> 42:49.900
Joe regained some health.

42:49.900 --> 42:50.900
Luck.

42:50.900 --> 42:53.220
Joe regained some luck.

42:53.220 --> 43:01.620
John looks up from the CSU campus beyond the ether and he winks at Joe.

43:01.620 --> 43:02.620
Like Joe?

43:02.620 --> 43:03.620
Holy shit.

43:03.620 --> 43:04.620
Wow.

43:04.620 --> 43:10.900
And in that exact moment, Ooh, that was creepy.

43:11.380 --> 43:15.020
It must have worked cause Joe got chills.

43:15.020 --> 43:16.020
Joe chill.

43:16.020 --> 43:17.020
Wholesome joker.

43:17.020 --> 43:18.900
You killed Batman's parents.

43:18.900 --> 43:27.020
John looks at you and says, who's Joe?

43:27.020 --> 43:34.980
And Clark shakes Leon who does not stop dancing, however, his buzzing cell phone falls out

43:34.980 --> 43:35.980
of his trousers.

43:35.980 --> 43:40.340
Hey, does he have angry birds on there?

43:40.700 --> 43:45.940
It falls to the ground and you see that a number that is unknown is calling and then

43:45.940 --> 43:52.820
the call ends and it has 25 missed calls from unknown and a few texts as well.

43:52.820 --> 43:55.060
I want to read them texts straight away.

43:55.060 --> 43:58.900
And it seems like it's only a matter of time before unknown calls again.

43:58.900 --> 44:02.060
Also this, uh, this phone pretty bright for the room.

44:02.060 --> 44:03.060
Nice.

44:03.060 --> 44:04.060
What do you mean?

44:04.060 --> 44:05.060
Pretty bright for the room.

44:05.060 --> 44:09.140
It just like has a nice glow to it because it's dance party time at the jingle ball.

44:09.140 --> 44:11.020
The lights are dimmed.

44:11.020 --> 44:12.700
Pretty bright compared to the room.

44:12.700 --> 44:13.700
Yes.

44:13.700 --> 44:14.700
Okay.

44:14.700 --> 44:15.700
Gotcha.

44:15.700 --> 44:19.700
I just sent you guys a screenshot of the text message conversation that was on this phone.

44:19.700 --> 44:25.540
You did and bold of you to assume that my phone would not be dead.

44:25.540 --> 44:30.740
So unknown texts Leon and says, how's it going?

44:30.740 --> 44:37.540
And Leon replies, the secretary is stubborn looking for another opinion.

44:37.540 --> 44:38.540
Option.

44:39.540 --> 44:42.300
It sounded just like Leon.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.700
Hey, maybe don't save it as a JPEG next time.

44:44.700 --> 44:46.500
You are doing such a good job of reading.

44:46.500 --> 44:47.500
I'm proud of you.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.500
Fucking got him.

44:48.500 --> 44:52.260
I don't know what a JPEG has been recognized as ours though was.

44:52.260 --> 45:04.600
Oh, I think you, you would pronounce it, uh, it's a, it's a, hold on, how's it going?

45:04.600 --> 45:07.820
The secretary is stubborn looking for another option.

45:07.820 --> 45:09.220
I don't want excuses.

45:09.220 --> 45:10.220
Pick up.

45:10.220 --> 45:11.220
Okay.

45:11.220 --> 45:12.220
Oh, sorry.

45:12.220 --> 45:14.900
That is not as clear as I thought it would not clear at all.

45:14.900 --> 45:15.900
Yeah.

45:15.900 --> 45:18.380
So the first message is from unknown and it says, how's it going?

45:18.380 --> 45:22.700
And then Leon replies, the secretary is stubborn looking for another option.

45:22.700 --> 45:27.300
And then the rest of the messages go unanswered from unknown.

45:27.300 --> 45:29.580
They say, I don't want excuses.

45:29.580 --> 45:30.580
Pick up.

45:30.580 --> 45:31.580
Okay.

45:31.580 --> 45:37.260
I sent them T O it's capitalized to, we'll be ready for extraction.

45:37.260 --> 45:42.500
Don't forget to get the signatures ETA question mark, and then another question mark.

45:42.500 --> 45:43.500
Jesus Christ.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.500
What is going on?

45:44.500 --> 45:45.700
That's also from unknown.

45:45.700 --> 45:48.460
And then three, three question marks.

45:48.460 --> 45:54.500
And then if he doesn't get here in time, this is all over everything we've worked for.

45:54.500 --> 46:00.140
Everything that exists just gone for what your fucking conscience, morality won't save

46:00.140 --> 46:01.140
us.

46:01.140 --> 46:02.140
God.

46:02.140 --> 46:03.140
Clark.

46:03.140 --> 46:04.140
What are you looking at?

46:04.140 --> 46:09.140
Uh, let me read it for you.

46:09.140 --> 46:17.140
Okay, go ahead.

46:17.140 --> 46:22.380
I did realize that, uh, Joe and I think probably Clark would to figure it out why that T O

46:22.380 --> 46:23.420
is capitalized.

46:23.420 --> 46:24.420
That's the overseer.

46:24.420 --> 46:25.420
I believe.

46:25.420 --> 46:26.420
Dang.

46:26.420 --> 46:27.420
Nice.

46:27.420 --> 46:28.420
Okay.

46:28.420 --> 46:32.260
Can you figure out why ETA is capitalized?

46:32.260 --> 46:33.260
It says, okay.

46:33.260 --> 46:34.260
I sent them.

46:34.260 --> 46:35.900
The overseer will be ready for extraction.

46:35.900 --> 46:37.540
Don't forget the signatures.

46:37.540 --> 46:41.580
I don't exactly know what any of it means, but it sounds like they were preparing for

46:41.580 --> 46:42.580
the overseer.

46:42.580 --> 46:44.380
Hey Clark, text him back.

46:44.380 --> 46:45.380
Why?

46:45.380 --> 46:47.460
Which I will, but I don't know what, I don't know.

46:47.460 --> 46:53.980
I mean, I was hoping that I had the suggestion and you would figure out the rest from there.

46:53.980 --> 46:56.820
This person seems to know Leon and knows what's going on.

46:56.820 --> 47:02.180
Do you think I should just say Leon is compromised or Leon's got the numbers in him or just

47:02.180 --> 47:16.420
just see what they say back to the numbers in that is baby grand pianos for a single.

47:16.420 --> 47:24.380
I think just say, uh, say, say this, should you tell him that you're the overseer?

47:24.380 --> 47:26.860
Well yeah, I think he knows, he knows, right?

47:26.860 --> 47:31.380
I just text back, this is the overseer.

47:31.380 --> 47:34.980
Now say, now say bitch.

47:34.980 --> 47:40.300
I mean, I know he knows you are, but I'm saying if you sent, if you send him a text, should

47:40.300 --> 47:45.620
you say it's you or no, no, we, we should pretend to be Leon on this phone unless we

47:45.620 --> 47:50.740
make a total power move by being like this, the overseer, I won't be extracted ready for

47:50.740 --> 47:52.360
my fist.

47:52.360 --> 47:56.520
This last message message says if he doesn't get here in time, this is all over everything

47:56.520 --> 47:57.520
we've worked for.

47:57.520 --> 48:02.580
Anything that exists gone for what your fucking conscience morality won't save us.

48:02.580 --> 48:05.780
So was this some kind of side mission that Leon was having us on?

48:05.780 --> 48:10.920
I thought, I figured it was coming down from Maggie yourself, but Oh, maybe this is probably

48:10.920 --> 48:12.640
Maggie isn't it?

48:12.640 --> 48:14.640
It could be.

48:14.640 --> 48:19.640
Guys, guys, does Maggie suck?

48:19.640 --> 48:21.960
Just text back Maggie question mark.

48:21.960 --> 48:22.960
You think I should?

48:22.960 --> 48:23.960
He'd know that.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.120
Well, he doesn't know anything right now.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.120
I don't know.

48:26.120 --> 48:27.120
But I mean, Leon.

48:27.120 --> 48:28.120
I don't know.

48:28.120 --> 48:29.120
That's what I'm saying.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.120
Leon don't know anything right now.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.120
Look at it.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.120
Hold on.

48:32.120 --> 48:33.120
Hold on.

48:33.120 --> 48:44.120
Text her that those numbers or just any random numbers she might not respond.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.920
I don't know if we could indicate that Leon is compromised.

48:46.920 --> 48:47.920
Why don't we just say that?

48:47.920 --> 48:53.360
Why don't we just say this is a whatever the fuck Justin's character's name is Donovan

48:53.360 --> 49:00.960
West, West and Donna Donovan Westerfuck and I am a student here and West Haven.

49:00.960 --> 49:03.260
I have a student here.

49:03.260 --> 49:08.340
He taught me how to shoot Leon Leon and trusted the mission to me.

49:08.340 --> 49:09.340
But he's gone.

49:09.340 --> 49:10.340
Yeah.

49:10.340 --> 49:11.340
Text that and then let's go to the lab.

49:11.340 --> 49:12.340
Let's just go to the lab.

49:12.340 --> 49:13.340
Fuck Maggie.

49:13.340 --> 49:16.360
If this is Maggie, I would worry that she would clam up that she wouldn't text back

49:16.360 --> 49:19.600
if she knew it wasn't Leon she was talking to you or at least a part of the circle of

49:19.600 --> 49:20.600
knowledge.

49:20.600 --> 49:23.000
I'm just going to take I'm going to say, Hey, it's Clark.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.760
If we think it's her, I'll say, Hey, it's Clark and it will see what happens with the

49:25.760 --> 49:26.760
reply.

49:26.760 --> 49:27.760
If it's like, who's Clark?

49:27.760 --> 49:28.760
Be like, Hey, man.

49:28.760 --> 49:29.760
Say, Hey, it's Clark.

49:29.760 --> 49:30.760
I'm going to I do that.

49:30.760 --> 49:31.760
I reply back.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.760
Hey, it's Clark.

49:32.760 --> 49:33.760
Leon's compromised.

49:33.760 --> 49:34.760
Leon's compromised.

49:34.760 --> 49:35.760
Yeah.

49:35.760 --> 49:36.760
Okay.

49:36.760 --> 49:38.120
Well, while we wait for a text back, I think we ought to go to the lab and check that out.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.760
I'm going to try Leon one more time.

49:39.760 --> 49:46.200
Leon, do you want to do you want to come with us or y'all said, Oh, I'm getting it up.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.200
Oh, I'm getting it.

49:48.200 --> 49:49.200
Yeah.

49:49.200 --> 49:52.120
Do you want to dance walk with us?

49:52.120 --> 49:53.120
You can keep dancing.

49:53.120 --> 49:58.240
If you want to follow us, I look at you and I'm like, put a hand on his shoulder and like

49:58.240 --> 50:02.160
try to like push him in front of me and I'm like, let's just lead him that way.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.400
I mean, I don't know if we should leave him.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.400
He'll keep dancing.

50:05.400 --> 50:06.400
Will he go with it?

50:06.400 --> 50:07.400
Sure.

50:07.400 --> 50:08.400
Let's do it.

50:08.400 --> 50:09.400
Where you lead.

50:09.400 --> 50:10.400
I will follow.

50:10.400 --> 50:11.400
Okay.

50:11.400 --> 50:18.720
So John definitely not looking at his phone, but you saw him looking at his phone earlier,

50:18.720 --> 50:24.480
but he just seems to speak out of like pure knowledge affecting thousands of people across

50:24.480 --> 50:26.000
several centuries.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.440
Dancing mania was not an isolated event and was well-documented.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.360
He says it like he's not reading it.

50:33.360 --> 50:35.960
Well-documented in contemporary reports.

50:35.960 --> 50:40.800
It was nevertheless poorly understood and remedies were based on guesswork.

50:40.800 --> 50:45.920
Often musicians accompanied dancers due to belief that music would treat the mania, but

50:45.920 --> 50:48.120
this sometimes backfired.

50:48.120 --> 50:51.400
No fucking chance.

50:51.400 --> 50:58.200
By encouraging more to join in.

50:58.200 --> 51:04.440
There is no consensus among modern day scholars as to the cause of dancing mania.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.160
That's real interesting.

51:06.160 --> 51:11.360
John was facing away from all of you while he said this.

51:11.360 --> 51:16.140
He was kind of saying it at a plant in the hallway.

51:16.180 --> 51:21.620
As soon as he finishes talking, I look at Clark, I don't have a good feeling about any of this.

51:21.620 --> 51:25.860
Something real bad's affected him, but he's not doing anything bad per se.

51:25.860 --> 51:29.780
I just kind of, I just want to go home.

51:29.780 --> 51:32.860
Let's go to that lab and see if there's anybody left here.

51:32.860 --> 51:35.460
Otherwise I'm going to get the fuck off this campus.

51:35.460 --> 51:36.460
Everybody run the alertness.

51:36.460 --> 51:42.380
Well, real quick, damn it.

51:42.380 --> 51:44.660
I fail 89 on a 60.

51:44.700 --> 51:47.740
I fail 94 on a less than that.

51:47.740 --> 51:49.700
I fail a 79 on a 70.

51:49.700 --> 51:50.700
Donovan?

51:50.700 --> 51:51.700
I rolled a six.

51:51.700 --> 51:52.700
Yeah!

51:52.700 --> 51:58.260
For the first time in Donovan's life, he is alert to his surroundings.

51:58.260 --> 51:59.260
Kind of.

51:59.260 --> 52:00.260
I don't know if I bastardized.

52:00.260 --> 52:04.540
Unfortunately, you only had five.

52:04.540 --> 52:05.580
Your bass is 20, I think.

52:05.580 --> 52:08.100
Thomas and Luke to leave the room.

52:08.100 --> 52:09.580
Sayonara suckers.

52:09.580 --> 52:10.580
Help.

52:14.660 --> 52:30.980
Clark, you're holding Leon's phone in your hand and you feel a buzz in your pocket and

52:30.980 --> 52:36.380
Donovan is standing right next to you and he hears the buzz from the phone in your pocket

52:36.380 --> 52:38.900
and you guys make direct eye contact with each other.

52:38.900 --> 52:39.900
You should answer that.

52:39.900 --> 52:41.700
I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to take this, Donovan.

52:41.700 --> 52:42.700
Yeah.

52:42.700 --> 52:43.700
Give me a second.

52:43.740 --> 52:44.740
I'm going to step away.

52:44.740 --> 52:45.740
Okay.

52:45.740 --> 52:46.740
Justin, get the fuck out of here.

52:46.740 --> 52:49.820
Well, you can, I don't, I didn't necessarily mean that.

52:49.820 --> 52:52.260
I kind of meant more from like the group, but.

52:52.260 --> 52:53.260
Just close your ears.

52:53.260 --> 52:54.260
Okay.

52:54.260 --> 52:55.620
You get a text on your burner phone.

52:55.620 --> 52:59.140
Do you remember what you had texted and what was texted back?

52:59.140 --> 53:00.140
I can tell you right now.

53:00.140 --> 53:01.620
If you can tell, I've get some of my notes.

53:01.620 --> 53:07.420
The last two texts sent, you received a text that said the book your parents died for is

53:07.420 --> 53:10.900
still hidden in an undisclosed location.

53:10.900 --> 53:19.660
Then you texted back what book where, and this text says your book, calm, comfy campground.

53:19.660 --> 53:24.460
I want to reply to this one with another, who is this, which I think I've already asked

53:24.460 --> 53:25.900
before, but I'm doing it again.

53:25.900 --> 53:31.780
You then receive a text on Leon's phone that says, fuck.

53:31.780 --> 53:32.780
What did you do?

53:32.780 --> 53:36.620
I replied back, I don't know.

53:36.620 --> 53:37.620
Who is this?

53:37.860 --> 53:43.460
Almost as soon as you send that text, both phones vibrate at the same time and they both

53:43.460 --> 53:45.780
have the exact same response.

53:45.780 --> 53:49.660
There's a single word reply, destiny.

53:49.660 --> 53:51.180
I don't know anybody named destiny.

54:07.620 --> 54:28.900
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
