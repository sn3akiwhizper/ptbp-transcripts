00:00.000 --> 00:03.740
Beep bop, beep boop, beep bop boop.

00:03.740 --> 00:07.100
It's Wolf the Robot here to give y'all the scoop.

00:07.100 --> 00:12.100
PTBP 694.2, y'all know the drill

00:12.580 --> 00:15.780
and y'all definitely know what time it is.

00:15.780 --> 00:19.420
But wait, do y'all actually know what time it is?

00:19.420 --> 00:23.300
Cause I have never once looked at a clock.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.820
I hope we broadcast at a decent time

00:25.820 --> 00:29.180
where people can tune in in mass droves.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.400
Today's Howlin' with Wolf comes from at SexyBaconStrip,

00:33.400 --> 00:37.140
who tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod,

00:37.140 --> 00:40.620
a delicious, smoky, and salty thing to do

00:40.620 --> 00:42.700
if I do say so myself.

00:42.700 --> 00:43.620
They right.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.640
Howdy, Wolf, just a heads up.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.220
Ever since all that weird stuff

00:47.220 --> 00:48.780
started here in contention,

00:48.780 --> 00:52.260
the dumpster behind Al's Tires and Tiger Sanctuary

00:52.260 --> 00:56.600
has turned into some Grade A quality eats.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.960
Much like this podcast, it's got all the goo and slime

00:59.960 --> 01:02.200
in all the right places.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.120
Really though, this podcast has become

01:04.120 --> 01:06.460
one of the main things I look forward to.

01:06.460 --> 01:09.680
It's so great I even got my own slip case for Delta Green

01:09.680 --> 01:12.380
and I can't wait to put my players through hell.

01:12.380 --> 01:15.360
Thank y'all and fuck Jeff Bezos.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.960
Thank you for writing SexyBaconStrip.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.800
I ain't never met a bacon strip

01:19.800 --> 01:22.720
that I didn't find at least somewhat erotic.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.600
I appreciate you saying those positive things,

01:25.600 --> 01:27.860
but the way that none of those positive things

01:27.860 --> 01:29.840
were directed at y'alls truly

01:29.840 --> 01:32.880
specifically has me feeling some kind of way.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.800
Time to hit up Al's Tires and Tiger Sanctuary

01:35.800 --> 01:37.720
for some delicious rubber

01:37.720 --> 01:40.920
and possibly endangered mystery meat.

01:40.920 --> 01:44.680
Remember to tag us in some nice things on the social things

01:44.680 --> 01:47.800
if you want us to probably read a thing that you said.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.100
Spread the love, spread the goo,

01:50.100 --> 01:53.020
and remember to spread the word of wolf too.

01:53.020 --> 01:55.580
Now prepare a warm spot on the floor

01:55.580 --> 01:59.460
to vore even more of this hardcore lore with Gorgolore

01:59.460 --> 02:01.700
and I'll roar and roar for an encore

02:01.700 --> 02:04.140
from the troubadours that I adore.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.140
It's kudzu with no backbone.

02:36.140 --> 02:38.860
In a high school classroom,

02:38.860 --> 02:42.140
the analog clock on the wall said 3.30

02:42.140 --> 02:45.140
and the chalkboard said detention.

02:45.140 --> 02:47.820
Sat at the only occupied desk in the room

02:47.820 --> 02:50.020
was a boy of 13 or 14.

02:50.020 --> 02:54.100
Jeremy Pettymore wore a denim cutoff jacket,

02:54.100 --> 02:57.660
a raggedy thin Western shirt, wrangler jeans,

02:57.660 --> 03:01.700
some punky boots, and a perpetual scowl.

03:01.700 --> 03:02.940
There was a knock on the door

03:02.940 --> 03:06.700
and two more boys of a similar age entered the room.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.100
The first was Ken Krenkelhoff,

03:09.100 --> 03:12.680
wearing a letterman jacket bought for him by his dad.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.180
Ken was tall, fit, had great hair,

03:15.180 --> 03:18.280
and walked with his head held high.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.120
The teacher greeted Ken warmly,

03:20.120 --> 03:23.660
then happily acknowledged the second boy, Ash Hornbeam,

03:23.660 --> 03:26.520
with his black, messy hair, white t-shirt,

03:26.520 --> 03:29.260
cheetah print vest, acid-washed jeans,

03:29.260 --> 03:31.280
and scuffed tennis shoes.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.240
The teacher administering detention

03:33.240 --> 03:36.760
was confident the new arrivals didn't belong,

03:36.760 --> 03:37.920
but Ken said they wanted

03:37.920 --> 03:39.960
to keep their friend Jeremy company.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.320
The teacher was reluctant, but said,

03:41.320 --> 03:44.180
"'These two boys are allowed to do whatever they want.'"

03:44.180 --> 03:47.240
Jeremy said his schoolwork necessitated his friends,

03:47.240 --> 03:50.240
so if he was supposed to get anything done,

03:50.240 --> 03:51.680
he had to go with them.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.600
The teacher was relieved to have an excuse to end detention,

03:54.600 --> 03:57.160
and Jeremy flipped him off on the way out.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.880
The young Pettymore asked the other two

03:58.920 --> 04:01.320
if they were ready for the woods that night,

04:01.320 --> 04:03.440
and Ash opened his jacket

04:03.440 --> 04:06.400
and revealed a bunch of water dynamite.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.920
Ken seemed a bit reluctant, but agreed to go,

04:08.920 --> 04:12.200
since this year was their last hurrah.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.320
Ken would have to meet them in the woods, though,

04:14.320 --> 04:17.940
since his mom would still wanna drive him there herself.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.340
As they walked through the hall,

04:19.340 --> 04:22.080
an upperclassman asked them what they were up to that night.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.740
Jeremy said they were going to the woods,

04:23.740 --> 04:24.580
that's their thing.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.080
Once a year, they go into the woods

04:26.080 --> 04:30.640
to look for some folktale legend called Ol' Madge.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.520
They left Silas Cole K through 12,

04:32.520 --> 04:35.200
slapping the banner sporting their mascot,

04:35.200 --> 04:37.060
a minor, on the way out.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.560
That evening, Ash drove Jeremy to the woods

04:42.560 --> 04:44.020
in his older brother's car.

04:44.020 --> 04:48.720
A 1991 Firebird painted a weird, ugly gold.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.560
They turned onto a dirt road,

04:50.560 --> 04:53.160
and a squirrel ran into the path of the car.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.320
Ash was able to quickly swerve and miss it.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.140
They pulled into the gravel parking lot

04:58.140 --> 05:00.000
for the contention woods,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.300
and there were two cars in the lot already.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.680
One had a boot on the back left wheel,

05:04.680 --> 05:07.840
and the other had a notice taped on the driver's side window

05:07.840 --> 05:10.840
that threatened to boot if it wasn't moved.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.720
There was also a Ford Bronco with a lift kit on it

05:13.720 --> 05:16.840
over next to the small, usually unoccupied,

05:16.840 --> 05:20.480
park ranger shack at the entrance to the woods.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.780
Ash left a note under his windshield wiper

05:23.260 --> 05:26.860
that said, please don't boot my car, signed Ash Hornbeam.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.260
They checked if the two cars were unlocked, both were.

05:29.260 --> 05:31.380
In the first car, there was almost nothing,

05:31.380 --> 05:33.820
as if it had already been cleaned out.

05:33.820 --> 05:36.580
In the second car, there was a bunch of camping equipment

05:36.580 --> 05:38.060
and a title for the vehicle,

05:38.060 --> 05:41.420
which listed a Stuart Feldman as its owner,

05:41.420 --> 05:43.580
registered in the city.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.820
Jeremy found some liquor and a pistol.

05:45.820 --> 05:47.660
Ash grabbed some of the camping equipment

05:47.660 --> 05:51.540
and headed over to the shack where he saw an elderly man

05:51.540 --> 05:54.580
wearing a state issued uniform sitting on a stool,

05:54.580 --> 05:56.860
just waking up as Ash approached.

05:56.860 --> 06:00.060
The boys realized this wasn't the normal forest ranger

06:00.060 --> 06:03.060
of contention, he introduced himself as Woodrow

06:03.060 --> 06:04.980
or Buzz for short.

06:04.980 --> 06:08.060
In addition to the normal ranger paraphernalia,

06:08.060 --> 06:11.520
there was a big thing, a hand sanitizer and a board

06:11.520 --> 06:13.460
behind Buzz covered in pictures

06:13.460 --> 06:15.900
and pieces of paper thumbtack to it.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.720
Buzz took out a Polaroid camera, took their pictures,

06:18.760 --> 06:21.720
took down their information, citing a recent string

06:21.720 --> 06:24.440
of disappearances in the woods as his reason

06:24.440 --> 06:28.320
and placed the pictures and information up onto the board.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.920
Ash asked if they could borrow the first aid kit

06:30.920 --> 06:32.720
and Buzz gave it to them.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.920
Ash shot an M80 into the distance with his slingshot

06:35.920 --> 06:37.840
and Buzz about shat his pants.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.600
So he went to the bathroom and Jeremy seized the opportunity

06:40.600 --> 06:43.520
to grab a fire extinguisher, two machetes,

06:43.520 --> 06:46.160
three flashlights and hand sanitizer

06:46.160 --> 06:48.960
and they shoved it all into their bags.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.920
They looked over the missing persons board,

06:50.920 --> 06:52.840
there were 18 missing people,

06:52.840 --> 06:55.280
several of whom the boys recognized.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.280
They saw Stuart Feldman on the board,

06:57.280 --> 07:00.560
he was an older bald British man in incredible shape

07:00.560 --> 07:02.440
with a thick jawline.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.020
He had claimed to be in the woods on business.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.680
Jeremy also saw the keys to both the Bronco

07:08.680 --> 07:11.260
and the shack itself and snagged them.

07:11.260 --> 07:14.200
Buzz returned and the boys asked if they could take a picture

07:14.200 --> 07:16.080
of the missing persons board so they could have

07:16.960 --> 07:19.560
a reference if they ran into any of the people in the woods.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.880
Buzz agreed and gave them a Polaroid picture

07:21.880 --> 07:24.480
of the board of Polaroid pictures, woof.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.280
The two boys gathered their things and headed off

07:27.280 --> 07:30.520
to their usual camping spot on foot.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.920
As they hiked, Jeremy noticed tracks.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.640
It looked like a car and a smaller vehicle,

07:35.640 --> 07:38.840
like a four-wheeler had driven down the trail.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.160
When they arrived at their spot,

07:40.160 --> 07:43.680
there was unusually no firewood waiting for them.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.680
Ash went to chop at a big log

07:46.160 --> 07:47.160
and Jeremy started looking around,

07:47.160 --> 07:50.160
frustrated at the lack of logs.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.960
Ash heard a rustling nearby and saw a man's head pop up

07:53.960 --> 07:56.000
from behind some bushes.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.320
The man made dead eye contact with Ash

07:58.320 --> 08:01.000
and popped back down into the thicket.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.080
Ken Krinklehoff's mom, Krista Krinklehoff,

08:05.080 --> 08:06.720
drove him to the woods in her minivan

08:06.720 --> 08:08.640
and explained she didn't like the tradition

08:08.640 --> 08:10.800
he and his friends had of going to the woods once a year

08:10.800 --> 08:12.120
for their silly game.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.200
Ken said not to worry,

08:13.240 --> 08:15.960
but a baby fox jumped out trying to cross the road.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.920
Ken's mom hid it and crushed the fox without remorse.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.320
They pulled into the parking lot

08:21.320 --> 08:23.760
and saw the same cars Ash and Jeremy saw

08:23.760 --> 08:26.520
plus the 91 Firebird Ash had borrowed.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.400
Ken's mom mentioned how multiple people

08:28.400 --> 08:30.840
who had gone into the woods recently were missing

08:30.840 --> 08:32.440
and she especially wasn't happy

08:32.440 --> 08:35.640
he was going into the woods with Ash and Jeremy.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.560
Ken grabbed his gear, said goodbye,

08:37.560 --> 08:39.280
and headed to the ranger shack.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.640
Buzz introduced himself, took Ken's picture,

08:41.640 --> 08:45.040
asked for his information, and posted it on the board.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.440
After talking about the missing people for a few minutes,

08:47.440 --> 08:49.560
Ken headed off into the woods.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.920
A group of three high school girls

08:52.920 --> 08:56.040
walked into the contention public library.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.840
Judy Krinklehoff, a senior at Silas Cole,

08:58.840 --> 09:01.280
and the older sister of Ken Krinklehoff

09:01.280 --> 09:04.440
still wore the same clothes she bought for freshman year.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.920
She was very anxious, never said the right thing,

09:06.920 --> 09:08.800
and wanted to be in a relationship

09:08.800 --> 09:10.680
with the coolest girl at school,

09:10.680 --> 09:15.440
a rebel who bullied Judy named Elizabeth Liz Lonklin.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.240
Liz wore a leather jacket and Doc Martens,

09:18.240 --> 09:19.640
she smoked cigarettes,

09:19.640 --> 09:22.920
and she was a self-described bitch.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.960
The final girl, Sharon Shadow Berryman,

09:25.960 --> 09:28.120
formerly a popular cheerleader,

09:28.120 --> 09:31.160
was now obsessed with going to graveyards,

09:31.160 --> 09:33.040
funerals, and hospitals

09:33.040 --> 09:37.280
to engage with all forms and stages of death.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.000
Shadow asked Steven Page for the location

09:40.040 --> 09:42.240
of occult books related to voodoo,

09:42.240 --> 09:44.360
and he led them to a small room in the back

09:44.360 --> 09:47.040
with a small sign that read occult.

09:47.040 --> 09:50.040
Inside, they found a book titled Voodoo.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.520
Shadow said they would find what they were looking for

09:52.520 --> 09:57.520
on page 419, and Liz revealed she wanted to torture

09:58.160 --> 10:01.960
someone named Brittany for sleeping with her boyfriend,

10:01.960 --> 10:05.280
all while Judy went on about how beautiful Liz was.

10:05.280 --> 10:09.140
Page 419 described a ritual that must be performed

10:09.140 --> 10:12.380
while surrounded by trees at night.

10:12.380 --> 10:15.660
There were a few ingredients necessary for performing it.

10:15.660 --> 10:17.740
The left pinky toe of a dead squirrel,

10:17.740 --> 10:19.020
dirt scraped from the earth

10:19.020 --> 10:22.100
after it had been stepped on by a menstruating calf,

10:22.100 --> 10:24.660
the blood from a former cheerleader gone goth

10:24.660 --> 10:29.060
who goes to Silas Colquet through 12, and bird pee.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.780
Smash cut to the group leaving the library with the book.

10:31.780 --> 10:33.920
Smash cut to them on the side of the road,

10:33.920 --> 10:36.660
bent over a dead squirrel cutting off its pinky toe.

10:36.660 --> 10:38.420
Smash cut to them in a field,

10:38.420 --> 10:41.460
scooping up dirt under a cow bleeding from its lady butt.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.820
Smash cut to them standing in a parking lot

10:43.820 --> 10:46.220
waiting for a bird to pee slash poo on them.

10:46.220 --> 10:48.740
Smash cut to Shadow scratching herself

10:48.740 --> 10:50.100
with the dead squirrel toe

10:50.100 --> 10:52.340
and dripping her blood into a vial.

10:52.340 --> 10:55.220
Smash cut to two days ago when Shadow told Liz

10:55.220 --> 10:57.180
her boyfriend was cheating on her with Brittany

10:57.180 --> 10:59.060
from Spinkbonk High in the city,

10:59.060 --> 11:01.060
and Shadow and Judy agreed to help Liz

11:01.060 --> 11:02.440
get back at her boyfriend.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.700
Smash cut back to the present,

11:04.700 --> 11:07.020
and the girls were on their way to the woods

11:07.020 --> 11:10.140
with all the necessary ingredients.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.940
Shadow turned onto a gravel road

11:11.940 --> 11:14.020
and a possum walked out in front of the car.

11:14.020 --> 11:18.060
Shadow drove straight for it and crushed it under the car.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.420
She was happy for the possum

11:19.420 --> 11:21.460
since it was in a different place now,

11:21.460 --> 11:24.780
but Judy worried it wasn't going to heaven.

11:24.780 --> 11:26.480
They buried the possum real quick

11:26.480 --> 11:29.180
and then arrived at the contention woods parking lot.

11:29.180 --> 11:31.460
Already in the parking lot were five cars,

11:31.460 --> 11:35.420
the four we expected, plus Krista Krinklehoff's minivan.

11:35.420 --> 11:36.580
Judy freaked out a little

11:36.580 --> 11:38.140
because she saw her mom's minivan

11:38.140 --> 11:40.680
and she was out past her curfew.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.700
Liz and Shadow promised to shove Judy into a ditch

11:43.700 --> 11:45.320
if they saw Krista Krinklehoff,

11:45.320 --> 11:48.380
which assuaged Judy's worries.

11:48.380 --> 11:51.780
An old man wearing a state forest ranger uniform

11:51.780 --> 11:53.580
jumped out and scared the girls.

11:53.580 --> 11:57.180
He introduced himself as Woodrow or Buzz for short

11:57.180 --> 12:00.180
and asked them to fill out some forms in the shack.

12:00.180 --> 12:05.180
Shadow whispered to the rest to not use their real names.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.180
Ash Hornbeam walked over to investigate the bush

12:08.180 --> 12:11.420
after seeing the man's face disappear back behind it,

12:11.420 --> 12:13.140
his ax in hand.

12:13.140 --> 12:15.320
He heard rustling and a chattering sound,

12:15.320 --> 12:17.500
so he ran back to find Jeremy Pettymore,

12:17.500 --> 12:19.140
who was standing at their campsite,

12:19.140 --> 12:22.260
still frustrated at the lack of pre-prepared firewood.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.660
Ash sprinted back and squawked about a man in a bush

12:24.660 --> 12:26.980
by a log making animal noises.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.040
Jeremy readied the gun he found

12:29.040 --> 12:31.180
and Ash led him to the bush.

12:31.180 --> 12:32.900
It was still rustling with movement

12:32.940 --> 12:35.920
and the animal-like noises were still audible.

12:37.180 --> 12:40.980
Ash picked up a long stick and poked at the bush.

12:40.980 --> 12:43.780
Stepping back from the bush was a naked human man

12:43.780 --> 12:45.460
covered in scratches and cuts,

12:45.460 --> 12:47.180
some of which were still bleeding.

12:47.180 --> 12:51.380
He looked at the boys with huge eyes and froze.

12:51.380 --> 12:53.740
Jeremy took out the Polaroid of the Polaroids.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.460
They could tell this was one of the people

12:55.460 --> 12:56.580
who'd gone missing,

12:56.580 --> 12:58.920
though they couldn't quite read his name.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.000
The boys called out to him,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.280
suggested he put on pants and offered to help

13:02.520 --> 13:03.680
with a first aid kit.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.800
The man scampered up to them hastily.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.580
Jeremy pointed the gun at him to no effect.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.520
The man pushed his fingers together,

13:10.520 --> 13:13.840
made sad puppy dog eyes and mewled.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.500
Ash and Jeremy discussed what to do with the animal man

13:16.500 --> 13:19.880
as he sniffed the air and headed to their campsite.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.580
The boys tried to Red Rover him,

13:21.580 --> 13:24.080
but the situation finally sunk into Ash.

13:24.080 --> 13:27.060
He freaked out, backed away and tripped backwards on a log.

13:27.060 --> 13:29.620
Jeremy tried to stop the man alone but wasn't able to.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.760
Both boys had the realization though

13:32.080 --> 13:35.640
that this man did not act or run like a normal human man.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.840
He was too fast.

13:36.840 --> 13:41.360
He was crouched and he used his front legs or arms

13:41.360 --> 13:44.440
to aid his movement toward their campsite.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.980
The boys ran back to their spot,

13:45.980 --> 13:47.760
still holding their weapons.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.600
When they returned,

13:48.600 --> 13:51.240
they saw the man hunched over their bag with food,

13:51.240 --> 13:53.600
going to town on the snacks they brought.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.160
Jeremy cried out for his little Smokies.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.000
After a small tussle between the boys and the naked man,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.120
Ash kicked away the can of Smokies,

14:01.120 --> 14:03.560
kneed him in the face and full nelsoned him

14:03.560 --> 14:06.280
down into the mud, immobilizing him.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.800
Jeremy took a rope, tied him to a tree

14:08.800 --> 14:12.480
and tried to calm him down with more Smokies.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.320
Ash used some hand sanitizer

14:14.320 --> 14:17.600
and headed back down the trail to get buzz.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.500
As Ash headed back to the shack,

14:19.500 --> 14:21.760
the trees around him began to warp.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.300
The trail became nearly non-existent

14:24.300 --> 14:26.800
and he was suddenly looking at a thicket of woods

14:26.800 --> 14:29.240
instead of the trail in front of him.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.040
The sun was going down

14:31.920 --> 14:33.220
and Ash was all by himself

14:33.220 --> 14:36.600
and he had no fucking clue where he was.

14:38.140 --> 14:39.920
Ken Krenkelhoff walked down the trail

14:39.920 --> 14:41.680
and made it to the usual campsite.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.440
When he arrived, he saw Jeremy waving little Smokies

14:44.440 --> 14:47.480
in front of the face of a naked, bloody man

14:47.480 --> 14:48.760
tied up to a tree.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.520
Ken shouted as he entered the clearing,

14:50.520 --> 14:52.780
startling Jeremy Pettymore.

14:52.780 --> 14:54.600
Ken asked if the man could hear him

14:54.600 --> 14:55.560
and if he was all right

14:55.560 --> 14:58.040
and the man made some more chattering noises.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.080
Jeremy indicated this was one of the people

15:00.120 --> 15:01.880
who had gone missing in the woods.

15:01.880 --> 15:05.440
Ash was on his way back to the ranger station to get buzz.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.540
In the meantime, Jeremy was trying to tame the animal man

15:08.540 --> 15:10.680
with tiny meat fellows.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.560
Ken realized that if Ash was going from the campsite

15:13.560 --> 15:18.120
to the ranger shack, they should have crossed paths,

15:18.120 --> 15:20.040
but they didn't.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.960
Ken called out for Ash but stopped

15:21.960 --> 15:25.360
when he looked back at the man and no longer saw humanity.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.140
Only animalistic intent behind the eyes

15:28.140 --> 15:31.500
of this bloody, muddy, tied up naked human body.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.300
Ken freaked out and backed away,

15:33.300 --> 15:35.260
claiming the man wasn't a person.

15:35.260 --> 15:38.460
Jeremy tried to convince him the man was still a man,

15:38.460 --> 15:40.180
but Ken wasn't convinced.

15:40.180 --> 15:43.340
He went back to calling out for Ash's panic rising.

15:43.340 --> 15:45.900
Jeremy wasn't sure why Ken was scared of this man,

15:45.900 --> 15:48.120
whom he had named Rusty.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.860
Shadow, Liz, and Judy were in the contention woods

15:52.860 --> 15:54.780
parking lot talking to Buzz.

15:54.780 --> 15:56.360
Judy worried about her mom

15:56.360 --> 15:58.740
and wondered if she'd also gone missing.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.240
Shadow and Liz calmed her down by suggesting

16:01.240 --> 16:03.200
that perhaps Chris's car was stolen

16:03.200 --> 16:06.600
and so it wasn't actually her that drove it to the woods.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.160
Now back in the shack, Buzz asked the young ladies

16:09.160 --> 16:11.160
to come over and take care of business

16:11.160 --> 16:12.560
so they can be on their way.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.620
They wondered if they should trust the man,

16:14.620 --> 16:17.020
but decided to have their pictures taken anyway.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.160
Glancing around the shack,

16:18.160 --> 16:19.920
they saw various ranger equipment

16:19.920 --> 16:21.720
and the bulletin board of missing people,

16:21.720 --> 16:25.600
as well as a massive jug of hand sanitizer on the windowsill.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.840
Judy furiously pumped hand sanitizer into her hand,

16:28.840 --> 16:32.320
so much so that it overflowed onto the floor.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.520
Liz looked at Judy appalled

16:34.520 --> 16:36.520
and asked Buzz if they could have a machete

16:36.520 --> 16:39.240
to protect themselves from something killing people,

16:39.240 --> 16:41.040
like maybe Judy's mom.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.880
Judy freaked out and started licking the hand sanitizer

16:43.880 --> 16:44.880
from her hands.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.720
Buzz offered the hand sanitizer to the other two girls.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.160
Shadow refused, but Liz put her hand out

16:50.160 --> 16:52.840
and as Buzz started to pump out the hand sanitizer,

16:52.840 --> 16:54.260
she tried to pull her hand away,

16:54.260 --> 16:56.060
but plenty still landed on her,

16:56.060 --> 16:58.420
so she unhappily rubbed it in.

16:58.420 --> 17:01.120
As Buzz pinned all their information and pictures

17:01.120 --> 17:03.200
on the not missing side of the board,

17:03.200 --> 17:06.220
the girls noticed a slight trickle of blood

17:06.220 --> 17:10.340
going down the back of his neck, staining his uniform.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.740
Ash looked around at the ever darkening tree

17:16.740 --> 17:20.940
surrounding him as the sun went down.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.500
He heard a noise and saw a tree

17:23.500 --> 17:26.860
emitting a bright light from a hollow point.

17:26.860 --> 17:28.500
He looked around suspiciously,

17:28.500 --> 17:30.860
saw a trip wire between him and the tree

17:30.860 --> 17:32.780
and carefully avoided it

17:32.780 --> 17:35.880
as he walked up to the light emanating knot.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.360
It was so bright, Ash couldn't see what was inside,

17:38.360 --> 17:41.020
but he knew something was deep in there.

17:41.020 --> 17:44.340
Ash pushed his arm into the arm shaped hole

17:44.340 --> 17:48.720
up to his elbow, felt around, found nothing,

17:48.720 --> 17:52.060
pushed in deeper and when he attempted to pull his arm out,

17:52.100 --> 17:55.200
he felt a great pain on his skin,

17:55.200 --> 17:57.860
like he was noodling a razor sharp catfish

17:57.860 --> 18:00.500
all the way from elbow to fingertip.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.460
Ash pulled out about a centimeter

18:02.460 --> 18:07.000
and the bit of arm revealed only raw muscle and tendons.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.220
It lacked skin completely.

18:10.220 --> 18:11.760
He realized he was trapped

18:11.760 --> 18:14.480
and for the first time in his life,

18:14.480 --> 18:17.980
Ash Hornbeam had no idea what to do.

18:18.980 --> 18:22.340
Shadow told Buzz he was bleeding from his head.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.740
She offered to trade her first aid kit for his machete

18:24.740 --> 18:26.420
and he gladly accepted.

18:26.420 --> 18:28.680
She grabbed the kit in a vial and patched him up

18:28.680 --> 18:31.740
while discreetly taking a sample of his blood.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.760
The group then took stock of their possessions

18:33.760 --> 18:36.020
and headed to their designated camping spot

18:36.020 --> 18:38.020
to perform the ritual.

18:38.020 --> 18:39.740
Upon arrival, there were no rocks

18:39.740 --> 18:41.380
around the designated fire pit

18:41.380 --> 18:43.380
in order to keep the fire contained.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.620
This was very concerning to Judy.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.900
Liz went to find some rocks

18:46.900 --> 18:50.540
and Shadow swayed in the wind to attune with nature.

18:50.540 --> 18:52.180
Judy, worried about her mom

18:52.180 --> 18:54.740
and the pond water she just used to brush her teeth,

18:54.740 --> 18:56.460
suffered a bout of insanity.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.220
She saw reality warp.

18:58.220 --> 19:02.560
Shadow blended into the trees and the ground became the sky.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.240
Judy promptly ran into the woods in her footy pajamas.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.300
Shadow sighed and followed with her machete,

19:09.300 --> 19:11.500
leaping and dancing as she went.

19:12.940 --> 19:15.180
Liz's reality glitched

19:15.180 --> 19:17.140
and she suddenly found herself lost

19:17.140 --> 19:19.760
in an unrecognizable part of the woods.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.300
Behind some rocks, she saw a fit looking bald man

19:22.300 --> 19:25.540
in his forties walking in circles, waving his hands

19:25.540 --> 19:27.060
and talking to himself.

19:27.060 --> 19:30.900
All on the other side of a thick line of white powder.

19:30.900 --> 19:35.700
A branch like sigil was carved into every tree in sight.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.780
Liz tried to get away quietly, but she stepped on a stick

19:38.780 --> 19:40.980
and he beckoned her over to his little camp

19:40.980 --> 19:42.900
with some semi-intelligible,

19:42.900 --> 19:45.780
mostly English accented instructions.

19:45.780 --> 19:48.660
She went over partly because she found him attractive.

19:48.660 --> 19:52.320
He was concerned about two things, the sky turning

19:52.320 --> 19:56.220
and keeping the lady in the wood away.

19:56.220 --> 20:00.100
A tattoo of a stylized H was slightly hidden

20:00.100 --> 20:01.700
on the back of his neck.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.180
After a little more discussion,

20:03.180 --> 20:05.540
Liz decided she was too worried by the situation

20:05.540 --> 20:06.820
and didn't trust him.

20:06.820 --> 20:08.740
She ran away as he shouted,

20:08.740 --> 20:11.680
she was definitely going to get go.

20:12.660 --> 20:17.620
Lost in the woods, Liz Lonklin stumbled upon Ash Hornbeam

20:17.620 --> 20:21.740
stuck in a tree with tears streaming down his face.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.460
They were understandably surprised to see each other.

20:24.460 --> 20:27.140
Ash warned her about the trip wire just in time,

20:27.140 --> 20:29.500
but the helpless situation caused him to lose it

20:29.500 --> 20:32.360
and pull his arm out a little bit more.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.020
The loss of skin was staggering.

20:35.020 --> 20:36.820
He threw up at a sheer panic.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.660
Liz dipped out, shouting for help.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.340
She was leaving Ash alone with the tree once again,

20:41.340 --> 20:45.580
staring at his lacerated, dripping arm.

20:45.580 --> 20:47.700
Judy ran haphazardly through the woods,

20:47.700 --> 20:49.860
but thankfully stopped just before

20:49.860 --> 20:52.700
a suspicious looking pile of leaves.

20:52.700 --> 20:56.260
Shadow almost danced directly into the dubious detritus,

20:56.260 --> 20:57.780
but Judy pulled her out of the way,

20:57.780 --> 21:01.460
revealing the 10 foot deep pit underneath the leaf pile.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.060
Shaken, but not yet broken,

21:03.060 --> 21:04.940
the two headed back to their campsite.

21:04.940 --> 21:07.220
They didn't see Liz, but they did see a raccoon

21:07.220 --> 21:10.460
sitting there eating just like a person would.

21:10.460 --> 21:13.220
The little trash panda indicated that hand sanitizer

21:13.220 --> 21:15.920
should not be used, might be deadly.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.860
Judy looked into the raccoon's eyes,

21:17.860 --> 21:21.220
saw the soul of a human and decided to trust it.

21:21.220 --> 21:24.120
Shadow tottered along with T-Rex arms,

21:24.120 --> 21:27.620
imitating the raccoon as the trio headed back

21:27.620 --> 21:29.860
to the entrance of the woods.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.780
After searching through the woods

21:32.780 --> 21:36.500
in the dwindling twilight, Liz finally found the trail

21:36.500 --> 21:38.820
along with Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krinkelhoff

21:38.820 --> 21:40.060
at their campsite.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.620
She saw them talking to a feral man,

21:42.620 --> 21:44.420
feeding him little winkies.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.660
She told them Ash was in trouble with a tree

21:46.660 --> 21:49.180
while Jeremy fed Rusty more smokes.

21:49.180 --> 21:51.540
They debated whether or not to take Rusty along

21:51.540 --> 21:52.380
for the search.

21:52.380 --> 21:56.960
Ken finally agreed to it and Liz Lonklin led the party.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.560
Shadow, Judy and the raccoon made their way

21:59.560 --> 22:01.620
back to the parking lot and were confronted

22:01.620 --> 22:04.960
by Judy's mom's voice coming out of the shack.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.040
Judy instinctively ran to get more hand sanitizer

22:08.040 --> 22:10.080
from her mom and succeeded in doing so

22:10.080 --> 22:13.340
despite the raccoon physically trying to stop her.

22:13.340 --> 22:15.480
Krista told the girls that Buzz had asked her

22:15.480 --> 22:19.360
to watch the shack while he went to investigate an argument.

22:19.360 --> 22:22.320
The raccoon indicated they should get the fuck out of Dodge

22:22.320 --> 22:24.720
but Shadow wanted to go back and get Liz.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.840
She persuaded Krista to help her find Liz.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.320
Judy could stay in the shack with the raccoon.

22:30.320 --> 22:33.600
When Shadow and Krista skipped into the forest together,

22:33.600 --> 22:35.480
Judy hit the restroom.

22:35.480 --> 22:40.480
There she saw the limp, neatly folded body

22:40.760 --> 22:44.040
of Ranger Buzz on the floor.

22:45.920 --> 22:50.160
Ken Krinklehoff, Jeremy Pettymore, Liz Lonklin and Rusty

22:50.160 --> 22:52.980
walked through the woods looking for Ash Hornbeam

22:52.980 --> 22:55.520
whose arm was stuck in a tree.

22:55.520 --> 22:59.800
The sun had now gone down and they were in total darkness.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.880
Too far off the trail, the group began to realize

23:02.880 --> 23:04.960
none of them knew where they were.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.780
They walked deeper into the woods

23:06.780 --> 23:09.600
and eventually saw through the moonlight

23:09.600 --> 23:13.000
a picture frame hanging on a tree.

23:14.320 --> 23:18.400
Flashback to Ken Krinklehoff a couple years ago.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.160
He and his friends were out in the woods

23:20.160 --> 23:23.320
on their annual outing to look for Ol' Madge.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.100
He popped away to pee behind a tree

23:25.100 --> 23:27.520
and as he looked up from his stream of urine,

23:27.520 --> 23:30.880
he saw a frame like of a painting

23:30.920 --> 23:33.000
hanging there in the woods.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.620
It looked like nothing was in the frame.

23:35.620 --> 23:38.680
Ken approached and noticed that somewhere along

23:38.680 --> 23:42.220
the edge of this frame, something didn't line up

23:42.220 --> 23:45.680
as if what was behind the frame wasn't the same

23:45.680 --> 23:47.880
as what he could see through it.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.560
He strafed to the side to get a better look

23:49.560 --> 23:52.320
and saw that beyond the frame was a cabin.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.640
Ken walked up to this frame to put his hand through it

23:55.640 --> 23:58.200
but at the last second noticed a trip wire

23:58.200 --> 24:00.160
he was about to step on.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.240
Ken jumped back, grabbed a rock

24:02.240 --> 24:03.960
and threw it at the trip wire.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.400
A giant wooden spear came flying through the canvas

24:07.400 --> 24:10.720
of the painting and stabbed directly into a tree

24:10.720 --> 24:12.440
just missing Ken.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.800
He rushed back to the camp while convincing himself

24:15.800 --> 24:17.320
it wasn't real.

24:17.320 --> 24:20.880
Flashback forward to Jeremy, Liz, Ken and Rusty

24:20.880 --> 24:23.600
standing in the clearing looking at the weird frame.

24:23.600 --> 24:27.280
Ken yelled out for everyone to stop and not go any closer.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.360
He pointed at the ground and next to the frame

24:30.360 --> 24:31.880
there was a trip wire.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.240
He tossed a small log onto the trip wire

24:34.240 --> 24:36.720
and a massive spear shot through the frame

24:36.720 --> 24:39.400
directly into a nearby tree.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.680
Ken shared his memory with the rest of the party

24:41.680 --> 24:44.400
and as they all looked at this frame

24:44.400 --> 24:46.480
they could see a cabin in the woods

24:46.480 --> 24:48.300
through the spear made hole.

24:48.300 --> 24:52.120
Ken snapped, grabbed the spear and raced toward the cabin.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.760
As Jeremy yelled at him to stop,

24:53.760 --> 24:56.960
Ken stepped on a pile of leaves covering a hole

24:57.520 --> 24:59.480
and disappeared into the ground.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.400
Ash Hornbeam stood in the woods terrified.

25:04.400 --> 25:08.240
His arm stuck halfway into the hollow of a tree.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.520
Part of his arm that he could see had been stripped

25:10.520 --> 25:13.160
of every layer of flesh.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.440
The sun finished going down and Ash stood alone

25:16.440 --> 25:18.320
in the moonlight.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.600
He heard the snap of a branch nearby

25:20.600 --> 25:23.180
and out of the trees approached a man

25:23.180 --> 25:26.360
in a black suit, white shirt and bolo tie.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.400
He was a fit man in his late 20s or early 30s

25:29.400 --> 25:31.920
with a glorious mustache and pants

25:31.920 --> 25:33.840
that were a bit too tight.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.720
He flashed an FBI badge and introduced himself

25:36.720 --> 25:38.360
as Agent Kevin.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.760
He asked Ash why he was out in the woods.

25:40.760 --> 25:42.880
Ash said he and some friends come out to the woods

25:42.880 --> 25:45.140
every year to camp and look for old Madge,

25:45.140 --> 25:47.800
a woman in the woods from local legend.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.640
Kevin cursed, thanked him and with a trembling hand

25:51.640 --> 25:54.940
pressed a gun to the back of Ash's head.

25:54.940 --> 25:57.860
Acting on pure instinct, Ash reached into his pocket,

25:57.860 --> 26:00.460
pulled out a lighter and some firecrackers,

26:00.460 --> 26:04.740
lit them with one hand and held them against Kevin's head.

26:04.740 --> 26:06.800
Kevin lowered his gun, grabbed the fireworks

26:06.800 --> 26:08.540
and threw them away.

26:08.540 --> 26:12.340
On closer inspection, Kevin recognized Ash as a local kid

26:12.340 --> 26:14.100
who was celebrated in the community

26:14.100 --> 26:17.380
after he defended his home from a couple burglars.

26:17.380 --> 26:18.860
Flashback!

26:18.860 --> 26:22.000
To a younger Ash Hornbeam sitting on his front porch

26:22.000 --> 26:23.800
wrapped in a crisis blanket,

26:23.800 --> 26:26.880
talking to a contention police officer.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.520
Ash had heard noises in his basement

26:29.520 --> 26:31.700
and it sounded like two men's voices,

26:31.700 --> 26:35.320
one tall and skinny, the other short and fat.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.440
Ash thought they were after his dad's coin collection.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.560
Flashback!

26:39.560 --> 26:44.380
To a few hours before this to Ash home alone watching TV.

26:44.380 --> 26:46.900
On the screen is a commercial for a CD player

26:46.900 --> 26:49.840
Ash desperately wanted but couldn't afford.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.760
So he hatched a plan to steal

26:51.760 --> 26:54.880
some of his dad's rare coin collection.

26:54.880 --> 26:58.100
He tried typing in birthdays into the lock box

26:58.100 --> 27:01.920
that contained the coins and his birthday worked.

27:01.920 --> 27:06.360
Ash took a handful, roughly $600 worth of coins.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.720
Flashback forward!

27:07.720 --> 27:11.080
To the officer asking Ash about the paint cans

27:11.080 --> 27:13.000
hanging from strings.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.260
Ash said he set up traps and tripwires

27:15.260 --> 27:18.880
and told an epic story of utilizing these common objects

27:18.880 --> 27:22.240
to hassle the robbers until they gave up and left.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.080
Flash a bit more forward!

27:24.080 --> 27:27.800
To Ash carrying his new CD player with him

27:27.800 --> 27:29.760
everywhere he went.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.720
Flash fully back forward!

27:31.720 --> 27:36.080
To Kevin returning to the trapped Ash

27:36.080 --> 27:38.640
along with a woman wearing a black suit,

27:38.640 --> 27:41.040
white shirt and a black tie.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.440
She held a machete and she chanted

27:43.440 --> 27:46.600
while she rubbed a hand on the blade.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.580
The woman smiled a cold, vacant smile

27:49.580 --> 27:53.500
behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes.

27:53.500 --> 27:57.400
Agent Kevin introduced her as Agent Karen

27:57.400 --> 28:00.440
and she immediately lifted the machete above her head

28:00.440 --> 28:03.440
and brought it down through Ash's elbow.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.840
Out of shock, Ash stepped back, looked down

28:05.840 --> 28:09.000
and saw his arm had been cut off.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.040
The end of it was completely cauterized

28:12.040 --> 28:15.400
and the skin around the stump began to grow back

28:15.400 --> 28:17.040
as he watched.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.840
Agent Karen said nothing, just smiled,

28:19.840 --> 28:22.520
turned around and walked away.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.360
Agent Kevin put his arm around Ash

28:24.360 --> 28:28.540
and led him to a black sedan sitting next to a four wheeler

28:28.540 --> 28:31.000
in the middle of the woods.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.760
Through some brush and trees, they could see a cabin.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.080
Shadow and Krista Krinklehoff walked down the trail

28:41.080 --> 28:44.380
and Shadow sang a song about death.

28:44.380 --> 28:47.260
The sun finished setting and they continued to walk

28:47.260 --> 28:49.420
lit only by a flashlight.

28:49.420 --> 28:52.420
Krista said she saw Liz and shot off with the flashlight

28:52.420 --> 28:56.260
into the woods followed by a giggling Shadow.

28:56.260 --> 28:59.360
But then Shadow watched the flashlight go completely dark

28:59.360 --> 29:01.940
and felt a rope tighten around her ankle.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.320
She was hoisted into the air upside down

29:04.320 --> 29:05.960
hanging by one foot.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.700
Krista turned on the flashlight under her chin

29:09.700 --> 29:13.280
like it was spooky story time.

29:13.280 --> 29:18.280
She said, my darling, it is certifiably unfortunate

29:19.800 --> 29:22.520
that your demise is seemingly necessary

29:22.520 --> 29:25.600
despite my finding your demeanor so appropriate

29:25.600 --> 29:26.840
for your kind.

29:28.240 --> 29:32.640
From your personal hymns, I can assume and do hope

29:32.640 --> 29:35.980
that a lack of existence is your preference?

29:36.920 --> 29:40.720
Shadow whispered to herself, finally.

29:41.720 --> 29:46.720
And she watched a long silver tendril grow from the back

29:47.200 --> 29:50.880
of Krista Krinklehoff's neck and then another

29:50.880 --> 29:53.280
and another and another.

29:53.280 --> 29:56.920
The limbs extended towards Shadow's pinoted body

29:56.920 --> 30:01.200
and the camera panned down to show the long shadows

30:01.200 --> 30:03.760
play out the grizzly scene.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.840
One of the shiny tentacles sliced into the soft tissue

30:07.880 --> 30:09.240
on the back of her neck.

30:09.240 --> 30:12.920
Another snapped her head forward and a third reached in

30:12.920 --> 30:17.360
and gripped her spinal cord and ripped it out of her body

30:17.360 --> 30:22.180
delivering Shadow to her finish line, her goal,

30:22.180 --> 30:27.180
her lack of a destination and finally she felt nothing.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.520
The sun had set and as it began to rain outside

30:32.520 --> 30:35.920
Judy Krinklehoff stood at the doorway to the bathroom

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
and stared at the lifeless folded crumpled body of Buzz.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.720
She could tell by looking around there'd been a tussle

30:44.720 --> 30:48.080
and she found a stick of her mom's favorite brand

30:48.080 --> 30:50.920
of chapstick behind the toilet.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.280
The raccoons stood in the doorway motioning

30:53.280 --> 30:55.160
to get the fuck out of there.

30:55.160 --> 30:58.880
Judy followed the raccoon into the rain into the darkness

30:58.880 --> 31:02.100
and a lightning bolt flashed in the distance.

31:02.100 --> 31:07.100
It was just bright enough to illuminate a blood covered

31:07.620 --> 31:12.620
Krista Krinklehoff walking directly toward her.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.420
The raccoon at Judy's side shivered

31:15.420 --> 31:18.300
and tried to communicate tugging at Judy's arm

31:18.300 --> 31:22.940
but eventually ran away when Judy went to help her mother.

31:22.940 --> 31:25.480
Judy guided her back to the shack to clean up

31:25.480 --> 31:29.260
her blood drenched mother but when she closed the door

31:29.260 --> 31:32.380
Judy felt a pinch on the back of her neck.

31:32.380 --> 31:37.060
She turned and saw her mom's body had crumpled to the ground

31:37.060 --> 31:40.500
and standing in front of her was a small one inch

31:40.500 --> 31:44.460
silver sphere with metallic arms grounding itself

31:44.460 --> 31:47.060
in the walls and ceiling of the shack.

31:47.060 --> 31:50.900
Shiny tendrils reached out, snapped Judy's neck forward

31:50.900 --> 31:54.320
and ripped out her spine shoving itself

31:54.320 --> 31:57.140
into her spinal column.

31:57.140 --> 32:01.720
Judy Krinklehoff was no longer Judy Krinklehoff.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.960
She was an objective based entity

32:04.960 --> 32:08.400
and its current objective was to collect

32:08.400 --> 32:11.540
as many bodies as possible.

32:12.460 --> 32:15.660
After falling into the hidden hole under the pile of leaves

32:15.660 --> 32:20.100
Ken Krinklehoff slid on his back down an earthy viscous slide

32:20.100 --> 32:23.180
for some time until he finally landed in a pit

32:23.180 --> 32:25.980
of cold dirt and perfect darkness.

32:25.980 --> 32:29.220
He was in a small crawl space with what looked like

32:29.220 --> 32:32.860
floor supports though they were translucent tubes

32:32.860 --> 32:36.500
filled with a squamous black ooze that traveled down

32:36.500 --> 32:40.140
from the cabin into the ground below.

32:40.140 --> 32:43.460
Ken also saw a door above him and he cautiously listened

32:43.460 --> 32:45.800
for any sound on the other side.

32:46.660 --> 32:50.060
Ash Hornbeam followed agents Kevin and Karen

32:50.060 --> 32:53.580
to the black sedan and four wheeler hidden in the brush.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.580
There was another agent in the backseat wearing

32:56.020 --> 32:57.580
the same black suit with a white shirt.

32:57.580 --> 33:01.660
The man in his early 30s had buzzed blonde hair

33:01.660 --> 33:04.820
and introduced himself as Agent Kyle.

33:04.820 --> 33:07.700
As Ash looked out ahead of him he saw the cabin

33:07.700 --> 33:09.380
in a small clearing.

33:09.380 --> 33:12.020
Next to the cabin sat a small shipping container

33:12.020 --> 33:14.460
and a large yellow excavator.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.140
A moat surrounded the clearing.

33:17.140 --> 33:19.680
Ash saw movement just outside the moat.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.980
Liz, Jeremy and Ken stopped to talk.

33:22.980 --> 33:25.380
Ken picked up a small log, threw it

33:26.220 --> 33:28.460
and a long wooden spear flew in their direction

33:28.460 --> 33:29.580
and hit a tree.

33:29.580 --> 33:32.300
Ken grabbed the spear, took off running, fell into the

33:32.300 --> 33:34.600
ground and disappeared.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.560
Kevin turned back to Ash and broke his mind

33:37.560 --> 33:39.760
with two sentences.

33:39.760 --> 33:43.340
The woods are full of traps and Ol' Madge,

33:43.340 --> 33:48.000
the local legend the boys searched for annually was real.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.940
Ash couldn't handle it, something snapped,

33:49.940 --> 33:52.520
he bailed out of the car, ran and disappeared

33:52.520 --> 33:53.540
into the night.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.480
Jeremy and Liz stood in the dark of the woods

33:57.480 --> 34:00.620
when they saw Ken disappear into the ground

34:00.620 --> 34:02.100
and it began to rain.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.600
They looked forward, the cabin lights turned on

34:04.600 --> 34:07.620
and they noticed a storage container and a big yellow

34:07.620 --> 34:11.620
excavator next to the cabin all encircled by a moat.

34:11.620 --> 34:13.500
The pair moved forward to investigate the cabin

34:13.500 --> 34:16.300
and found the moat was about five feet across.

34:16.300 --> 34:18.980
Jeremy threw some smokies onto the other side

34:18.980 --> 34:22.820
and held Rusty's feet as he lunged across to grab

34:22.820 --> 34:24.960
the small sausage boys.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.700
Liz crossed Rusty's back without issue but Jeremy

34:27.700 --> 34:30.720
and Rusty fell into the fish filled moat.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.780
They crawled out near Liz, a wet mess.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.740
The trio approached the cabin slowly.

34:36.740 --> 34:39.720
Liz stumbled up the stairs to look through the window

34:39.720 --> 34:43.640
and she saw strange lab equipment and translucent tubes

34:43.640 --> 34:46.880
that ran down into the floorboards filled with a

34:46.880 --> 34:50.400
squamous black viscous goo.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.240
Papers were scattered across tables and a desk

34:53.240 --> 34:57.560
and in the corner sat a large wooden trunk.

34:57.560 --> 35:01.080
Jeremy edged toward the storage unit, opened the door

35:01.080 --> 35:05.320
and saw on one side a closet full of clothes

35:05.320 --> 35:07.960
and on the other side lined up against the wall

35:07.960 --> 35:12.960
the bodies of roughly 15 people hung limply on hooks

35:13.000 --> 35:15.880
from a pole in the back of each neck.

35:15.880 --> 35:19.040
Jeremy turned and screamed at Liz they needed to get

35:19.040 --> 35:22.880
the fuck out of there and the pair bolted across the moat.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.300
As they ran Liz heard a click under her foot.

35:26.300 --> 35:29.840
She tried to stop in time but a giant metal cloth

35:29.840 --> 35:34.240
swung down from the branch above and removed her head

35:34.240 --> 35:36.240
from her shoulders.

35:36.240 --> 35:40.680
Jeremy knew she was dead, he kept running.

35:40.680 --> 35:44.720
Ash Hornbeam also ran through the dark rainy night.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.080
He found the trail and in the distance he saw

35:47.080 --> 35:49.600
Judy Krinklehoff walking toward him.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.460
Ash grabbed her arm and kept running, pulling her with him.

35:52.460 --> 35:54.360
They arrived at his usual campsite.

35:54.360 --> 35:57.840
Ash fell to his knees, gasped for air and told Judy

35:57.840 --> 36:01.200
her brother disappeared into a hole in the ground.

36:01.200 --> 36:05.360
Judy seemed unworried by this news and suggested finding

36:05.360 --> 36:07.140
some large rocks.

36:07.140 --> 36:10.040
Ash continued to panic and freak out and Judy went to go

36:10.040 --> 36:11.560
find some rocks.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.960
Ash considered his options but decided to stay with Judy

36:14.960 --> 36:18.000
for now since he did have a crush on her.

36:18.000 --> 36:23.000
Judy found a huge rock, walked up behind Ash and crushed

36:23.500 --> 36:25.520
his head in.

36:25.520 --> 36:29.220
Ken Krinklehoff crouched in the crawl space under the cabin

36:29.220 --> 36:31.840
lit only by his flashlight.

36:31.840 --> 36:34.840
He gently put his ear to the door above him and heard

36:34.840 --> 36:37.160
a muffled yell in the distance.

36:37.160 --> 36:41.960
It was Jeremy screaming for Liz to get the fuck out of here.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.160
Ken poked his head up through the door.

36:44.200 --> 36:47.140
This was not a cabin, it was a lab.

36:47.140 --> 36:51.040
The same translucent tubes full of black ooze were all

36:51.040 --> 36:54.840
around the room going into the floor and Ken saw the tubes

36:54.840 --> 36:59.040
were coming from small coffin shaped boxes.

36:59.040 --> 37:02.160
There was a desk littered with papers, a bulletin board

37:02.160 --> 37:04.580
and a large wooden trunk.

37:04.580 --> 37:07.620
Ken heard a guttural scream cut short and looked out the

37:07.620 --> 37:11.360
window at the exact moment Liz Lonklin was stopped dead

37:11.360 --> 37:16.360
in her tracks by the decapitation from a massive metal claw.

37:17.880 --> 37:21.140
Having convinced himself that what he just saw could not

37:21.140 --> 37:24.200
have been real, Ken turned back around and investigated

37:24.200 --> 37:25.400
the scene.

37:25.400 --> 37:29.880
He found articles of organization for a new business called

37:29.880 --> 37:34.880
Cole's Orphanage, New School Under Modern Etiquette.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.720
All the other papers were blueprints for an odd looking gun

37:39.720 --> 37:43.040
which seemed to have been recently completed.

37:43.040 --> 37:47.160
There were also plans for small metal spheres one inch

37:47.160 --> 37:52.160
in diameter which were being placed into small human bodies.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.760
Ken took a wary glance at the little coffins.

37:55.760 --> 37:59.200
He opened one and a black viscous goo began pouring out of it

37:59.200 --> 38:01.000
onto the table and floor.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.960
Inside the coffin there sat the body of a two year old

38:04.960 --> 38:09.200
that was not quite fully human looking as if it was being

38:09.720 --> 38:13.720
3D printed and was not yet finished like a face with a

38:13.720 --> 38:15.560
plastic bag over it.

38:15.560 --> 38:19.760
Ken freaked the fuck out and ran for the front door

38:19.760 --> 38:20.720
of the cabin.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.480
Jeremy Pettymore ran desperately through the woods

38:24.480 --> 38:27.720
and eventually found Judy Krinkelhoff walking toward him.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.200
Judy said she didn't know what to do since the other girls

38:30.200 --> 38:31.840
had left her alone.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.480
The two decided to head back to the ranger shack.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.040
Jeremy took the lead.

38:36.040 --> 38:39.240
Judy pulled out the machete she was hiding and lunged

38:39.240 --> 38:42.600
at the Pettymore boy but she slipped on the muddy rocks

38:42.600 --> 38:47.600
below, fell face first onto the machete and split her skull

38:47.600 --> 38:52.600
wide open enough for Jeremy to see a small one inch

38:52.800 --> 38:57.160
in diameter silver sphere in the middle of her head.

38:57.160 --> 39:02.160
Black ooze began to leak onto the trail and Jeremy ran.

39:03.160 --> 39:07.040
Ken stumbled out of the cabin and saw three figures

39:07.040 --> 39:08.200
approaching.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.040
Through the rain and darkness a lightning strike in the

39:11.040 --> 39:13.440
distance revealed the trio.

39:13.440 --> 39:16.560
All wearing black suits with white shirts, two with black

39:16.560 --> 39:19.440
ties and one with a bolo tie.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.520
The tall one had buzz blonde hair, the man with the bolo

39:22.520 --> 39:26.160
tie was shorter, sported tight pants and a thick mustache

39:26.160 --> 39:30.800
and the last was a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile

39:30.840 --> 39:35.480
behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes.

39:35.480 --> 39:39.040
They saw Ken and the woman began chanting.

39:39.040 --> 39:42.920
Ken turned to rush back into the cabin, his arm reached out

39:42.920 --> 39:47.920
for the door and his hand phased into and through the wood.

39:48.200 --> 39:52.040
He felt an aberrant push in the back and his body too

39:52.040 --> 39:54.960
was forced into the door.

39:54.960 --> 39:59.960
Ken Krinklehoff was trapped halfway in and halfway out

40:00.080 --> 40:02.880
the entrance and exit of this cabin.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.600
His mind worked just long enough to watch the suits

40:06.600 --> 40:08.520
ransack the lab.

40:08.520 --> 40:12.200
One grabbed a bucket of water filled with fish to splash

40:12.200 --> 40:13.640
and repel the ooze.

40:13.640 --> 40:18.200
The other two took some papers in the trunk and they left

40:18.200 --> 40:22.080
but not before the woman chanted once more and ignited

40:22.080 --> 40:25.720
the cabin in unnatural flames.

40:25.720 --> 40:29.560
Ken Krinklehoff died burning part of the cabin

40:30.080 --> 40:31.280
in the contention woods.

40:33.360 --> 40:38.360
Jeremy Pettymore now all alone ran back to the ranger shack

40:38.520 --> 40:40.160
in the parking lot.

40:40.160 --> 40:43.040
He got to the Bronco with the keys he had nabbed earlier

40:43.040 --> 40:44.600
but the car wouldn't start.

40:44.600 --> 40:47.720
He got out and then the heavy rain and darkness of night

40:47.720 --> 40:51.060
he ran down the road toward town.

40:51.060 --> 40:55.160
Behind Jeremy, the black sedan drove furiously into view

40:55.160 --> 40:57.240
and behind it the four wheeler.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.720
As they approached, the four wheeler overtook the sedan

41:00.720 --> 41:04.760
and pulled up next to Jeremy as he desperately sprinted.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.880
Jeremy looked over and the man who drove this ATV

41:07.880 --> 41:11.120
was pretty fit for his early 40s and he wore a black suit

41:11.120 --> 41:13.880
with a white shirt and a bolo tie below a face

41:13.880 --> 41:16.120
with a badass mustache.

41:16.120 --> 41:20.000
He recognized the man as John Lee Pettymore III,

41:20.000 --> 41:21.840
his second cousin.

41:21.840 --> 41:26.240
The two came to a stop and Jeremy waved and tried to hop

41:26.280 --> 41:27.640
on the four wheeler.

41:27.640 --> 41:31.040
John, John, Uncle John, Uncle John.

41:31.040 --> 41:35.920
John stopped, saw Jeremy and his heart sank.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.780
Uncle John, thank God you're here.

41:38.780 --> 41:40.100
What's wrong, Uncle John?

41:40.100 --> 41:43.980
John Lee Pettymore III lifted a pistol

41:43.980 --> 41:47.040
and put it to his second cousin's head.

41:47.040 --> 41:51.440
Jeremy Pettymore, 14 years old, closed his eyes tight,

41:51.440 --> 41:55.880
shaking, he felt the gun against his head trembling.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.440
And then there was nothing.

42:01.200 --> 42:03.800
Now, back to the contention boys.

42:03.800 --> 42:06.920
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore IV

42:06.920 --> 42:09.560
and the body of John Lee Pettymore III

42:09.560 --> 42:13.360
woke up, bodies fully in shock, ears ringing,

42:13.360 --> 42:18.360
bellies weirdly satisfied and an uncomfortably savory smell

42:19.200 --> 42:23.300
in their nostrils as their eyes adjusted to see

42:23.300 --> 42:27.580
the inside of a mausoleum splattered in blood.

42:27.580 --> 42:30.560
They remembered everything that had happened to them before

42:30.560 --> 42:33.280
but they seemed to be back in the same physical

42:33.280 --> 42:36.280
and mental state they were in just after meeting

42:36.280 --> 42:39.640
the chanting cloaked old Clark.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.280
According to Clark's watch, it was the day of the funeral

42:43.280 --> 42:46.160
at 1 p.m. again.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.280
Keith ripped his shirt off and found the word Marvin

42:50.280 --> 42:54.000
that had been burned into his chest had been crossed out.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.560
The other names, Tildy on their dominant palms,

42:56.560 --> 42:59.520
Drew on their backs and Maggie on the bottom

42:59.520 --> 43:01.920
of their left feet were still branded

43:01.920 --> 43:05.040
on each of their bodies the same as before.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.960
They wondered whether Marvin would still be dead

43:07.960 --> 43:10.440
and theorized that they'd have to work their way

43:10.440 --> 43:12.040
through the other names as well.

43:12.040 --> 43:15.520
Would they have to kill Maggie and Drew?

43:15.560 --> 43:17.960
And how would they find Tildy?

43:17.960 --> 43:20.680
John called Rosemary, she picked up

43:20.680 --> 43:22.820
and he immediately hung up.

43:22.820 --> 43:25.780
John recalled the vision he'd had the last time

43:25.780 --> 43:27.640
they were at the cemetery.

43:27.640 --> 43:30.360
Keith told the others about the visions he had

43:30.360 --> 43:32.740
while wearing his father's watch.

43:32.740 --> 43:35.360
Clark suggested calling Maggie and reporting

43:35.360 --> 43:38.500
that he'd successfully killed Stan Manstein

43:38.500 --> 43:42.920
but first he tried to summon old Clark.

43:42.920 --> 43:46.920
He only succeeded in driving himself into a rage

43:46.920 --> 43:49.080
and he charged John.

43:49.080 --> 43:51.160
When they finally sorted themselves out,

43:51.160 --> 43:55.440
the CPD-3 exited the mausoleum and again

43:55.440 --> 43:58.960
encountered the old lady who freaked out.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.640
She'd already seen them leave the tomb earlier.

44:01.640 --> 44:04.880
The gang of risen ex-cops scared her off

44:04.880 --> 44:07.940
and discussed the implications of this news.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.720
They considered just waiting around

44:09.720 --> 44:12.460
for their next iterations to come out of the mausoleum

44:12.860 --> 44:15.680
but decided instead to call Maggie.

44:17.540 --> 44:21.180
The vision Clark received when he tried to summon himself

44:21.180 --> 44:24.260
became instantly clear in his mind.

44:24.260 --> 44:28.180
A candlelit stone room contained a hooded figure

44:28.180 --> 44:33.180
scribbling furiously into an ornately decorated book

44:33.600 --> 44:37.300
made of strange leather.

44:37.300 --> 44:42.220
This figure was an elderly decrepit Clark Bishop.

44:42.220 --> 44:44.940
There was a knock on the door and a voice called,

44:44.940 --> 44:49.940
my Lord, my Lord, as the door opened up.

44:50.220 --> 44:54.500
Cut to a silver accord flying down the highway

44:54.500 --> 44:57.340
driven by a frantic Maggie Cook.

44:57.340 --> 45:00.880
He saw her call him on her phone.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.460
Clark blinked away this unnatural vision

45:04.460 --> 45:09.420
and suddenly the phone in his pocket began to buzz.

45:09.420 --> 45:11.420
Clark answered and Maggie told him

45:11.460 --> 45:14.700
to get to the parking lot immediately to meet her.

45:14.700 --> 45:17.060
John and Keith joined even though they disagreed

45:17.060 --> 45:19.100
with Clark about trusting her.

45:19.100 --> 45:22.620
Maggie sped into the parking lot and pulled up next to them.

45:22.620 --> 45:27.620
She tasked them with taking out a man named Bruce Robin

45:28.620 --> 45:31.100
as he had gone fully insane

45:31.100 --> 45:35.180
and was a danger to the world at large.

45:35.180 --> 45:39.460
She was shook by the appearance of John Lee Pettymore III

45:39.460 --> 45:42.820
and they quickly explained that whole situation.

45:42.820 --> 45:47.180
She did not take it well and they had to calm her down.

45:47.180 --> 45:49.700
Clark grabbed the burner phone from his car

45:49.700 --> 45:52.220
and saw a text that read,

45:52.220 --> 45:56.720
your parents owned an artifact of immense power,

45:56.720 --> 46:00.300
too much power for them to be trusted with.

46:00.300 --> 46:02.920
He responded, what artifact?

46:03.980 --> 46:08.340
Maggie asked her former coworkers to murder Bruce Robin,

46:08.340 --> 46:11.500
owner of Bar Corp and former business partner

46:11.500 --> 46:14.700
of Keith's brother, Ferguson Beans.

46:14.700 --> 46:18.560
John began to question Maggie on how she was still alive,

46:18.560 --> 46:22.740
but the ringing of her cell phone cut off Maggie's reply.

46:22.740 --> 46:24.180
As Clark rejoined the group,

46:24.180 --> 46:27.280
he noted a second cell phone vibrating

46:27.280 --> 46:29.420
from within the chief's car.

46:29.420 --> 46:32.420
On the call, Maggie berated Leon,

46:32.420 --> 46:34.820
told him to do his fucking job.

46:34.820 --> 46:37.220
He needed to knock the dust off his knuckles

46:37.220 --> 46:40.660
because he knew what needed to be done.

46:40.660 --> 46:42.660
She hung up and explained,

46:42.660 --> 46:45.020
she never died, just had to disappear.

46:45.020 --> 46:46.760
She implied the body they'd found

46:46.760 --> 46:49.400
in the remains of her house was a decoy.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.300
Maggie tossed the officers a manila envelope,

46:52.300 --> 46:56.740
reminded them she was counting on this and drove away.

46:56.740 --> 46:59.680
The manila envelope had a manila folder inside

46:59.680 --> 47:03.620
labeled Operation Hole Puncher, Bar Corp.

47:03.620 --> 47:05.960
It contained information on Bar Corp,

47:05.960 --> 47:10.400
including its three subsidiaries, Jesus Christ Ministries,

47:10.400 --> 47:13.040
Health and Rehabilitation Unlimited,

47:13.040 --> 47:15.220
and The Learning Center.

47:15.220 --> 47:18.480
It also showed finances for the last five years

47:18.480 --> 47:21.680
and profits had been steadily rising.

47:21.680 --> 47:25.800
The previous year, they made over $850 million

47:25.800 --> 47:28.400
and paid zero in taxes,

47:28.400 --> 47:32.080
and they were projected to make over $2 billion

47:32.080 --> 47:33.540
in the current year.

47:33.540 --> 47:37.420
It was also noted that after being declared deceased,

47:37.420 --> 47:40.960
Ferguson Beans' majority share was split

47:40.960 --> 47:44.740
between his wife Stacy, daughter Frances,

47:44.740 --> 47:48.140
and the mill on the other side of the city,

47:48.140 --> 47:52.620
which secured Bruce Robin as the majority owner.

47:52.620 --> 47:55.580
John mentioned he recently sold that cocaine

47:55.580 --> 47:57.420
they'd found in the storage units

47:57.420 --> 48:00.140
to Jesus Christ Ministries,

48:00.140 --> 48:03.060
a church camp just outside the city.

48:03.060 --> 48:08.060
Clark told John they saw Marvin Glass split his body in half

48:08.100 --> 48:11.700
to reveal a silver ball inside his head.

48:11.700 --> 48:13.500
John explained his working theory

48:13.500 --> 48:16.820
was that all the officers might be bald.

48:16.820 --> 48:20.060
He explained that upon the death of his original body,

48:20.060 --> 48:23.860
he burst out and went into John Lee Kevinmore's body.

48:23.860 --> 48:25.180
He believed this was possible

48:25.180 --> 48:28.660
because he was just a little silver ball.

48:28.660 --> 48:31.260
Clark described the actions of Rosemary

48:31.260 --> 48:35.300
in her final moments inside the flooded Glass office.

48:35.300 --> 48:37.340
John asserted her turn on Marvin

48:37.340 --> 48:39.700
may have been due to her infatuation

48:39.700 --> 48:42.420
with Marvin's son, Jermaine Glass,

48:42.420 --> 48:47.420
the man who disappeared when he used the odd-looking gun.

48:48.260 --> 48:50.820
After a quick confession from Keith

48:50.820 --> 48:54.340
detailing the murder of his own brother by proxy

48:54.340 --> 48:58.120
as well as the firsthand murder of Bruce Robin's mother,

48:58.120 --> 49:00.140
the former contention police officers

49:00.140 --> 49:03.660
traveled to Robin's home address downtown in the city,

49:03.660 --> 49:08.660
hoping to find personal files and or Bruce Robin himself.

49:09.740 --> 49:10.900
However, when they arrived,

49:10.900 --> 49:12.980
they found police tape across the door

49:12.980 --> 49:14.820
of Robin's brownstone.

49:14.820 --> 49:16.340
The residence was wrecked

49:16.340 --> 49:19.220
and human excrement was strewn throughout.

49:19.220 --> 49:21.940
The stench was overwhelming.

49:21.940 --> 49:23.780
Spray paint covered the walls.

49:23.780 --> 49:28.020
It repeated the same number pattern over and over.

49:28.020 --> 49:33.020
8118189520131181119.

49:35.100 --> 49:36.780
John checked upstairs.

49:36.780 --> 49:41.780
His hair stood on end with the feeling of a heavy presence.

49:42.220 --> 49:44.820
In a room deemed to be a former office,

49:44.820 --> 49:48.740
the same set of numbers was carved into the walls

49:48.740 --> 49:53.740
again and again and again on every surface in the room.

49:53.780 --> 49:55.380
Clark investigated what he thought

49:55.380 --> 49:58.260
might once have been the master bedroom

49:58.260 --> 50:01.140
and found various sleeping pallets.

50:01.140 --> 50:03.660
It was clear as many as 20 people

50:03.660 --> 50:06.460
had been sleeping in this room at one time.

50:06.460 --> 50:08.820
John called the city PD

50:08.820 --> 50:12.860
under the cover of having tracked a drifter to this home.

50:12.860 --> 50:16.340
He requested any information they'd uncovered at the scene.

50:16.340 --> 50:17.860
The city officer shared

50:17.860 --> 50:20.820
that Bruce Robin went missing two days ago.

50:20.820 --> 50:24.700
His neighbors spoke about how crazy Bruce had been recently.

50:24.820 --> 50:27.340
He'd had all kinds of people coming in and out

50:27.340 --> 50:29.300
at all times of the day and night.

50:29.300 --> 50:32.340
The steep decline of Bruce Robin

50:32.340 --> 50:35.580
had been a rapid transformation.

50:35.580 --> 50:36.980
On their way out to the car,

50:36.980 --> 50:39.660
they noted again the sickly green hue

50:39.660 --> 50:41.900
of the city around them.

50:41.900 --> 50:45.220
The putrid smell, the oppressive grays,

50:45.220 --> 50:49.380
the bloated and lifeless faces of the people on the streets.

50:49.380 --> 50:51.380
And in contrast to all this,

50:51.380 --> 50:54.980
the beautiful blooming flowers on every corner

50:54.980 --> 50:57.580
and from every crack in the sidewalk.

50:57.580 --> 51:02.220
John asked a passerby why he was so pallid and corpse-like.

51:02.220 --> 51:04.140
The man explained that work at Bar Corp

51:04.140 --> 51:05.580
had been hard as of late,

51:05.580 --> 51:09.260
though they'd just been given some days off.

51:09.260 --> 51:11.620
He felt the color was actually probably better now

51:11.620 --> 51:13.060
than it had been recently.

51:13.060 --> 51:16.860
Bar Corp was surprisingly paying all employees

51:16.860 --> 51:19.420
time and a half to take two weeks off.

51:19.420 --> 51:21.420
John asked why a big corporation like that

51:21.420 --> 51:24.060
would pay its staff to take time off.

51:24.060 --> 51:24.980
The man wasn't sure,

51:24.980 --> 51:28.420
but it might have to do with the new CEO.

51:28.420 --> 51:32.860
Bruce Robin announced he would renovate every building

51:32.860 --> 51:36.020
and provide everyone a livable wage,

51:36.020 --> 51:39.060
benefits and better working hours.

51:39.060 --> 51:41.500
Clark asked what exactly Bar Corp does.

51:41.500 --> 51:42.940
Do they sell something?

51:42.940 --> 51:46.260
The man asked Clark to pull anything out of his pockets.

51:46.260 --> 51:48.020
Clark produced a pin

51:48.020 --> 51:49.700
and the man said Bar Corp made it.

51:49.700 --> 51:54.100
Sure enough, the pin read Bar Corp there along the side.

51:54.100 --> 51:55.660
The party hatched a plan.

51:55.660 --> 51:58.180
Keith would call Bruce Robin directly

51:58.180 --> 52:00.100
under the guise of commiseration

52:00.100 --> 52:02.740
over the death of Ferguson Beans.

52:02.740 --> 52:04.900
But a woman named Winifred Worth

52:04.900 --> 52:07.180
answered for Bruce Robin's office.

52:07.180 --> 52:09.540
Keith explained Ferguson Beans was his brother

52:09.540 --> 52:12.340
to which Winifred expressed condolences.

52:12.340 --> 52:14.420
Keith requested to speak to Bruce

52:14.420 --> 52:16.500
to ask him some questions.

52:16.500 --> 52:19.620
Winifred promised she would pass along the questions

52:19.620 --> 52:21.500
to Bruce for him.

52:21.500 --> 52:22.420
Keith pressed her.

52:22.420 --> 52:23.980
He'd hoped to have a conversation

52:23.980 --> 52:26.100
with his late brother's business partner.

52:26.100 --> 52:27.340
She insisted.

52:27.340 --> 52:29.780
While Bruce was currently in the office,

52:29.780 --> 52:32.460
he was currently unavailable.

52:32.460 --> 52:34.180
Keith found out Bruce's office

52:34.180 --> 52:36.860
was on the 17th floor and hung up.

52:36.860 --> 52:39.380
He then called the number for Ferguson's office,

52:39.380 --> 52:42.620
but he was greeted again by Winifred.

52:42.620 --> 52:46.460
Keith tried to disguise his identity as Ferguson,

52:46.460 --> 52:49.380
but Keith, caught in the act, just hung up.

52:49.380 --> 52:52.540
The group decided since they knew where Bruce Robin was,

52:52.540 --> 52:54.540
they would head that way and barge in

52:54.540 --> 52:57.380
as officers of the law to question him.

52:58.300 --> 52:59.500
On the way to Bar Corp,

52:59.500 --> 53:04.060
the fellas noticed both flowers and sickness everywhere.

53:04.060 --> 53:07.020
After a diversion to acquire blue windbreakers,

53:07.020 --> 53:09.100
coveralls, and fancy hats,

53:09.100 --> 53:12.020
they pulled up to the 17-story building

53:12.020 --> 53:14.380
and walked through the revolving doors

53:14.420 --> 53:18.300
into a massive foyer with marble columns.

53:18.300 --> 53:20.220
A security guard and a receptionist

53:20.220 --> 53:23.100
stood at a large marble desk,

53:23.100 --> 53:26.060
behind which hung a giant mural

53:26.060 --> 53:29.060
of Washington crossing the Delaware,

53:29.060 --> 53:33.580
but all the guns were replaced by flowers.

53:33.580 --> 53:38.140
The building directory showed only 12 of the 17 floors.

53:38.140 --> 53:40.220
John fast-talked the security guard

53:40.220 --> 53:42.900
and the group found their way into the only elevator

53:42.900 --> 53:46.860
that actually went all the way to the 17th floor.

53:46.860 --> 53:48.940
On 17, they were met straight away

53:48.940 --> 53:52.980
by a small older woman with a shock of white hair.

53:52.980 --> 53:56.460
Winifred Worth wore a white satin blouse

53:56.460 --> 53:59.660
with black vertical stripes on the left-hand side,

53:59.660 --> 54:02.420
high-waisted pants with horizontal stripes

54:02.420 --> 54:04.180
on the right-hand side,

54:04.180 --> 54:07.580
white platform shoes with studded soles,

54:07.580 --> 54:12.300
and interconnected silver rings across her right hand.

54:12.340 --> 54:15.020
She knew they were the disgraced police officers

54:15.020 --> 54:18.900
from contention and she demanded to know their business.

54:18.900 --> 54:20.620
John attempted to persuade her

54:20.620 --> 54:23.260
to let them into Bruce Robin's office.

54:23.260 --> 54:24.900
She was not convinced.

54:24.900 --> 54:28.460
John's solution was to push this 71-year-old lady

54:28.460 --> 54:31.980
to the ground and holler for the others to run past.

54:31.980 --> 54:33.940
John called an ambulance for her

54:33.940 --> 54:37.300
and gave Keith's name as the caller.

54:37.300 --> 54:40.460
Keith picked the lock to get into Bruce's office,

54:40.460 --> 54:43.500
which was in a state of disarray.

54:43.500 --> 54:46.100
A large bookcase had been ransacked.

54:46.100 --> 54:48.900
A conference table was absolutely covered

54:48.900 --> 54:51.380
in binders, files, and papers.

54:51.380 --> 54:54.300
Behind an equally cluttered desk,

54:54.300 --> 54:57.420
a panicked Bruce Robin paced back and forth

54:57.420 --> 55:00.140
and muttered numbers to himself.

55:00.140 --> 55:03.260
He wore a disheveled but well-tailored suit

55:03.260 --> 55:05.820
and his hair was a disaster.

55:05.820 --> 55:07.020
Bruce greeted them

55:07.020 --> 55:09.860
and the officers asked him about the numbers.

55:09.900 --> 55:11.860
He denied he was even saying numbers

55:11.860 --> 55:14.380
and became aggravated when pushed.

55:14.380 --> 55:16.780
They asked if he knew who Keith was.

55:16.780 --> 55:18.100
While Bruce considered this,

55:18.100 --> 55:20.460
they noticed his bleeding knuckles

55:20.460 --> 55:23.700
and the silver ring with a flat blank top

55:23.700 --> 55:25.220
on his middle finger,

55:25.220 --> 55:28.900
exactly like the one they found at Jim Cook's house.

55:28.900 --> 55:32.060
Keith revealed the ring he had tied around his neck

55:32.060 --> 55:35.860
with a shoestring and Bruce's eyes went wide

55:35.860 --> 55:38.540
with fear and excitement.

55:38.540 --> 55:41.380
He asked if they were with Myriad.

55:41.380 --> 55:45.100
Keith said yes and put the ring on.

55:46.140 --> 55:48.860
Bruce stared off above their heads

55:48.860 --> 55:52.140
through a curtain of unwashed hair

55:52.140 --> 55:54.220
and began chanting,

55:54.220 --> 55:56.820
Tawil Alakol.

55:56.820 --> 56:00.100
Clark leapt across the desk, tackle punched him,

56:00.100 --> 56:02.660
and knocked a hidden pistol out of his hand,

56:02.660 --> 56:04.820
but Bruce kept chanting.

56:04.820 --> 56:07.500
Keith tried to stomp on his arm to take the ring,

56:07.500 --> 56:10.940
but Robin used the momentum to pull Keith to the ground.

56:10.940 --> 56:13.740
John tried and failed to gag the chanting man

56:13.740 --> 56:15.940
with his own tie.

56:15.940 --> 56:17.540
Bruce threw Clark off of him

56:17.540 --> 56:20.620
and reached the fallen gun chanting the whole time.

56:20.620 --> 56:24.180
Keith instinctively shot the once again armed CEO

56:24.180 --> 56:27.820
to protect Clark, but it only wounded the businessman.

56:27.820 --> 56:30.140
John demanded Bruce stop chanting

56:30.140 --> 56:32.780
and went to check on Winifred.

56:32.780 --> 56:35.740
However, Bruce Robin completed the chant

56:35.740 --> 56:39.860
and promptly shot himself in the head.

56:39.860 --> 56:43.340
Keith took the ring off Bruce's limp finger.

56:43.340 --> 56:44.380
When he stood back up,

56:44.380 --> 56:49.380
he noticed John was writing numbers on the desk in blood.

56:49.420 --> 56:52.140
Clark stopped him, but John strangely wasn't aware

56:52.140 --> 56:54.220
he'd been writing any numbers.

56:54.220 --> 56:57.700
Suddenly, the doors to the office burst open

56:57.700 --> 57:00.180
and the trio realized they no longer stood

57:00.180 --> 57:03.500
in the places they'd had just been standing.

57:03.500 --> 57:06.020
They were stark naked and drenched

57:06.020 --> 57:08.300
in Bruce Robin's blood.

57:08.300 --> 57:13.300
The numbers 218213518152914 were scrawled

57:15.140 --> 57:20.140
in dark red fluid on every surface of the office

57:20.580 --> 57:25.580
and the gang had no recollection of their actions.

57:27.340 --> 57:29.660
When the doors to the office busted open,

57:29.660 --> 57:31.860
three police officers barged in

57:31.860 --> 57:34.540
as John, Clark, and Keith became aware

57:34.540 --> 57:37.860
of their abruptly changed surroundings.

57:37.860 --> 57:40.180
Clark recognized the officer at the back,

57:40.180 --> 57:45.180
an attractive older man with gray hair as Leon Simpson.

57:45.300 --> 57:48.260
Leon dropped two duffel bags on the ground

57:48.260 --> 57:52.580
and expeditiously executed the other two officers

57:52.580 --> 57:53.580
from behind.

57:53.580 --> 57:56.700
He then marched back out into the hallway

57:56.700 --> 58:00.900
and fired a single additional shot.

58:00.900 --> 58:03.060
Clark told the other two this newcomer

58:03.060 --> 58:06.100
was from the circle of knowledge.

58:06.100 --> 58:08.980
Leon came back, donned headphones and gloves,

58:08.980 --> 58:13.940
turned up some outlaw country and began to clean the scene.

58:13.940 --> 58:15.460
Inside one of the duffel bags,

58:15.460 --> 58:17.500
Clark found cleaning supplies

58:17.500 --> 58:20.900
and three clean city PD uniforms.

58:20.900 --> 58:24.620
Clark, John, and Keith cleaned themselves and suited up.

58:24.620 --> 58:27.500
Leon pulled papers from Bruce's desk

58:27.500 --> 58:31.860
and stamped them with a copy of Bruce's signature.

58:31.860 --> 58:35.460
These papers signed Bruce's share of bar corp

58:35.460 --> 58:39.180
over to the mill on the other side of the city.

58:39.180 --> 58:42.380
Among Bruce's things, John found a note.

58:42.380 --> 58:46.820
It read, she broke me open and all new things

58:46.820 --> 58:50.740
have the power to escort change in the future of good

58:50.740 --> 58:54.020
in order to break the cycle and find fulfillment

58:54.020 --> 58:56.060
in an unquestioning goodness

58:56.100 --> 58:58.140
that breaks the relentless tether

58:58.140 --> 59:02.500
holding this lie of a world withstanding itself.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.540
I can smell my past.

59:04.540 --> 59:06.420
I can hear my future.

59:06.420 --> 59:07.980
I am joy.

59:07.980 --> 59:09.780
I am destruction.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.540
I am pure.

59:11.540 --> 59:14.300
Death to Myriad.

59:14.300 --> 59:16.300
811-818-9520-131181119.

59:22.020 --> 59:24.380
They recognized the number from Bruce's house

59:24.380 --> 59:26.980
and finally broke the cipher.

59:26.980 --> 59:30.460
They found the numbers spelled Harriet Marks,

59:30.460 --> 59:33.340
a name they hadn't come across.

59:33.340 --> 59:36.740
Clark received a text on the mysterious burner phone

59:36.740 --> 59:40.220
that read, the book your parents died for

59:40.220 --> 59:44.980
is still hidden in an undisclosed location.

59:44.980 --> 59:47.540
He texted back, what book?

59:47.540 --> 59:48.620
Where?

59:48.620 --> 59:51.060
A quick search for Harriet Marks revealed

59:51.060 --> 59:53.500
she was a pro-union activist

59:53.500 --> 59:56.380
studying at City State University

59:56.380 --> 59:58.500
who committed suicide in her dorm room

59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.980
just four days before on December 2nd.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.340
Leon said they would go investigate her

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.980
after they cleaned up.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.740
The group heard sirens and made a run for Leon's car.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.380
After a destructive chase and a lethal getaway,

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.700
Keith noticed Clark and John zoning out

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.140
muttering the number sequence.

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.100
Keith described to Leon what happened

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.380
in Bruce Robin's office

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.980
and what they'd worked out about the cipher.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.220
Leon showed Keith a picture of the inside

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.420
of Harriet Marks's dorm room.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:34.540
Spray painted all over the walls was a third sequence.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:39.540
1522518195518, the code for overseer.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.820
Leon evangelized.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.500
Clark is more than a man.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.020
He's a God.

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.740
He's the savior.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:55.740
A prophecy maintains Clark will go back in time

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.180
and found the circle of knowledge.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.860
John and Clark came to in a parking lot on CSU campus

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.700
with Leon and Keith staring at them.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.500
Keith informed them they had just been chanting

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.300
Bruce Robin's numbers.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.620
Then he handed them the folder Leon had given him.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:17.060
Inside were pictures of a crime scene in a dorm room.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.180
Numbers were spray painted on every surface.

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.860
In the cipher, it read overseer.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:26.660
Clark bluntly asked Leon if he believed

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.060
Clark was the overseer and was met

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.380
with an equally blunt yes.

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.900
Leon went on.

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:36.620
He believed Clark would eventually go back in time

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.500
and found the circle of knowledge.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.820
The contention officers informed Leon

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:45.260
that an old Clark had been poking and prodding

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.820
at their lives recently.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:51.060
Leon seemed curious and asked them to explain further.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.260
They recalled the time old Clark warned Drew

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.700
something terrible would happen

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.980
before the chief's house exploded

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.620
and how old Clark had branded names

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.460
into their skin with magic.

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.660
Leon proposed the group split up.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.820
John and Keith could head to the dorm room.

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:10.860
He and Clark would go to the administration building.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:14.340
Leon explained while they're not sure what it is,

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.780
it seemed to transfer from person to person.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.740
Bruce Robin got it from Harriet Marks

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.300
and Harriet Marks got it from the overseer

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.460
based on the numbers in her dorm room.

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.500
They needed to know why Clark had done this.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.300
Clark reminded them it's not him

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.660
they're talking about exactly,

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.140
so maybe they could call old Clark Clarkold

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:36.980
to avoid confusion.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:40.100
With that, the groups split off.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.620
Leon began to drive away with Clark in the back seat

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.220
and Clark noticed Leon reached for a gun

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.900
that looked like the tranquilizer gun

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:50.980
he'd given Clark to coerce agent Trent Chad.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.940
Before Leon could fire, Clark kicked the back of his seat

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:57.260
and a tranq dart stuck in the ceiling of the car.

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:58.600
After a short struggle,

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.260
Clark wrestled the gun away from Leon.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:06.100
He held the gun to the back of Leon's head with a strong,

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.620
what the fuck?

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.580
Leon explained he had hoped to knock Clark out.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.480
He was terrified something would happen to Clark

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.140
like a stray bullet.

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:19.480
If Clark died, that could mean the world ends.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.960
Leon felt he needed to protect Clark at all costs,

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.520
but Clark argued if he really was the overseer

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.600
and he did go back to found the circle of knowledge,

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.560
then this must all work out.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.200
In fact, he might be bulletproof now.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.640
In a pretty threatening tone,

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.080
Clark reminded Leon he might be the one needing protection

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.240
as he didn't recall an old Leon

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.600
running around as Clark Old's right-hand man.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.740
Leon replied with a sigh.

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.460
He said it was time.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.900
They really needed to go to calm, comfy campground,

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.720
but Leon had been coerced.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.860
First, they could put Clark's invincibility theory

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:03.600
to the test and finish out the investigation at CSU.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.460
So Leon Simpson swung the car back around

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.580
and headed to the administration building

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.500
they'd first set out for

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.860
before the failed kidnapping attempt.

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:16.620
John and Keith walked through the holiday decoration

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.620
riddled CSU campus to gifts house, Harriet Marks dormitory.

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.860
The lobby was dark and vacant.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.380
John hopped on the computer behind the front desk

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:30.320
and the desktop background was a promotional flyer

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.940
for the Jingle Ball scheduled for that evening,

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.500
December 6th at CSU.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.500
The poster read, follow the scavenger hunt

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.980
to make your way to the Jingle Ball.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.300
On the computer, John found the directory

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:49.300
and discovered Harriet Marks and her roommate, Amelia Locke

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:53.660
lived in 328 across the hall from a show dorm

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.600
for tours to prospective students.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.340
They called the elevator and the light

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.060
that emanated from the open doors

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:04.140
revealed countless unique number sequences

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:08.300
scribbled all over the walls and floor of this building

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:13.300
in materials ranging from spray paint to bodily fluids.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.140
And inside the elevator, the limp corpse of a student

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.380
was slumped over itself.

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:25.020
Her face was amorphous, smashed repeatedly

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.800
until she was unrecognizable.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.780
Back in the administration building

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.500
the campus seemed absolutely empty.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.940
It looked like Christmas itself had thrown up

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.460
the decorations that adorned everything in sight.

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.980
The lights of the administration building were off

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:45.380
but down the hall stood two figures.

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:49.140
One mumbled a sequence of letters and numbers interrupted

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:53.780
by desperate appeals requesting physical violence.

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:57.060
In their city PD uniforms, the pair approached

01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:00.840
under the guise of officers looking for the records office.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.320
In the elevator, John Lee Pettymore began to mumble

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.560
and pulled a Sharpie from his pocket.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.720
He put the marker to the elevator wall

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.440
and wrote the familiar cipher of Bruce Robin.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.000
The third floor was similarly dark and silent

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.280
and the doors to both 328 gifts house

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.840
and the show dorm room across the hall were open.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.660
The show dorm room was covered in numbers

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:29.360
like every other surface in this building.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.360
And there was an out of place Casio keyboard

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.900
in the middle of the room with a sheet of music

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:35.940
on the stand.

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.040
However, instead of notes on the staff

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.240
the sheet music is made of little cartoon pictures,

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:46.000
seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon and another egg.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.960
Keith pushed on a few of the keys

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.800
and the electronic piano was set

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.520
to make the sound of jingle bells.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.160
Keith put the silly sheet music in his pocket

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.320
and continued investigating the display dorm.

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.520
A window looked out on the overly festive campus.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.080
In the middle of the quad was a large old bell tower.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.760
Keith ignored that and found a flyer for the jingle ball

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.320
and written on the back was a math equation.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.040
The solution to this problem was 330,

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.040
the number of the room in which he stood.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.380
Keith ignored that and headed across the hall

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:25.040
to Harriet Marks's room with the mumbling John in tow.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:28.520
In 328 Gift's house, Keith found trophies

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:33.240
for riddle solving competitions on the desk of Amelia Locke,

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:37.320
a desk which clearly lacked a laptop.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.440
The charging cord and various USB accoutrement

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:45.440
wreathed a rectangular negative space on its surface.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.640
On scrap paper, Keith found a handwritten note from Amelia

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:53.420
that outlined her views on the suicide of her roommate.

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:56.860
She clearly did not believe Harriet was suicidal

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.180
and she wrote she had a plan to figure out

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:00.820
what actually happened.

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:02.580
Keith went through Harriet's things

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.700
and found a tucked away sticky note

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.440
with a two point to do list.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:13.440
The first, research most unethical corporation in the city.

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.580
The second, who is the overseer?

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.620
Clark and Leon approached the two figures

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.860
in the hall outside the admin office.

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.780
A short and slight freshman jumped up

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.940
and poked a tall, well-dressed student with perfect hair.

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.420
The little one begged to be hit

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.980
and the tall one calmly declined.

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:36.620
Defeated, the short dude ran to a wall,

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:39.180
slammed his head against it and yelled

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:42.860
that doing it himself just wasn't the same.

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.880
Clark and Leon approached and the tall student

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.980
calmly asked for a moment as he stared up

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:51.580
at a banner above the office window that read,

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.380
at the end of the 10th day,

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.740
my true love had given me blank gifts.

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.600
Leon ignored the scene entirely

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.260
and entered the unlocked administration office.

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:07.820
The crazed, small student requested pain from Clark

01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:10.420
who asked why the kid would wanna be hit so badly.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.620
The student said he would love it

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:16.420
and then suddenly started to spout some numbers off.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.120
Clark asked about the numbers.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.000
The student didn't recall saying any numbers.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.680
Clark hit him and he crumpled the floor in delight

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.120
before scampering off into the darkness.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.320
Clark asked if the tall, calm student

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.920
was thinking of numbers at all.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.840
He said no.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:38.120
Leon reiterated the question and flipped on the lights

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.440
which revealed countless numbers

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.220
covering the walls of the hall.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.800
The tall student affirmed he didn't even know

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.240
the numbers were there

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.860
and he introduced himself as Donovan West Haven.

01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:53.760
Donovan West something explained

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.680
he was just trying to work out the riddle on the banner.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.280
After some debate about how to solve

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.920
the gift counting riddle,

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.140
Clark and Leon agreed to investigate the office instead.

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.180
The single computer was password protected.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:11.880
On the desk sat pictures of a woman in her early 20s

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.440
holding trophies for scavenger hunts.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:17.760
The name on the trophies, Amelia Locke.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:20.560
There was also a photo of a group of students

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.480
holding up a banner that said Best R.A. Gifts House.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.600
Clark suggested their best bet

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.820
would be to head to Locke's dorm.

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.540
Donovan asked if he could tag along.

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.560
He would, after all, need help solving the other riddles.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.720
On the way to Gifts House,

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.840
they could hear strange whoops and hollers

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.400
from unseen people all over campus.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.280
Inside Gifts House, the lights were out.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.520
Clark motioned for Leon to investigate

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.000
the receptionist's computer

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.920
while Clark hollered a hello down the empty hall.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.400
Donovan wandered into a smaller hallway

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.560
and lights suddenly came on.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.880
Numbers covered everything and from behind a door

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.880
at the end of this hall came a desperate no, no, no,

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:11.800
followed by a sequence of numbers.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.520
The door cracked slightly

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.480
and a voice very creepily reached out.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.840
Please turn out the lights.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.920
Donovan obliged and slowly backed out of the hallway

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:31.920
and a genuine thank you oozed from the room.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.760
Clark warned Donovan that if he heard numbers like that,

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.360
he might want to close his ears.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.360
But Clark still wasn't sure how exactly

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.800
this thing spread so he went to ask Leon,

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.220
who'd already put on noise canceling headphones.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:47.880
Clark tapped him on the shoulder

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.840
and Leon tapped the computer screen

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.760
that showed the room number of Amelia Locke

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.380
and her roommate, Harriet Marks.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.800
When asked, Donovan said people

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.880
had been shouting numbers at him constantly.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.220
Clark wondered if he'd had any blackouts

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.840
or gabs in his memory but Donovan replied no,

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.800
he felt pretty good actually.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.120
Clark pondered aloud whether Donovan

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.120
might be the thing they were looking for.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.760
It seemed like he could be immune.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.960
The trio headed up to Amelia and Harriet's room

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.800
on the third floor.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.200
Clark Bishop, Leon Simpson and Donovan Westerfuck

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.240
approached 328 Giff's house

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.260
and found John and Keith already there.

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.320
John snapped out of a haze as they entered

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.880
and mumbled something about being able to do anything.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.800
Keith explained they'd come across a dead body

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.740
in the elevator when John went blank

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.400
and started writing the Bruce Robin numbers.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.780
Clark asked John if he remembered writing the numbers

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:52.780
and John asked Clark if he had ever felt quote, immense.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.440
Clark introduced Donovan to John and Keith

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.060
and revealed there was a chance Donovan was the key

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.800
to all this, that he might be immune to the numbers.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.960
John walked directly into a wall

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.400
and confessed he was still working out the kinks.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.980
The reconvened team put their heads together

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:15.400
on the riddle from the banner and came up with 330.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.960
The room across the hall where Keith already found

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.840
a piece of paper that depicted illustrations

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:24.360
of seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.680
and another egg set upon a music staff

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.800
atop a Casio keyboard.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.000
Keith then presented the to-do list from Harriet's desk.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.160
One, research the most unethical corporation in the city.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.040
Two, who is the overseer?

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.760
He also had a note from Amelia's desk

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.640
where she wrote she didn't believe Harriet

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.400
would commit suicide and she was going to get

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.080
to the bottom of it.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.160
They hit the first letters of each cartoon

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.900
as notes on the Casio keyboard.

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:58.120
It's the melody of Jingle Bells

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.520
and out the window of 330 Gift's house

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.320
they watched the bell tower in the center

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:09.320
of the CSU campus light up in all its holiday glory.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.160
This not so subtle clue led the party

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.500
to a pleasant stroll through campus,

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:21.040
admiring the crisp white snow, festive decorations

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.560
and constant screaming on their way

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.160
to the lit old bell tower.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.760
They climbed the spiral staircase behind Keith

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.000
who warned them to close their eyes

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.260
to not look at the corpse of an almost retired security guard

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.900
some of them listened.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.540
The interior of the bell tower and the corpse

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.900
were also covered in numbers.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.800
At the top of the tower they met an attractive young woman

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.260
named ShamWow Chameleon who recited the numbers

01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:52.840
for Harriet Marks as she desperately tried

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.480
to get onto the roof of the tower.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.400
Keith saw a sleigh lit up across the way

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.520
which indicated the Jingle Ball

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.800
was in the Accord Student Center.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.840
John accidentally let slip to Leon

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:11.320
that at least some of them might possibly also be ball.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:14.440
Keith and John helped ShamWow out of the bell tower

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.280
and onto the roof and the group headed off across campus

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.920
to go to the Jingle Ball.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.800
On the journey a path of colorful string lights

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.240
led to a sitting area which contained a ripe corpse

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:33.800
and a frantic dancer who pointed to the student union.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.000
They entered the Accord Student Center

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.320
on the middle floor of a three story atrium

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.880
filled with the pure chaos

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.440
of wholly obsessive students and faculty.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:49.880
On their level a girl shaved a team of live reindeer

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.520
with a blunt knife and glued the fur to herself.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.200
On the floor below a pair of muscular young men

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.480
in Santa outfits diligently wrapped a student

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.320
in wrapping paper with duct tape and force.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.200
Above an older woman in a bathrobe

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.560
and an aviator hat climbed a garland to the top floor.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.480
A huge disco ball and a Santa hat

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.440
hung from the middle of the domed ceiling.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.440
On the lower level a naked man used a mop

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.080
and bucket full of paint to write out numbers.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.480
An ice skating rink contained three people dressed as elves.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.440
They placed carrots in various locations

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.760
on a life size snowman model and laughed hysterically.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.600
A young woman in a t-shirt that identified her

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.240
as a gifts house RA threw a laptop in the air

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:48.680
over and over again while spinning around.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:52.200
A man doing squats on top of Santa's throne

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.280
suddenly stopped.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.800
He looked out, wild eyed and screamed,

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.000
Tawil alagool, Tawil alagool.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.920
John with the power in his mind

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.680
commanded the chanting man to stop.

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.680
Unfortunately to no avail.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.600
Keith shot the guy and he collapsed

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.240
into the Santa Claus throne.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:16.760
However, he was not dead and continued to chant.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.360
The gunshot grabbed the attention of the assembly

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.000
in the atrium and they changed their behaviors.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.840
The woman with the fur sharpened the reindeer's antlers.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.040
The Santa twins wrapped each other

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.800
instead of the other students.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.200
The ascending woman climbed faster.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.360
The elves took off their skates

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.560
and the girl with the laptop threw it

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.800
even higher than before.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.520
John accidentally shot two reindeer.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.040
Clark ran toward the laptop girl.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.440
Keith shot one of the Santa twins to death.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.760
Leon gave Donovan a gun and escorted him to a safe spot.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.840
Suddenly, the frenzied throng froze

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.320
and began the chants.

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.960
The man in Santa's chair jumped

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:06.080
and impaled himself on the post of the throne.

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.240
The laptop landed on the side of the spinning woman's head

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.200
and knocked her out cold.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.640
Clark grabbed the laptop

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.160
and checked the unconscious RA's vitals.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:21.040
As the rest of the deranged chanting party

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:25.840
executed their elaborate and festive suicides,

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.840
Emilia Locke took her last breath in Clark's arms.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.800
The atrium of the Accord Student Center

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.960
was a suddenly still disgusting mess.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.480
The PA crossfaded out of the classic mashup

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.040
of Wonderful Christmastime by Sir Paul McCartney

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.520
and Grown Up by Danny Brown,

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.400
replaced by a horrifying rendition of Santa Baby

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.480
by Tyler the Creator.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:58.520
John and Clark fell back into their unnatural malaise

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.360
and scrawled the numbers for Bruce Robin

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:04.720
all over whatever mess they sat in.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.040
Leon Simpson, for the first time,

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.760
fell to the ground to write out a sequence of numbers.

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.800
Donovan was still conscious and present,

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.800
but absolutely shook.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.240
Keith solved Leon Simpson's new cipher,

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.520
the solve Ben Smith,

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.840
who Keith recognized after a quick Google search

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.560
happened to be the corpse nearest,

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.960
the now dazed member of the circle of knowledge.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.120
Still the only team member up in Adam,

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.600
Keith opened Emilia Locke's laptop.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.120
He found screenshots

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.400
from the CSU Biology Department Twitter account.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.920
The first read,

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.080
a few of us who are not infected

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.760
are quarantined in the lab.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.520
Please call 911.

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.760
Our calls are not going through.

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.880
The second was in all caps.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.680
Call 911, CSU campus infected with a virus.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.320
Please help, we are trapped.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.520
Call 911.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.080
And the final tweet pleaded.

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.720
We're still quarantined in the lab.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.760
If you are the person or entity scrubbing this page,

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.480
please have a heart.

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.240
We are running low on supplies.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.920
There were also two videos

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.720
and small windows open on the desktop.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:21.360
One showed Harriet Marks sitting in her dorm room.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.600
The other was a dark and distorted picture

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.480
with only a lit candle in frame.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.920
Clark and John snapped back to reality,

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.920
but Leon Simpson began dancing

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.200
like his life depended on it.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.000
Keith showed Clark the laptop,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.800
but Clark was far more interested

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.000
in the glow than the content.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.040
Leon's phone went off and he continued to boogie down

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.280
with no concern for his surroundings.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.240
Due to his groove,

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.600
the buzzing flip phone popped out of Simpson's trousers.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.400
Clark grabbed it for the glow,

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.720
but noticed 25 missed calls

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.240
and an interesting text thread.

01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.840
Responding to, how's it going?

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:03.360
Leon sent, the secretary is stubborn,

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.760
looking for another option.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.080
That was the last outgoing message,

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:11.560
but there was a barrage of words from the other side.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.840
In short stabs, they wrote, I don't want excuses, pick up.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.280
Okay, I sent them.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.200
T.O. will be ready for extraction.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.440
Don't forget to get the signatures.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:28.440
E.T.A., question mark, Jesus Christ, what is going on?

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.320
Question mark, question mark, question mark,

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.080
before the longer final message.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.240
If he doesn't get here in time, this is all over.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:41.800
Everything we've worked for, everything that exists,

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.880
just gone, for what?

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.840
Your fucking conscience?

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.440
Morality won't save us.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.400
They all assumed it was Maggie on the other end,

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.320
so Clark responded, hey, it's Clark.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.720
Donovan led the group to Glass Hall,

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.960
which housed the biology lab.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.600
Clark received a text on his mysterious burner.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.840
He had asked, what book, where?

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.800
And this message read, your book.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.280
Calm, comfy campground.

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.960
Leon's phone also received a text.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.000
It said, fuck, what did you do?

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.040
From both phones, Clark Bishop sent the question,

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.560
who is this?

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.680
And on both phones, he got the same response.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.160
Destiny.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.440
The walk across campus was soundtracked

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:33.000
by a cacophony of guttural moans,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.480
which danced on the cold December winds.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.440
In the quad, they saw ShamWow Chameleon

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.440
as she steadied herself on the sanctified minion blow up

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:48.240
atop the bell tower and screamed about getting even higher.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.680
In the far distance, the chopping of helicopter blades

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:55.360
slowly but surely grew louder and louder.

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.360
Given the option between a longer lit path

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.360
and a shorter one in darkness,

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.320
Clark persuaded the group to stay in the light.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.040
Around a well-lit corner, an old man moaned

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.560
and took a citrus peeler to his frail fingers.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.760
Keith saw this horror and lost it again.

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.360
The group, sans vigna,

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.880
deciphered this old man's number sequence

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.720
and learned the name belonged to a coworker

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:24.840
who hanged himself in front of this bloody mad old-timer.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.960
They continued on to Glass Hall Keith came to

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:32.960
and they found a child meticulously sticking syringes

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.560
into a somehow unmoving student's eyeballs.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.080
With that, John and Keith

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.440
were lost in their numbers once again.

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.760
Inside Glass Hall, the sounds of a few deranged folk

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.200
bounced and echoed through the halls.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:52.040
A trail of blood slowly dripped down the stairwell

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:55.600
which had a few bloody screwdrivers scattered about.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:59.680
On their way down the wet, sticky stairs to the biology lab,

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:01.840
Keith Vigna tripped, fell,

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.720
and knocked something loose in his head.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.440
He popped up ecstatic

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.720
and grabbed what he thought were handfuls of cash

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:14.320
but were, in reality, handfuls of bloody screwdrivers.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.880
He stuffed them into all of his pockets

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.120
and, for good measure, pulled a few out of a woman's corpse

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:23.880
while he smiled and yelled they were rich.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:27.800
Keith Vigna then crammed his finger deep into his nose

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.960
and sniffed with all of his lungs.

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.960
Eyes wide, he shoved his finger into Clark Bishop's nose

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:42.960
who did not expect a heaping bump of pure cocaine.

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.360
Clark immediately went blank,

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.720
but instead of numbers, he chanted,

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.360
Ta will alico.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.640
In the basement of Glass Hall,

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:57.720
the team stood just outside of the biology lab.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.440
Keith Vigna collected bloody screwdrivers

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.400
he thought were cash.

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.320
John Lee Pettymore talked down to everyone

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.280
like a god might.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.360
Donovan Wester-something-or-other panicked.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.240
Leon Simpson boogied and Clark Bishop chanted.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.840
The lights went out and the red emergency lights activated.

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.600
An ominous glow illuminated the party

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.240
as the entrance of Glass Hall burst open.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.600
Orders were shouted.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.960
Crazed voices were silenced.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.080
Clark grabbed one of Keith's dripping screwdrivers.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.480
A small canister was tossed down the stairs

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:40.320
and a thick gas came pouring out of it.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.440
Clark sharpened his screwdriver.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.680
Keith and Donovan rushed into the lab.

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.240
Leon danced.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:51.200
Down the stairs stormed a squad in tactical gear.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.240
They shouted and tossed more gas canisters.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.360
Clark jammed the sharpened screwdriver into his eye

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:02.320
until the handle was flush with his socket.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.240
Blood dripped down his face

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:09.120
and Clark Bishop crumpled to the ground,

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.400
limp and lifeless.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.080
John stared at the scene, began chanting

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.560
and ran into the lab.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.400
Inside, a man and a woman in lab coats

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.000
sat turned away at a desk.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.840
The woman greeted the group and asked

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.360
if they knew how to fix the situation.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.800
Back in the hallway, Leon started chanting

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.600
and fell to the ground, surrounded by the tactical squad.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.240
John aimed his gun at the door

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.760
and waited for the incursion.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.960
Barbara, the woman in the lab coat,

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.160
insisted that she and Phillip were just fine,

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.560
much like Donovan Whateverhaven.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.480
She asked Phillip to explain, but he didn't move.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.640
Donovan, worried he might be the only sane person

01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:00.920
left on Earth, looked to John for help,

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:04.880
but John was turning his firearm on himself.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.920
So, Jonathan fired at John to try to disable him

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.120
from committing suicide, but he missed

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:14.800
and sent a bullet right into the CSU biology department's

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.920
prized anti-virus machine.

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.360
Barbara turned Phillip's chair around

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.640
so he could see this madness,

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:28.280
but Phillip held his own eyeballs in his hands

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.200
and dried blood covered his face below

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.800
his empty eye sockets.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.480
The raid from the tactical squad began.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.960
Smoke filled the lab.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.800
John looked around the room and smiled.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.440
Finally at peace, John Lee Pettymore the third

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.680
shot himself in the head.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.320
Keith prepared for a showdown and Donovan went to his knees,

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.360
submitted and asked for help.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.480
One of the infiltrating squad members

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.800
placed an oxygen mask on Donovan

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.840
and he immediately fell asleep,

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:03.160
but high on disillusion and cocaine,

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.960
Keith Vigna murdered two of the troops

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.080
with bloody screwdrivers

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.600
before they eventually ended his life.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.160
Through the haze and red emergency lights,

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:21.960
we see the two casualties of Keith's screwdrivers,

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.360
lifeless in pools of their own blood.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.240
The camera leaves the lab,

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.360
passes the elderly pile of a corpse in the hallway,

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.440
moves up the stairs and out of glass hall.

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.600
The CSU campus is humming.

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.480
Sirens are constant.

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.600
Limp bodies are being transported by teams of two

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.480
in full tactical gear

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.720
and dragged into prison transport buses.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.040
The sky is littered with unmarked black helicopters.

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:58.320
We see one hovering above the minion atop the bell tower,

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:03.320
a rope ladder allowing ShamWow Chameleon to get even higher.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.440
As we leave the CSU campus,

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.400
we see a confluence of black SUVs

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.800
heading toward one of the taller buildings

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.520
of the city skyline,

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.720
a building that is being climbed

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.040
by something massive and spherical.

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.440
We continue past the business district

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.320
and swoop down into the back of a van

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.480
heading out toward the pier.

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:32.480
The broken and upgraded and dead and metal corpses

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.480
of John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.040
are jostling around the posterior of this van

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.760
that pulls up to a grand old edifice,

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.320
alone on the edge of the water

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.520
with a well-lit sign outside that reads,

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.720
The City Asylum.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.840
Inside the front doors are two familiar guards,

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.440
tall and overweight and all black

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.120
with prominent facial scarring.

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.360
After we move down through the floor,

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.760
we are immediately looking through

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:07.400
a long line of the bottoms of feet.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.320
Body after body has been laid out in a row

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.400
covered in sheets, feet sticking out.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.920
We stop on the final four soles.

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.880
Both right feet are blank.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.480
Both left feet have dead skin

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.960
in the shape of the circle of knowledge,

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.520
but one left foot has the name Maggie

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:30.920
burned on top of the seven circles.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.040
Our vision moves up through the ceiling

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.360
and into a small dark room.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:42.160
Donovan Westhaven wakes up to the sounds of beeps

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:47.160
and bloops of a machine that you feel yourself connected to

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:52.160
and you're laying in a hospital bed

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:56.000
in a room that is completely dark

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.120
except for the lights coming from the machine

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.200
on either side of you.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:04.080
You see that your blood is being drawn

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.880
and there is an IV in your other arm

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.160
and then a screen turns on,

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:12.560
a freeze frame of like a webcam video

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:17.560
and it's Harriet Marks and she is mid-chant.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:22.800
Allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:27.800
Towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.920
Towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.040
And then you see at the bottom of the screen,

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:44.040
the barrel of a gun comes up and she squeezes the trigger

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:49.000
and then she with a splatter of blood behind her

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.760
falls back and out of frame of the camera

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.960
and you're just looking at her dorm room

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:56.880
with a paint of blood behind her

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.680
on the wall and on the ceiling and then the video stops.

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:04.360
And a man comes out of the darkness

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.280
in the back corner of the room

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:09.680
and you can see that he's lit by your machines

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:13.160
and he's wearing a black suit with a black tie

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:14.440
and a white shirt.

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:19.680
I need you to tell me everything that happened.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.280
Okay.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:30.280
What's up everybody?

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:42.360
I just wanna drop in here real quick

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.760
to shout out two absolutely indispensable folks

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.640
from over on the Discord who have made this tiresome task

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.560
about 10 times less interminable feeling.

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.320
First, I Shot Marvin.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:58.400
I Shot Marvin wrote up recaps for six episodes.

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.800
They have earned a shirt.

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:02.880
And second, Here Be Tigers.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.080
Here Be Tigers got a name check last time

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.680
because they not only wrote four recaps

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:10.640
but their recaps were super well done.

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.920
Well, they added five more episodes this time around

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:17.480
bringing their total to nine fucking recaps.

01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:20.560
Thank you so, so, so much.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.480
You have so clearly and obviously earned yourself

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.320
an elusive PTBP T-shirt.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.240

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.360

I'm so stupid stoked.

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:42.400
We are dumb grateful for all of you sharing

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.360
in our absurd story.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:49.120

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.840
There's no one home.

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.840
No one home.

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.840
No one home.

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.200
Fly, fly, to the stream you know.
