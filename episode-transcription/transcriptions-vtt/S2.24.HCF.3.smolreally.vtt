00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
Hello, insert audience name.

00:03.400 --> 00:10.000
It is I, Host the Animal, and I am here to verb your... body parts?

00:10.000 --> 00:14.400
Damn, my producer wrote me a weird-ass intro this week.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.800
I'm gonna wing this one, y'all.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.200
Greetings, audience members.

00:19.200 --> 00:27.800
It is I, Wolf the Dog, and I am here to gobble your biscuits and... bake... some... some biscuits.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.100
This shit's too hard, man.

00:30.100 --> 00:33.400
Let's skip to the fan stuff, why don't we?

00:33.400 --> 00:42.800
This blessed edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Cyrus, GW, in Snellville, Georgia,

00:42.800 --> 00:46.800
who tweeted about the show and tagged "@pretendingpod",

00:46.800 --> 00:49.800
a thing you could easily do right now.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.700
Like, so easily.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.300
Just fuckin' do it, dude.

00:54.300 --> 01:02.700
Just type, I listen to "@pretendingpod", and you should, too, if you're nasty enough to handle it.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.000
And tweet. See? Easy.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.600
Be like Cyrus, GW, in Snellville, Georgia.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.500
Cyrus, GW, writes,

01:13.500 --> 01:15.000
Dear Dog,

01:15.000 --> 01:21.700
The only thing that keeps me happy is my favorite DJ Dog the Wolf along with his dog, Wolf,

01:21.700 --> 01:25.700
who plays me sweet new tunes every other week.

01:25.700 --> 01:33.300
I'd like to shout out Becca, Kim, Chris, and Kristen for introducing me to TTRPGs,

01:33.300 --> 01:43.700
and Kane, Ellie, Charlie, Alex, Other Alex, and Emile for lettin' me haunt them with my TTRPG ideas,

01:43.700 --> 01:46.500
which I hope to do again soon.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.900
Wait a second.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.100
This is Dog the Wolf, right?

01:51.100 --> 01:54.300
The wolf that eats my recyclables?

01:54.300 --> 01:56.500
Or is this the wrong number?

01:56.500 --> 02:00.100
Either way, fuck Zuck Markleburg.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.800
Did you just call me Dog?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.100
The wolf?

02:04.100 --> 02:07.500
Get the freakin' hell out of here, buddy.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.200
Thanks for the email, pal.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.300
Hope you have a good one, friend.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.200
And hey, you know what?

02:15.200 --> 02:19.500
I would never chow down on any recyclables.

02:19.500 --> 02:25.700
Only burgeoning bags with bountiful biomass for this beautiful babe.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.800
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,

02:28.800 --> 02:32.900
tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter,

02:32.900 --> 02:36.200
tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,

02:36.200 --> 02:42.300
or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and send it on over,

02:42.300 --> 02:46.300
or make that review a clear message to your wolfie,

02:46.300 --> 02:51.900
and I might just howl it out because of the things you say about little ol' me.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.500
Mmm, I'd like that.

02:54.500 --> 03:00.500
Also, I don't want to be weird about money, but you should sign up for the Patreon.

03:00.500 --> 03:05.300
Hey, it keeps my throat wet with that good, good sloppy juice,

03:05.300 --> 03:09.900
so I can keep howling with the lush flow of words you hear now.

03:09.900 --> 03:16.100
And second, you'll get immediate access to 41 exclusive bonus episodes

03:16.100 --> 03:20.200
on the contention confidential RSS feed.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.900
Y'all know what RSS means, right?

03:22.900 --> 03:25.200
Really super stuff.

03:25.200 --> 03:32.100
The most recent three episodes are the kickoff to a Patreon-exclusive campaign

03:32.100 --> 03:38.900
run by Thomas and sit in the holler outside a contention in the aftermath of season one.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.500
It has been an absolute blast.

03:41.500 --> 03:45.900
Joe, Luke, and Zach are playing members of the Pettymore family

03:45.900 --> 03:49.500
searching for the lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

03:49.500 --> 03:53.900
If that sounds rad as fuck, and that's because it is,

03:53.900 --> 04:00.100
and if you're looking for a link, the links are in the show notes.

04:00.100 --> 04:04.600
And speaking of links, what y'all know about sausages?

04:04.600 --> 04:08.100
It's, uh, it's time for the news.

04:08.100 --> 04:16.400
Last time, Shelly St. Blythe, Jimmy Corrigan, Vincent T. Bory, and Meat Hook

04:16.400 --> 04:21.700
went to the main offices of Holy Cow Farms, set off the alarms,

04:21.700 --> 04:27.500
called Bowery Security, found a few different options for leads,

04:27.500 --> 04:35.000
and viewed some strange security footage of Dr. Brock Hargrave and his missing co-worker.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
With sirens in the distance, they bailed in the weirdest and most chaotic way possible.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.200
They called up Aurin and Aaron Strummer from Strummer's Resonating Crystals,

04:48.200 --> 04:53.200
who are purveyors of crystals and crystal meth, respectively,

04:53.200 --> 04:59.400
and they learned that Dr. Brock Hargrave has been a... smoking meth, I guess?

04:59.400 --> 05:05.800
That's wild. He seemed like he had a good head on his shoulders, good gut instincts.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.000
Guess not.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.500
And Aaron mentioned that Hargrave has been digging holes out by the Zeitgeist,

05:13.500 --> 05:17.500
an abandoned space needle copycat in the city.

05:17.500 --> 05:24.000
Taking us now to what is hopefully the most dysfunctional group at the cowboy's disposal,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.500
it's Hudson Freeman with Muscles R. Springs.

05:37.000 --> 05:55.000
ðŸŽµ

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
ðŸŽµ They fed some consolation ðŸŽµ

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
ðŸŽµ I was thinking the same thing ðŸŽµ

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
ðŸŽµ I am now mechanization ðŸŽµ

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
ðŸŽµ All my muscles work like springs ðŸŽµ

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
And with that... I promised.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
They promised really put me on the spot.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
They made a promise to me.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
They made a promise to the boys. Welcome to episode three of this short arc

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
with our guest player, Becca Scott.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Woo!

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Oh, hello.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
She came back for a third episode.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I debated. You know?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I thought about, what happens if I never come back?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
That's right.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
You just walk away. End of the night.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Meat Hook just dipped in her sewer and... who knows?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Did she wash into the ocean? Was there a rainstorm?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Did she find some other way to get electricity?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Or the hole?

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
I think Fishface had something to do with it.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
There's your cue.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
What? Oh, sorry. What?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Fishface, you're here in the intro?

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Oh yeah, here I'm in the intro and I think I can hang out for a second.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, you don't need to be here until we call in.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Okay, bye.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Wow.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
The longest amount of time Fishface ever went without someone telling him to leave.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
I got a William H. Macy face on because that shit...

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Oh boy, it was shameless.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Let's get into this. We've got a lot of...

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I was trying to get through his filmography.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Because that shit was Fargo.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
And so, this group was headed to the zeitgeist.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
I want a quick rundown of the interior of this stretch,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Escalade, as well as the...

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Were we headed to the zeitgeist?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I thought we specifically said we were saving that for last

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
and there was another place to go, but I may be wrong.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
You said that first.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Right, we called...

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Let the DM direct it where the story is.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
Don't tell him he's giving away where he wants us to go next.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Strummer's Resonating Crystals was called

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
and I think after that phone conversation with both Aaron and Arin Strummer...

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Vincente is going to make a little more money after this.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
That's right.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
The phone call with him, I think, pointed us more strongly towards the zeitgeist.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah, he was doing some digging out there.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Oh right, we were going to go...

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
And there's a telescope in the top.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Does anyone want luck for whoever says the name of whoever's doing the digging first?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Dr. Brock Hargrave.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Ooh, so close.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Dr. Brock Hargrave.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Sam Luke gets luck.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Luck.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Hey, I'll split it with you.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
We each have half a luck.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
That sounds useful.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
So the way that we use luck in this game is you can spend luck if you have luck

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
or you don't have luck.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
It's like a switch that's turned on or off.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And when you do have luck, you can turn your luck off by changing a dice roll

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and you change the dice roll just by switching the numbers.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
So if it's critical...

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Just like real life.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Numbers match.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
So you can't ever use luck on a crit.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
That is a fun little wrinkle in this.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
But if you've got a 50 and you roll a 54, you can use luck and make it a 45 and pass.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Boomtown.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah, I know math. I'm with you.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
And because you're our guest player, I'll give you luck as well.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Our listeners are not educated people, so...

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, I see.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Let's get this luck economy off the ground.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
And for the wonderful, wonderful role-playing in the last couple episodes as me took,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I would like to award a luck here to Becca.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
You're brown-nosing.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
No luck for the other two, but you'll get it quickly.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Sorry, I am half a luck.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Oh, that's right. That's my bad.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
We'll see how that's spent later, I guess.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Probably going to give it back to Luke.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
So give me the rundown.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Who looks like what?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Who's doing what?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Who's driving what?

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Who's driving what on these dark, dark roads?

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
Heading out to the outskirts of the city, out away from downtown, out away from the district,

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
where the office building was that you just strangled a random cleaner, threw them in their own van,

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
headed inside, set off the alarms, called the alarm company, made it worse,

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
and then talked to a security guard and talked to the woman who you knocked out.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
She saw some of your faces and saw your stretch.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Dorothy.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah, Dorothy saw your stretch escalate drive away as well and left her there,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
headed off into the night to the zeitgeist.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I mean, not only did you talk to the security guard, you got up to some legitimate escapades.

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah, I sent them off after the tall, I think shirtless, long fingernailed.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I remember the long person.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
But you also got there in the first place by running two blocks away to fire gunshots and draw their attention.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Right.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
Because the rest of us got winded on the stairs.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Carrie and Joe's character.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
Well, I think Vincente is sitting in one of the many seats in this stretch escalate,

11:24.000 --> 11:31.000
and he's pouring Perrier in champagne flutes for the three people in?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm in there, yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I guess five.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
I'm pouring one for Goomba, the driver, and also for Fishface.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Hey, thank you.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I really appreciate that.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Oh, hey, thank you.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Oh, you can't pour a drink for the...

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Well, you know what?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
It's your game.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
It's a Perrier.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
You can drink it.

11:45.000 --> 11:54.000
Meat Hook is poised on the floor of the Escalade because she's not used to riding in style like this

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
and kind of looks like a cat with tape stuck to her.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I'll take that champagne though.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Thank you.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
It's Perrier, but he just hands it to her.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
Oh, but now that she mentions it, is there perhaps a spirit or two in the car here with us?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
She chugs it.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Has she ever had spicy water before?

12:16.000 --> 12:24.000
You mean like a bottle of whiskey a night or just carbonated water?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Carbonated water.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
I think not if there wasn't cola as well.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, this is new.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Like only if the syrup had run out.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
This is the smoothest champagne I've ever stolen.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I didn't steal this one though.

12:39.000 --> 12:48.000
To answer Shelly's question, Vincente just kind of motions towards the back, which is like a double door refrigerator.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Double door refrigerator?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Double door refrigerator.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Double door refrigerator.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
Shelly finds the gin and starts pouring himself just a tumbler of straight gin.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Oh, yes, this will calm the nerves.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
And what is happening in the Jeep that Jimmy Corrigan?

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
He's driving hands at 10 and 2, no music.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Oh, no.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Eyes constantly moving.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I was really hoping you would say just silent.

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah, just a situational awareness is the most important asset you have at any given time.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Okay, hit me with the mindset. What's running through Jimmy Corrigan's mind?

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
I bet he's drinking gin in there.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Such situational awareness.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I bet Shelly got to the gin.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
I bet the kid thinks Perrier is champagne.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
You know that Jimmy fella, he never used to let me drink in the car.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
Well, this isn't really a car as much as it is a lifestyle.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
This is some lifestyle.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
We're used to a kid if we make it out of here.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Luke, not Vincenzi, that's a really good point.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
And should we all invest in a stretch Escalade?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
For the lifestyle.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
You guys are heading to the Zeitgeist, which is an abandoned space needle.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
And I think that Dylan B. from Deadwood, South Dakota did an excellent job describing the Zeitgeist.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So I'm just going to go ahead and read this.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
It'll give you some backstory, some history of the Zeitgeist within the city that you would all kind of be aware of.

14:17.000 --> 14:27.000
The Zeitgeist is a tower so clearly traced from Seattle's space needle that it hovers an embarrassed wallflower on the outskirts of the city.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
It is primarily aesthetic by design and it fulfills this purpose to the detriment of all others.

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
The free outdoor observation deck has rusted and fallen away into the surrounding woods.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
The expensive rotating restaurant is quietly creaked to a halt inside.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
Its facade is as weathered and gray, but when the Zeitgeist's lights blink on among the foothills,

14:51.000 --> 15:00.000
the weary citizens of the nearby city will still sometimes prod their children and tell them again that the aliens have come, cresting the horizon.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And the children will laugh or cry or ignore them altogether.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
In its heyday, celebration packages included neon mocktails and costumed servers,

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
the parting gift, a white cotton t-shirt that read,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
I was abducted at the Zeitgeist.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
The phrase gained notoriety during a series of kidnappings in 2013 and was quietly retired.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
I was thinking about turning this place into a t-shirt the whole fucking time you were reading that and then they did it for us.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yep, they did it.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
You don't get any of the profits.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Sorry.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
The Zeitgeist is bright and gaudy and it makes no sound.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
The forest's silent carnival.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
Dylan! Oh my god! Everybody else is fired.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Dylan, where's your podcast?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah, this is your podcast now, Dylan.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
It's your podcast.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
It's heavy. Good luck.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
Did stories of the Zeitgeist play a big part in Meat Hook's formative years?

15:58.000 --> 16:09.000
Actually, Meat Hook was abducted at the Zeitgeist, but only because her parents left her there on purpose.

16:09.000 --> 16:21.000
And after a few weeks of just wandering up and down the elevator, eventually she was abducted by a kind of creepy guy in a van and that was Fishface.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Hey, what's up? Hearing your memory.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
What is the age disparity between Meat Hook and Fishface?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Probably like 15 years.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Okay.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I feel more conflicted about pushing this.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
Divide about a 2 plus 7 is fine. Bye.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Uh, wow.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Vroom, vroom. We're going.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Dylan really wrote that, huh?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Dylan really wrote that. Good job, Dylan.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
And you guys are heading out into...

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Into the Zeitgeist.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Into the Zeitgeist.

17:01.000 --> 17:11.000
The grounds are kind of just on a park that is still sometimes used. It's open. However, it is just kind of mostly abandoned.

17:11.000 --> 17:20.000
All of the restrooms haven't been cleaned in ages. The parking lot is overrun with weeds and shit from the bathroom.

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
Just pouring out, making a flowing river down the hill. It's a long, long hill.

17:27.000 --> 17:34.000
This parking lot is simply on an incline. One should park sideways according to where the parking spots are.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
But if you park according to where the parking spots are, you should use a parking brake.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
And in this parking lot, you see a turquoise 2001 Ford Escort and no other cars.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I used to drive a Ford Escort. Me too, dude.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Not Meat Hook. Back up.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Meat Hook's never had a car.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
It's got Missouri plates somewhere out there.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I had a Ford Escort hatchback.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
Mine was a ZX2. I could drive a stick. I assume I still can.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
Meat Hook rolls down the window of the Escalade, takes a deep breath, breathing in the sewage, and says,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Smells like home.

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
Shelley used to party here back when it was in its heyday. Back when it was an actually nice restaurant up top that served those fancy drinks.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
Oh my. It's been years since I've been out here. I didn't realize that they let it fall into such a disrepair.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I had such glorious days here.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
I've been out here a handful of times. I'm kind of worried that he's digging holes out here.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
He might, you know, find a little present we left over the years.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
By he, you mean Shelley's nemesis?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah, Mr. Dr. Brock.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Mark McGriff.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
And by present, you mean dead bodies?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Who knows?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Got it.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
God's gift to the earth.

18:49.000 --> 19:02.000
Well, wasn't it? Okay. Yeah. God's gift anyway. You know, humanity and whatnot. If you believe such things. I don't. I believe we are descended from, well, that's a whole other story.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
The planet Krypton.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I'm sorry. Meat Hook used to be explicitly Christian.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Did you not read the entire contract?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Oh yeah, that contract.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
We're descended from aliens, but who made the aliens?

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
Well, I have two theories. One is the lizard government and two is the underground people we're about to become.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And who made both of those?

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
She goes cross-eyed trying to cross-reference all of her conspiracy theories at once.

19:36.000 --> 19:46.000
It's a heavy summer night and the humidity is weighing on each and every one of you. Kind of each breath almost like you're swimming through it. It's so thick.

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
It's just quite warm out this evening and the grass is green. Nailed it.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
Hey, doc. You're an anthropologist or a paleontologist or some kind of ologist.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
If you were out here digging, looking for something, where would you start?

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
Of course I would start with the ground and if that didn't yield anything, I would move along.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Which area of this ground?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Oh, um, perhaps.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead and roll.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
That's a 40 on a 50.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Maybe give out Craig and you can use him like a divining rod.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Incredible.

20:26.000 --> 20:37.000
Craig is not a divining rod. He's one of my actors. He's not some toy to be played with. He puts on serious performances.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
I'm sorry that I respected that he had other talents besides just acting, but we'll leave him to it.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Jimmy walks up at this point and he drops a couple bags down and he says,

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
where I come from, we called him witching rods, but here's the thing. If you want to know where he's dig.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
If you want to know where he has dug.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
We should probably just look for the holes.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Is the past tense?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Digged.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Did my anthropology role throw me into a spot?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah, absolutely it did.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
I believe if I were here and I was leading an excavation, it would be over here. This is where the ground is most disturbed.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Oh, definitely disturbed. You see that there are some mounds that are already like...

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Mounded.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah, out of the ground elsewhere.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
They've been de-grounded.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Sitting above where they used to be.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
You can see here that the dirt has been de-grounded. We should start our search here.

21:37.000 --> 21:49.000
And you continue to look and looking down at the ground, you all kind of notice as your eyes adjust to the dark up in this area that is kind of in a clearing up by the zeitgeist itself.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
The trees kind of surround you and looking down, you see mound after mound after mound.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
It's like puberty.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
And then two holes.

22:04.000 --> 22:12.000
They're at the ends that have not been filled in, but the rest are clearly where the ground was dugged up.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Digged.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And then it was splatted back down, slapped on into the ground.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
So hold and un-hold back in?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Fucked and un-fucked.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
And I need whoever has SIGINT. If anyone has above basic SIGINT, go ahead and roll that.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
That's me even though I forgot what it means.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Signals.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
I know signals.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
We got a 35 under 40. That's a success.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Fuck yeah, so I failed.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
But it doesn't matter. Meat Hook's got my back.

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
Meat Hook always has your back unless you cross her and then she will stab you in the back six to seven times with her butterfly knife.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Oh I like to hear that.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
For a grown man you might need to stab upwards of a dozen times to really put them down.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Well yeah, I'm not trying to kill anybody.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Anything that comes out of your mouth is only making me like you better, kid.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Thanks. Most people find me very off-putting.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
Meat Hook, you should join the army. You shouldn't join his criminal organization. It was the best thing I ever did with my life.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
I don't follow rules. Too good.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
They'll teach you.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
No, I don't like being taught things.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Maybe you should join his criminal enterprise.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
We don't make you learn anything except how to kill better.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
If you need to, we try not to do it all the time though.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
It's the 21st century.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
The army is the same thing with buddies.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Perhaps you'd like to become an archaeologist?

23:38.000 --> 23:48.000
Look, I got a job. It's called handing out pamphlets and flyers on the street corner and finding out what's really going on.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Which is what we need to do right now. You got a pamphlet for this?

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Meat Hook can kind of figure out what's going on right now. Becca, I've shared my screen with you.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
I see it.

23:58.000 --> 24:10.000
So this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten mounds that are completely filled back in and then two empty holes. So twelve total.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
Hold on. Stand back. Pretend you're up real high and look at these mounds. Don't you all see it?

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
There's a backwards L and then a tiny little L and then a little straight line with two mounds.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
And then, you know, like an F but missing the other across line.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
It's Braille. It says hashtag HCF.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Hashtag?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Is that what it says?

24:39.000 --> 24:49.000
That is what it says. And you would know from your knowledge of signals that when you were using Braille, you put the number sign before letters.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
The letters are interacting with numbers on the alphabet in a direct way. So A is one, B is two.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
Okay, so H is eight, C is three, and F is six. Someone else figure this out.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
Becca, he fucking loves Braille puzzles. He tried to do this shit to me on my 30th birthday while I was on acid.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
He's like, figure out this Braille puzzle, motherfucker.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
I think it's eight, three, six. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. I nailed it. First try.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
You absolutely got it. And you also notice that the H, C, and F seem familiar to you for why?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Hard cousin fuckers.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Hard cousin fuckers.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Cousin?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Heart grade.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Heffers. Cheese?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Perhaps if I...

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Holy cow farms.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
If I put an exclamation point here, there would...

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Holy cow farms.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
Wait, are the numbers also important, or did you just have her translate it from letters to numbers back to letters?

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Translate it back into letters. Genius. A perfect code.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
It's just how Braille works, man.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Actually, you know what? I don't even know if that's true. It's how this online Braille translator works.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Nice.

26:14.000 --> 26:14.000


26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
So the numbers did not actually matter? Is that what you're saying?

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Everything matters, Joe.

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
These words also come out of Meat Hook's mouth at the same time that any players may have heard them.

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
It all has significance, okay? The stars? They were put there to send us messages.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
Yeah, you're telling me I saw the stars align into another star with flames and eyes.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
And that's how I got here in the first place.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
How did we never talk about that? That's a lot.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
I don't know. It's why I started my whole moon rock business on the side.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
You're talking to the biggest star signal guy in the whole town.

26:56.000 --> 27:02.000
I literally watched and threw my telescope as the stars arranged themselves differently.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
And that's how I got wound up in this whole mess.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
I'm doing freaking mythical quests on the side while I'm running the family business.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Okay, Vincente. I have to tell you something that may be hard to hear.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Tell me.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
You might not be real.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
What? What does that even mean?

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
I don't know. It's just, it came to me.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
I think that you could be a figment of our imagination here to tell us a message.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
You could be just with the aliens, like they're signposts, you know?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
But your intelligence is artificial. Do you ever think about that?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
You're the simulation, maybe, man.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Can I roll to see if Vincente wants to literally just-

27:47.000 --> 27:47.000


27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Roll grip.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
If that's true, I do not pass my grip.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Roll a d4.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Because you gave, your option was like believing it.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
Two. So I believe it. And I want to, I'll lose two.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
I want to think really hard and whatever the first thing that comes to my mind, that is what I believe the message is.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
Okay, so what is the internal monologue of Vincente Bory?

28:14.000 --> 28:22.000
First things first, first thing in your mind, mounds on the ground, dirt all around, the space needle above you, the zeitgeist.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
We need to get up to the top of the needle and drop something into these holes.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
And it'll all make sense.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
I'm with you.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
You were sent here to tell us that, so I'm with you.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
It's not a bad idea.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Vincente then tries to see if he can just float.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this a trust fall?

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
He's doing like the Chris Angel mind freak float thing where he's just actually up on one like tippy toe.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
And he's like, I'll try, I'll try later.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I want to look in the holes.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
The empty ones are the ones that have been filled.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah, so it's about four feet deep, about two feet wide, about three feet long.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Yeah, he could drop something in here real good.

29:07.000 --> 29:13.000
Inside is dirt and some rock from the local under what the rock that's under the ground kind of rocks.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Oh, city stone.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Yeah. You would recognize it as a highlight.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Oh, this is a beautiful specimen of highlight here.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
That's the kind of thing Shelley would know.

29:25.000 --> 29:25.000


29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
Okay, well, while you're jizzing over that, I'm going to go take a look at this Ford Escort.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Ford Escort.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
Back out in the parking lot, Meat Hook is seeing this Ford Escort in this parking lot with only your two other cars.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
No one else is around. It's really silent here. You hear some crickets.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Is it unlocked?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
When you go up to it, you see that it is locked.

29:48.000 --> 29:56.000
Looking through the windows, you see that there are zines all over the ground called Gnathic News, spelled with a silent G.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Gnathic News.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I think that Meat Hook would know all about Gnathic News.

30:03.000 --> 30:14.000
Gnathic News is a local zine to the city and it is all about like Bigfoot and UFOs and is about any other cult things that are happening within the city.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Amateur shit. Of course that stuff's real. Do you even need to write about it anymore?

30:19.000 --> 30:30.000
Vincente likes the idea of looking in the car because that's where we get the stuff to drop into the holes, of course.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
So he is going to try to break into the car and steal some items.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Real criminology.

30:37.000 --> 30:45.000
Yeah, I was going to say, as you walk up, you see this leather jacket studded elbow go smashing into the backseat window.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
Oh my God. So I only have a 10 criminology, but I got a 4.

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
So as Meat Hook smashes this back window at the exact same time...

30:57.000 --> 31:07.000
Vincente knows exactly how to get into the 2001 Ford Escort and he is kind of just like very quickly does something with the handle and it pops open.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Yeah, you Fonzie the side of the door in the right spot.

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
It's got one of those like old number padlocks, but it's from 2001 so it's just very clear that the code is 1234.

31:19.000 --> 31:26.000
Right. That's the ones that all the numbers are like faded off of and then the window crashes.

31:27.000 --> 31:35.000
Little, little pieces of glass just bust into this Ford Escort just ruining the person's day who owns this car.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Oh, didn't see you there.

31:37.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah, I've got a pretty good stealth, so I sneak up on people sometimes. See anything cosmic or cool back there?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Hit me with those searches.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
Just a classic Gnathic news. Nothing going on here. That's not enough.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Gnath enough.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
Oh no, that's a crit fail. Oh wait, no, that's a nine. It's a 69.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
That's a crit success.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
That's a good one.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Because that's a crit success.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Yeah, I got a 55 on a 40 so I did crit fail.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
But we do occasionally forget that 96 is a crit fail.

32:12.000 --> 32:20.000
We always forget that and so with the 69 that is going to completely outweigh the critical failure on the part of Vincenzi Bori.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
So you just saved him a D4 of damage cutting himself on the glass that you busted through there.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Couldn't she use it on cool shit in the car instead?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Oh, she's definitely going to use it on cool shit in the car instead.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
It applies to everything.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
It applies to everything.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
It's situationally excellent all around.

32:38.000 --> 32:45.000
So as you go through this car you find there's an avoided ID for a Rowan Fitzpatrick.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
I was under the assumption that this was Dr. Brock Hockgrave's car. Oops.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Shout out to Marie from North Carolina.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Oh, hey Marie.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Hey Marie, what's up?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Marie Marie.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Discord super mod.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Absolute brilliant person, kind tea drinker Marie. Thank you.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
She's threatened to ban me from the Discord before so fuck you Marie.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Just kidding.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
No, I agree with Marie too.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
She should have done it a long time ago.

33:21.000 --> 33:28.000
It is naughty in there and it is not Patreon exclusive so no matter what if you're a listener and you want to join the Patreon get on in there and have some fun.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
He meant Discord.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
What did I say?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Do join the Patreon.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Join the Patreon for not free.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Join the Discord for free.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
And pay us money when you join the Discord.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
When you get your Escalade stretch limo join the Patreon.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Right.

33:47.000 --> 33:54.000
So Rowan Fitzpatrick on this ID is five foot seven, 32 years old, curly red hair, dark circles under their eyes.

33:54.000 --> 34:02.000
They are wearing a brat pit band tee and tweed blazer over the top of it.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Do I know this person?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I mean they got a Nothic News in their car.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
How familiar are you with Nothic News?

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
I know like everybody who's ever written there I'm pretty sure.

34:15.000 --> 34:23.000
So yeah you would know Rowan Fitzpatrick works at the perfect print which is where they make Nothic News.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Well I've gotten my zines printed now and then so that makes sense.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Exactly.

34:29.000 --> 34:41.000
So you've run into Rowan a couple times they're just like an androgynous dude and they're 30 somethings hanging out making zines talking to people about Bigfoot and UFOs in a very monotone voice.

34:41.000 --> 34:48.000
This dude is maybe the most boring conspiracy theorist I've ever met Vincente.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
You don't happen to have his phone number memorized do you?

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
I assume you don't have a cell phone.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
Of course I don't have a cell phone. That's how they get you. They're triangulating you all the time.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
You think I want them knowing my every move? The lizard people.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
In the city I am the they to worry about.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
You've got your hand reached back meatloaf like in between.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Meatloaf?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
But I won't do that.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Meatloaf's here too.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
I wasn't upset.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Hey it's Meatloaf.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
Alright and so you got your hand just like deep in the like backseat crevice.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Paradise by the dashboard lights you know what I mean?

35:35.000 --> 35:44.000
You whip out a business card. It is for the occult and unnatural investigative journalism association.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
It says Rowan Fitzpatrick and it has a phone number.

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
I found the number. Here you go use your fancy cellular telephone on this Vincente.

35:54.000 --> 36:01.000
Vincente puts his reading glasses on and pulls out his like iPhone 2 and is like

36:01.000 --> 36:08.000
yeah can you read those numbers off to me? And he's like holding it really close to his face and he plugs in the numbers.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
4206969.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
4206969 area code 836.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Nice got it.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Send. Call. Loudspeaker. Taylor's voice.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
We're gonna cut to the woods where Jimmy Corrigan and Shelly St. Blythe are standing.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
What are you guys doing as you're looking at these holes?

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
Oh well as soon as I see there's nothing in the holes I look up Trigate Supply and give them a call.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
I want to be taking in some of our surroundings. I realize we didn't do that when we got here.

36:43.000 --> 36:48.000
Is the tower lit up tonight and is there any signs that somebody's been in or out near the front door?

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
When you said the tower light I assumed you meant like a flashing airplane light that's still on it right?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Just like blinking.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
But there could still be lights inside.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
And the generator like fucks up and like twitches out.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Is it on?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
No.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
But it's fucking cool and it is but not right now.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
Then he's doing his anthropological work to see if he can figure out if there was any more to these holes than writing a message.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Was there a reason these holes are here?

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
What do you make of these holes doc? Do they look like your standard anthropological holes?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
It's a 51 on a god damn 50.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
I ain't gonna do it.

37:26.000 --> 37:32.000
I don't understand why he would have been digging here. There's nothing of significance in this area.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
I don't uh...

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
It's baffling to me.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
He probably did it just to send the message.

37:39.000 --> 37:47.000
As you call Tri-Gate Supply it's like 1045pm and you get a message.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Hey this is Tri-Gate Supply. No, new voice.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
That was new.

37:53.000 --> 38:01.000
Yeah, this is Tri-Gate Supply. If you leave your name and number I'll get on back with you.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Beep.

38:04.000 --> 38:15.000
Our normal business hours are Monday through Monday 8am 430pm.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Beep.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
My name isn't important. Who I am is not important.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
But I do have a very particular set of skills. Or whatever the fuck he says. I've never actually seen taken.

38:27.000 --> 38:35.000
I need to know what you're doing with Dr. Brock Hargrave. Call me back immediately at 421-6868.

38:35.000 --> 38:45.000
And as you hang up you hear a phone ringing in the treeline just off to the side.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
And you hear scuttling and someone like trying to silence their phone.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
I mean I've got a pistol drawn and I'm running towards the treeline.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Hello do you consent to being recorded?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Hello do you consent to being recorded?

38:58.000 --> 39:05.000
And you see an androgynous 5'7 30-something with unkempt curly red hair and dark circles under their eyes.

39:06.000 --> 39:13.000
Wearing a brat pit tee. Yes, still. Cuffed straight-legged jeans, Doc Martens and a tweed blazer.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
And when they're holding out this Panasonic RN-163 micro cassette recorder.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Hello do you consent to being recorded?

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Who the hell are you?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
My name is Rowan Atkinson. I am sorry.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
That's not his name.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
My name is Mr. Bean.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
You got real beans for brains, kid. You could get killed out of here late at night.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Vincente is still ringing. I don't know.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
I don't know what's going on.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
Hello this is Rowan Fitzpatrick's phone. Please leave your number and I will call you back at an appropriate time.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Leave a message and tell him you're going to kill him.

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. What else? What else?

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
If he doesn't come clean about...

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
If you don't come clean about the...

40:01.000 --> 40:01.000


40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Everything. I'll kill you.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
And I'll burn down the perfect print too.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Give him a callback number.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
And my callback number is 4226767.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Perfect.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Bye. Bye. Have a good one.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Bye.

40:26.000 --> 40:32.000
I guess maybe we should go... Well, I'm going to grab two things out of this car because there's two holes that we need to drop stuff in.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Yeah, what do you find? What is some stuff you'd want to drop in a hole?

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
It's a little tiny figurine of Bigfoot and a...

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
A giant figurine of Bigfoot.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Like a carnival stuffed animal Bigfoot.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
Does there happen to be a lucky rabbit foot around the mirror I could grab?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Yes. I do so.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
What do you do with it?

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
She gets another point of luck.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Smell it.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
In the pocket it goes.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
Cutting back. They've got their recording device out to you.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
I snatch it out of his hand.

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
They have just like a wildly blank face on and they're just, okay, so is that a no?

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
Okay, I'm going to ask you again. Are you trying to get yourself killed? What the fuck are you doing out here tonight?

41:16.000 --> 41:23.000
I am not trying to get myself killed. I am doing investigative journalism and research. Why are you here? What brought you to these woods?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
I live in these woods.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Have you seen the man digging here?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Have you seen the man digging here?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
With the hat.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Cowboy hat.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Cowboy hat. He likes it.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Shiny little shovel.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Do you know Dr. Hargrave?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Why are you here?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
That's part of why we're here.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Why are you here?

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
I am investigating what he has been up to. He has been seeming very sketchy.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
How do you know Dr. Hargrave?

41:55.000 --> 42:02.000
Immediately they've got a card in your face and it says the Occult and Unnatural Investigative Journalism Association, Rowan Fitzpatrick.

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
Yeah, you told us you were an investigator. How do you know Dr. Hargrave? He said he'd been acting weird lately.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
Yes. He did not come to the meeting last night.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
His body a little, you little spooky club?

42:14.000 --> 42:20.000
I followed him and I saw him with the shovel and then I saw the holes in the ground after he left.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
He does scare me a bit when he, I mean you know him, he is...

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
A dastardly bastard, yes.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Formidable, yes.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
And a bastardly dastard.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
We are friends of Dr. Hargrave's. We're trying to get some help for him.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
Can you tell me everything you know about his activities in the last few days?

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
I was staying here to watch for him to come back to see what he was up to.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
How long have you been wearing that Brat Pit shirt? Cool shirt.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
Ah, thank you. I wear it on Saturdays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Mondays.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
Aja heartburn, diarrhea, upset stomach. Ah shit, indigestion, upset stomach.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Knees and toes, yes.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Shelly, what do you think?

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
So he's been coming here for days now.

43:04.000 --> 43:11.000
I just followed him last night but, and then Rowan, they kind of point to the holes in the ground.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I mean it takes a long time to dig holes so...

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
So about a hole a night.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Maybe two, three holes a night, you know, if he was up for it.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
That's what she said.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Thank you.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
I would like to sneak up from the side and sort of flank Rowan and then tackle him.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Stab him in the back six or seven times.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Just a regular tackle.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
Yeah, go ahead and roll stealth to get that sneaky sneak.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Okay. Ooh, yeah, 2650.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
They failed with a 48.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And that's a D4 minus one?

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
That is indeed.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Oh, I do one.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
But I'm more trying to grapple them to the ground than hurt them.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
You take Rowan Fitzpatrick directly to the ground and they are like,

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Oh my goodness, the smell.

43:57.000 --> 44:06.000
And that's like the first thing that they say is their face kind of hits into the soft, you know, summer humid ground below.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Sewage, water.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
There's no sewage up in this area. It's kind of nice up here.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
You can still kind of smell the sewage from the parking lot a little bit, but not as bad up here.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
That's right. I'll know how to make him pass out and put my armpit over his mouth.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
This is like the same as chloroform.

44:26.000 --> 44:32.000
Rowan, you boring motherfucker. Tell us, what'd you do with Hargrave?

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I removed my armpit so he can talk.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
I did nothing to Hargrave. I am here to watch. I think like you all are also here to do.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
And how come you didn't print my last zine? You cut the corners off.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
The corners had the most foul images I had ever seen.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
People need to see that stuff. It's real.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Why'd you cut the kids corners?

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Cost.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
I knew it.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
The classic reason.

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
Sorry to lie to you about the images. So, if we're all here to investigate.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
All you know is that he was acting funny. You don't know why. You don't know what brought him here.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
He is interested in occult and unnatural things, such as I, seemingly such as you all are.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
Do people go to this meeting that I heard you talking about as I snuck up through the woods?

45:28.000 --> 45:46.000
Yes. The Cult and Unnatural Investigative Journalism Association is a tight-knit group of comrades who believe in investigating and making journalism entries into the world about the unnatural and occult findings that we get leads on.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
How come nobody ever invited me?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Answer the question.

45:51.000 --> 45:58.000
This is the first time Rowan looks, like, kind of shook. And they're just, like, searching for an answer. You can see it on their face.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
You know I always bring snacks to share.

46:02.000 --> 46:08.000
Oh, yeah. We didn't know that you were interested.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
That's a load of crap.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
A tear wells in Meathook's eye as she turns to the woods, crossing her arms.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
No human role needed.

46:17.000 --> 46:31.000
Why would you not invite every, every, since I met this, this little rat kid, everything that they have done has just made me want to be around them. Why in the hell?

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
What kind of organization are you running that wouldn't want to invite her? I'm mad at you, kid.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
She is a perfectly good basement creep.

46:39.000 --> 46:47.000
She's our little basement troll, and we're her surrogate fathers, and we love her. But I'm gonna guess your organization didn't invite her because of the smell.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Yeah.

46:50.000 --> 47:02.000
You guys! That was the three nicest things anybody's ever said to me, or about me in my presence. I accept your surrogate fatherhoods.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Okay, get up off the ground.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
Fish face, you're fired from whatever weird position you were holding for me.

47:11.000 --> 47:20.000
Yeah, fish face, honestly, with your fish head on your human body, we didn't understand the age discrepancy, and we would like to ask you to fuck off.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
Ghost fish face appears and is like, whoa, no, it hurts, Mr. Stark.

47:26.000 --> 47:33.000
Wait, did fish face get murdered while we were out here? Anyway, we'll deal with that later.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
You guys just murdered him out of your lives.

47:37.000 --> 47:44.000
No, look, it's complicated. I never said anything weird about this. I just said I got his van and he raised me.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
Zack, when you ghost somebody, you don't make them a specter.

47:52.000 --> 47:58.000
Okay, well, if this guy doesn't have anything else to add, I think I got shit to drop in holes.

47:58.000 --> 48:03.000
I would like to know, what was Hargrave's focus in this group? Did he ask questions of specific things to you?

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Exactly, how involved in your group was he?

48:07.000 --> 48:15.000
I would call him a core member for some time, as he used to work with a group of cowboys or something.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
I'm sorry, he told you about his work with the cowboys?

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
Well, yes, because he was changing direction philosophically on how he felt about the unnatural.

48:25.000 --> 48:38.000
Previously, his work had been to get rid of the unnatural, but now he would like it to be more in the light and be written about journalistically to show the people the truth of the world.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
I think Shelley and Jimmy share a glance.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Yeah, Jimmy's maybe a little sad, but he pretty quickly hardens.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Gross.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
He gets rock hard and says, we're going to have to kill Dr. Brock Hargrave tonight.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
I can't say that I don't relish the thought.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Yeah, Dr. Shelley Blythe gets rock hard.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
Did he ever say anything to you about happy cow farms? Holy cow farms.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Happy cat factory.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
He was rambling at the last meeting he was at and he was talking about...

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Was it about his co-worker? Did he eat him?

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Did he say anything to you about eating a man whole and contentedly patting his belly?

49:18.000 --> 49:24.000
Wow, no, I know nothing about that, but that sounds like a really cool scene.

49:25.000 --> 49:30.000
I think that I haven't seen him for three or four days now.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
Four days, looking back, that was when we had the last meeting and I saw him.

49:36.000 --> 49:44.000
He was rambling when it was his turn to talk about some run of numbers and holy cow farms and something...

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
What was he calling it? It was...

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Hmm...

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
It was in another language I can't remember.

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
They're literally scrolling through their phone on their photos and they're like,

49:58.000 --> 50:05.000
Oh, I did take a picture of, yes, here and it's the words, it's words, it's letters.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
It's A-N-D-E-N-P-I-L.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
A-N-D-E-N-P-I-L.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
That is correct.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Space and A was capitalized.

50:15.000 --> 50:22.000
Space, capital Z-V-E, space, capital R-L-O-R-E-N.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
Does that mean anything to Shelly?

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Go ahead and roll German.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
I got German.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Ooh, and I rolled a nine.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Nine on a 50.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
Do you actually have German?

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
I really do. The anthropologist category gives you a foreign language.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
And you picked German?

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Can I, I want to pull back the curtain. Can I?

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
I called Zach and I said, Hey, this anthropology thing gives me two languages.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
I don't think I'm going to need two languages.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
And he says, take German.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
That's why just now I was like, roll German.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
And he was like, okay. And I didn't say anything.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
Because in my mind that just adds up.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I'm sorry, now that the curtain's been pulled back, I can no longer participate in this.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Yeah, I quit. I quit. I was told nothing.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
You didn't tell us what language to pick.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
None of you called me during my workday.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Whatcha doing?

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
And in Piel, we love Lauren.

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
Hey doc, I only speak the tongue of the motherland, but not your motherland.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Mine, Italian.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
What the hell does this mean?

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
German is a little rusty, but it roughly translates to...

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
It's like you maddle a bit and you realize that the spaces are in the wrong place.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
It says, Andenpilsverloren.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Andenpilsverloren.

51:54.000 --> 51:54.000


51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Ten pills for Lauren.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Lost to the fungus.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Holy show, I don't like that.

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
It roughly translates to, my god, lost to the fungus.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
That's a great band name.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
What could that possibly...

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Hey Fitzy, what do you know about the fungus?

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Hey Meat Hook, do you know anything about the fungus?

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Fungus? Yes, that sounds like Meat Hook's alley.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I know a lot of things about a lot of kinds of fungus.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Alright, go ahead and roll a cult, Meat Hook.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Oh? Where did we find this German?

52:30.000 --> 52:42.000
It was taking a picture on Rowan Fitzpatrick's phone from the presentation that Dr. Brock Hargrave most recently gave four days ago at the...

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
That's right. I was paying full and total attention and that's why I was totally with you.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
I rolled a crit fail on a cult.

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
Got it. Yes, you know all about being lost to the fungus.

52:56.000 --> 53:03.000
So it grows on your toes if you don't clean them good, but if you grow it long enough, then that can be penicillin.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
Yes, perhaps he was onto a penicillin. A new penicillin. Penicillin 2, perhaps.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Thank you.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
That pursuit of scientific excellence he was lost to the fungus? Did he say anything about penicillin 2 to you?

53:19.000 --> 53:28.000
I don't think he made it as far as you did. He just showed us that. I didn't know that it was German that meant something specific.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Where did he say it was from?

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
In his presentation, he did not explain the words he showed on the screen.

53:34.000 --> 53:46.000
No, he said that someone was going to be Andenpils v. Rowan soon in this area and that he had narrowed it down.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
This sounds like an amazing hip-hop concept though. Lost to the fungus.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
It sounds like maybe his friend got lost to this fungus.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
Yes, yes. Or maybe he got lost and now he has to eat his friends.

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
Either way, I think we might find more answers if we go up the tower.

54:07.000 --> 54:20.000
Up the tower, yes. There's telescopes up there. We can drop these stuffed animals into the holes which is what, because I'm not real, the message that we had to follow in the first place.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Oh, hey Vincente. Very cute Bigfoot.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Which one?

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Oh, I didn't see the smaller one there.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Thank you. You want to drop it?

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
I'd rather give them to my children.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
Nope. Maybe if they don't do anything in the holes, you can grab them out of there. I don't need them after that.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
You'll have a lot of time to get more gifts before you see them again because you hardly ever see them, right?

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
It's just a vibe I got. I didn't actually know that about your personal life.

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
Yeah, no, I have a lot of time at home alone to buy gifts for my children or whatever. Please.

54:52.000 --> 54:57.000
Do they paint like I miss daddy during finger painting class when you see them finger painting?

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
No, they paint a lot of pictures of their mother. I have them this weekend. I had to get a sitter.

55:02.000 --> 55:14.000
Okay. Well, let's hope this elevator works because it's a lot of stairs and you guys are not very good at that.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
That was a one-time thing.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Well, we're not going downstairs. We'll see how we are going.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I'm much better going up.

55:24.000 --> 55:30.000
Real fast, now that we know that fungus is on the table, can we just check around, make sure there isn't a giant mushroom?

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
There's fungus growing around the holes or something.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
There's giant Mario mushrooms all over the place.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Yeah, growing out of each of these holes in the ground, no.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
This fucking toadstool runs by.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Looking around, yeah, you don't see any mushrooms about, no?

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
Yeah, that's good.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
Except for meat hook.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
You notice some of the spikes on her jacket are actually mushrooms.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Just mixed in.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Don't eat that.

55:56.000 --> 56:06.000
As you look at the spikes on her jacket, you see some of the patches on Meat Hook's jacket as well, and they are all about making the unnatural known to the world.

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
Oh yeah, you notice that? What you looking at? This patch is a good one. I made that myself.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
Kid, it's probably time we had the talk.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
I was dreading this moment.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Fishface and I had this talk long ago.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
No, this is...

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
I handled it really well.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Fishface won't be bothering you anymore.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
Nope, bye.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
This seems maybe like a conversation we have at the top of the tower.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
I think you're having this conversation as you...

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
I think Zach introduced the patches for a very specific reason.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
As you're heading up to the top of the tower, this conversation is going on.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Are we walking?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Yeah.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
I feel like if there's no power...

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Yeah, there's no power right now. The lights aren't on, so the elevator doesn't work.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
Because Shelly St. Blythe keeps clicking the button over and over like, please, please!

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
It used to take forever, even back in its heyday. It surely is on its way down.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Roll luck.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
Dr. Shelly, it's not happening. If there's one thing I know, it's what buildings without electricity look like.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
I rolled an 84.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Yep, no power.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
No, it must come. Oh god, no.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
Does anyone have any kind of engineering or electrical science?

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
Electrical science.

57:15.000 --> 57:21.000
Oh, well, I am pretty scrappy. I bet I could shimmy up the lines that...

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Don't say shimmy.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
If you open the top of the elevator car, climb up on top.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
I don't know if that's going to get you up any faster. That's like climbing a rope in gym class, you know?

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Yeah, I mean, you could try.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Okay, I will try.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Athletics?

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
It's a 98.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Oh, I ain't gonna do it.

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
You are like part of the way up and like a koala, just like stuck, just chilling.

57:54.000 --> 58:00.000
You're like, you know, in your heart of hearts, if you continue to go up, you can try, but it might not go well for you.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
You might slide down and hurt yourself.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I gently allow myself to slide back down.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Looks like it's stairs for Meat Hook.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
I place the stuffed Bigfoot below just in case.

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
You know, we have a lot of, we have a very different outlook on life philosophically, but I think you're going to be a good three dad.

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
Thank you. I already got eight of my own and I've done it a couple of times.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Yeah, I have two.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
Meat Hook, I appreciate the effort, but if we must take the stairs, we must take the stairs.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Everyone roll athletics.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
Or stairs if you like.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
It really feels like that should have been a passive thing last time.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Yeah, it did feel like that, didn't it? And it should this time for sure.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Yep, I failed.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
I failed.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
I passed.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
Jimmy piggyback ride.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
I told you, off way the puppets if I'm going to give you another piggyback ride.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
So, did Meat Hook succeed or fail?

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
No, fail.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
You can go ahead, Morgan. You can go ahead if you'd like, but everybody else is...

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
He's just like jogging backwards.

59:07.000 --> 59:13.000
Meat Hook, we did after it's time your three dads told you about the unknowable information you're about to encounter.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
All right.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
It's bad. All this stuff is very bad. You're right. It's out there.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Everything you know to be true is true.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
I know it. This is not much of a revelation for me because I was utterly convinced.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Good work, kid.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Wow.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
But here's the thing. Nobody else can know it.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
What? Everybody's got to know it.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
They're not strong like you.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
The feeble little minds will break. Society will collapse.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Maybe that's what we need, to start a better society.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
I know it feels like that's probably the case from where you are.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Urchin with nothing.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
But we are all fairly comfortable men.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
And that would be disastrous for us.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
The status quo must remain.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
It must.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It's the Delta Green way, unfortunately.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I quite like the life that I've developed for myself here.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
You literally just play the worst people.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Who is your father Vincentian going to rob?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
If people don't have any more money because they know about all this bad stuff.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Nobody will need to rob in this new utopia.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Everyone will have everything that they need because we'll all understand the truth.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Here's the real truth. As comfortable as we are, humans on their own can't fight these things.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
We are quite fragile as individuals.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
We can't even walk upstairs on our own.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I don't want to, yeah, I could push you all down right now.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Humanity's ignorance is what keeps them safe from the utter fear if they really embrace the truth.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
That's right, kid.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
You said it better than we ever could.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Everything I've worked for.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
99 flights of the zeitgeist.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Here's the thing though, you can at least continue to discover what is true.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And share it amongst your, what's that little shack called that you live in?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
The hold?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
That's it.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
You can tell everybody in the hold. You can make your zines.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
That's literally all we're talking about here.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Well, she's been making these zines anyway, nobody reads it.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It gives me pause that you don't understand what we're talking about here.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Which is the real information, the truth.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
She can make her zines about Bigfoot.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Right, yeah, just not this stuff.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I see, but I can talk about it with all of my dads.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
You can talk about it with your three dads.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
You can talk to us about anything, yes, of course.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And there's still a lot of truth to discover that I don't know.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I don't know why the stars aligned to show me zines.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I'm still trying to figure it out and you can help me.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
That's the thing, when we move into the penthouse you won't just have to stay in the basement.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
You can go up every night.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
You can look in the stars and see the zines that they show us.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And look at the telescope.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And also, it kind of is nice to know what other people don't.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
It's like, I have a lot of money and a lot of other people don't and that makes me feel good.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000
So you would share with me your privilege for me to be complacent about other people's misfortune too?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
That's exactly what we're offering.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
It's beautiful.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I'm so conflicted and yet the answer is definitely yes.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Okay. Welcome.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000
As soon as we get out of here we're getting you a real leather jacket, not this faux leather bullshit.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I made it out of tofu.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Yeah, it looks like it's melting in a number of places.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It definitely smells that way.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
No, you can age tofu.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
You can teach me this process once we drop these stuffed animals into the holes.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And maybe run into a mushroom man.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
You got it dad three.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Hell yeah. Can I be dad one though?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I don't know. What have you got to offer for that position?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
It is Shelly's townhouse. I figured he'd be dad one.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
It's only reasonable, yes.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I'd be gun dad. You could be crime dad.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
You're kind of right. I do have eight children of my own that I don't really spend time with.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So you can be the number one time spent child, but still there's not going to be a ton of time. I'm a very busy man.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Vincenzi's probably not going to be in your life a whole lot.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But the telescope will always have the telescope.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And I want to look around this restaurant for the telescope.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I follow closely because the distance that you've told me I must have makes me want you to be dad number one more than ever.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
This is what Vincenzi has done with all his children and it makes him feel so powerful.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Keep them at arms length so that they want to be close.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah, that's what kids are for.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
And as scapegoats in case I get caught doing something.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
That's why you got eight of them.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Exactly. I had nine. And now I got...

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Hey, and Meat Hook, I got nine again.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
That's beautiful. Let's look around this restaurant.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
As you guys look around, what you do see immediately is Dr. Brock Hargrave walking up the path.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Thank God.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
He's just been patiently waiting behind us while we have this conversation.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
He's not in the zeitgeist with you.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
He's been making little like asides.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Meat Hook, you can't know these things.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
He's outside on the ground below?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:55.000
He's on the ground below. He's walking up from the parking lot area toward where these holes in the ground are which are kind of directly underneath where you are but still within sight.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And he is walking up with two people and they are both on those like kid leashes.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Are they being dragged or are they leading the way?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000
They are behind but they are not being dragged on the ground but they are being kind of like forcefully led.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.000
However, they both seem to be passive and just kind of like stumbling forward.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I would like to grab the telescope that I know is in here and aim it at them and then ask Shelley if he recognizes the people.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Do I? No.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
God damn Hargrave, he's here. He's with two people. They have leashes and I don't know him.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I can see his big hat and shiny shovel from up here.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:55.000
It's just like a man and a woman, they seem to be in their mid-thirties and they're just dressed normal like they were maybe out at a bar or something and now they're here.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Kind of stumbling lifelessly behind Dr. Brock Hargrave.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And as he's kind of walking up, he's not looking up or around, he's just looking at these holes. He's got his eyes set directly on these holes in the ground.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I really need to drop these in those holes but I don't want to spook them off.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I don't think that you should immediately notice that Rowan Fitzpatrick has been with you this whole time.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I don't think you should drop those down yet. Shut up. I think we should be quiet.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I agree, but I think maybe you're just saying those things about the Bigfoots because they're your toys.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Also, are you interested in three dads?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
You seem a little way with yourself.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Hold on, you just let anybody be your child?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I don't want to be this kid's dad.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
No, but they have to be exceptionally lost like this nerd.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
No, Rowan is the worst. Do you hear how he doesn't use contractions?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
The whole way we were walking back to you guys.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Is that true? I will not say one way or another whether or not I would use-

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
You fucking freak.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
No inflection at all.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I would have in the past, but now I do not.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yeah, shut up. You're so boring.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Meat Hook, you were so right about this freaking nerd.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Thank you.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Okay, well I am not going to leave even though I feel like I should.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Right, but your voice should leave. Shut up.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
How high is this?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
How high is the Space Needle?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It's like 25.48 meters.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Why?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
That's not very tall.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
That's a thousand feet.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
It's like eight stories.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Yeah, it's pretty short.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
So it's like a sad miniature Space Needle?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Yeah, it's a bummer.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
It's the Las Vegas version of the Space Needle.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Even they, I think, have a pretty cool one.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
If you stand far away in the picture, it looks bigger.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Giddo, when we get back down there, we're going to take one where you're holding it up.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Have you ever had your picture taken before?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I mean, like, one time somebody nicked a Polaroid around the hold.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Okay, cool. I didn't know if you knew that that steals your soul.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Well, yeah, obviously.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I never let anyone.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
They only take pictures in my sleep, you know?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I can't stop them.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Did Fish do that to you?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Fish face.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
What? That wasn't me.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Yeah, no, that was a guy named Ralph.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Hey!

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Ralph, what the fuck are you doing here?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
A lot of weirdos party at this tower at night.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
How should we, should we go talk to him? Should we wait for him to come up here?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I feel that we've now located Hargrave. Wasn't that part of our mission? I think that now is the time to act.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Yeah, but I want to see what he's here to do. Can we hide and watch him?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
As you all are hiding and watching, he walks up to the two holes that are empty.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Oh fuck!

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And he takes his shovel that he has in his hand.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
We should have dug in the other holes.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And he sticks it in the ground.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.000
And then he pulls a pipe out of his pocket and lights the bottom of it.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
An acrid smell begins to rise up toward the top.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
He's smoking the crystal.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And he starts shaking his head violently.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:31.000
He pulls out a syringe and he stabs it into the arm of the leashed man who already seemed out of it and is now swaying slowly side to side.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And Hargrave takes a deep breath as he pulls a bit on the man's lead and he positions the swaying man a bit closer to himself than the still leashed woman.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And that's when Dr. Brock Hargrave shoves one of his fingers deep into his own ear.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Wiggles it around and then puts that whole eerie finger into his own mouth wrapping his lips around the bottom knuckle and sucking.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:10.000
When you all see the head of the clearly sedated swaying man do like a slow motion snap to attention.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And he reaches out toward the torso of Dr. Brock Hargrave who just stands there and watches as this dude scoops into Hargrave's abdomen with both hands.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Like he's doing the breast stroke or walking through a beat curtain.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And he crawls into the belly of Dr. Hargrave and disappears from view entirely.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:45.000
What? Is this true enough for you kid? In fact this is just more of your anti-meth propaganda.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
This Christian anti-meth propaganda.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
That's a much sillier than what I thought happened in the kitchen.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000
He just got on in there. Climb on in my belly.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
What was that fish face?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Goodbye. Goodbye.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:49.000
If at some consolation I was thinking the same thing

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I am now mechanization All my muscles work like swings

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Is this something that would not affect me?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I think this is something where it's the end of the episode.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I knew that. How did you not know your cliffhanger voice?
