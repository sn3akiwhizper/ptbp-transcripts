00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
What's good my spawn? It's your mom Wolf the dog, and I am here to provide

00:06.840 --> 00:11.400
Sustenance in the form of a radio show. Will it nurture your organs?

00:12.520 --> 00:19.800
Maybe. Will it feed your brain? It better. Will it deliver you all unto the great void?

00:20.680 --> 00:22.680
I actually do not know

00:22.680 --> 00:24.680
I

00:29.320 --> 00:31.480
Hello one hello all

00:32.160 --> 00:37.000
Hello, y'all. It's your best friend with the trash-eating problem wolf the dog

00:37.000 --> 00:41.160
It is December 6th, and the time is five o'clock y'all

00:41.800 --> 00:45.620
Sounds like it's about garbage been o'clock for your wolfy boy

00:45.620 --> 00:49.580
Now speaking of trash earlier

00:49.580 --> 00:55.760
I took my dog wolf the dog to go find him something to fill his big old belly up with

00:55.980 --> 01:02.980
But upon venturing outside the sky suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit y'all ever seen an eclipse

01:03.180 --> 01:05.180
it was like that but uh

01:05.820 --> 01:11.240
Different it was real spooky y'all wolf nearly shit his big-ass britches

01:11.360 --> 01:17.320
Which wolf did that I'll let y'all figure that one out when I came back down to the studio

01:17.320 --> 01:21.520
I found a note attached with a thumb tacked to the inside of my door

01:21.560 --> 01:26.880
It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says for wolf at the top

01:26.880 --> 01:33.800
I guess it's this week's howlin with wolf it comes from user chuckling boy over on the subreddit

01:33.800 --> 01:35.040
He's an Android user

01:35.040 --> 01:42.200
But logged on to iTunes on his computer to leave a review this boy sure knows how to make old wolfy blush

01:42.760 --> 01:48.260
Chuckling boy writes the cowboy years introduced a turn of phrase for dealing with a shitstorm

01:48.600 --> 01:53.760
We called it a night at the Opera you boys have taken care of a few off-screen

01:53.760 --> 01:57.740
But damned if your debut isn't like the Mets own debut Faust

01:58.480 --> 02:03.900
Somewhat fitting isn't that and remember the mission is over when the world ends

02:04.140 --> 02:08.620
For all of you out there listening be sure to stop by the subreddit

02:08.620 --> 02:16.000
We are starting to see more discussion around the greater Delta green cannon as well as game running tips and general show

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
stuff see y'all there

02:18.260 --> 02:20.340
Wolf bless you chuckling boy

02:20.340 --> 02:26.140
I think you're smooth like butter like a criminal undercover hot like summer

02:26.380 --> 02:31.420
y'all make me sweat like that when you tag us on Instagram or Twitter at

02:31.900 --> 02:37.080
Pretending pod all right a five-star review on Apple podcast that's good, too

02:37.420 --> 02:42.500
Fuck a whole lot of people, but especially those with influence who propagate

02:43.180 --> 02:48.660
Anti-science rhetoric it's time for the news a tall gaunt

02:49.220 --> 02:51.220
humanoid figure

02:54.140 --> 02:57.620
Where an older version of himself just stood

02:58.260 --> 03:02.780
None of that made a lick of sense to me, but that doesn't mean I'm not hungry

03:03.660 --> 03:08.100
Filling me up always is kudzu with no backbone

03:27.620 --> 03:29.620
You

03:37.100 --> 03:41.020
All see yourselves existing in this infinite

03:41.620 --> 03:49.420
Darkness and you feel eyes on you all over you and out of your own bodies floating in this vast

03:50.060 --> 03:52.060
nothingness in this endless void

03:52.620 --> 03:54.420
You see a hand

03:54.420 --> 04:01.780
stretching out of darkness and in the palm of this hand a small metal sphere a ball

04:02.380 --> 04:07.300
Suddenly long and wiry metal tendrils begin shooting from this round

04:07.660 --> 04:15.100
Shape the wires wrap their way around this hand holding the silver object and begin tightening the grasp

04:16.100 --> 04:21.140
Constricting until the skin on this hand peels open at each strip of wire

04:21.760 --> 04:24.860
Bleeding out into the nothing and this hand

04:25.460 --> 04:28.860
unable to hold the ball any longer falls and

04:29.580 --> 04:35.780
disappears and with no platform no support the silver sphere to begins falling a

04:36.220 --> 04:39.780
line of bodies forms in its downward

04:40.260 --> 04:47.060
Trajectory hoping to slow its descent the bodies are human men women children and their fashion

04:47.420 --> 04:55.220
Follows a distinct pattern the first bodies are dressed like pioneers in the Old West you recognize one as

04:55.500 --> 04:57.540
the founder of contentions wife

04:58.020 --> 04:59.340
Mary Cole

04:59.340 --> 05:07.020
the next looks to be from the turn of the century then the roaring 20s the Great Depression then looks from the

05:07.220 --> 05:11.060
Mid-century and eventually you see modern clothing as you know

05:11.060 --> 05:15.980
It far down at the end of this line and this small metal sphere this ball

05:16.380 --> 05:21.300
Cannot be held for long on top of each of these bodies before its wire arms

05:21.520 --> 05:25.900
Decimate the skin until there's no more blood left to drain from this

05:26.220 --> 05:32.020
Biological shell or the round object simply blasts its way through its short-lived host

05:32.660 --> 05:36.740
Either way the blood from previous bodies above

05:37.460 --> 05:39.460
trickles at the start

05:39.700 --> 05:47.240
Eventually pouring down onto those below before the subject of this story even makes it to them and finally

05:47.700 --> 05:49.700
the lowest body a

05:50.080 --> 05:51.980
young girl

05:51.980 --> 05:54.660
Receives this hellish gift

05:55.540 --> 06:03.460
The ball buries itself into her forehead and the vast nothingness is blown away by a new

06:03.580 --> 06:07.380
Setting this girl is running through the woods. It's raining

06:07.380 --> 06:09.740
She seems to be chasing a teenage boy

06:09.740 --> 06:17.240
The girl lifts a machete that flickers in the glint of the moonlight and the boy turns around just in time to watch as

06:17.240 --> 06:19.240
She brings the sharp blade down

06:19.540 --> 06:21.540
over her head

06:21.540 --> 06:22.900
But

06:22.900 --> 06:29.540
She trips and she drops the machete which plunges perfectly into a crack between two stones

06:29.640 --> 06:33.460
Blade facing up and this young girl falls face first

06:34.060 --> 06:36.060
splitting open her skull

06:36.300 --> 06:40.380
revealing a small metal sphere sitting inside

06:41.220 --> 06:48.140
The scene changes again and the only image that remains is the cleft head of this young girl

06:48.300 --> 06:53.940
Now sitting in a storage tub atop a folded bloody suit

06:53.940 --> 06:59.560
But time has not treated this head. Well, it has been removed from her body

07:00.380 --> 07:02.380
the skin decayed and

07:03.420 --> 07:06.460
slumping over the bones in her face completely

07:08.060 --> 07:15.100
Unrecognizable and we see John Lee Pettymore the fourth who's plucked the silver ball out of this corpses dome

07:15.540 --> 07:17.540
And he pops it in his pocket

07:18.260 --> 07:20.420
And your vision fills with water

07:21.140 --> 07:29.080
Sitting on top of all this water is a desk and sitting on top of this desk is the small metal sphere as well

07:29.080 --> 07:36.380
As an odd-looking old-timey revolver with glass tubes on the cylinder and a green light lit in front of the desk

07:37.260 --> 07:41.800
Rosemary dives for the gun and snatches it behind the desk

07:42.020 --> 07:46.520
Marvin Glass reaches out one of his spindly arms and with the flick of his

07:47.040 --> 07:50.140
Translucent hand he flings the ball at her

07:50.640 --> 07:57.060
Suddenly multiple shiny limbs extend from the small metal sphere and slam into the body of its target

07:58.060 --> 08:04.000
Rosemary one of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of Rosemary's neck

08:04.120 --> 08:10.200
Another snaps her head forward and you hear the fracture as a third metal tendril reaches in

08:10.560 --> 08:16.000
Gripping the top of Rosemary's spine where it meets her head and it rips her entire

08:16.400 --> 08:22.560
Spinal cord out of her body in one swift motion promptly forcing itself into the now

08:22.980 --> 08:25.940
vacant spinal column of this human being

08:26.800 --> 08:34.660
The new Rosemary standing before you has a crazed look in her eyes as she blows her nose

08:35.560 --> 08:37.160
into her hand

08:37.160 --> 08:40.440
Slams the mucus black shiny

08:41.240 --> 08:48.040
Fiscus into the empty chamber and squeezes the trigger on this odd-looking revolver

08:48.600 --> 08:55.640
There's an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision and then

08:56.120 --> 09:00.400
Covering the spot where Rosemary just stood this black

09:01.040 --> 09:02.360
shiny

09:02.360 --> 09:04.360
Fiscus sludge

09:05.360 --> 09:07.080
Oozes and

09:07.080 --> 09:13.560
Seemingly inside this muck is the placid body of Rosemary

09:14.400 --> 09:17.160
she is lying peacefully as

09:18.240 --> 09:21.840
Her limbs seem to fold into this ooze

09:22.960 --> 09:27.640
becoming one with the sentient mass of goop and

09:28.480 --> 09:30.200
then

09:30.200 --> 09:31.880
You all

09:31.880 --> 09:33.880
Wake up

09:34.360 --> 09:41.040
You've felt this feeling before the shock your stomach feels weird and content your ears are

09:42.000 --> 09:44.120
Ringing it's dark. It's cold

09:45.160 --> 09:52.640
And it smells like burned flesh which immediately brings you back as your eyes begin to adjust

09:53.880 --> 09:59.560
there's a pool of blood on the floor and next to it is a coffin on the ground an

10:00.200 --> 10:04.480
Ari Manstein's mausoleum where you've woken up before you look at each other

10:04.520 --> 10:10.480
there's blood splatter speckled on each of you John Lee Kevin Lee Pettymore the thirth and

10:11.240 --> 10:19.200
All-black tactical gear Keith Vigna in his brightly colored polo and boat shoes Clark Bishop and an old

10:19.640 --> 10:23.520
contention PD uniform currently holding a thick

10:24.080 --> 10:27.920
Black cloak and the shock begins to wear off

10:28.760 --> 10:34.280
You feel the searing pain on your chest on your back

10:34.800 --> 10:36.960
on the bottom of your left foot and

10:37.520 --> 10:40.040
inside your dominant palm

10:42.320 --> 10:48.160
Welcome back to contingent boys or rather the city cemetery

10:49.360 --> 10:51.360
Holy shit

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I'm getting sick of this shit

10:54.880 --> 10:56.880
Uh

10:57.720 --> 11:05.160
Clark is looking bewildered at everybody. Are we back? What's the last thing you guys remember?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.600
John and I know we

11:10.360 --> 11:13.640
We found we found my parents old book you

11:14.640 --> 11:21.400
Where it was right under my nose the whole time. Is it it's in my house. Well, what's in it? I

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
Mean I

11:26.480 --> 11:28.480
Power I guess

11:30.080 --> 11:32.080
It lets you it lets you do things it's

11:32.720 --> 11:35.680
What's what's your last memory Keith? What happened when you?

11:36.280 --> 11:40.040
Crossed through the door. Oh my god. I I have vivid

11:40.840 --> 11:42.840
vivid memory of

11:43.200 --> 11:45.200
falling through the door

11:45.280 --> 11:47.740
landed on the pastor I went

11:48.340 --> 11:53.260
through some of those doors down there and went down an elevator and I

11:55.140 --> 11:57.540
Got to our room doors in an elevator

11:58.180 --> 12:02.860
Opened a few doors and what I got I got into a room and found

12:04.100 --> 12:06.100
Well, I found

12:06.820 --> 12:15.040
Some papers and I found the gun and I saw Tilly B, but she was

12:15.040 --> 12:17.040
Very

12:17.080 --> 12:19.080
Much worse for wear

12:19.080 --> 12:20.560
how so

12:20.560 --> 12:23.280
well, she just her hair was falling out and her

12:24.000 --> 12:28.560
skin looked thin and almost translucent and just

12:29.280 --> 12:31.800
she didn't have any fingernails and oh

12:32.720 --> 12:34.720
man, I I

12:34.760 --> 12:36.440
found a

12:36.440 --> 12:38.080
spell on

12:38.080 --> 12:43.920
One of those papers and I I said it and my my fingernails popped off

12:45.080 --> 12:52.200
And I checked my hand real quick and you have fingernails. Thank God. Wait was was Tilly be alive. She was alive

12:52.200 --> 12:54.200
She was acting like a monster

12:54.240 --> 12:55.680
or

12:55.680 --> 12:57.560
like a caged-up

12:57.560 --> 12:59.480
animal she was

12:59.480 --> 13:05.680
Behind a door like a blast door, but I didn't open it up. She was screaming and making crazy noises and

13:06.680 --> 13:08.680
after I cast that first spell I

13:09.560 --> 13:11.560
figured it worked and

13:11.680 --> 13:19.380
Figured you know magic works. So I I cast this cast a spell that that Mildred Mitchell had on her and

13:20.600 --> 13:22.600
my god my I

13:23.240 --> 13:25.240
Feel I want to feel my arm

13:25.640 --> 13:27.640
You can feel the metal

13:27.800 --> 13:31.200
underneath where muscle should be when I cast that

13:32.360 --> 13:40.040
My arm and chest and face ripped open and all the metal that was in me popped out and I pre grew my bones

13:41.040 --> 13:43.040
They just popped back in

13:44.120 --> 13:49.240
At that point I kind of lost it and I pulled the trigger on that gun and

13:52.040 --> 13:55.040
Guys I was Silas Cole. I

13:56.600 --> 14:02.320
I found it contention. I own them. I own the mine and I

14:05.320 --> 14:07.920
I'm made I made Mary

14:07.920 --> 14:12.740
Mary's a ball you made Mary Cole

14:14.040 --> 14:20.120
Mary I think it gets real fuzzy after I pull that trigger, but I

14:21.840 --> 14:24.040
Don't know if there is a Mary Cole

14:25.040 --> 14:29.560
Mary is is ma are why she's a ball

14:30.480 --> 14:32.480
She's one of those silver balls

14:33.060 --> 14:35.920
Why did you what do you ma are? Why what I?

14:36.680 --> 14:38.680
Well, I

14:39.240 --> 14:44.500
It's fuzzy and it's not at the same time when before I pulled that trigger. I found paper

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
with the

14:48.960 --> 14:53.840
It had a through X of what looked like failed attempts of making something and

14:55.020 --> 14:57.020
the last one was

14:57.320 --> 15:01.600
looked like a success and it was M a are why

15:01.600 --> 15:03.600
Like

15:04.320 --> 15:10.920
You ain't got no alibi you're Mary what what you're Mary I

15:12.840 --> 15:14.840
Had to off the dog make that same

15:17.680 --> 15:20.480
Really yep, damn it I

15:23.680 --> 15:29.060
Made him do it. I made him. I made him make Justin

15:29.940 --> 15:33.420
Every once in a while put in a joke that I'm like hi you motherfucker

15:34.380 --> 15:41.880
Hey Luke, are you using your internet from your house or your hotspot my hotspot? Is it bad? Yeah, maybe use the other one

15:42.020 --> 15:47.460
Okay, I will until your robot voicing hard which made that agonizing and wonderful

15:50.780 --> 15:52.580
Okay

15:52.580 --> 15:55.160
I'm on regular internet now, so

15:55.920 --> 16:01.280
Fingers crossed it stays on so did you get most of that or should I go over it?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.320
Just with you guys I got the gist of it

16:04.320 --> 16:06.020
There was one thing that you cut out for that

16:06.020 --> 16:10.240
I was here Oh your but did you say your your metal popped out and something about your bones?

16:10.440 --> 16:16.040
My bones grew back grew back. Oh shit. I thought you said everything popped out

16:18.180 --> 16:20.280
Metal and bones but your grunts, okay

16:20.280 --> 16:24.960
It feels like I'm still got metal in me now, so there might be there might be a way back

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah, I mean to what we were

16:29.600 --> 16:35.120
Yeah, I wouldn't I don't know if I'd recommend going through that again, but let me see that watch you son of a bitch

16:35.560 --> 16:40.320
Thankfully, he doesn't wake up with the watch you had to go get it in contention. Thank God

16:43.560 --> 16:46.700
But yeah after I pull that trigger I have vague memories of

16:47.380 --> 16:50.060
Starting the town and having the mine and

16:50.980 --> 16:53.900
making stuff that helps people and you know

16:54.720 --> 17:01.860
Wow, you didn't go all evil anything. Did you I don't know it just gets up to a certain point and then it's nothing

17:01.860 --> 17:07.220
I can't remember probably not you probably just did good. How do you know how to make stuff? You know how to make stuff?

17:07.860 --> 17:13.020
Now yeah, like I said, I've been secretly competent this whole time like I said the

17:13.540 --> 17:17.600
Once I've pulled that trigger it all gets super fuzzy. I just

17:18.300 --> 17:22.660
Make us all right now. It's almost like I wasn't doing it. It's like I have the memory of

17:23.740 --> 17:26.420
Like somebody else, but I know it was me

17:27.100 --> 17:29.140
Cuz I felt going back in time

17:29.140 --> 17:35.340
I've felt it but are you sorry saying that you didn't have the capability to to change anything. I

17:36.020 --> 17:38.940
Don't know what apparently not I've you know

17:38.940 --> 17:43.500
I was feeling a little crazy when I pulled that trigger

17:44.380 --> 17:48.860
Like if I had a meter of sanity, there was nothing else to lose in it

17:50.380 --> 17:56.420
Almost as if my decisions were not my own but a higher beings. I know that feeling sure sure. Yeah

18:01.060 --> 18:05.740
You're talking about the the gun with the tubes on it, is that what you're saying that was the one yeah

18:06.140 --> 18:09.900
But at the same one, I don't know if it it's either the same one or

18:10.580 --> 18:17.100
Or it's gotta be it's gotta be a replica. But I mean, I think that room I was in down there. It was some sort of like

18:18.420 --> 18:22.420
Science lab for Silas Cole, which was me

18:23.140 --> 18:26.940
But I didn't know it until I became Silas Cole

18:27.540 --> 18:35.300
but then I must have remembered the diagrams and made them from what I remembered again and then

18:35.740 --> 18:37.740
It's a made more of them

18:39.740 --> 18:43.180
Is one of them dang old bootstrap paradoxes it sounds like

18:45.420 --> 18:47.420
It does sound like that Keith

18:49.500 --> 18:51.580
Shit I haven't gone by Keith in a while

18:52.420 --> 18:54.100
That's weird

18:54.100 --> 18:56.300
and he just looks off into the distance like

18:57.140 --> 18:58.940
way deep in thought

18:58.940 --> 19:02.340
So do you reckon that Adams Cain Adam Cain's?

19:02.340 --> 19:04.340
I

19:06.900 --> 19:13.420
Reckon Adams Cain got him through all this. Yeah, I was thinking Adams Cain like there's multiple of them and that's what you say

19:15.540 --> 19:17.540
Like courts martial

19:19.580 --> 19:25.060
You you reckon then that Adam Cain's whole plan would it would have been destined to fail if

19:25.560 --> 19:28.360
He wouldn't have been able to change anything in the past. It sounds like

19:29.080 --> 19:32.940
You guys think that that was a viable option maybe everything is

19:34.120 --> 19:36.120
Predetermined I thought of

19:36.960 --> 19:42.760
Science experiments and stuff not philosophy. So the gun is behind the door

19:43.280 --> 19:45.800
that's right, and I think that watch opened it up because

19:46.440 --> 19:53.360
Right when I got down there the other door open when my watch was close to it and I told you John and Adam Cain

19:53.360 --> 19:57.840
Has the radio and the helmet right now? I guess he does

19:57.840 --> 20:01.920
He's probably I bet he did that earlier than just right now

20:02.520 --> 20:06.560
Seemed like by the time we got back there. He'd been consolidating all this shit for a few days

20:06.560 --> 20:09.960
He really yeah made hay while we were away, you know

20:09.960 --> 20:15.600
Once you time travel this much it's real hard just to determine where you are when you are

20:15.880 --> 20:22.040
Speaking of and I look at my watch. What time is it in the mausoleum now 5 p.m. Yeah. Sorry

20:22.080 --> 20:26.960
Do you want to guess 5 p.m. I bet it's about 5 p.m. Oh my god. Yep. That's it

20:27.040 --> 20:32.320
So in the past we've woken up at 3 and 1 and 11. Yeah. Yeah as a number 4, baby

20:32.360 --> 20:34.360
So it's 5 o'clock

20:34.400 --> 20:38.200
What do you reckon? We're doing right now like not us but

20:39.080 --> 20:42.940
Us God are there are there three other us is running around?

20:43.840 --> 20:50.000
As we speak that's kind of been our operating theory so far. Yeah, maybe we're the ones who just let ball

20:50.000 --> 20:52.240
Take care of everything. Look at your body. Look at your body

20:52.240 --> 20:56.220
Do we have anything crossed out this time and I'm looking at all the yeah names

20:56.600 --> 21:03.420
Before you had seen that Marvin on each of your chests were crossed out and you confirm that

21:04.340 --> 21:09.240
You saw that Maggie on the bottom of your left feet were crossed out

21:09.400 --> 21:16.360
Which you also confirm and Clark you again see the eaten away logo for the circle of knowledge

21:17.280 --> 21:20.100
On your back was drew

21:20.780 --> 21:24.680
Which you all see is crossed out when you check each other's backs

21:25.500 --> 21:30.380
Check for ticks too and inside the dominant palm of each of your hands

21:31.220 --> 21:34.580
It says Tildy and that is also

21:35.220 --> 21:38.340
Crossed out. Oh shit. That last one was a twofer

21:41.060 --> 21:45.300
Well, this this it kind of seems like we got a freebie boys to just tie this all up

21:45.300 --> 21:50.340
Well, so Drew's crossed out what what ended up happening with Drew? Oh, yeah

21:50.340 --> 21:53.260
You don't even know what happened after you went down in the hole. No

21:54.340 --> 21:58.340
The pastor might yeah. Well, that's in the future past

22:02.480 --> 22:08.760
Wait, what about the pastor's future past? Well, I left him down there with two bullet holes in his feet, but I propped him up

22:11.860 --> 22:13.860
You kind of glossed over that

22:14.820 --> 22:18.660
Remember you said to shoot him so he didn't follow me and I did and then you said

22:20.340 --> 22:21.700
Literally, yeah

22:21.700 --> 22:26.420
Yeah, was he ever he was he was still knocked out unconscious the last time you saw him

22:26.420 --> 22:33.460
Yeah, and I reckon if I went back in time and all that probably nobody else got there that got down there to him. So

22:34.820 --> 22:36.820
oops

22:37.020 --> 22:39.020
But yeah withdrew what happened withdrew

22:39.300 --> 22:45.640
What happened what happened with everything after I went down there when when's last you saw drew was he still under gunpoint?

22:46.020 --> 22:47.740
well, he was

22:47.740 --> 22:49.380
drew

22:49.380 --> 22:52.700
Carries or what? However, we're saying he was good

22:52.700 --> 22:59.140
I'm the last thing I remember pretty much was him in her body and not really much else had happened

23:00.220 --> 23:05.980
Well, I took a shot at Adam as you guys were heading down into that hole and that prompted

23:06.980 --> 23:10.420
Kristoff fuck. What was his name? Yeah, the janitor. Yeah

23:11.420 --> 23:15.600
We thought we thought drew was a goner because we heard a gunshot ring out right then

23:16.220 --> 23:23.980
Turned out we had a little Savior in the in our midst. Yeah, who shot Kristoff's hand off. It was a

23:25.260 --> 23:29.060
Her name's and loved you. Do you know her? No

23:29.060 --> 23:30.980
She

23:30.980 --> 23:35.740
Killed my parents. She killed your parents and love killed my parents

23:36.620 --> 23:43.220
To have you always known that or I mean, I've known it as much as I've known things since these things started. Oh

23:44.220 --> 23:49.100
What she killed your parents? Why is she trying to get you and mister?

23:49.500 --> 23:55.700
Here's the thing is that and I've known this for a while and that's been eating me up. She she works for the circle

23:55.700 --> 23:57.700
She's a circle of knowledge member

23:58.020 --> 24:03.500
She was also in case L with Kevin with dad you and

24:07.420 --> 24:13.340
Daddy me. Yeah. Well, what was she doing there? Well, I thought she was working for the circle here

24:13.340 --> 24:18.540
Here's the mind blower. You ready for this get you might sit down. Are you seated? Well, you know it can't yeah

24:18.580 --> 24:24.100
sure, Jim Cook was her handler in some kind of covert operation to

24:25.060 --> 24:27.060
Do stuff

24:27.420 --> 24:29.420
Secret

24:30.860 --> 24:32.860
Interest can you believe that?

24:42.220 --> 24:44.220
You know what Keith

24:45.140 --> 24:47.140
Thanks, something's up

24:47.300 --> 24:49.700
Got a firm grasp on how all this works

24:51.580 --> 24:53.740
Jim was her hands. So you're telling me

24:54.740 --> 24:58.340
Jim cook was an loves handler to do something secret

24:58.380 --> 25:06.060
So they were he was the handler of case L it turned out but then he had some kind of some kind of a splintering

25:06.420 --> 25:12.100
So you remember we saw those notes about how Maggie heard that Jim Cook was worried about Maggie and all that

25:12.100 --> 25:16.620
there was some kind of yeah some kind of strife within the circle itself and

25:17.540 --> 25:18.540
And

25:18.540 --> 25:23.980
Was was working for Jim in particular. So that's why she killed my parents Jim sent her off to get a book

25:24.580 --> 25:30.940
You remember that book we found in Jim's house. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, that's one. He like homemade so it didn't work too. Well

25:31.780 --> 25:35.840
Okay, so you got the real book at your house turns out

25:36.460 --> 25:39.300
John can actually fill you in on how we figure that now. I

25:39.940 --> 25:41.940
Had a vision. Oh

25:42.180 --> 25:47.880
Without the watch yes, but that though that's my own thing god damn it. Oh, okay. I believe you

25:47.900 --> 25:49.900
Everybody's doing their part to save the world

25:52.860 --> 25:54.860
I was Silas Cole guy

25:59.620 --> 26:02.660
Tell me what happened what about it? What about the book?

26:02.900 --> 26:06.340
It's a grimoire and wanted us to get it real bad

26:06.340 --> 26:09.100
And then we were gonna go over to calm comfy campground

26:09.100 --> 26:12.340
But then she did some shit that we didn't take too kindly to

26:13.060 --> 26:15.060
namely killing John I

26:15.260 --> 26:17.820
Thought John she killed you well nearly

26:18.660 --> 26:24.940
Stabbed a knife through his head good ass. I got I got pretty lucky though without provocation or I

26:26.180 --> 26:28.180
wouldn't exactly say

26:30.180 --> 26:32.180
Without provocation, but

26:32.300 --> 26:37.220
while we were talking to Ann John let it slip that he was a ball and

26:38.100 --> 26:44.500
Turns out that's kind of Ann's whole thing is to get rid of them balls. She's trying to get rid of all my kind

26:45.140 --> 26:48.100
okay, so that makes a little more sense why I should do that, so

26:49.100 --> 26:54.340
Did you guys save drew though? Oh, yeah, I forgot. That's what you asked about. He's fine. He went back to the tunnels

26:54.340 --> 27:01.220
We told him to you said get on down there just scamper be safe, and then did you kill Ann yeah, I?

27:02.060 --> 27:04.060
Got real mad at her and I killed her

27:04.220 --> 27:08.820
And then I still was kind of curious about what the book would do now that we knew where it was cuz she was so

27:08.820 --> 27:10.820
Hyped up on it right

27:10.860 --> 27:12.860
went and got the book and

27:15.140 --> 27:17.140
That's I

27:17.540 --> 27:19.540
Yeah, they kill you

27:20.500 --> 27:27.600
Use it no not it. It certainly didn't kill me in fact. It. Maybe did the opposite, but I it all gets fuzzy after that

27:28.220 --> 27:30.220
huh, huh

27:30.880 --> 27:32.880
What happened with your head wound oh

27:33.660 --> 27:34.940
well

27:34.940 --> 27:36.940
And magic some of it away

27:37.660 --> 27:39.780
enough for me to help out and killing her I

27:40.540 --> 27:47.140
Also, I gave a I gave a shot at doing the same thing. I'd just seen an do which was

27:47.860 --> 27:49.820
Just a little just a little blood magic

27:49.820 --> 27:54.260
She just did like a like a little magic spell with that used that used blood

27:54.700 --> 27:59.540
like like John said that a while ago would have really freaked me out, but

28:00.260 --> 28:01.220
It freaked me out, too

28:01.220 --> 28:06.860
I tell you what I believe in magic it freaked me out so much that I decided to try it myself in a young girl's

28:06.860 --> 28:08.060
heart

28:08.060 --> 28:10.060
You believe in magic

28:10.580 --> 28:16.140
It worked when I did it well, and what did it do held him up held him up a whole lot if I remember right?

28:16.940 --> 28:19.380
Sorry, that's I don't know yeah, it felt real nice

28:20.140 --> 28:25.140
So I was really filled with purpose at that point and decided to go and get the book and that's the last thing I remember

28:26.060 --> 28:28.060
It yeah

28:28.300 --> 28:30.700
You got I got it. I got to

28:32.060 --> 28:33.620
you

28:33.620 --> 28:36.260
Keith you can relate you know sometimes at the end of the day

28:36.980 --> 28:41.620
You're crazy, and I didn't really know what I was nothing left in you yeah

28:44.180 --> 28:45.740
You guys remember

28:45.740 --> 28:53.340
Jim cook right remember Jim when we found out he died in a yeah in an alley right I did that

28:54.340 --> 28:57.660
You did you did that I did that when

28:58.980 --> 29:03.060
what I touched the book and I said a spell and I

29:04.420 --> 29:06.300
Was suddenly in the alley with Jim

29:06.300 --> 29:12.540
and I knew that he'd sent and loved to kill my parents and it it just got the better of me and I I

29:14.260 --> 29:16.260
Killed him I strangled him and I killed him oh

29:17.500 --> 29:19.820
Whoa whoa whoa whoa Clark Clark?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.260
You're under arrest

29:24.340 --> 29:26.340
I'm just kidding

29:30.860 --> 29:38.480
So is that the last thing you remember is killing him in all honesty. Yeah that I got the feeling that

29:39.540 --> 29:45.220
I'd found purpose in my life, but when did that happen that was just a couple days ago

29:46.660 --> 29:48.860
That was five days ago five days ago

29:49.740 --> 29:51.740
So we potentially could have

29:52.820 --> 29:58.260
Have a few of you running around along with us a murdering one

29:58.260 --> 30:00.980
You know the last thing I remember is watching wheel of fortune

30:05.460 --> 30:13.180
Well boys with the fell asleep on the couch and woke up here really damn yeah, you get me right

30:13.180 --> 30:20.020
Roll intelligence fucking one

30:22.820 --> 30:30.020
Keith I swear to God I got him all right every one of them. Well damn what a worthless fucking one

30:30.020 --> 30:32.020
I

30:38.380 --> 30:44.220
Don't know what the hell we do now. I mean going to watch wheel of fortune sounds just good as anything

30:44.220 --> 30:47.500
Hey, I John Lee petty more roll a d10 for me

30:48.860 --> 30:52.180
Seven gain seven sanity nice I

30:53.060 --> 30:59.540
Can't tell what's real in this world, but wheel of fortune. That's it. There is something so calming about that experience

31:00.060 --> 31:04.140
after everything that you've been through of just sitting on the couch and

31:05.020 --> 31:10.740
Crushing wheel of fortune boys. I'd highly recommend it. I'm right there with you. I wish I could it I

31:12.260 --> 31:14.980
Mean what do you what what do we do now?

31:14.980 --> 31:21.580
I mean, I've got a couple couple ideas personally it kind of depends. Oh, that's one thing Keith

31:21.580 --> 31:27.580
I should tell you and love put a name to that creature that I saw she called it a gigantic

31:28.100 --> 31:34.020
Permanente kiss I nailed it. Don't ask me more and she clarified and she

31:36.540 --> 31:41.780
She she she said that that that whole thing's real that whole thing is something that the circle is is

31:41.980 --> 31:44.300
Trying to keep out of the world Freeman Donna

31:44.980 --> 31:46.980
That's it

31:48.780 --> 31:52.260
That's right, that's what she said right John. Yeah, no something like that

31:52.980 --> 31:56.980
Real hold up real quick. I gotta I gotta rewrite the end of this campaign real quick

31:58.580 --> 32:00.580
Yeah

32:01.780 --> 32:04.980
Yeah, so and and was telling us that the the giant

32:06.140 --> 32:07.180
Penta kid

32:07.180 --> 32:13.420
Perminta kiss was a was a real bad thing and that was still the goal of the circle and that's always kind of been

32:13.420 --> 32:21.060
The thing here's here's one kind of scary thing Keith that and mentioned to us is that Maggie had some designs on the circle of knowledge

32:21.060 --> 32:23.060
That would then

32:23.140 --> 32:26.060
Lay in a new world order or something like that

32:26.380 --> 32:30.460
But Ann was pretty much on our side as far as she didn't care about that

32:30.460 --> 32:33.400
She just wanted to make sure that the creature didn't happen

32:34.100 --> 32:39.460
Well, the is the creature related to the ball in any way, you know hell

32:39.460 --> 32:44.020
I haven't been able to make that connection quite if I made ball then probably not

32:45.140 --> 32:49.720
Probably not where you may. Yeah, I made ball. I

32:50.580 --> 32:52.580
made Mary

32:53.140 --> 32:55.140
Daddy

32:56.420 --> 33:01.500
I'm you're my real daddy. I guess so. Holy shit

33:09.540 --> 33:11.540
Runs out of the mausoleum

33:11.660 --> 33:14.200
and he stumbles over one of the

33:14.900 --> 33:18.980
broken androids who's crushed and falling on the ground and

33:19.860 --> 33:24.920
Sitting in this dirt and this cold cold December 6th. You're looking up

33:24.920 --> 33:29.340
The fire is almost completely out on this crawfish boil

33:30.340 --> 33:31.780
smell

33:31.780 --> 33:33.780
souring hits your nose

33:33.820 --> 33:38.840
As he runs out I look at Clark and kind of like give him an elbow and go

33:39.380 --> 33:42.540
Hey son, where are you going and then laugh to myself?

33:42.540 --> 33:44.540
We

33:46.300 --> 33:48.300
Probably ought to follow him out though

33:48.460 --> 33:53.860
I'd be careful about person this one Keith. That's that's why I said it in here

33:56.620 --> 33:59.460
Yeah, I'll start following John out just to make sure

33:59.980 --> 34:05.380
John John don't don't get too far. We get it. We got to figure something out now. John is running

34:05.380 --> 34:07.380
He's gonna disappear if you don't catch him

34:07.380 --> 34:09.380
So

34:10.540 --> 34:13.700
You just take off I look at Clark I

34:14.500 --> 34:16.340
guess

34:16.340 --> 34:19.780
John and I just take off after him. Oh, hey. Oh hell

34:20.820 --> 34:22.820
Clark's gonna run to

34:23.220 --> 34:26.260
John John come back. We're gonna need your help

34:28.300 --> 34:30.300
Okay, yeah

34:30.860 --> 34:36.100
For the last time you just run right by those androids don't look at them at all Clark take your headphones off

34:37.380 --> 34:39.380
Take your headphones off as well

34:41.300 --> 34:44.360
Joe not Clark, whatever you have one name

34:51.740 --> 34:53.800
Thomas dr. Bradley aim

35:03.700 --> 35:05.700
Say it

35:06.300 --> 35:08.300
Dr. Bradley anus

35:12.180 --> 35:14.700
We got to name ourselves in the zoom chat

35:16.980 --> 35:20.180
Tell me petty more the third is sprinting through

35:21.100 --> 35:24.860
Mausoleum, I need you to roll an alertness check for me

35:26.980 --> 35:28.260
17

35:28.260 --> 35:33.260
There are clearly the lights and sounds of an ambulance

35:33.820 --> 35:38.700
Pulled up at the entrance of the city cemetery, which is now

35:39.500 --> 35:43.540
Close enough that you can tell what is happening up there

35:44.460 --> 35:47.040
Remembering back from the last time that you were here

35:47.300 --> 35:54.220
There's a woman sitting in a wheelchair at the entrance the city cemetery who passed away

35:54.980 --> 35:56.980
likely an hour ago

35:56.980 --> 36:00.700
That's probably what this is. I I crossed myself and

36:01.700 --> 36:03.700
Pay my respects to

36:06.540 --> 36:11.300
You know this woman who we have really come to think of as a friend

36:14.980 --> 36:17.180
And then I'm booking it for the

36:18.900 --> 36:23.180
Marmal glasses place. Okay. I'm looking at for planet juggernaut fair enough

36:23.180 --> 36:25.180
As

36:27.020 --> 36:30.660
Clark Bishop and Keith vigna take off running through these above-ground

36:31.340 --> 36:36.780
Mausoleums here in the city cemetery. I need you to roll alertness checks for me

36:38.220 --> 36:44.900
61 on a 60. Oh shit. I thought I'd rolled a 11, but it's a 17 on a 70

36:45.900 --> 36:47.900
Thank God

36:48.940 --> 36:52.940
Sometimes is a handler you really really want

36:54.700 --> 36:56.700
Certain roles to get made. Oh

36:58.460 --> 37:00.460
That was nerve-wracking

37:00.500 --> 37:03.700
as you're running through you hear sirens and

37:04.220 --> 37:06.780
You see lights from an ambulance

37:07.700 --> 37:10.180
at the entrance the semi-se

37:10.860 --> 37:12.540
Semi-semitary

37:12.540 --> 37:14.540
the semi-semitary

37:14.580 --> 37:20.020
The semester and as soon as you recognize that you actually hear

37:20.900 --> 37:27.540
The running of a slightly heavier than human man taking off in a perpendicular

37:28.220 --> 37:35.740
Direction to the entrance of the city cemetery and that man is running toward the glass compound

37:36.580 --> 37:41.500
Is a John do we know it's John we would have just been running after him. Yeah. Yeah, it's John, okay

37:41.500 --> 37:46.300
I wasn't sure if it was one of the robot guys that were protecting Stan Manstein got back up

37:46.300 --> 37:49.460
That's what I was. No, you didn't hear me make fun of you for not looking at them. I

37:51.540 --> 37:54.580
Mean I just remembered them I brought him up every time

37:58.620 --> 38:04.660
Well, so since I filled my alertness check I'm gonna keep running till till he alerts me

38:05.860 --> 38:08.340
Keith he's heading that way. There's a there's there's a there's a

38:09.020 --> 38:13.540
Ambulance up there at the front gate. He's good. He's going the other way. He's heading toward the glass compound. Let's

38:14.300 --> 38:16.300
Go get him

38:18.100 --> 38:20.460
Silas Cole completely forgot what Keith Vigna's

38:24.180 --> 38:29.180
Yeah, I'm like, um, it's legitimately weird for me to be Keith again

38:29.820 --> 38:31.820
Right now. Yeah, I

38:32.100 --> 38:34.100
am in pursuit of

38:34.780 --> 38:36.500
John I

38:36.500 --> 38:43.140
Am too do I see him? Can I see him? Am I that close roll both of you real athletics for me? I

38:44.220 --> 38:46.220
Got an 8 on a 50

38:46.380 --> 38:51.460
Fuck I got a 31 on the baseline 30. I was super fucking close. Wow

38:52.460 --> 38:54.460
Let's get Thomas in here to roll for us

39:04.100 --> 39:06.100
It was a bit

39:06.940 --> 39:08.940
It seemed like a bit

39:09.260 --> 39:10.980
What's up?

39:10.980 --> 39:14.580
We were waving at you looked up and then just look down at your phone

39:16.420 --> 39:23.860
Like right when we started burning it right when we started doing it. Hey Thomas real quick roll athletics for me. Oh

39:26.980 --> 39:29.620
Nope 70 on a 50 so as you're

39:30.420 --> 39:36.580
Approaching the edge of the city cemetery about to make your way onto a

39:37.100 --> 39:39.740
Main street here in the city

39:40.380 --> 39:47.940
Keith Vigna catches up to you and you can see Clark Bishop trailing at least eight mausoleums behind

39:49.300 --> 39:55.940
Standard measurement when I catch up I want to just like grab his shoulder like what are you doing? Just come on slow down

39:55.940 --> 40:00.940
We got a we got a talk. Where are you going? It's far away from you as I can get

40:00.940 --> 40:07.900
I never asked to be born. Don't worry about that right now. I'm not even totally sure what any of it means. Oh

40:08.700 --> 40:12.700
Great real comforting dad, please. Don't call me that

40:14.220 --> 40:16.220
Dad

40:17.220 --> 40:19.420
Clark Bishop hears as he approaches

40:20.980 --> 40:25.240
Where are you running off to I'm going to be with planet juggernaut John

40:25.940 --> 40:30.220
I'm gonna ride him into the sky. No, it's what I want to do

40:32.820 --> 40:39.020
John just just cuz there's a chance that Keith in the body of Silas Cole invented you doesn't mean he's your dad

40:39.380 --> 40:41.860
You had a dad. It was Kevin. You're in his body now

40:41.860 --> 40:43.860
Oh

40:55.420 --> 40:57.420
Full identity crisis

41:02.740 --> 41:09.860
Well, he wasn't here to raise me when I was a young one and neither were you Keith so planet juggernaut is the strongest male

41:09.900 --> 41:15.040
Influence I've ever had in my life. You're older than me. I don't know how I could have raised you

41:15.740 --> 41:17.740
Then what you should have thought of that

41:18.180 --> 41:20.180
Before you had me

41:21.620 --> 41:22.940
Well

41:22.940 --> 41:24.940
Shit, I'm out of breath

41:25.660 --> 41:33.460
Actually, uh, John Lee Pettymore cannon is 26 years old and Keith Vigna is 29 years old

41:34.380 --> 41:38.560
We never talked about birthdays. Yeah, John never asked Keith

41:40.380 --> 41:41.660
a

41:41.660 --> 41:43.660
John assumed the same

41:47.660 --> 41:52.820
Clark help me talk some sense into him. We I don't even know where we need to be going John

41:52.820 --> 41:55.980
I'll tell you I don't I don't think the glass compounds where we need to go

41:55.980 --> 41:58.980
First of all that his name is crossed off our chests

41:58.980 --> 42:04.260
That seems like a clear sign that that's all taken care of over there at the end of the day

42:04.260 --> 42:08.780
We're gonna need you with that vision thing you got going on these days. That's that's a powerful skill you got

42:08.780 --> 42:11.540
That's something you can hang your hat on. That's all I am to you

42:11.540 --> 42:13.300
I mean you've been you've been with us from the beginning

42:13.300 --> 42:16.320
We didn't we never treated a different after we found out you were ball

42:16.980 --> 42:21.820
You were still one of our friend. It's cuz we need you around you're you're you you help us

42:23.420 --> 42:25.420
Y'all always did treat me like a friend

42:26.900 --> 42:29.700
All right, what do you want to do Clark you got any

42:30.540 --> 42:33.540
Yeah, any ideas? I got I got one

42:33.780 --> 42:39.400
Yeah now that we know where the book is and these days I'm feeling like I have my wits about me a little more

42:40.420 --> 42:45.220
Why don't we go get the book and head over to calm comfy campground? See what see what we can do?

42:45.420 --> 42:47.420
Maybe save the world there

42:48.260 --> 42:55.660
Okay, you know what that that one song said I'll follow you into the dark Clark

42:55.660 --> 42:57.660
I

43:00.340 --> 43:04.680
Don't step on Superman's cape I'm no Superman

43:08.460 --> 43:13.060
You don't follow Clark into the dark and you don't mess around with Jim

43:13.060 --> 43:17.780
I see you guys think that ambulance is here to pick up our mess back there. Oh, most certainly

43:17.780 --> 43:20.420
Yeah, I think we ought to let him see that

43:21.020 --> 43:21.940
Hey, all right

43:22.060 --> 43:25.460
You know what a good place to start might be checking out the bodies of these androids

43:26.020 --> 43:28.380
Moving them into the mausoleum, so they're not so obvious

43:28.860 --> 43:36.660
Yeah, I don't think I don't think this to have an EMTs see robots. It's gonna be help our case any let's get on it

43:36.900 --> 43:40.300
John they were at the front gate when we busted out of the mausoleum after you there

43:40.300 --> 43:45.960
I think they're they're pretty close. We got a hurry. We got to move fast. So so we are dragging the

43:46.660 --> 43:49.740
Androids back into the mausoleum, but also giving them a thorough

43:50.260 --> 43:57.580
Investigation Zach as we do so especially their penises you guys are so good at role-playing. It's wild. Thanks

43:58.860 --> 44:01.580
you know these ideas just come to us second I

44:03.380 --> 44:07.620
Mean you did say every time we left the mausoleum that they were there so

44:08.980 --> 44:14.460
It's not like we would have forgotten that yeah. Well was also just like yeah, we killed him

44:17.020 --> 44:19.020
Dealt with what's next

44:19.820 --> 44:22.160
There's nothing interesting about them. Fuck you

44:25.980 --> 44:27.460
Okay, so

44:27.460 --> 44:33.880
So the three of you make your way back to where you just were deep in the heart of the city

44:34.140 --> 44:36.700
Cemetery as you're dragging these androids

44:37.620 --> 44:39.620
into Ari Manstein's

44:39.980 --> 44:41.460
tomb

44:41.460 --> 44:47.460
You're giving him a good once over so I will need each of you to roll search

44:48.140 --> 44:51.700
Because you each have one of these androids

44:52.700 --> 44:59.940
30-40 didn't hear either one of you because you're both standing go Luke 31 on a 40 48 on a 50

45:00.660 --> 45:04.120
64 on a 20 Clark. Come on, man. Clark's useless

45:06.740 --> 45:08.740
This guy's totally lame rat dead

45:09.820 --> 45:11.820
John the androids are dead

45:12.220 --> 45:19.780
What else did you want to know Keith Vigna as you are dragging yours and you're kind of looking over it you remember

45:19.980 --> 45:26.520
Fighting one of these things at James the mill workers house and you remember how strong?

45:27.060 --> 45:29.060
the metal was and

45:29.140 --> 45:34.140
how the wrists popped off and had wiring inside and

45:34.580 --> 45:38.940
There were there were all sorts of gadgets kind of an inspector gadget style

45:39.740 --> 45:46.620
Dave Bautista thing going on here and I followed the first part where it is. Yeah Bautista come in

45:46.620 --> 45:50.900
Yeah, it's as if Dave Bautista was playing inspect your gadget. Yeah

45:52.860 --> 45:56.900
Cool that would be that's a fun casting I would fucking love

46:03.100 --> 46:05.100
All right podcast over

46:08.940 --> 46:10.940
a

46:11.220 --> 46:13.220
Friendship with podcast is ended

46:20.940 --> 46:23.740
I mean, he's he's he's hitting like

46:24.580 --> 46:27.800
65% right now. He's nailing it for blockbusters

46:27.800 --> 46:33.620
So it might be more like 40 after some of those bombs so we could probably sneak in there. That's what we want

46:34.060 --> 46:37.900
Stuber. Yeah, he did. He did. He did blow a stuber. That was a bummer

46:38.940 --> 46:40.940
Hey Dave, we've got just

46:46.060 --> 46:48.060
Everybody loves a reboot

46:48.300 --> 46:50.620
Also movies are huge right now

46:51.740 --> 46:57.960
No, it would be oh, oh my god it had Dave Bautista inspector gadget series on Disney Plus

47:00.660 --> 47:03.020
Can we use that Mandalorian screen

47:04.500 --> 47:06.500
That thing is fancy

47:06.860 --> 47:10.220
I'm editing all of this out so we can actually make this happen

47:10.460 --> 47:15.080
It's got a better chance of happening if we put it out in the world, baby. That's the secret

47:15.820 --> 47:19.040
Did you read that didn't have to that's the secret?

47:21.420 --> 47:28.780
Keith I forgot what I was gonna tell you. I don't know but they already have an inspector gadget in the works for Disney Plus

47:30.740 --> 47:35.960
Who called it baby, but who's starring I haven't gotten to those starring the writers are Mikey day

47:36.160 --> 47:41.240
What has been on SNL? He's gonna nail that and Streeter Seidel

47:41.920 --> 47:43.920
Streeter they got Streeter Seidel

47:47.800 --> 47:55.360
Yeah, they're also behind the Home Alone reboot for Disney Plus, I would love to see Home Alone, but Dave Bautista is the kid

47:55.360 --> 48:08.200
Keith Vigna as you drag this thing into the mausoleum you notice that this

48:09.200 --> 48:11.200
robot seems to have

48:11.240 --> 48:16.680
none of the advanced features that were previously part of

48:17.060 --> 48:24.080
The Android that you fought at the behest of you now know Maggie Cook and myriad

48:24.320 --> 48:28.440
They're at James the mill workers house and dr. Bradley anus fuck

48:31.000 --> 48:34.820
Do you really rely on it that much I'll change it and John Lee petty

48:35.720 --> 48:37.200
I

48:37.200 --> 48:39.440
Was like it was he a part of me

48:42.680 --> 48:44.960
Dr. Bradley anus is behind it all

48:47.280 --> 48:49.280
That asshole

48:49.280 --> 48:51.280
It

48:52.040 --> 48:57.720
Was there and you took it easy low-hanging fruit John Lee Kevin Moore the third as you're

48:59.120 --> 49:02.680
Dragging this thing in by the ankles of its pants

49:04.080 --> 49:07.940
Pants begin to fall down and instead of a Ken doll

49:09.200 --> 49:11.600
Right there where the smooth part is

49:13.360 --> 49:16.080
We're finally checking out these robot dogs

49:16.080 --> 49:18.080
You

49:18.120 --> 49:21.720
See a stamp that says property of

49:22.600 --> 49:27.280
The city asylum well god damn this one's hands don't pop off

49:29.200 --> 49:32.480
That's fascinating you find anything on yours

49:34.600 --> 49:37.200
Yeah, it belongs it belonged to the city asylum

49:38.080 --> 49:41.000
Holy shit are there any cavities to search?

49:41.600 --> 49:43.600
Cuz just call me dr. Anus

49:44.440 --> 49:45.840
I

49:45.840 --> 49:47.680
Will never again

49:47.680 --> 49:51.360
Keith I don't know if we if we told you and and filled us in a little bit

49:51.360 --> 49:57.580
There's this other group this opposing group called the city asylum, and that's who we think McKinley and

49:58.540 --> 50:01.640
Harrison Harrison Harrison Harrison was one of them

50:01.640 --> 50:08.640
But then the other guy the the woman who else got dead and as a president McKinley Canada and Kennedy

50:09.040 --> 50:13.280
Agent Kennedy we think that that's who they were working for and we told and

50:13.440 --> 50:16.360
They kind of helped us out in the end and and was like yeah

50:16.440 --> 50:22.520
Everybody's kind of moving around toward the same goal so so the city asylum isn't like an asylum

50:22.520 --> 50:30.000
It's a group it seems kind of like the opposite of the circle of knowledge or maybe you're huh, so we got some of these

50:30.720 --> 50:34.720
Robots are from them and some of these robots are from myriad

50:34.760 --> 50:42.300
And they just got these robot if you'll excuse the metaphor inspector gadget Bautista's running around out there

50:43.640 --> 50:49.360
Just wreaking havoc on the public doing their whims. I don't I don't stand for that

50:49.360 --> 50:53.820
I think these people started out trying to save the world and now now it's just gotten out of hand

50:53.820 --> 51:00.880
I mean we know Maggie's trying to take over the damn thing a small-town police chief just seems like a really unlikely and

51:01.360 --> 51:06.640
Poor starting position to be taken over the world from but somehow she did it, so that's I

51:07.320 --> 51:10.560
Will give her kudos there. That's some real Putin shit

51:14.800 --> 51:19.760
Quick question do we as characters know anything about the robots being tied to

51:20.640 --> 51:23.780
Any of the project stuff so that's the big thing

51:23.780 --> 51:29.160
I'm blanking on is that and clarified a little bit of those connections, and I'm blanking on how it all worked out

51:29.160 --> 51:36.600
Yeah, I thought we knew myriad had made them originally or yeah, you guys know that myriad makes these things so myriad

51:36.600 --> 51:40.160
That's why myriad has the newer model cuz these are old, but then also

51:40.840 --> 51:45.880
myriad decided that they were gonna start selling them to private companies and

51:46.560 --> 51:48.560
Jim Cook's operation

51:49.480 --> 51:51.560
operation stapler was

51:52.280 --> 51:54.280
his respect

51:54.560 --> 51:57.020
operation to cut down on cost

51:58.020 --> 52:03.940
For selling to private companies so the first one we fought was like og

52:04.900 --> 52:06.680
these are

52:06.680 --> 52:08.680
cheaper and not

52:09.060 --> 52:11.060
myriads

52:11.140 --> 52:14.100
Hmm I think out loud as Keith Vigna

52:14.820 --> 52:22.160
Boy, it was a good thing. We thought to check these bodies. Yeah, and John like takes the job one of them, and he's like

52:27.020 --> 52:29.020
Oh

52:31.740 --> 52:33.740
That's pretty silly don't you think was

52:41.900 --> 52:48.040
Where we going Clark I vote I vote hit I vote heading to get my book and then heading to calm comfy camper

52:48.060 --> 52:50.300
Okay, let's do it. I'm down

52:50.300 --> 52:56.100
How are you guys getting to contention I start running on all fours like a horse

52:56.100 --> 52:58.920
And I say I feel like I knew somebody that did this

53:02.180 --> 53:05.340
It's kind of fuzzy quit Clark hop on Keith I

53:07.460 --> 53:14.800
Don't know isn't I guess somebody's cars got to be here. Yeah, I guess drew got occupied last time so

53:15.180 --> 53:18.280
Okay, well. I think we should take over the ambulance

53:19.060 --> 53:22.440
Cops can do that right do we have any badges I?

53:22.960 --> 53:28.200
Got my badge on looks real old. They're gonna know looks like you're like in a

53:28.840 --> 53:33.440
Costume for a movie these are these are these are medical professionals

53:33.440 --> 53:37.620
They're they're around cops all the time what we need to do is go up to a civilian

53:37.960 --> 53:41.520
And steal their car under the guise of you being a cop. Yeah, I

53:42.240 --> 53:46.520
Don't really mind how we get a car. Let's just go. Oh, you know what also. We're grown-ass men

53:46.520 --> 53:52.720
Do we have wallets on us? Are you saying buy a car? I'm saying rent one. I kind of like the idea of stealing one

53:54.200 --> 53:58.240
We could just hail a cab yeah, we could just take an uber there as

53:59.040 --> 54:02.880
Somebody gets their phone out to order an uber. I'm like. I don't know we could steal that pretty easy

54:06.120 --> 54:10.680
Imagine how easy it'll be to steal once we're inside the uber if we want to go with now

54:10.680 --> 54:14.420
That's genius once we're in the vehicle. We can steal an uber well

54:14.420 --> 54:17.900
Yeah, and also let him drive us around a little bit and see if you know is this a car

54:17.900 --> 54:22.660
We want to steal you don't just go with the first uber. Yeah, I don't have a very good uber rating

54:22.660 --> 54:25.420
So I'll call him Keith. What'd you do? Oh?

54:26.420 --> 54:32.920
I've only ridden a couple times, and it's been on official police business, so they'd you know what let's not get into it

54:33.780 --> 54:36.540
Keith has like a 2.4. He just

54:38.260 --> 54:40.260
Why I wonder

54:45.100 --> 54:47.100
Right, but I don't know

54:51.940 --> 54:58.460
Excuse me dear listener, but I have to drop in here real quick with some unfortunate news

54:58.520 --> 55:03.360
See we had to record the rest of this episode on a different day and on that day

55:03.540 --> 55:09.620
We had issues two of them in fact the first is fine Luke. Just didn't have his newer microphone

55:09.620 --> 55:13.860
So he's at a slightly lower quality than he will be moving forward

55:13.860 --> 55:21.140
But the second sucks shit my laptop couldn't handle my recording and Google Docs and discord and my manatee

55:21.340 --> 55:26.740
Masturbation meditation videos all at the same time so my voice is pretty choppy

55:26.780 --> 55:32.980
I've been trying and trying tirelessly to figure out a way to repair this issue to no avail however

55:32.980 --> 55:39.540
I do think the rest of this episode rules hard enough to pull the focus away from the problem in fact

55:39.540 --> 55:45.640
You know what I actually did it on purpose to make your muscles tense while listening to this fairly

55:46.140 --> 55:51.680
Unnerving part of the story so when you feel your jaw finally relax at the end of the episode

55:51.980 --> 55:54.760
You'll know it worked hugs and kisses

56:01.300 --> 56:04.060
It doesn't get you down to a 2.4

56:04.580 --> 56:06.580
stars from just one

56:06.860 --> 56:10.540
Incident so I think we should all describe a single

56:10.900 --> 56:16.860
Incident that got teeth while on duty a low uber score. I will start one word at a time

56:18.540 --> 56:23.700
Yeah, we'll go around Keith really shit

56:29.620 --> 56:31.900
His mama

56:36.580 --> 56:38.580
My

56:41.660 --> 56:46.100
Okay, we do need we need to take improv lessons if we want this to be

56:49.260 --> 56:55.020
Well hold on let me improv this one word at a time for everybody Keith really shit what his mama gave him

56:55.500 --> 57:03.660
And forgot his police cruiser, so he called a wacky uber to drive him to the crime scene

57:03.660 --> 57:07.220
That was really cool how we all work together

57:09.500 --> 57:15.560
We all do a really good Thomas we should just make the one episode where all it is is a mad lib

57:15.740 --> 57:21.620
We should do like four episodes in a row where it's just one of us talking. It doesn't sound like it would be very popular

57:24.320 --> 57:31.260
Okay, so I like to think that Keith was out on a call and he needed to arrest someone so he handcuffs a perp

57:31.260 --> 57:37.340
And then as he takes him back to the police cruiser you realize he locked his keys in his cruiser with the car running

57:37.340 --> 57:39.340
so then he has to

57:45.180 --> 57:49.100
Explains to the uber driver like this is a wanted criminal

57:55.100 --> 57:57.100
Pop the trunk

58:01.260 --> 58:03.260
I

58:04.020 --> 58:08.300
Throws him in the trunk and then Keith gets in the shotgun seat of course and

58:08.940 --> 58:13.860
Instead of going straight to the police station Keith is like I'm gonna shit with my mama gave me

58:16.940 --> 58:20.180
He shits his pants, and then still makes the guy go through a drive-through

58:23.900 --> 58:25.900
I shit my pants

58:31.860 --> 58:33.860
Away, there's no trouble afterwards

58:37.140 --> 58:40.760
Actually I was wrong that one experience might take you all the way down to

58:44.700 --> 58:46.700
He's only been on three uber rides

58:49.020 --> 58:56.220
Goodness so Keith pulls out his phone and orders an uber and it's you see on the app that there is a vintage

58:56.220 --> 58:58.380
I guess it wouldn't say vintage, huh?

58:58.380 --> 59:01.300
I wouldn't say what year the car is no

59:01.300 --> 59:05.740
It might say what year the car is it says what year the car is once somebody agrees to pick you up

59:05.740 --> 59:12.420
It does tell you what what the car is so one unfortunate soul does agree to pick the three of you up

59:12.420 --> 59:15.620
I guess he doesn't know that there's three of you, and you don't know it's a he

59:15.620 --> 59:20.460
But it does does it say his name. It's been a while since I've used you. Yeah. What's his name?

59:20.980 --> 59:23.780
Lewis his name is Lewis, and he's driving a

59:24.780 --> 59:26.780
1966 Toyota Prius oh

59:27.900 --> 59:31.260
His name is Reginald, and he's driving hey

59:33.500 --> 59:35.500
1966

59:36.020 --> 59:41.980
Volkswagen van like a bus or like a mini. Yeah, it's like a bus. It's like a van bus

59:43.220 --> 59:46.100
Two different things are just the same name for the same thing

59:46.940 --> 59:49.660
Was the van this vintage teal?

59:50.540 --> 59:54.380
Volkswagen van rolls up on the outskirts of

59:54.940 --> 01:00:01.180
The city cemetery and it is driven by a man as like long hair

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.580
He looks pretty

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:10.100
Pretty lanky and his eyes are darting all over the place. He's kind of flinching a little bit and

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:18.140
You see that his shirt seems to be made from random pieces of fabric that were like patched together quilted together

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.980
Hey guys

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:31.060
Are you what what's your name Spud, but I'll miss but it was Lewis or Reginald

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.900
Oh, no my mom tried to name me Lewis, but my dad

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.740
He he really liked the name Reginald

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:44.460
And he grabs a can of whipped cream from the floorboard under his feet, and he just goes

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.460
Into his mouth

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:53.620
But but I'm gonna sidebar with my compatriots real quick

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:59.780
Is he eating the whipped cream or is he like inhaling the the gas from the can?

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.060
Yeah

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:05.980
Is he popping a rule search for me to see if there's a any any actual cream on that any cream?

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.460
And I'm gonna search for cream in his mouth

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.420
Let's see 22 freaking crit success

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.940
Dude there is a little there's a little bit of cream

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.180
There's like a little bit of cream on his lip and it seems to like at least sputtered

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:33.860
You know there's some he keeps his lips tight around that white

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.340
But

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.740
So you can't see it all but like yeah

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:46.580
So we are John leads these guys into a sidebar real quick, and it's like hey

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.700
You know I don't know if it's just that the good Lord

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:53.500
You know can only make so many variations of his own creations

01:01:53.700 --> 01:02:01.260
But but doesn't doesn't this guy sound a lot like that that weird creature that was looking for the overseer

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:07.020
I'd have to hear him. I'd have to hear him talk one more time

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.080
Do you think maybe those creatures are doing poppers, too

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.740
That's not what poppers are I

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:20.340
Did them one time in a hot tub at a bastard you're thinking of you're thinking of whippets Joe whippets

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.860
That's something yeah, I've never done whippets, but I did do poppers in a hot tub with a bunch of hot dudes

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.660
You know what happened to your accent Keith?

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.660
Yeah, that was Keith saying that he forgot who he was

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:41.660
Being Silas Cole for so long made him forget who he was yeah, I'm having like flashbacks. I'm like I'm not okay, okay

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:48.180
Zach you gave me like dirty looks and flipped me off, so I was asking a legitimate game strategic question

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.260
No, I I appreciate that he turns and he's like

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.320
Sorry, I had something in my eye

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.540
Hey, hey, I had some I had something in my

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:10.480
This sidebar was a false alarm. This is just an average country feller. Just like you or me or Keith even

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.820
I just been doing some helium and whipped cream

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:18.860
Wait you've been doing your are you high right now nah?

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.900
You want your driver relaxed. Let's get in yeah normally

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:27.680
I've started, but this seems kind of like the guy that wouldn't think twice about anything. We're about to do

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.720
Yeah, if you see some freaky shit. It's cuz you're high Clark

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.080
I don't want to alarm you, but every time you've been in a cruiser with Keith, or I we have been at least

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400
His level or beyond on

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.920
Inhalants or some other substance he hears you guys talking, and he's like nice. Hey

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.880
Yeah, we used to be the law still are kind of not anymore

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.280
I guess we're we're kind of wandering vagabonds like you creatures of the road

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.340
Are you guys going to like a costume party or something?

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.340
Oh

01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:04.220
Sure, that's sick. Yeah, man. You're born naked and the rest is just drag dude. The rest is just ha ha and he like

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:08.860
grabs on his shoulder like the shirt of his shoulder the shoulder of his shirt and

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:13.260
He's like the rest is just rags my dude

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.100
Yeah, your clothes are not very good

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.540
Self man, it's yeah, I'm making myself. It's really me

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.680
Self yeah, it yeah, it does look like that

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.500
Where did I where did I put the address as?

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:37.140
For our end. Yeah, could you just take us to the to the pen man? Oh, yeah for sure dude, and he starts driving

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:43.040
I'm really glad that I got that thing out of my throat. I feel much more comfortable like this

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:48.020
I'm glad to man. I'm glad you can be comfortable. I'm glad you can just drive us

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:53.100
Guys doing in contention really have to say anything at all to us. No, I figure we talk

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:58.020
I'm one of those uber drivers who likes to talk to everybody the whole time. What are you guys doing in contention?

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:02.620
Huh? Do you find that people like that? I know I know dude. It's just like I get so lonely

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:09.340
Sometimes, you know, yeah one cool thing that an uber driver can do is just put on some some pretty

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:13.980
You know some pretty well-liked music radios busted man

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:19.220
Pretty me some music that like everybody can kind of get you know anything from the 70s basically off

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.380
I wish I could do the worst

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.960
Worst thing they could do besides talking is like put on Imagine Dragons, but they do that a lot

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:32.260
Would we recognize this guy from like around contention? Nah, man. I'm from the city. What are you guys?

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.620
Are you guys from contention or what born and raised here? What?

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:40.980
Yeah, you're from contention. That's sick, dude. I heard the cops. They're like

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:47.340
Bad I heard there's some crazy boys. Yeah. Yeah. What else have you heard about him? Oh, dude

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:54.140
I just have some friends down there who like get litty like my homie. He's the manager at this sandwich place and

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.980
Like you I mean he grows his own shit. It's fucking cool. Yeah, that's my cousin

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:04.980
No shit what yeah, he's a good guy. His stuff is pretty good. Oh

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.620
Dude, and he like as he's driving he turns fully around

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:15.740
Look you in the eyes and hands and puts on his fist to give you nuts

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:19.240
I quickly return his knucks and point towards the road

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.100
nice

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.180
And it's quiet for the first time

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:30.380
Hey, could you put something on like even Imagine Dragons at this point? Oh, like I said before

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.380
We're kind of both standing up at the same time. It's pretty crazy

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.700
But like so I couldn't hear you or you can hear me

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:45.320
But like radio is fucking busted I could I could sing some Imagine Dragons for you if you want. Yes, please do that

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.880
Yeah, that's for sure that that sounds great to me. Thank you

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.880
Oh

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:09.080
Well, maybe I need to give them boys a second chance cuz that's the best Imagine Dragons song I've ever heard I

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.080
Mean just fucking imagine them though, right?

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:20.080
It is evocative as hell I'm picturing them all Game of Thrones, you know one time after I think it's like smile

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.920
I read all those books in my early 20s. That's one thing. You don't know about John Lee Pettymore. Oh nice

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.920
John Lee Pettymore is your name? That's long

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.960
Yeah, it's three it's three of them

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.680
All together they're

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.880
Mean my name's spud pass bud spud

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:44.520
Yes, but like the beer dog like it like a tater like a tater nice and he turns fully around

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.120
Back back turn around and as you turn around you both you all see two things in the distance both are

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:03.960
Roughly 30 feet in the air the Sun slowly beginning its descent behind them one is

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:11.660
Expected it's the billboard for the contingent trucks your hometown baseball team trucks. Bring it

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:17.680
Trucks bring it. The other is less expected. It's a floating

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.240
four-wheeler this

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:26.720
Familiar all-terrain vehicle adds another terrain to its already impressive resume

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.720
As it seems

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.800
As it seems to surf on some sort of

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:41.620
Invisible wave roll sanity. Is this a four-wheeler occupied or just on its own up in the it's occupied as hell

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.920
It's pretty far away

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:51.080
Can I can I reroll my sanity? No, that's great though. If you failed it's fun. I did

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.980
I am at 18. Oh and so

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.540
Do you think 44 is a good roll

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:07.260
Yes, I do think 44 is a good roll Joe you put a thumbs down meaning you pass

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:16.580
It was luckily under my power, okay under your power and then Thomas what did you roll I failed

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:21.300
Okay, so it says if you pass you don't lose any sanity

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.180
Congratulations to no one

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.860
if you

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:33.420
Joe and Thomas both roll a d4 as Luke takes one d4 of sanity damage or I mean, sorry

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.700
Luke you take all four

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:40.660
That's what I figured Joe and Thomas roll a d4 as Luke rolls a d4

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.420
You guys are rolling a d4 for fun, he's actually losing the same

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:51.760
I didn't want to feel I didn't want you to feel left out of this interactive process

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:57.460
Zach I got bad news for you or good news. I hit my breaking point. Hey

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:04.460
This already but every time I wake up in the mausoleum, I'm one point away from my breaking point

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:14.020
It's fucking great and Thomas, what'd you roll? I lost to sanity okey-dokey and Luke lost four

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:20.060
I mean Keith Vigna lost four which puts me at fourteen. There's one thing on my notes here

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:23.640
It says if they pass read this I won't read that

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:31.300
Okay fast approaching is a massive black shiny wave the size of a tsunami

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:36.980
formed from the indelible viscous sludge that infiltrated your town and

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:43.060
Disrupted your lives inside this thrashing swell of my I wrote this already

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:46.900
So it's like but it disrupted your lives and now I'm thinking like what lives

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.700
We don't really sad

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:54.740
Jesus Christ inside this thrashing swell of muck

01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:02.620
Thrashing bodies. Yeah, read your copy and add like any commentary or like embellishments later. Don't fucking

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.120
Hold your applause for the end, dude

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:11.020
If you want to add some parentheses, like what lives these miserable fucks

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.980
Okay, do that you don't know you got it I mean

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:20.740
Bust out of character just to throw shade. It's it's it's fine. I'm a tree birch. So

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:27.060
inside this thrashing swell of muck are the thrashing bodies of

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:33.820
councilwoman Carrie pages and Salem the cats their hands and paws

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:38.220
Stretch out trying to breach this inescapable tide

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:45.740
But their struggle does not last long their limbs fold into this ooze becoming one with a sentient

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:50.380
Massive goop that is about to crash down upon you

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.020
What do you do?

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:59.620
How fast is this wave moving? Like do we have much time? Nope, and as it collapses over you

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.620
You

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:10.740
It's just enough time for you to also realize that the driver is seeing what you're saying as he just goes

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.700
dude

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:18.220
But the dude is pretty much cut off by the wave

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:23.940
like the swell of like, you know when you get hit by a wave in the ocean and just kind of holds you down and

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.980
for like a moment you think it's

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.700
over

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:37.580
Okay, so like GAC was Nickelodeon's version of flarp or slime a toy for children made by mixing water

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:45.020
With borax and with my wife. I'm sorry. It's I GAC slime. Yes. What was the other thing? You said flarp?

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:47.660
flarp flarp flarp

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:54.100
FL AR I think I that's what we called it. Hang on. Wait. Wait one second. Oh shit

01:12:54.620 --> 01:13:01.060
Does he have some floor just walked away he just like ran away with a giddy child like smile I have

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.620
It's not in the thing, but I've got the case for it. No

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:09.420
I don't know where

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.620
Buddy oh no, it got out noise putty. So it's the stuff

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:20.060
You can put your finger into it and it makes really easy fart sense. Gotcha. Yeah, okay

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:25.260
Or if you can't afford a pocket pussy almost as if like the the sound is that's where it went

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:30.460
Or if you can't afford a fuck barrel the flarp barrel. Oh, that's a patreon joke

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:33.860
Yeah, nobody

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:44.780
It's it's so good right now, I cannot wait until you make a fuck barrel the fuck barrels are gonna come out sooner than the t-shirts

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.300
Fucking hurts

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:59.860
The the stuff we created in our kitchen with like borax and water and liquid glue is a lot like wetter and runnier

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:07.300
Than the GAC like the name-brand stuff and it felt cold and wet but sort of heavy at the same time

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:14.580
And when the stuff moved around it peeled away like it had to like make an effort to release from your skin

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:20.540
What is that called where it's like when you hit it it's a solid but I was just thinking about that too

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:24.220
I think it's a Newtonian substance or a yeah

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:32.580
Newtonian yeah non-newtonian with like cornstarch or something. Is that how you used to make it? Yeah cornstarch and and like come

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:36.020
Oobleck oobleck. Yeah black ooh

01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:40.420
Flarp ooh black. Okay now imagine

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:42.420
Dragons

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.620
Imagine the stages

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.340
the way that your thoughts change throughout this

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.420
vorish

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.100
Process as you are consumed

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:59.380
Oh the reason that I talked about GAC for so long is imagine that it's like literally covering your entire body at first it

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:06.100
Feels like jumping into a pool with your clothes on like a little strange little awkward like in the van. Yes

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:10.060
Oh completely. You can't see anything anymore except for darkness and

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:17.820
As the ooze pushes in around you it becomes increasingly difficult to move your limbs

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.380
this cold wet sludge

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:29.340
relentlessly fills every orifice in your body and you struggle to maintain a sense of optimism as you are

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:32.420
completely enveloped in this suffocating

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.700
goo

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:40.820
John Lee Pettymore who rolled over his power has just unbuckled his seatbelt like while he could still move

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:47.780
He rolled up into as much of a ball as he could, you know, this form is not really my own. I

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:52.220
Will survive the goo onslaught. I hope my friends will be as lucky

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:57.900
If not, perhaps I might rip their spines out and take their corpses if this one is ruined by the goo

01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:59.840
Keith

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:06.620
After having just lost four sanity, he isn't really computing like he knows what's going on

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:12.240
But he's just decided it's not actually happening to him. And so he's just sitting there

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.240
Breathing in as normal. I

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.000
Think Clark tries to scream and gurgles

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.480
This isn't how it was supposed to go

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.840
So look directly into the camera right now Joe look directly into the camera right now

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.600
Dear listener, I have such mixed emotions right now

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:54.000
An oozing substance has just made its way into my studio and it is heading directly

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:58.140
Towards me on one hand. I feel like I am

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.140
Unfortunately

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:03.840
Staring down the empty pudding cup of my existence

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:11.580
But on the other hand, it kind of looks like rotting putrid slop like I said, I'm hungry

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.940
What the fuck

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.140
Oh

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.140
You

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:30.140
You
