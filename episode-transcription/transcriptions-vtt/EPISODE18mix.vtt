00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
Hello all my nephews and nieces, it is your fun uncle, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to

00:06.880 --> 00:14.120
weird y'all out from 694.2 PTBP Contention's Greatest Radio Show.

00:14.120 --> 00:20.800
This episode is brought to you by Fire Lizard Games, a tabletop games company based in Springfield

00:20.800 --> 00:23.480
run by just three brothers.

00:23.480 --> 00:31.200
They currently have a Kickstarter launched in their first game, Base, a card PG.

00:31.200 --> 00:38.680
Base is a setting agnostic storytelling game using a simple, uniquely designed system.

00:38.680 --> 00:44.120
They designed the game to be appealing for everyone, whether you are a newcomer to roleplaying

00:44.120 --> 00:47.520
games or a stone cold pro.

00:47.520 --> 00:52.680
All you need to play the game is the rulebook, a standard deck of cards, and a few six-sided

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
dice.

00:53.680 --> 00:59.560
The Kickstarter tiers start as low as $3 and it will end on April 16th, my babies.

00:59.560 --> 01:05.840
Give them a follow on Facebook for your buddy Wolf, or Instagram, or Twitter, or how about

01:05.840 --> 01:10.200
all three, at Fire Lizard Games for more updates.

01:10.200 --> 01:16.040
And now let's get back to my favorite segment, Howlin' with Wolf, where we get to hear from

01:16.040 --> 01:20.720
our caring, adoring, and intelligent listeners.

01:20.760 --> 01:26.280
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Hot Donna on Twitter, who writes,

01:26.280 --> 01:30.880
After careful consideration, my request is as follows.

01:30.880 --> 01:36.200
Instead of making an actual announcement, I would love for Wolf to make one incredibly

01:36.200 --> 01:39.880
long and possibly melodic fart noise.

01:39.880 --> 01:45.040
Ahem, I guess it might go something like,

01:55.320 --> 02:02.160
Well, Hot Donna, I hope that made you happy inside, cuz, uh, yeah.

02:02.160 --> 02:07.760
Anyway, it's time to remember what happened last time, it's the news.

02:07.760 --> 02:13.640
Turns out, maybe Keith is a monster to be around because his dad was a dick who clearly

02:13.640 --> 02:17.000
preferred his older son, Ferguson.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.280
Now that's not an excuse, Officer Vigna is the worst person in contention.

02:22.280 --> 02:27.560
While playing on the family's sprawling estate, Keith and Ferguson heard the sirens blaring

02:27.560 --> 02:32.880
as strange, gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky and were shot down by the

02:32.880 --> 02:35.360
Bean's security personnel.

02:35.360 --> 02:40.520
Later that night, William Beans gave Ferguson a watch and told him about a prophecy that

02:40.520 --> 02:42.800
says he will save the world.

02:42.800 --> 02:48.400
Back in whatever year it is now, the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station

02:48.400 --> 02:53.360
and locked it up with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures.

02:53.360 --> 02:59.000
The light on the camera was green, so John took a picture of Keith outside the station.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.480
Unsurprisingly, the picture was not of Keith, but of two men in a strange room that lacked

03:04.480 --> 03:05.720
color.

03:05.720 --> 03:10.560
On the way to the mill, on the other side of the city, John saw something strange in

03:10.560 --> 03:17.480
the sky, causing a fiery three car wreck on the main longitudinal drag of contention.

03:17.480 --> 03:23.040
Taking us to that scene now, is Kudzu with no backbone.

03:47.480 --> 03:56.840
I need everyone to roll power.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.720
I fail.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.840
I'm the most powerful motherfucker.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.600
I fail, 96 on a 60.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.440
I got an 86 on a 50.

04:11.440 --> 04:12.440
Okay.

04:12.440 --> 04:16.000
You have all been in a car wreck.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.880
You have the choice to either stay put in the exact position that you're in or to move.

04:22.880 --> 04:28.460
Now real quick, I'm going to have you all roll a D6 for hit points to see how many you

04:28.460 --> 04:30.320
lost from the wreck.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.320
Four.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
One.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.320
Two.

04:33.320 --> 04:37.240
That puts me at 24.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.240
I'm at 14.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.880
Luke said he was at 19.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.080
I'm at 19.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.080
My name is Keith.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
Oh yeah.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.080
Oh no.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.080
Oh no.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.080
Keith.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.080
Oh no.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.080
Luke, it's you.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.080
I'm at 19.

04:51.080 --> 04:56.320
Guys, I was in a car wreck tonight, I don't know if I can finish the episode.

04:56.320 --> 05:03.560
You all hear this vehicle that is flown off the side of the road on fire.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.880
Do you move or do you stay put?

05:05.880 --> 05:06.880
I move.

05:06.880 --> 05:07.880
I move.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.880
Is my car still operational?

05:09.880 --> 05:10.880
Is it on?

05:10.880 --> 05:11.880
No.

05:11.880 --> 05:12.880
I move.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.880
Okay.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.680
I got their power check.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.680
Just John.

05:16.680 --> 05:21.960
John, you lose one willpower and I need the other two to roll a D4 for me.

05:21.960 --> 05:22.960
One.

05:22.960 --> 05:23.960
Three.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.040
That was willpower?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.040
It was indeed.

05:27.040 --> 05:31.320
Well, Clark Bishop is at seven willpower, John Lee Pettymore is at 11 willpower.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.320
I'm at one.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.560
However, yes, Keith Vigna is at one willpower.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.880
I thought you did all the coke to gain willpower.

05:37.880 --> 05:42.560
I did the coke to not have a minus 20 to my rolls.

05:42.560 --> 05:49.280
When you get down to one or two willpower, you're at a negative 20% on all rolls.

05:49.280 --> 05:54.840
Now, Keith Vigna, having lost willpower at this point, you were back at a negative 20%

05:54.840 --> 05:56.600
on all rolls.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.600
And so your high of your cane-

06:00.600 --> 06:02.220
It was so harsh, dude.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.360
It was harsh as fuck.

06:04.360 --> 06:05.680
You no longer have the-

06:05.680 --> 06:06.680
I do more.

06:06.680 --> 06:07.680
Advantages.

06:07.920 --> 06:12.960
So you guys are all in the car wreck and John passed his power roll and so he's spending

06:12.960 --> 06:14.720
one willpower to move.

06:14.720 --> 06:20.480
Keith and Clark both failed their power rolls and so they had to roll a D4 in order to find

06:20.480 --> 06:23.560
out how much willpower they were going to lose in order to move.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.140
Keith is losing one willpower point to move.

06:26.140 --> 06:29.740
Clark failed and is spending three willpower points to move.

06:29.740 --> 06:36.400
Clark is driving one cruiser with Keith sitting shotgun and John is driving the cruiser ahead

06:36.440 --> 06:39.240
that got rear ended by Clark's cruiser.

06:39.240 --> 06:43.960
Now, John, I need you to roll luck for me.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.600
John's luck is 55.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.600
Yes.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.600
98.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.160
And he fails.

06:49.160 --> 06:56.760
So I need you to roll a dexterity check to try to get out of your seat, which your seat

06:56.760 --> 07:00.880
belt is completely jammed and you're stuck in your seat currently.

07:00.880 --> 07:01.960
11.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.040
Critical success.

07:03.040 --> 07:07.320
You want to describe how you get out of this car in a very cool way?

07:07.320 --> 07:08.320
Yeah.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.300
We describe how I'm stuck again real quick.

07:10.300 --> 07:16.520
You got crunched from the back and so your seat literally moved forward and your knees

07:16.520 --> 07:22.400
went into the console of your cruiser, breaking through the plastic on either side of the

07:22.400 --> 07:27.280
steering wheel and so your knees are like cut up and bleeding from the plastic and you

07:27.280 --> 07:32.760
hit your head on the steering wheel and so you're kind of dazed and your seat has moved

07:32.760 --> 07:36.120
forward in a way to where your seat belt has jammed you into position.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.240
Oh, I don't know how I'm going to get out of that.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.400
That sounds really bad.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.920
You can do anything to get out of this because you rolled a critical success.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.200
He chews his way out.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.600
Like a rat in a...

07:47.600 --> 07:53.280
Yeah, I think he just takes his flashlight and just bangs it against the seat belt a

07:53.280 --> 07:55.360
few times and gets lucky.

07:55.360 --> 08:01.520
Yeah, wiggles out the window basically while doing a somersault because it's a crit success.

08:01.560 --> 08:06.400
Oh, can I trade in for doing something really cool for my crit success with noticing a little

08:06.400 --> 08:10.700
bit more about the situation as I get out because what I'm really interested in is what's

08:10.700 --> 08:15.160
happened to what was hit, who was hit, and what's all going on.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.160
Absolutely.

08:16.160 --> 08:23.460
So as you make it out of your police cruiser, you would notice not only has your police

08:23.460 --> 08:29.900
cruiser caught fire, but you look over and you actually see the other vehicle that you

08:29.900 --> 08:33.140
ran off the road by swerving into their lane.

08:33.140 --> 08:34.540
It's a minivan.

08:34.540 --> 08:40.300
It is flipped over and it is currently leaking fluid all over the ground.

08:40.300 --> 08:43.300
Keith, I need you to roll luck.

08:43.300 --> 08:47.100
A 70 and a 65.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.060
You are pinched.

08:49.060 --> 08:54.540
Your cruiser with Clark driving smashed into the back of John's cruiser.

08:54.540 --> 08:56.100
Your airbag went off.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.380
It knocked you back and...

08:58.380 --> 09:01.220
My penis fell off.

09:01.220 --> 09:02.220
I used my penis to unlock...

09:02.220 --> 09:03.220
Grab it.

09:03.220 --> 09:04.220
Grab it with the door.

09:04.220 --> 09:05.220
I grab his penis.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.220
Thanks, Clark.

09:06.220 --> 09:13.580
Your side of the car got completely smashed in and so your door is unable to open.

09:13.580 --> 09:18.300
So you're going to have to smash through the window to get out of this vehicle.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.340
So I need you to roll strength for me.

09:20.340 --> 09:22.780
10 on a 55.

09:22.780 --> 09:23.780
All right.

09:23.780 --> 09:24.780
So...

09:24.780 --> 09:25.780
I...

09:25.780 --> 09:27.660
Give me a second to think about it.

09:27.660 --> 09:33.700
Oh, I take my handy dandy handgun and use the butt of it to just...

09:33.700 --> 09:36.900
And I am very careful not to cut myself.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.340
Fire some warning shots outside for you.

09:39.340 --> 09:46.620
No, I like to conserve my ammunition for people that threaten me or people I want to threaten.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.940
So yeah, I do that.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.980
And then do I have a move or...

09:49.980 --> 09:57.220
So you can use your turn to get out of the vehicle and as you do get out of the vehicle,

09:57.220 --> 10:02.620
you would notice that this cruiser that you were in, Clark's cruiser, is also leaking

10:02.620 --> 10:05.540
fluid all over the ground underneath the vehicle.

10:05.540 --> 10:08.020
Clark, I need you to roll luck for me.

10:08.020 --> 10:10.460
53 on a 75.

10:10.460 --> 10:11.460
Okay.

10:11.460 --> 10:16.460
I mean, you already spent your three willpower to make a move action this round.

10:16.460 --> 10:22.220
So you can use that to get out of the car or do anything else that you want to do.

10:22.220 --> 10:23.780
No, I just want to get out of the car.

10:23.780 --> 10:24.780
Okay, awesome.

10:24.820 --> 10:28.860
You get out of the car, you would notice as well that there is liquid underneath your

10:28.860 --> 10:33.180
car and you would also see John's cruiser is catching fire.

10:33.180 --> 10:40.460
You all look over and see this minivan that has swerved off the road is completely upside

10:40.460 --> 10:45.780
down and dark liquid coming out all over the place.

10:45.780 --> 10:46.780
Round two.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.140
I need everyone to roll power in order to move.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.140
Fuck.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.620
No, 68 on a 60.

10:52.620 --> 10:55.100
I pass with a 45 on a 60.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.100
Crit failed.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.820
Your other penis falls off.

10:57.820 --> 11:00.180
Clark, we'll start with you this time.

11:00.180 --> 11:01.180
You succeeded.

11:01.180 --> 11:02.180
Mm-hmm.

11:02.180 --> 11:04.260
So you're only going to lose one willpower right now?

11:04.260 --> 11:07.340
Am I going to lose willpower because I have one willpower?

11:07.340 --> 11:09.700
Does that mean I die?

11:09.700 --> 11:12.980
Going to zero willpower doesn't mean that you die, but I will describe what happens

11:12.980 --> 11:15.980
to you in just a second.

11:15.980 --> 11:21.260
What's my distance from the front of John's car and what's my distance from the van?

11:21.260 --> 11:24.420
You are one move action away from either.

11:24.420 --> 11:26.220
Shit.

11:26.220 --> 11:30.180
But is one closer?

11:30.180 --> 11:31.180
They are equidistant.

11:31.180 --> 11:32.180
Okay.

11:32.180 --> 11:33.180
I'm going to go to the van.

11:33.180 --> 11:34.180
Okay.

11:34.180 --> 11:35.180
Sounds good.

11:35.180 --> 11:37.020
You run up to the van.

11:37.020 --> 11:40.300
Roll an alertness check for me.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.300
Fuck.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.300
A 90 on a 70.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.300
Okay.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.780
So you see two people in the front seats.

11:48.780 --> 11:54.100
There's a woman driving and a young boy in the front seat.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.100
Okay.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.180
John, you failed your power check.

11:57.180 --> 11:58.180
Yeah.

11:58.180 --> 12:00.020
So I need you to roll a D4 for me.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.020
What?

12:01.020 --> 12:02.020
Okay.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.860
So you lose one willpower in order to move this round.

12:04.860 --> 12:05.860
I'm down to 10.

12:05.860 --> 12:06.860
Yeah.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.600
Just for the record, I'm down to six.

12:08.600 --> 12:13.900
I would like to grab the fire extinguisher from my cruiser and attempt to put out the

12:13.900 --> 12:15.740
fire on my engine.

12:15.740 --> 12:17.900
Does it look extinguishable at this juncture?

12:18.020 --> 12:19.020
Yes, absolutely.

12:19.020 --> 12:21.740
So go ahead and roll law for me.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.140
I got a 50-50 shot.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.140
13.

12:25.140 --> 12:26.780
Describe what you do.

12:26.780 --> 12:32.300
Calmly and efficiently, like seeing Clark taking care of the civilians, I demonstrate

12:32.300 --> 12:35.940
an excellent knowledge of law and procedure.

12:35.940 --> 12:37.400
Go right to the compartment.

12:37.400 --> 12:43.720
My extinguisher is locked in and calmly, but professionally and with the quickness, I put

12:43.720 --> 12:44.720
the fire out.

12:44.720 --> 12:45.720
Wonderful.

12:45.720 --> 12:50.640
After you do that, you see Clark's cruiser begins to go up in flames.

12:50.640 --> 12:54.320
The engine is smoking and you see flames licking out from underneath the hood.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.400
I'm just going to Benny Hill style run between both cars.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.200
So you've taken care of your cruiser.

13:00.200 --> 13:04.840
Keith Vigna, you failed your power check in order to move.

13:04.840 --> 13:10.120
I need you to roll a D4 for me, although it doesn't really matter.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.120
One.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.640
That means I'm at zero.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.840
Keith has hit zero willpower.

13:14.960 --> 13:22.240
Keith hops out of the side door of Clark's police cruiser and desperately looks around,

13:22.240 --> 13:28.520
smelling the gas, seeing the oil, seeing the flames, seeing this minivan.

13:28.520 --> 13:32.160
Your head begins spinning and you black out.

13:32.160 --> 13:38.980
The two of you look over and see Officer Vigna, just eyes go blank and he falls backward onto

13:38.980 --> 13:44.000
the ground right next to Clark's cruiser.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
And three.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Fight!

13:46.000 --> 13:50.720
I need John and Clark to roll power for me.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.040
Oh, God damn it.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.040
Sixty two on a sixty.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
Thirty two on a sixty.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
Okay.

13:57.040 --> 14:01.480
Clark, you're going to lose one willpower and John, go ahead and roll a D4 for me.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
Four.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.720
John loses four willpower and Clark loses one.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.720
I'm now at five.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.720
I'm at six.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.720
All right.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.440
Clark, I need you to roll a luck check for me real quick.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.080
Ah, fuck.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.720
Uh, ninety on a seventy five.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.720
Awesome.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.720
Fuck you.

14:17.720 --> 14:23.760
That will come into play in just a second.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.600
So John, what do you want to do this round?

14:25.600 --> 14:30.240
I get, yeah, I want to try to extinguish the fire in on the other cruiser.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.720
Is there enough juice left in the container or do I need to get theirs?

14:33.720 --> 14:36.640
Why would you ask that?

14:36.640 --> 14:48.640
I'll go ahead and let you, uh, by the way, this is a super important role and I'm going

14:48.640 --> 14:55.360
to let you finish out the rest of this canister on their car, but I need you to roll law in

14:55.360 --> 14:57.720
order to put it out.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.360
Okay.

14:59.360 --> 15:02.000
Forty.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.520
Fuck you.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.520
Well done.

15:04.520 --> 15:05.520
Thank you.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.520
Nice.

15:07.400 --> 15:12.120
Once again, like fucking calmly as shit, John Lee Pettymore, who has lost a lot of willpower

15:12.120 --> 15:15.680
and HP, like bleeding all over the extinguisher.

15:15.680 --> 15:21.000
I just nailed that shit and save this family, the passed out Clark's, like all the converging

15:21.000 --> 15:23.480
fluids you've been sending at us.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.840
So you have had all the fluid that didn't combust.

15:25.840 --> 15:33.840
So you have successfully, you have successfully stopped the combustion of the fluids of your

15:33.840 --> 15:37.040
police cruiser as well as Clark's police cruiser.

15:37.040 --> 15:44.760
Clark, you, you are crouched down at this minivan and the flames are growing taller

15:44.760 --> 15:54.080
and taller coming out of the bottom of the front of this minivan and the smell is overwhelming.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.640
What would you like to do with your turn?

15:55.640 --> 15:58.040
Are either of the occupants conscious?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.840
Roll first aid.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.560
Oh, crit fail 77 on a 30.

16:05.560 --> 16:06.560
They died on impact.

16:06.560 --> 16:14.600
As far as you can tell, these aren't people at all, they're bears.

16:14.600 --> 16:19.400
You would have absolutely no idea, but they might be beyond saving at this point.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.920
They look pretty dead.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.840
Save them anyway.

16:24.840 --> 16:28.920
I assume I'm on the, actually I don't assume, what, what side am I on when I, when I walked

16:28.920 --> 16:29.920
up to it?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
What side do you want to be on?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.160
I guess I would prefer to be on the passenger side.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.320
You are on the passenger side.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.320
I break it.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.320
I break in the window.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.520
Go ahead and roll.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.720
You can roll strength or law.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.720
I'm rolling strength.

16:42.720 --> 16:46.080
Uh, four on a 65.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.080
Okay.

16:47.080 --> 16:53.440
Good old smash it, uh, smash in the window and it's a kid you mentioned.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.440
Yes.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.440
It's a young boy.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.520
I try to get up under kind of underneath him and hit his seatbelt and kind of catch him

16:59.520 --> 17:02.320
as he falls and then pull, drag him out.

17:02.320 --> 17:07.160
And as far away from the cars, I feel as a safe distance, but not too far away because

17:07.160 --> 17:09.520
I'd like to try and go back for the driver.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.520
Absolutely.

17:10.520 --> 17:18.360
And as you pull him away from the car, the minivan explodes and I wouldn't say mushroom

17:18.360 --> 17:26.160
cloud, but there is one of those wily coyote, like small ones, tiny wily coyote mushroom

17:26.160 --> 17:30.120
cloud erupts from this minivan.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.520
And the entire thing, I mean, this is loud.

17:32.520 --> 17:42.900
The entire thing is up in flames and you guys just hear all this and you also hear the screaming

17:42.900 --> 17:44.640
of a young girl.

17:44.640 --> 17:54.640
I need the two of you who are still conscious to roll sanity, uh, 16, uh, 56 on a 37 fail.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.640
Okay.

17:56.120 --> 18:06.200
You are hearing the sounds of rubber popping and plastic melting and your stimuli are completely

18:06.200 --> 18:10.160
overwhelmed and you don't, it just sounds like ringing in the ears to me.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.160
Exactly.

18:11.160 --> 18:21.680
And Clark, you absolutely know that there's someone screaming for help inside this burning

18:21.680 --> 18:22.680
vehicle.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.240
I need you to lose one sanity.

18:25.240 --> 18:29.080
That puts me at 36 with a breaking point of 31.

18:29.080 --> 18:33.680
Oh, you've got to drink when you're a sanity hits your age.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
Is that how old you are?

18:34.680 --> 18:35.680
I missed it.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.680
No.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.680
Oh, you got to drink twice.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.680
Okay.

18:40.680 --> 18:44.840
I keep forgetting you're younger than I am in the game.

18:44.840 --> 18:52.280
You old motherfuckers is like eight months older than you or something.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.120
I know it's like a year and a half, right?

18:54.120 --> 18:55.400
You're 26, right?

18:55.400 --> 18:56.400
Yeah.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
Luke is 17.

18:57.400 --> 19:01.680
I'm almost 17.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.080
New character voice.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.800
I'm almost 17.

19:05.800 --> 19:09.920
That's what Keith speaks like after the explosion.

19:09.920 --> 19:16.600
I hit my head really hard when I passed out.

19:16.600 --> 19:22.300
This is how Keith finds his character voice.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.300
It's perfect.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.660
Just a shitty Russell Brand.

19:26.660 --> 19:35.900
I talk like, oh, from London, you talk like you're from London, from London, London, London.

19:35.900 --> 19:40.820
I'm almost 17, I'm almost 17.

19:40.820 --> 19:42.380
Sounds awful.

19:42.380 --> 19:45.300
John, what do you do?

19:45.300 --> 19:47.180
Can I do an awareness roll?

19:47.180 --> 19:49.920
Well, I don't know how realistic that is.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.860
Have I noticed Vigna lying there?

19:51.860 --> 19:52.860
Yeah.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.900
I just go over to him and try to resuscitate.

19:54.900 --> 19:55.900
Okay.

19:55.900 --> 19:56.900
Sounds good.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.100
Go ahead and roll first aid for me.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.100
Oh, wow.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.100
This could go, yeah.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.420
I don't have that.

20:02.420 --> 20:03.740
What is your first aid?

20:03.740 --> 20:05.140
The basic 10%.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.140
Cool.

20:06.140 --> 20:07.140
Good luck.

20:07.140 --> 20:10.460
Which is exactly how confident I think I would feel as a real person in an emergency

20:10.460 --> 20:11.460
situation.

20:11.460 --> 20:15.740
There's like, okay, if I can wrap my shirt around it, then I've seen that in a movie.

20:15.740 --> 20:16.740
Otherwise 33, crit fail.

20:16.740 --> 20:17.740
Yeah.

20:17.740 --> 20:18.740
I thought it was crit success.

20:18.740 --> 20:24.140
You try to CPR me and you give me a heart attack.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.140
Break your collarbone.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.500
Also, what is the extent of, I'm not like cut up or anything.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.500
I'm just-

20:29.500 --> 20:30.500
No, you're just like unconscious, right?

20:30.500 --> 20:31.820
Just passed out and probably hit my head.

20:31.820 --> 20:33.820
You're probably bleeding from your face a little bit.

20:33.820 --> 20:36.860
I'm trying to slap your face and maybe I like accidentally-

20:36.860 --> 20:37.860
A little too hard.

20:37.860 --> 20:38.860
Yeah.

20:38.860 --> 20:39.860
Poke you really hard in the eye.

20:39.860 --> 20:40.860
Yeah.

20:40.860 --> 20:42.860
He lost the eye on the rack.

20:42.860 --> 20:43.860
It was weird.

20:43.860 --> 20:50.980
Jon, you run over to Keith to try to resuscitate him and as you're running over, you actually

20:50.980 --> 20:59.460
trip and fall and your knee comes down right on Keith Vigna's nose.

20:59.460 --> 21:03.440
Does it fall off like his penis?

21:03.440 --> 21:10.540
You hear a crunch as your knee goes down onto his face, but you immediately catch yourself

21:10.540 --> 21:17.620
and get up, but he is bleeding just way more profusely than he was before.

21:17.620 --> 21:20.020
And Keith, I need you to roll, actually, you know what?

21:20.020 --> 21:21.020
You did the damage.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.620
Jon, go ahead and roll a-

21:22.620 --> 21:23.620
Oh, no.

21:23.620 --> 21:24.620
D4.

21:24.620 --> 21:25.620
I'll really try not to.

21:25.620 --> 21:26.620
One.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.620
Ah.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.620
Keith, you take one hit point of damage.

21:30.620 --> 21:36.380
I only broke in as a little, just a little.

21:36.380 --> 21:38.460
I am down to 18 hit points.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.460
Clucks.

21:39.460 --> 21:40.460
Your turn, what do you do?

21:40.460 --> 21:41.780
I've got the kid over by the side.

21:41.780 --> 21:43.980
Can I discern better if he's conscious or not?

21:43.980 --> 21:45.400
Is he lucid at least?

21:45.400 --> 21:46.980
Is he lucid or not lucid, I guess?

21:46.980 --> 21:48.820
He is still very unconscious.

21:48.820 --> 21:49.820
Okay.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.780
Check for a pulse.

21:51.780 --> 21:53.580
How engulfed is the van?

21:53.580 --> 21:54.580
Holy.

21:54.580 --> 21:59.540
I want to, yeah, I want to run over to the driver's side and just see if I can get close

21:59.540 --> 22:03.140
enough to kick the window in.

22:03.140 --> 22:04.140
Crit failure.

22:04.140 --> 22:07.260
Kick her in the face while she's talking.

22:07.260 --> 22:10.060
Okay, cool.

22:10.060 --> 22:13.380
So I don't know, I don't know how to, you know, what do you guys-

22:13.380 --> 22:16.820
Have you seen the movie Crash?

22:16.820 --> 22:19.460
If it's, if it's, it won an Oscar, so.

22:19.460 --> 22:21.080
So yeah, it's possible.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.700
This episode will probably win the podcast if it won one of the Oscars.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.700
I've seen all the best movies.

22:25.700 --> 22:29.580
The worst episode of our podcast will win a, what does a podcast win?

22:29.580 --> 22:30.580
A potty.

22:30.580 --> 22:31.580
No, they have a name.

22:31.580 --> 22:32.580
Anywho.

22:32.580 --> 22:33.580
Blowy.

22:33.580 --> 22:34.580
A blowy.

22:34.580 --> 22:37.140
If you're saying it's so hot that no human could get close enough to do this, then just

22:37.140 --> 22:39.700
say that I won't, I won't roll for it or anything.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.420
You are more than welcome to do anything that you want.

22:42.420 --> 22:46.060
But I just mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not physically there.

22:46.060 --> 22:50.820
So if you picture it being so hot that it would deter me, I need to know that.

22:50.820 --> 22:53.980
It will cause you damage if you go in there.

22:53.980 --> 22:54.980
Okay.

22:54.980 --> 22:55.980
I'm not going to do it.

22:55.980 --> 22:56.980
I'm going to run back to the boy.

22:56.980 --> 22:57.980
Okay.

22:57.980 --> 23:01.300
And as a, as I'm running back to the boy, I'm going to go ahead and radio in to Drew

23:01.300 --> 23:03.020
unless I have a direct line to paramedics.

23:03.020 --> 23:05.300
Oh, you absolutely do.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.940
We need emergency services up here.

23:06.940 --> 23:08.140
We've got some hurt people.

23:08.140 --> 23:10.260
We're just up the road from the clinic.

23:10.260 --> 23:11.260
Send ambulances.

23:11.260 --> 23:12.260
The clinic.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.900
And then I want to try and first aid the kid.

23:13.900 --> 23:14.900
Okay.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.900
Go ahead and roll first aid for me.

23:16.900 --> 23:17.900
Fuck.

23:17.900 --> 23:21.540
A 72 on a 30.

23:21.540 --> 23:26.500
He is still very unconscious and his breathing begins to slow.

23:26.500 --> 23:30.740
I'm going to have you go ahead and roll luck for me.

23:30.740 --> 23:31.740
Fail.

23:31.740 --> 23:34.020
93 on a 75.

23:34.020 --> 23:36.100
You chip over him and break his nose.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.100
Also.

23:37.100 --> 23:38.100
Yeah.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.260
That's all of my fails from here on out.

23:41.260 --> 23:46.940
You tripping fall on someone and it hurts him real bad fucking idiot fail on hacking

23:46.940 --> 23:49.100
that computer.

23:49.100 --> 23:53.620
You trip over it and break your nose.

23:53.620 --> 23:57.340
A broken nose is my favorite thing to do in a role playing game.

23:57.340 --> 24:00.620
Just in case you can get people to talk like this.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.260
Is that how you're going to give him this character?

24:02.260 --> 24:09.140
I was hoping that Luke might have the new broken nose character voice.

24:09.140 --> 24:13.180
It's funny because when we started, he thought about holding his gun to do this the whole

24:13.180 --> 24:17.460
time and I'm so glad I did not do that.

24:17.460 --> 24:18.460
Okay.

24:18.460 --> 24:22.860
So after that very funny exchange, you see this boy begin to die.

24:22.860 --> 24:28.140
As the ambulances arrive on the scene, two paramedics hop out immediately.

24:28.140 --> 24:31.340
One of them comes over, comes up to you, Clark, cause you have the boy.

24:31.740 --> 24:33.660
Hey man, what happened here?

24:33.660 --> 24:35.660
I don't, I don't, I don't know.

24:35.660 --> 24:40.140
It's all I'm a, it was an accident.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.620
They went off the road.

24:42.620 --> 24:44.020
I don't, I don't think he's doing so good.

24:44.020 --> 24:45.020
Okay.

24:45.020 --> 24:49.380
So they are loading him up on the stretcher as you're, as you're telling them this and

24:49.380 --> 24:51.000
they get the boy into the ambulance.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.220
The fire truck arrives and firemen hop out and begin putting out the flames on this minivan.

24:57.220 --> 24:58.220
What are you guys doing?

24:58.260 --> 25:04.700
Well, I want to send one of a paramedic after Keith and then I want to go investigate the

25:04.700 --> 25:06.580
body on the hood of my car.

25:06.580 --> 25:09.780
I want to talk to a fireman or more like yell.

25:09.780 --> 25:11.900
There was, there was somebody in the driver's seat.

25:11.900 --> 25:12.900
They were screaming there.

25:12.900 --> 25:17.620
I don't think they're, I think they're, I think they're dead, but if we can get in there.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.100
Calm down officer.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.100
We're on it.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.100
Oh God.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.340
You guys remember 9-11 fucking firemen?

25:23.340 --> 25:28.140
Sorry if my voice is really weird, but I'm really hoarse from a three day bachelor party.

25:28.180 --> 25:31.180
I'm really horny from a three day bachelor party.

25:31.180 --> 25:34.060
I'm a horse from a three day bachelor party.

25:34.060 --> 25:35.060
Ooh.

25:35.060 --> 25:36.060
Naaay.

25:36.060 --> 25:37.060
Edited that out.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.060
Um.

25:38.060 --> 25:40.100
Do not edit what he's saying.

25:40.100 --> 25:43.660
I'm a horse from a three day bachelor party out.

25:43.660 --> 25:44.940
That's so good.

25:44.940 --> 25:49.060
So as soon as they get the young boy up into the ambulance, they pull another stretcher

25:49.060 --> 25:52.660
out, get Keith on it, get him into an ambulance.

25:52.660 --> 25:53.660
Amber lamps.

25:53.660 --> 25:58.580
One, you would see them take Keith away on a stretcher as you walk over to the front

25:58.580 --> 26:06.700
of your police cruiser, which is completely covered in fire foam or fire foam, the detritus

26:06.700 --> 26:08.020
of a fire machine.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.020
Oh God.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.020
I can't.

26:10.020 --> 26:12.020
Oh, that was so adorable.

26:12.020 --> 26:16.260
I was trying to do a fireball, but my voice can't get up there.

26:16.260 --> 26:17.260
Anyway.

26:17.260 --> 26:22.580
Do it again.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.580
Fire foam.

26:24.500 --> 26:32.820
So as you go up, you see this body that fell from the sky like an angel on his back into

26:32.820 --> 26:33.820
the cruiser.

26:33.820 --> 26:42.100
And when you walk around, you see him and you kind of move some of the foam away from

26:42.100 --> 26:44.140
his face.

26:44.140 --> 26:51.380
And he is a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose.

26:51.380 --> 26:56.300
And he has fool seared into his forehead with a brand.

26:56.300 --> 26:58.860
I shout over to, uh, to Clark.

26:58.860 --> 27:01.660
Hey Clark, I think we found John Peters.

27:14.140 --> 27:29.660
Keith, you were looking at all of this chaos around you and your mind just couldn't handle

27:29.660 --> 27:35.260
it and your body just shuts down and everything goes black.

27:35.260 --> 27:41.940
You wake up in bed, it's Christmas morning and you hear the faint sounds of laughter

27:41.940 --> 27:43.660
coming from downstairs.

27:43.660 --> 27:49.540
I rub my eyes and I get out of bed and I, I look around and I realize I went to bed

27:49.540 --> 27:55.180
early last night so that Santa Claus could come bring me some gifts.

27:55.180 --> 27:57.560
So I immediately realized that it's Christmas day.

27:57.560 --> 28:05.300
So I excitedly run down the stairs and I see my entire family, my mom, my dad, my brother

28:05.300 --> 28:08.100
Ferguson, all sitting around a bunch of gifts.

28:08.100 --> 28:12.180
Half of them are already open and they all turn their heads at me.

28:12.180 --> 28:19.740
My mom goes, oh, I guess we forgot to wake up Keith and they all laugh.

28:19.740 --> 28:26.220
And I, and you actually, you hear your father chortles and says, yes, that's right.

28:26.220 --> 28:27.220
We forgot.

28:27.220 --> 28:34.500
I pretend like I didn't hear that and I sit down, uh, directly across from my brother

28:34.500 --> 28:35.500
Ferguson.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.660
I say, Hey, what, what have you gotten already?

28:37.660 --> 28:41.960
Ferguson just stares at you with a blank expression.

28:41.960 --> 28:46.020
His eyes have looked different ever since your dad gave him that watch.

28:46.020 --> 28:51.980
William, your father says, we got Ferguson some games that will help him train for his

28:51.980 --> 28:53.060
path.

28:53.060 --> 28:54.060
That's cool.

28:54.060 --> 28:56.580
Maybe once you beat the games, I can play them.

28:56.580 --> 28:59.940
Well, they aren't really for you.

28:59.940 --> 29:02.260
Can I, I can watch you play them.

29:02.260 --> 29:03.260
Perhaps.

29:03.260 --> 29:04.260
Okay.

29:04.260 --> 29:06.580
Well, Hey, Hey dad.

29:06.580 --> 29:09.260
I get, where's my presence at?

29:09.260 --> 29:15.500
Your mom, without breaking her smiling eye contact with your father, points to a box

29:15.500 --> 29:19.740
on the other side of the room, like, okay, is it my turn to open it yet?

29:19.740 --> 29:25.500
In unison, your parents say, no, as they push another present toward Ferguson.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.500
Okay.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.580
Uh, Hey Fergie, I'm excited to see what you got.

29:29.580 --> 29:31.060
Can I help you open it?

29:31.060 --> 29:37.740
Ferguson looks to your parents, both of them, sternly shaking their heads and his eyes begin

29:37.740 --> 29:41.220
to tear up as he opens his present.

29:41.220 --> 29:44.100
What did you want more than anything else for Christmas this year?

29:44.100 --> 29:50.020
I wanted the pro players extended pack of Pokemon cards with all the holograms that

29:50.020 --> 29:56.820
had all of the rare cards and super rare and all the shiny ones you see Fergie open up

29:56.820 --> 30:03.260
this present and it's all these Pokemon cards that you desperately wanted and kept asking

30:03.260 --> 30:07.820
for and dropping hints for the past couple months that this is what you wanted.

30:07.820 --> 30:13.680
And Fergie looks up with these begging eyes as your father says, do it.

30:13.680 --> 30:19.280
And Ferguson shuts his eyes tight, a single tear running down each cheek as he picks up

30:19.280 --> 30:27.120
his Christmas hot cocoa and pours it all into the box filled with these cards of pocket

30:27.120 --> 30:28.400
monsters.

30:28.400 --> 30:34.440
I start crying immediately and then I don't, I don't even ask.

30:34.440 --> 30:42.520
I just rip open my gift expecting to see more Pokemon cards, but I open it up and it's a

30:42.520 --> 30:49.660
white box, one that I've recognized from years prior from Christmases past and I knew that

30:49.660 --> 30:53.300
it contained just clothes.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.260
It's just a clothes box.

30:55.260 --> 30:59.600
And when you open it, it is a brand new jacket.

30:59.600 --> 31:03.820
Something you're not accustomed to since you are typically the recipient of Ferguson's

31:03.820 --> 31:05.020
hand-me-downs.

31:05.020 --> 31:10.600
And it is exactly the style of jacket all the young boys are envious of at this time.

31:10.600 --> 31:15.480
My immediate disappointment turns into pure excitement and I look at my father and my

31:15.480 --> 31:22.240
mother and a tear is rolling out of my eye and I say, thank you so much.

31:22.240 --> 31:26.180
And I put it on and it droops over you.

31:26.180 --> 31:29.640
It is, the sleeves go past my hands.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.680
It is at least two sizes too big.

31:31.680 --> 31:36.240
And I look at him and I'm like, well we can take it back and exchange it for my size.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.480
And your parents are staring at Ferguson.

31:40.480 --> 31:45.280
He begins sobbing uncontrollably as he walks toward you.

31:45.280 --> 31:49.900
Your father barks, emotion is weakness.

31:49.900 --> 31:51.920
You need to be strong.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.920
Take what is yours.

31:53.920 --> 31:57.280
It's the only way to succeed.

31:57.280 --> 32:03.360
Ferguson beans, wipes his tears away and takes the jacket from off your back, putting it

32:03.360 --> 32:06.860
on and turning away from you.

32:06.860 --> 32:11.540
It looks really cool on you, Ferguson.

32:11.540 --> 32:16.900
And you wake up in the back of this ambulance, what are they called?

32:16.900 --> 32:17.900
Ambulance people.

32:17.900 --> 32:18.900
EMT.

32:18.900 --> 32:19.900
The EMT.

32:19.900 --> 32:20.900
Paramedic.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.700
Oh, hey, you're back.

32:22.700 --> 32:23.700
How are you feeling?

32:23.700 --> 32:24.700
What?

32:24.700 --> 32:25.700
What?

32:25.700 --> 32:26.700
Ah.

32:26.700 --> 32:32.660
And your nose is just super broken and you got blood splattered all over your chest.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.900
Oh, hey, we can give you something for that.

32:35.940 --> 32:41.580
He hands you a bunch of pills and you take them, I'm guessing.

32:41.580 --> 32:42.580
Oh yeah.

32:42.580 --> 32:45.460
Alright, so we're going to put you back up at one willpower.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.580
So you're still at a negative twenty percent.

32:47.580 --> 32:53.900
Go ahead and roll a D4 for me as he begins doing first aid on you.

32:53.900 --> 32:54.900
Dose.

32:54.900 --> 32:55.900
So you gain two hit points back.

32:55.900 --> 32:56.900
Cool.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.800
That puts me back up to twenty, I believe.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.220
Do you think you can stand up?

33:00.220 --> 33:01.700
How are you feeling?

33:02.020 --> 33:05.780
Yeah, I think, I mean, my face just hurts.

33:05.780 --> 33:10.860
It feels a lot better after that, thank you, but, you know, I think I just, I just took

33:10.860 --> 33:15.380
a, I smelled some of that gas and stuff, it just kind of got to my head, but I, help me

33:15.380 --> 33:17.020
up and let me see if I can.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.180
Okay, for sure.

33:18.180 --> 33:24.020
And he helps you up and he kicks over in the back of the ambulance and the scene is still

33:24.020 --> 33:25.020
out there.

33:25.020 --> 33:29.620
There, it's, I mean, it's not chaos anymore, but there are people running around all over

33:29.620 --> 33:31.300
the place, taking care of business.

33:31.300 --> 33:35.600
The fire has been put out, they're getting information, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

33:35.600 --> 33:41.700
You see John and Clark standing on the other side of John's cruiser, just ahead of you,

33:41.700 --> 33:43.620
and you walk out of the back of the ambulance.

33:43.620 --> 33:44.620
Cool.

33:44.620 --> 33:45.620
What?

33:45.620 --> 33:46.620
Whoop-de-de-scoop.

33:46.620 --> 34:05.740
God damn it, I was, I almost put this through your eye, holding a mechanical pencil.

34:05.740 --> 34:07.500
He's holding a mechanical pencil.

34:07.500 --> 34:12.020
For the listeners, Thomas is holding a mechanical pencil that he threatened the life of Luke

34:12.020 --> 34:13.020
with.

34:13.020 --> 34:14.020
No, just the eye.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.420
That's like my depth perception.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.420
What's behind your eye?

34:16.420 --> 34:17.420
Luke, you would look really cool.

34:17.420 --> 34:18.420
Your brain.

34:18.420 --> 34:19.420
No, I don't think I'd look cool with an eye patch.

34:19.420 --> 34:29.120
I would have a fake eye, but I would get like an eight ball, no, a magic eight ball.

34:29.120 --> 34:33.580
And when I like shook my head, I could, you know, answer your questions for you.

34:33.580 --> 34:34.580
That's really good.

34:34.580 --> 34:41.820
Okay, so John and, John and Clark are standing in front of John's police cruiser and you've

34:41.820 --> 34:44.620
just had this revelation about who the body is.

34:44.620 --> 34:49.940
When you guys look up and you see Keith Vigness stumbling out of the back of the ambulance.

34:49.940 --> 34:50.940
Wow.

34:50.940 --> 34:51.940
Hey, you guys.

34:51.940 --> 34:58.060
You guys were in the slum room for a long time.

34:58.060 --> 35:02.540
Just to set up that joke.

35:02.540 --> 35:08.380
Real fast though, I did want to watch and see if the body of the driver came out of

35:08.380 --> 35:10.860
the car before I was going to go over to John.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.340
They haven't pulled anything out yet.

35:12.340 --> 35:13.340
Okay.

35:13.340 --> 35:16.860
Then yeah, I'll walk over to John and I now see that it's John Peters.

35:16.860 --> 35:17.860
You do.

35:17.860 --> 35:19.700
And you said fool was on his head.

35:19.700 --> 35:20.700
Correct.

35:20.700 --> 35:25.100
And that was from, we saw that when he was in the stock stocks in a picture that came

35:25.100 --> 35:26.100
from the camera.

35:26.100 --> 35:27.820
I'd like to feel for a pulse.

35:27.820 --> 35:29.380
Roll first aid.

35:29.380 --> 35:30.380
Fuck.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.960
A 37 on a 30.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.580
You feel no pulse.

35:34.580 --> 35:36.460
Also, you killed him.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.340
Good job, dude.

35:38.340 --> 35:41.620
He is one with the vehicle.

35:41.620 --> 35:43.180
He fell on his back.

35:43.180 --> 35:44.180
He fell on his back.

35:44.180 --> 35:46.020
Like his FAQ.

35:46.020 --> 35:47.020
His FAQ back?

35:47.020 --> 35:49.700
His FAQ bell in first.

35:49.700 --> 35:54.820
So you would clearly see, well, it's not out of the ordinary for you to try to find a pulse,

35:54.820 --> 35:57.100
but this body is extremely dead from what you can tell.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.460
I want to look up in the sky.

35:58.460 --> 36:01.100
Do I see any remnants of the stuff we saw earlier?

36:01.100 --> 36:02.100
No.

36:02.100 --> 36:05.740
Also, we were all in the room when it was being recorded, but John is the only one who

36:05.740 --> 36:08.220
saw the body fall from the sky.

36:08.220 --> 36:09.220
Oh really?

36:09.220 --> 36:11.180
And all the stuff happened like around the sky.

36:11.180 --> 36:13.380
I don't, I don't look up then.

36:13.380 --> 36:18.220
Hopefully, John says, did you, did you see where this came from?

36:18.220 --> 36:24.380
I mean, he must've been standing in the road when he fell from the sky.

36:24.380 --> 36:30.620
I look up, you see a giant swirl.

36:30.620 --> 36:33.900
Did you not see the clouds go crazy?

36:33.900 --> 36:34.900
The clouds go crazy.

36:35.140 --> 36:39.220
They were swirling all around and a technicolor light was coming from.

36:39.220 --> 36:42.260
And then this motherfucker right here just fell on the head of my car.

36:42.260 --> 36:44.780
I didn't, I didn't see any of that, John.

36:44.780 --> 36:45.780
Can you feel my forehead?

36:45.780 --> 36:46.780
Fuck.

36:46.780 --> 36:47.780
I feel his forehead.

36:47.780 --> 36:48.780
It's wet.

36:48.780 --> 36:49.780
It's wet.

36:49.780 --> 36:50.780
Warm, wet, or cold wet?

36:50.780 --> 36:51.780
Warm, wet.

36:51.780 --> 36:52.780
Warm, wet.

36:52.780 --> 36:53.780
I'm not seeing things though, buddy.

36:53.780 --> 36:54.780
I saw this.

36:54.780 --> 36:58.420
I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to discount it just because of all the stuff we've seen,

36:58.420 --> 37:00.060
but I didn't see it, my man.

37:00.060 --> 37:01.060
Okay.

37:01.260 --> 37:06.300
I'm just coming up and just now I'm noticing John Peter's body on the hood of your car,

37:06.300 --> 37:07.300
in the hood of your car.

37:07.300 --> 37:08.900
I, uh, I pat him on the shoulder.

37:08.900 --> 37:09.900
Keith, you all right?

37:09.900 --> 37:10.900
Oh, that hurts.

37:10.900 --> 37:11.900
Please don't do that.

37:11.900 --> 37:12.900
Ooh.

37:12.900 --> 37:13.900
Ooh.

37:13.900 --> 37:14.900
I'm very sore.

37:14.900 --> 37:15.900
What, uh, what got you?

37:15.900 --> 37:21.080
Oh, just a car wreck and passing out and hitting my head and, uh, I don't know how my nose

37:21.080 --> 37:26.140
got broken, but somehow I fell on the back of my head and ended up with a broken nose.

37:26.140 --> 37:28.180
So I assumed the airbag, right?

37:28.500 --> 37:30.460
Oh man, so much stuff was flying around.

37:30.460 --> 37:31.460
Who can tell really?

37:31.460 --> 37:32.460
Oh yeah.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.460
It's, it's weird.

37:33.460 --> 37:37.780
I thought this would have maybe changed the way you talk or something.

37:37.780 --> 37:45.300
I decided against doing that cause it's, it would be annoying for me to have to do.

37:45.300 --> 37:49.100
Also I did it once and then immediately forgot to do it and I don't want to have to.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.700
I don't want to have to go do that again.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.020
Looking at you, are you bandaged?

37:53.020 --> 37:54.600
Yeah, I'm bandaged up.

37:54.600 --> 38:00.260
They gave me some medication so that I could just like stand talking and standing and walk

38:00.260 --> 38:01.260
and stuff.

38:01.260 --> 38:05.000
So I'm feeling beat up, but you know, definitely worse for wear.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.620
But also I'm able to, yeah, like not feeling good.

38:08.620 --> 38:13.400
So I go up to the body and I look down at it and I look up at both of you guys.

38:13.400 --> 38:17.480
I'm like, wait, do you know who this is?

38:17.480 --> 38:19.360
Who do you think it is?

38:19.360 --> 38:20.360
Do you know who this is?

38:20.360 --> 38:22.360
Who do you think it is?

38:24.600 --> 38:27.800
Wait, would I not know who it is?

38:27.800 --> 38:30.800
I would though, right?

38:30.800 --> 38:36.840
I'm no fool, but I think this is John Peters.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.600
And he moonwalks out of the scene.

38:38.600 --> 38:42.920
We'll make a cop of this boy, yeah.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.240
That's what a fool believes.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.680
He puts his sunglasses on and you hear a scream from a distance.

38:48.680 --> 38:52.600
I put my sunglasses on and then I take them off.

38:52.600 --> 39:01.720
I want to get out my phone and take a picture, take a bunch of pictures even of this whole

39:01.720 --> 39:02.720
scene.

39:02.720 --> 39:03.720
Okay.

39:03.720 --> 39:07.720
I need you all to roll sanity for me for this body being John Peters.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.520
I say, hey Clark, is that for your spank bank?

39:11.520 --> 39:12.520
I failed this.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.520
I failed it too.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.520
I failed it hard.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.680
I don't even know what we're rolling for, but I definitely failed.

39:16.680 --> 39:17.680
Sanity.

39:17.680 --> 39:18.680
Yep.

39:18.680 --> 39:19.680
71 on a 31.

39:19.680 --> 39:20.680
And a 95.

39:20.680 --> 39:21.680
63 on a 36.

39:22.080 --> 39:31.560
For our fucking nerd listeners, who are all, for those of you who might be fucking nerds.

39:31.560 --> 39:34.480
Likely all of you.

39:34.480 --> 39:35.480
Roll a D4.

39:35.480 --> 39:37.480
That's how much you each lose.

39:37.480 --> 39:38.480
Yay.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.480
Got that out.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.480
One.

39:40.480 --> 39:41.480
Fuck.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.480
Four.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.480
This was sanity?

39:43.480 --> 39:44.480
Correct.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.120
I am at sanity 32 with my breaking point at 31.

39:47.120 --> 39:52.840
Clark lost four sanity, Keith lost four sanity, and John lost one sanity.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.120
I don't remember if we talked about this.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.280
I hit my breaking point last time.

39:56.280 --> 40:01.800
Did we decide on something to go along with my other disorder?

40:01.800 --> 40:04.960
We are going to worry about the disorders.

40:04.960 --> 40:08.320
Once your psyche's really had time to stew on what fucked it up.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.320
Exactly.

40:09.320 --> 40:10.320
Gotcha.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.320
Gotcha.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.320
Gotcha.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.320
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.320
What?

40:14.320 --> 40:15.320
Got him.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.320
Got him.

40:16.320 --> 40:20.400
He got me pretty good.

40:20.400 --> 40:25.720
That was a, dude, burn.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.560
What kind of clothes is John Peters wearing?

40:27.560 --> 40:35.240
John Peters is wearing a pair of jeans and a button down shirt.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.240
Are they cool jeans?

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
No.

40:37.240 --> 40:39.280
Am I able to get to his pockets?

40:39.280 --> 40:40.280
Yes.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.280
Hold on.

40:41.280 --> 40:50.040
Luke just actually broke his nose on the mic.

40:50.040 --> 40:54.400
Oh, this hurts really bad.

40:54.400 --> 40:57.480
We'll get you that character voice.

40:57.480 --> 41:01.600
If we have to break your nose for real, we'll get you that character voice.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.480
I'm method acting for this podcast.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.520
Luke just slammed his face into the wall.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.920
To all 30, to all 30 listeners.

41:08.920 --> 41:09.920
What would Leto do?

41:09.920 --> 41:10.920
What would Leto do?

41:11.560 --> 41:13.600
He just slammed his face.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.000
I would like to search John Peters pockets.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.200
Get police instincts.

41:17.200 --> 41:21.920
They're full of cum.

41:21.920 --> 41:22.920
You reach in.

41:22.920 --> 41:26.920
Ew, it's cum, guys.

41:26.920 --> 41:30.920
Oh, let me double check.

41:30.920 --> 41:34.520
Yep, that's cum.

41:34.520 --> 41:35.520
Give me some.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.080
Keith, taste it.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.800
Oh, he needs to change his diet.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.600
There's nothing in his pockets.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.600
Sorry.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.600
Except cum.

41:43.600 --> 41:50.360
He's a masochist and a skydiver.

41:50.360 --> 41:51.840
I hope that makes it on.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.040
It probably won't.

41:53.040 --> 41:57.800
I crit success staying in the podcast.

41:57.800 --> 42:02.760
You search John Peters' pockets and you don't find anything inside them.

42:02.760 --> 42:03.760
Sorry.

42:03.760 --> 42:04.760
Cummer.

42:04.760 --> 42:06.160
I wish I could give you something here.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.880
It just doesn't make any sense for him to have anything on him.

42:08.880 --> 42:16.920
I was like, I wonder if you keep your wallet once you've transported to the goo plane.

42:16.920 --> 42:17.920
Can I do a...

42:17.920 --> 42:18.920
Wait, do I have forensics?

42:18.920 --> 42:19.920
Okay, yeah.

42:19.920 --> 42:23.200
I'm going to do a forensics roll to see how he died.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.200
I think it was blunt trauma.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.200
Hell yeah.

42:27.200 --> 42:30.440
Wait, can we do that again?

42:30.440 --> 42:32.000
Can we get a tight hell yeah on that?

42:32.000 --> 42:35.100
This feels shitty, but yeah.

42:35.100 --> 42:38.800
Can I do a roll to see if I can tell how he died?

42:38.800 --> 42:39.800
Hell yeah.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.800
All right.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.800
Let's try to fight against...

42:41.800 --> 42:42.800
Yeah.

42:42.800 --> 42:43.800
He did pass his roll though.

42:43.800 --> 42:44.800
How did he die?

42:44.800 --> 42:45.800
Yeah, he did.

42:45.800 --> 42:46.800
He did nail it.

42:46.800 --> 42:47.800
It was 17 for that first roll.

42:47.800 --> 42:48.800
Oh, was it?

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
Okay, cool.

42:49.800 --> 42:50.800
Yeah, I have a zero in forensics though.

42:50.800 --> 42:51.800
Oh, really?

42:51.800 --> 42:52.800
Oh, fuck.

42:52.800 --> 42:53.800
Oh, shit.

42:53.800 --> 43:05.720
Yeah, I was just going to say that I pass it no matter what.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.720
So an unusable bit.

43:07.720 --> 43:16.040
Okay, so as you guys are standing around looking at the body in John's cruiser, you

43:16.040 --> 43:23.680
see the firemen are pulling a woman's charred remains from the driver's seat of the minivan.

43:23.680 --> 43:24.680
Is she hot?

43:24.680 --> 43:29.460
Oh, she was.

43:29.460 --> 43:34.280
Then you see two more firefighters and they're going into the back of the van.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.280
Don't pull out a dog.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.200
Pull out a kid, not a dog.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.840
They pull out the body of a small girl.

43:40.840 --> 43:44.440
Oh, we should have been a dog.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.600
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

43:46.600 --> 43:47.600
Pass.

43:47.600 --> 43:48.600
Fail.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.600
42 on a 30.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.600
The crit failed.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.400
I rolled 100.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.400
It was your daughter.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.280
This is going to stack nicely with...

43:58.280 --> 44:01.600
Hey, remember how smoothly the first half of this went?

44:01.600 --> 44:08.360
So John, you lose one sanity, Clark, you lose two sanity, and Keith, you lose no sanity.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.600
That makes me hit my breaking point.

44:10.600 --> 44:13.640
32 now, I'm at 30 with a breaking point of 31.

44:13.640 --> 44:14.640
How do I recalculate that again?

44:14.640 --> 44:15.640
I always forget.

44:15.640 --> 44:19.800
So you're at 30 now, and so you subtract your power, which is 12.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.620
From that breaking point, right?

44:21.620 --> 44:22.800
From your current sanity.

44:22.800 --> 44:23.800
Oh, okay.

44:23.800 --> 44:27.680
So if you go past your breaking point, it starts over from where your sanity is currently.

44:27.680 --> 44:28.680
Gotcha, cool.

44:29.680 --> 44:33.800
We all know is 18, and I didn't use my calculator for that.

44:33.800 --> 44:37.920
Joe, I'm bad at math, and that one's a little sad.

44:37.920 --> 44:42.520
The only reason I didn't lose sanity is because I am a terrible police officer, and I was

44:42.520 --> 44:45.520
not paying attention at all.

44:45.520 --> 44:46.520
Perfect.

44:46.520 --> 44:50.400
You're trying to figure out how to pick your nose in a nose cast?

44:50.400 --> 44:55.040
No, they popped my nose back into place and said, don't let your coworkers fall on you.

44:55.400 --> 44:58.920
What if they put one of those clear masks over your face?

44:58.920 --> 45:02.600
It's like when you have to play basketball, yeah, yeah.

45:02.600 --> 45:03.600
Perfect.

45:03.600 --> 45:11.200
Because I was too busy messing with the clear face mask they put over me to not break my

45:11.200 --> 45:12.880
nose.

45:12.880 --> 45:16.840
The cone that they put on me, dog.

45:16.840 --> 45:24.960
What if they gave you a gun on both of his hands so that he can't scratch his face?

45:24.960 --> 45:29.320
I'm wearing the clear face mask and cones over my nose.

45:29.320 --> 45:30.320
No.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.520
We're turning him into a monster.

45:32.520 --> 45:33.520
Too funny.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.520
Oh, man.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.840
No, just ridiculous.

45:35.840 --> 45:40.800
I'm guessing that you are going to need- We're going to need new cars.

45:40.800 --> 45:41.800
New cars.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.360
Good thing we're not out of town yet.

45:43.360 --> 45:46.600
Thankfully, Keith's Cruiser is still at the police department.

45:46.600 --> 45:47.600
True that.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.720
Let's call Drew and have it bring it to us.

45:49.720 --> 45:50.720
Grab it.

45:50.720 --> 45:53.160
Bring it to us.

45:53.160 --> 45:54.160
We respect you, Drew.

45:54.160 --> 45:57.000
I put a lot of emotion into that character.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.080
You can't just call him an it.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.880
Have the fang bring us.

46:01.880 --> 46:06.880
Also, the Chief's Cruiser is still feasible, so we could just steal hers.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.360
She's not going to be using it.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.240
Yeah, stealing's an interesting way to put it.

46:10.240 --> 46:11.240
Well, not steal.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.240
Utilize.

46:12.240 --> 46:13.240
We can certainly utilize.

46:13.240 --> 46:16.840
It's still police department property.

46:16.840 --> 46:21.280
When we call Drew, can we also have him get a tow truck and bring in our cruisers and

46:21.280 --> 46:24.000
maybe start working on fixing them bad boys back in shape?

46:24.000 --> 46:27.760
Well, we could also, instead of this mill thing, we could just go to the cruiser store.

46:27.760 --> 46:31.360
Wait, also, didn't we fix the four wheeler?

46:31.360 --> 46:32.360
That is true.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.840
Drew did fix the four wheeler.

46:33.840 --> 46:35.900
I want to drive the four wheeler.

46:35.900 --> 46:36.900
Around town?

46:36.900 --> 46:38.120
I mean, following you guys.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.400
We're going to be on the highway and stuff, man.

46:40.400 --> 46:43.720
I'll attach a rope to the front of my four wheeler.

46:43.720 --> 46:44.720
Put it in neutral.

46:44.720 --> 46:45.720
Put it in neutral.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.720
Have you?

46:46.720 --> 46:48.520
No, Keith, you're going to have to ride with us.

46:48.520 --> 46:49.520
I'm sorry.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.520
Yeah, good, because my drive is-

46:50.760 --> 46:53.880
Hey buddy, we'll have more four wheel adventures real soon.

46:53.880 --> 46:54.880
Okay.

46:54.880 --> 46:56.800
Should we do anything more with John Peters?

46:56.800 --> 46:59.360
I feel like there's a lot more we need to do.

46:59.360 --> 47:00.840
Autopsy, for sure.

47:00.840 --> 47:01.840
Just get a coroner out there?

47:01.840 --> 47:03.360
I mean, send him to the coroner.

47:03.360 --> 47:05.240
Yeah, if we take him to the coroner.

47:05.240 --> 47:09.000
Load him up in the tow truck.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.040
So the coroner isn't counting.

47:11.040 --> 47:14.160
Is that where the cruiser repair shop is too?

47:14.160 --> 47:19.600
No, you guys, there's a place in town that Drew will have your cruisers towed to.

47:19.600 --> 47:24.680
What if we send John Peters to the repair shop and see what they can do?

47:24.680 --> 47:27.720
Work your magic, boys.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.540
Bit of a special request this time.

47:30.540 --> 47:33.480
You did say he was part of the car now.

47:33.480 --> 47:37.280
Man, they're going to overcharge you for those.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.540
Oh, that's true.

47:38.540 --> 47:39.540
We are going to have to like, yeah.

47:39.540 --> 47:40.540
Yeah, put it on our tab.

47:40.540 --> 47:42.560
He's going to need some extraction.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.560
It's a lot of body work.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.560
Hey!

47:45.560 --> 47:46.560
Hell yeah.

47:46.560 --> 47:53.880
Podcast over.

47:53.880 --> 48:02.880
This has been pretending to be people with Zach Thomas, Luke, and our star, Joe Terry.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.000
Thank you.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.920
Thank you.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.060
Okay.

48:08.060 --> 48:10.060
And then let's have the cruisers towed.

48:10.060 --> 48:12.640
We can ride with the tow truck back to...

48:12.640 --> 48:15.000
Or we could have Drew drive the cruiser to us.

48:15.400 --> 48:17.200
And then he could ride with the tow truck back.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.200
That's true.

48:18.200 --> 48:19.960
Also, the tow tump...

48:19.960 --> 48:23.600
The tow truck company is called Towed Truck and they just have a towed logo.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.600
Oh, of course.

48:24.600 --> 48:25.600
Love it.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.600
I like it.

48:26.600 --> 48:27.800
And the frog has huge toes.

48:27.800 --> 48:30.200
Yeah, that's why it's a toad.

48:30.200 --> 48:34.120
Anyway, so yeah, he brings the cruiser up here.

48:34.120 --> 48:36.680
We all hop in my cruiser.

48:36.680 --> 48:41.160
And then, well, I would say we would go to the mill, but do you want to push us in a

48:41.160 --> 48:43.880
certain direction?

48:43.880 --> 48:49.240
Ouch, and yes.

48:49.240 --> 48:54.720
So Drew comes rolling up in Keith Vigna's police cruiser.

48:54.720 --> 49:01.480
He gets out and he looks at all three of you suspiciously and he says...

49:01.480 --> 49:03.480
It's pronounced specifically.

49:03.480 --> 49:06.480
One, two, three.

49:06.480 --> 49:08.480
Bubble gum tree.

49:08.480 --> 49:09.480
Bubble gum tree.

49:09.480 --> 49:10.480
Bubble gum tree.

49:10.960 --> 49:11.960
Let's try that one more time.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.160
I forgot what it actually was.

49:13.160 --> 49:14.160
Bubble gum tree.

49:14.160 --> 49:17.000
Okay, I think we're good.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
What happened here?

49:18.000 --> 49:19.120
I mean, you don't have to tell me now.

49:19.120 --> 49:23.480
I'll see the paperwork later when I fill it out, but that, I mean, this looks crazy.

49:23.480 --> 49:28.760
Well, John Peters fell out of the sky causing me to lose control of my patrol vehicle, which

49:28.760 --> 49:31.620
careened across the highway into oncoming traffic.

49:31.620 --> 49:35.800
And because of that, two civilians are dead and another is seriously injured and Keith's

49:35.800 --> 49:38.760
penis fell off and he broke his nose.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.120
For the record, my penis is still attached.

49:41.120 --> 49:42.600
Oh, they got that back on.

49:42.600 --> 49:43.600
I don't know.

49:43.600 --> 49:44.600
That was a weird joke to make.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.320
It kind of makes me mad since...

49:46.320 --> 49:47.640
You were screaming and my penis fell off.

49:47.640 --> 49:48.640
I don't know.

49:48.640 --> 49:51.640
I probably have a concussion.

49:51.640 --> 49:52.640
I don't know.

49:52.640 --> 49:53.640
That might make sense.

49:53.640 --> 49:55.800
Keith, is your penis okay?

49:55.800 --> 49:59.080
I unbuckle my big britches.

49:59.080 --> 50:05.120
I unbuckle my big britches, open them up about a foot past my stomach and I look at it and

50:05.120 --> 50:06.760
I'm like, yep, it's on there.

50:06.760 --> 50:07.760
Okay, thank goodness.

50:07.760 --> 50:14.840
Okay, so guys, I hate to do this, but I just got a call from the estate salesman and he's

50:14.840 --> 50:23.840
at James's house and he found some unsettling writing in blood and many guns after accidentally

50:23.840 --> 50:27.520
triggering some sort of secret door-like trap.

50:27.520 --> 50:32.560
So he's wondering if he can sell the guns in the estate sale.

50:32.560 --> 50:38.040
I told him probably not, but that you guys would go over and check it out because it

50:38.040 --> 50:42.560
seems like it might be a crime scene, what with the weird blood writing and such.

50:42.560 --> 50:44.160
Who was James?

50:44.160 --> 50:45.160
He was the waiter guy.

50:45.160 --> 50:46.160
He said see you later guy.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.160
That's what I thought.

50:47.160 --> 50:48.160
Yeah.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.800
He wasn't good enough for us.

50:50.800 --> 50:57.560
Also, he had his foot missing in the explosion radio and he was also the guy with the vacuum.

50:57.560 --> 51:00.540
Wait, was James the one over the table?

51:00.540 --> 51:03.900
He was the one hunched over the table, foot missing.

51:03.900 --> 51:06.140
Also the guy with the vacuum in the neighborhood.

51:06.140 --> 51:07.540
And was he eating a plate of foot?

51:07.540 --> 51:12.660
He had a plate of foot in front of him, but we don't know if he was eating it.

51:12.660 --> 51:13.660
Oh yeah.

51:13.660 --> 51:16.180
Have we ever had the coroners looked at if those feet matched?

51:16.180 --> 51:17.700
Well, they blew up.

51:17.700 --> 51:18.700
Remember?

51:18.700 --> 51:19.700
Oh, man.

51:19.700 --> 51:20.700
Okay.

51:20.700 --> 51:21.700
Again, Joe fucking up.

51:21.700 --> 51:24.980
But back at that house, you walked in and it was Maggie?

51:24.980 --> 51:29.300
Maggie was dead, stabbed in the face to death with a foot missing.

51:29.340 --> 51:36.340
James slumped at the table with the foot meat or whatever, shot in the head, his foot missing.

51:36.340 --> 51:37.340
Holding a gun.

51:37.340 --> 51:38.340
Holding a gun.

51:38.340 --> 51:39.340
And a fork.

51:39.340 --> 51:45.980
Drew passed out and the Harold Dorsey of what'sbehinddorsey.tumblr.com.

51:45.980 --> 51:48.160
By the way guys, I know who did it.

51:48.160 --> 51:49.160
Don't tell us.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.160
We got to figure it out.

51:50.160 --> 51:51.160
Don't tell us.

51:51.160 --> 51:54.380
A guy with a scar over his eye and a gun.

51:54.380 --> 51:57.960
An overweight guy wearing all black with a scar over his eye.

51:57.960 --> 51:59.520
And we have not seen that guy since.

51:59.520 --> 52:00.520
No.

52:00.520 --> 52:01.520
Correct.

52:01.520 --> 52:02.520
Okay.

52:02.520 --> 52:03.520
That's what I was trying to remember.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.520
Okay.

52:04.520 --> 52:08.480
After Drew says all that, he kind of looks at John Lee Pettymore.

52:08.480 --> 52:10.920
Hey, can we talk for a minute right now?

52:10.920 --> 52:12.280
Yeah, it'd probably be best.

52:12.280 --> 52:13.280
Okay, sure.

52:13.280 --> 52:14.280
Yeah.

52:14.280 --> 52:15.280
What's up, buddy?

52:15.280 --> 52:19.040
And so he kind of pulls you over to the side of the road, maybe off the ditch in the side

52:19.040 --> 52:20.040
of the road.

52:20.040 --> 52:21.040
Do you guys want to head out?

52:27.960 --> 52:28.960
Hey, John.

52:28.960 --> 52:29.960
Yeah, buddy.

52:29.960 --> 52:30.960
What's up?

52:30.960 --> 52:31.960
Hey.

52:31.960 --> 52:33.680
So, um, I got a message from the Duke.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.680
Oh yeah.

52:34.680 --> 52:35.920
What is, what's it say?

52:35.920 --> 52:37.640
The deal is going down tonight.

52:37.640 --> 52:38.920
Well, what time?

52:38.920 --> 52:40.400
Uh, 2am.

52:40.400 --> 52:44.560
Whatever, whoever sent it to me said the location will be sent later tonight.

52:44.560 --> 52:45.560
All right.

52:45.560 --> 52:49.840
I just wanted to give you a heads up, obviously, and not really text about it like we talked

52:49.840 --> 52:50.840
about before.

52:50.840 --> 52:55.520
Man, you've got great, I had to say this, consider it a lot of work, but great.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.520
Criminal instincts.

52:56.520 --> 52:57.520
Thank you.

52:58.080 --> 52:59.080
I have to think I learned quickly.

52:59.080 --> 53:03.280
You know, also, around here, this is just more general rascalism than actually criminal.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.280
Oh.

53:04.280 --> 53:05.280
That's the way the Pettimores look at it.

53:05.280 --> 53:06.280
Absolutely.

53:06.280 --> 53:09.400
No, I mean, if we didn't sell these drugs, someone else would.

53:09.400 --> 53:11.480
All right, I need, I want you to try something.

53:11.480 --> 53:12.480
Okay.

53:12.480 --> 53:15.880
And if you can pull this off, I'll give you 5% of my share.

53:15.880 --> 53:16.880
Okay.

53:16.880 --> 53:17.880
All right.

53:17.880 --> 53:20.880
I want you to try to negotiate with the Duke and say, hey man, we're the ones with the

53:20.880 --> 53:22.280
drugs.

53:22.280 --> 53:26.880
We picked the location and I wanted to come out to my farm where we got the drugs buried.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.240
Okay.

53:28.240 --> 53:29.240
Sounds good.

53:29.240 --> 53:30.240
You're a good man.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.240
That's perfect.

53:31.240 --> 53:33.240
What should we say we were talking about?

53:33.240 --> 53:34.240
Um.

53:34.240 --> 53:35.240
I'll wing it.

53:35.240 --> 53:36.240
I'll figure it out.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.240
Okay.

53:37.240 --> 53:38.240
Sounds good.

53:43.240 --> 53:49.360
Keith and Clark, what are you guys talking about when John and Drew go walk off into

53:49.360 --> 53:50.360
the ditch?

53:50.360 --> 53:51.360
Hey, dude.

53:51.360 --> 53:54.040
I know, like, I'm really sore.

53:54.040 --> 53:59.640
I remember not losing consciousness in the car and my nose definitely wasn't broken.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.200
Like how, how did that happen?

54:01.200 --> 54:05.400
Oh, I mean, we, we slammed into the back of John's pretty fucking hard.

54:05.400 --> 54:09.080
I remember that, but I remember crawling out of the window with my nose intact.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.080
I don't remember that.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.080
My man.

54:11.080 --> 54:12.080
Can I do a human on?

54:12.080 --> 54:16.160
Well, hey, Clark didn't actually see this, but I like that you think this is going to

54:16.160 --> 54:19.440
somehow possibly make up at all.

54:19.520 --> 54:23.280
Like meet me on the same level as trashing my house.

54:23.280 --> 54:25.520
That's really exactly what I'm going for.

54:25.520 --> 54:26.520
Yeah.

54:26.520 --> 54:27.520
Not going to work.

54:27.520 --> 54:29.520
He's probably going to break it again.

54:29.520 --> 54:35.840
No, uh, Keith, I heard you smash out the window, but I was, I was occupied trying to get myself

54:35.840 --> 54:37.320
out of my side.

54:37.320 --> 54:38.800
I don't, I don't know what happened.

54:38.800 --> 54:39.800
Hey.

54:39.800 --> 54:42.000
Well also they told me that you saved that kid.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
So good on you for that.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
That was good.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.920
I just, I just jumped, you know, I mean, it's a shame you couldn't save the other people,

54:47.920 --> 54:49.360
but I don't think that's on you.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.960
And I put my arm around Clark and I comfort him just a little bit.

54:52.960 --> 54:55.600
I think I'll be hearing those screams for a while though.

54:55.600 --> 55:02.700
I'm glad I was unconscious for it because that would fuck me up.

55:02.700 --> 55:07.720
As you guys are finishing up this conversation, Drew and John walk back toward you.

55:07.720 --> 55:13.200
So as, as I walk up, I like slap a big hand on Keith's back and I'm like, Hey man, really

55:13.200 --> 55:14.480
sorry about the nose.

55:14.480 --> 55:19.040
I was rushing over, trying to give you some existence and I, uh, I tripped on your big

55:19.040 --> 55:22.040
pants and kind of need you right in the face there.

55:22.040 --> 55:25.200
I'm really sorry about that, buddy, but you know, I, I didn't mean anything by it.

55:25.200 --> 55:27.760
You know, just the, the, it's the thought that counts.

55:27.760 --> 55:32.640
So I, you know, I appreciate you trying to help me cause I know I can't do anything to

55:32.640 --> 55:33.640
hurt me.

55:33.640 --> 55:34.640
Yeah.

55:34.640 --> 55:39.040
I know that I was about to say like, you know, I'm a, I don't know if I would have done the

55:39.040 --> 55:40.080
same thing for you.

55:40.080 --> 55:42.840
Not out of spite, but out of pure fear.

55:42.840 --> 55:45.080
I mean, yeah, I would have definitely helped you too.

55:45.080 --> 55:46.080
Sorry.

55:46.080 --> 55:47.080
Forget.

55:47.080 --> 55:48.080
I said anything.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.080
Thank you for breaking my nose.

55:49.080 --> 55:51.640
Uh, John isn't like thinking about your faux pas.

55:51.640 --> 55:54.600
He's just like, did Keith call me brave?

55:54.600 --> 55:55.760
Yeah.

55:55.760 --> 56:02.240
As you guys are having this conversation, Drew says, Oh my, Oh my God, what is that?

56:02.240 --> 56:09.400
And you guys see an extremely wet black cat running toward you from the water.

56:10.400 --> 56:19.080
And the extremely wet black cat jumps up onto your leg, John, and it's like,

56:19.080 --> 56:22.560
I bring him up to my face and I say, hold on, Doug, we're going to get you the help

56:22.560 --> 56:23.560
you need.

56:23.560 --> 56:24.560
Perfect.

56:24.560 --> 56:25.560
Perfect.

56:25.560 --> 56:26.560
Hell yes.

56:26.560 --> 56:27.560
Whooped it is.

56:27.720 --> 56:28.720
Hell yes.

56:28.720 --> 56:29.720
Whooped it is.

56:57.560 --> 56:58.560
Hell yes.
