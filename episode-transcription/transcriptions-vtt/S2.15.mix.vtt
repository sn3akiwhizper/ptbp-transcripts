00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
Hello, all of my sweet little ones.

00:03.760 --> 00:08.240
It's your caretaker from another dimension, Wolf the Dog.

00:08.240 --> 00:12.880
And I'm here to nuzzle you until you grow big and strong

00:12.880 --> 00:17.120
and become capable of great and grand things.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.880
Then you can repay me bit by bit

00:20.880 --> 00:26.320
with just a little teeny tiny bit of your life force.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.680
Just a little bit.

00:27.680 --> 00:32.400
You won't even notice it, I promise, until you do.

00:32.400 --> 00:38.800
And I am sapping y'all live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:38.800 --> 00:42.560
the radio station that you listen to,

00:42.560 --> 00:45.440
the only one that makes sounds at night

00:45.440 --> 00:48.240
to drive away the old ones.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.680
Sometimes y'all write me things, and this time,

00:51.680 --> 00:53.360
I guess I'll read it.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.560
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jaron

00:56.560 --> 00:58.960
in Springfield, Oregon,

00:58.960 --> 01:02.720
the real Springfield the Simpsons was based on,

01:02.720 --> 01:07.040
who wrote up a lovingly sopping five-star review

01:07.040 --> 01:09.920
on their podcast app of choice,

01:09.920 --> 01:13.600
which is a nice way to support this podcast that you like

01:13.600 --> 01:15.760
and are currently listening to.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.440
Well done, Jaron.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.600
Never heard of any Simpsons,

01:19.600 --> 01:22.320
so not sure what you're on about.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.160
Jaron writes,

01:52.320 --> 01:55.360
Well, we've been talking about this entire time.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.200
The password to get in will be fuck the zuck.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.480
See you there.

02:00.480 --> 02:04.080
P.S. Keep up the good work, my guys.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.440
My favorite RPG podcast by far.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.360
Just became the proud owner

02:09.360 --> 02:13.040
of a Splashylvania Fastpass myself.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.480
Well, thanks, Jaron from Oregon,

02:16.480 --> 02:19.840
but I'll be declining your invitation

02:19.840 --> 02:26.640
because I am far too busy taking care of Wolf the dog,

02:26.640 --> 02:28.640
my dog, Wolf the dog.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.560
I also finally figured out what the internet is.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.360
It's an interdimensional net

02:35.360 --> 02:40.240
used for catching the plasma carp from the galactic streams.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.720
Yeah, I know things.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.920
I guess you could say

02:43.920 --> 02:47.920
I'm a little bit of an internet expert myself.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.520
If you want to ride up something

02:49.520 --> 02:51.840
for your big, bad Wolfie to hell,

02:51.840 --> 02:55.520
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.240
Tag pretending to be people on Facebook

02:58.240 --> 03:00.320
or write up a five star review

03:00.320 --> 03:02.960
on the podcast app of your choice.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.080
Screenshot that absolute gift

03:06.080 --> 03:11.040
and send it on for Wolfie to see and smell and taste.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.600
And if you want to support this show

03:15.600 --> 03:18.880
and unlock 37 bonus episodes,

03:18.880 --> 03:22.320
all while getting us closer and closer to our goal

03:22.320 --> 03:25.920
of getting back to the weekly releases that you crave,

03:25.920 --> 03:30.480
head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.120
Now, in fact, you can find us

03:33.120 --> 03:37.360
on a few different places on the internet for merch

03:37.360 --> 03:39.520
or to listen to the soundtrack

03:39.520 --> 03:43.440
or to engage with this nasty community.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.320
You're gonna want to go to the show notes.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.120
How many times have you heard me say that?

03:49.120 --> 03:50.800
A bunch, I bet.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.960
And have you ever clicked in

03:52.960 --> 03:55.520
and actually looked at those little links

03:56.080 --> 04:00.080
or the little episode blurb that my producer writes up

04:00.080 --> 04:04.320
for every single one of these episodes?

04:04.320 --> 04:07.360
It takes him so long to type up.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.040
You should cherish it.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.320
Admire it.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.600
I know I do.

04:12.160 --> 04:15.440
Well, either way, it's time for the news.

04:16.160 --> 04:21.360
Last time, our intrepid heroes used each other's strength

04:21.360 --> 04:25.680
and the limp body of Vernon Covington, the landlord,

04:25.680 --> 04:28.320
to escape from the It Pit.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.800
And when they finally got out,

04:30.800 --> 04:34.880
Beck Wilder couldn't move on until Cal Colorado

04:34.880 --> 04:38.720
and Julia Summers removed their jackets?

04:38.720 --> 04:40.320
Hmm, weird.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.520
The can crew then crept quickly through the woods

04:43.520 --> 04:46.560
on the far east side of Grover's Gorge,

04:46.560 --> 04:50.400
heading south until they met the enormous plant wall.

04:50.400 --> 04:55.200
Lush, verdant, and apparently quite easy to maneuver within

04:55.200 --> 04:57.520
without starting a commotion.

04:57.520 --> 05:01.840
There was, however, a commotion in Grover's Gorge

05:01.840 --> 05:05.920
due to the sloshingly soaked current mayor,

05:05.920 --> 05:10.480
Chuck Bidwell, walking confidently south through the town.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.120
The team from City Action News

05:13.120 --> 05:15.360
slinked out the metal hatch door

05:15.360 --> 05:19.360
and backed toward Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge,

05:19.360 --> 05:22.720
the single, simple, steel-trained car

05:22.720 --> 05:25.200
that crosses the foggy crevasse

05:25.200 --> 05:29.920
with the unnaturally smooth cliff face on either side

05:29.920 --> 05:32.800
and a church stuck upside down

05:32.880 --> 05:37.760
where it fell into this chasm so many years ago.

05:37.760 --> 05:38.960
You know what?

05:38.960 --> 05:42.560
Y'all deserve a brand new theme song,

05:42.560 --> 05:45.680
a fresh jam, if you will.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.440
Let's unwrap this tasty snack together.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.720
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great

05:52.720 --> 05:55.040
and it's all my fault.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.640
It's all my fault

05:58.640 --> 06:03.680
Cause my life is great

06:03.680 --> 06:05.680
And it's all mine

06:13.120 --> 06:18.080
Cause my life is great

06:18.080 --> 06:20.960
And it's all my fault

06:25.040 --> 06:31.120
What about my hair?

06:31.120 --> 06:35.280
Oh. Oh, yeah, it caught on fire.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.320
Joe lit his face on fire.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.160
It's cool. We'll post it on social media.

06:40.160 --> 06:40.720
It's dope.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.560
Yeah, go to our social media right now

06:42.560 --> 06:45.040
if you don't follow us or if you do

06:45.040 --> 06:50.480
and check out a fun video of Joe's face catching a blaze.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.520
It's just a party trick I do sometimes,

06:53.520 --> 06:54.720
specifically on camera.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.320
Yeah, it's important.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.040
It really went up, didn't it?

07:01.040 --> 07:02.720
Do you put anything in your beard?

07:02.720 --> 07:03.040
Nope.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.320
Yeah, gasoline.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.800
It went up very quickly.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.320
It looked like it had an accelerant in it,

07:08.320 --> 07:08.960
but it doesn't.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.240
It's just dry and brittle.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.240
I hadn't smelled burnt hair in a long time

07:12.240 --> 07:13.360
and that was crazy.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.320
Yeah, then we smelt it for a while.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.600
I think I just got used to it

07:17.600 --> 07:19.520
because I'm like, oh, it's gone

07:19.520 --> 07:21.040
and then go outside and come back in.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.040
I'm like, oh, it definitely smells like burnt hair.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.800
I was smelling it the next day.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.720
That's because there was still burnt hair on your face.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.200
Yep.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.080
How does it feel?

07:31.120 --> 07:31.520
It's fine.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.400
It's 100% fine, except that I did singe my eyelashes

07:34.400 --> 07:37.920
and they feel weird still, but they're going to be fine.

07:37.920 --> 07:38.560
Like crusty?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.480
I've done that smoke in a bowl before.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.840
Hey, same.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.640
The whole front of my hair went up on New Year's Eve one year

07:46.640 --> 07:48.000
when I was standing outside.

07:48.000 --> 07:48.960
It was real windy.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.600
I've only curled my eyelashes, but that's impressive.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.120
Oh, I got the whole thing.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.120
And the first thought that I had,

07:55.120 --> 07:57.200
cause I didn't even smell it,

07:57.200 --> 08:00.160
but I looked at myself in a mirror later and always

08:00.720 --> 08:05.120
and I was like, did I get like Cheeto puff in my hair?

08:05.120 --> 08:05.760
Like dust?

08:07.040 --> 08:08.160
It was orange?

08:08.160 --> 08:11.440
It was like a little, I guess cause I have like brownish hair.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.600
I had like brownish hair.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.520
I know I actually can picture the...

08:16.560 --> 08:18.800
The curly Q crusties.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.640
New Year's 01 was crazy.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.960
Everybody thought, you know, Y2K was going to end it all

08:26.320 --> 08:27.120
the year before.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.520
He was still talking about it though.

08:31.520 --> 08:35.600
Oh, so you guys just pass through the door?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.440
The door?

08:37.440 --> 08:38.560
The SpongeBob portal.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.080
The SpongeBob portal door.

08:40.080 --> 08:43.280
Well, I did some research on what those doors are called.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.000
Nice.

08:44.000 --> 08:44.560
Yeah.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.920
And apparently...

08:45.920 --> 08:47.360
And now you're voting Republican.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.880
You would believe the insane restrictions

08:53.520 --> 08:57.280
that the fucking libs have put on the big ass door industry.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.120
What did you learn?

08:59.120 --> 09:01.200
The entrances are called doors.

09:02.720 --> 09:03.360
Wait, wait, wait.

09:03.360 --> 09:08.160
Like the, the watertight things that come together are called dogs.

09:08.880 --> 09:09.680
Dows.

09:10.240 --> 09:10.800
Dogs.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.280
Where?

09:11.280 --> 09:13.040
The watertight things that come together.

09:13.040 --> 09:13.440
So like the seal.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.800
You mean like the helical like...

09:14.800 --> 09:17.120
The cams is what I'm reading on the internet.

09:17.120 --> 09:22.400
This is a former US Submariner typing on Reddit.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.040
What was that?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.400
Submariner.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.200
Whatever.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.120
And they said dog the door.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.680
Yeah, that just means, I think that means secure it, right?

09:33.680 --> 09:37.120
Spin the wheel to engage the cams in the closed position.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.640
Like the pins.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.520
The pins.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.880
So it's not called the dog.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.320
Yeah, that's clearly a verb.

09:44.320 --> 09:44.960
Okay.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.800
So the pins that like lock it into place?

09:47.120 --> 09:50.160
But not the door itself, which is what you just said earlier.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.520
It's called a door, I think.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.200
And then the parts around are dogs.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.400
So dog the doors.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.160
I adore with my dogs.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.200
I adore my dogs.

09:58.480 --> 09:58.880
Nice.

09:58.880 --> 09:59.200
Y'all.

10:00.960 --> 10:01.600
A dog door.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.400
See, that just opens up more confusion now.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.360
Cause when you say dog door, we're going to all start crawling.

10:07.360 --> 10:07.860
Yeah.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.440
I'm crawling right now.

10:10.880 --> 10:11.440
On the train?

10:12.080 --> 10:12.560
Very good.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.200
Let's go there.

10:13.200 --> 10:20.160
Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, Julius Summers, and Stevie are all standing in a simple steel

10:20.160 --> 10:26.240
single train car sized train station on an unnecessarily massive bridge, 20 meters tall

10:26.240 --> 10:28.320
and 100 meters long.

10:28.320 --> 10:34.560
This bridge that crosses this enormous massive ravine is a minimalist construction showcasing

10:34.560 --> 10:42.080
the steel that seems to be your only way back over this deep, wide, and foggy ravine.

10:42.080 --> 10:47.040
The fog seems to be growing thicker and taller with every second.

10:47.040 --> 10:53.120
And soon it will be a wall that this simple steel single train car will need to penetrate

10:53.120 --> 10:54.800
to get to the other side.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.560
The creaking hatch-like submarine looking door that leads back.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.880
Zach, we were going to just let penetrate fly.

11:04.880 --> 11:08.640
Did you want us to, uh, where did you have a beat written in there?

11:08.640 --> 11:09.280
No, no.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.640
It says and standing.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.720
So there's a, there's a hatch.

11:16.720 --> 11:17.760
Pause for the boys.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.040
Pause for the dirty boys.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.720
Pause for the dirty boys.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.160
And a sopping wet.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.600
Is this the kind of hat you can dog?

11:25.600 --> 11:32.960
Chug Bidwell in his snug, now snugger green, now darker green polo steps confidently through

11:32.960 --> 11:34.880
the door, just dripping.

11:34.880 --> 11:39.360
Suddenly Stevie, their eyes get huge with realization.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.720
Holy fucking shit.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.520
There's no backup for the backup mayor.

11:45.520 --> 11:52.480
And she begins like she's going to sprint out of the train car toward the soggy current

11:52.480 --> 11:54.400
mayor of Grover's gorge.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.480
We're going to move in dexterity order.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.760
They were in the car with us and now they are sprinting out of the car.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.960
They are about to start sprinting, but we're going to go into decks order.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.000
So if one of you has higher decks than Stevie.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.840
But their intention is to leave the car?

12:07.840 --> 12:09.920
Their intention is to leave the car.

12:09.920 --> 12:10.480
Yep.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.760
As they holler out, holy fucking shit.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.640
There's no backup for the backup mayor.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.200
What happens if there's no mayor?

12:19.760 --> 12:22.880
God gets loose, I guess.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.640
And we got to go dexterity.

12:24.640 --> 12:25.200
Who's got what?

12:25.200 --> 12:26.080
75.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.520
Oh, you're definitely going first.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.080
50.

12:28.080 --> 12:28.960
50 and?

12:28.960 --> 12:29.600
45.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.160
45.

12:30.160 --> 12:35.360
So it's going to go Julia Summers, Stevie, and then down the line, we got Beck, Beck

12:35.360 --> 12:37.520
Wilder, Cal Colorado, Julia Summers.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.000
What do you do?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.600
He grasps at them.

12:39.600 --> 12:39.840
Okay.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.640
What do you want me to roll?

12:47.120 --> 12:48.960
I'd like you to roll on armed combat.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.760
Yeah, I don't win.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.480
Stevie rolled a success.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.320
I rolled an 83 on a 60.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.120
That's not going to do it.

12:59.200 --> 13:06.080
So as you reach out and grasp for Stevie, they dip out and take off running off out of this

13:06.720 --> 13:14.400
single steel, simple train car sized simple train station and toward the sopping wet current

13:14.400 --> 13:16.160
mayor of Grover's Gorge.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.600
It is Beck Wilder's turn.

13:18.480 --> 13:24.160
Beck, we've all resigned ourselves to trying to get the fuck out of here.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.480
I don't think that he's on the train.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.960
He's just going to go to the door and yell out to them.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.320
Stevie, dude, we got to go.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.160
We can maybe install a new mayor when we get back or something.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.360
Would that be helpful?

13:37.360 --> 13:38.160
We need to leave.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.640
No, it's got to happen now.

13:40.640 --> 13:46.880
Cal kind of brushes past Beck and he can't run very fast, but he's, you know, bad left

13:46.880 --> 13:47.120
knee.

13:48.320 --> 13:55.440
But yeah, he's starting to chase after Stevie and he's shouting, Stevie, I don't think this

13:55.440 --> 13:56.320
is very prudent.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.040
Have you really considered if this is the best course of action?

13:59.040 --> 14:00.720
Why don't you just wait up a minute there?

14:00.720 --> 14:01.760
Hold on, Stevie.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.280
I'm really serious, guys.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.880
This is very serious.

14:05.600 --> 14:11.280
You can roll persuade both of you combined and you can combine your role against her.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.760
Can I have said no, don't go and also roll?

14:15.680 --> 14:17.920
I fail mine a 65 on a 50.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.080
I also rolled a 65 on a 80.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.100
Nice.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.600
Very good.

14:25.600 --> 14:31.440
So you are giving it your all, but I gave her a plus 20 because you had a predetermined

14:31.440 --> 14:32.080
outcome in mind.

14:33.280 --> 14:38.160
I gave her a plus 20 because the thing that she knows is very stout.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.040
And I gave her a 50.

14:41.040 --> 14:41.520
What did she roll?

14:41.520 --> 14:42.080
For a human.

14:42.720 --> 14:43.680
Luke, what did she roll?

14:46.800 --> 14:48.000
A critical fail.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.440
77 on a 70.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.640
So she stops dead in her tracks.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.920
I think you're getting through to it, man.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.600
They turn around, they look at Cal.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.080
Well, now I'm not sure if stopping them was even a good idea.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.720
Wait, why did you want to, what were you going to do?

15:09.440 --> 15:09.940
Okay.

15:10.720 --> 15:18.160
Sopping wet, Chuck Bidwell is just walking confidently, carefully, and slowly toward

15:18.160 --> 15:22.240
the edge of the cliff with one eye kind of looking over.

15:22.240 --> 15:28.320
He's kind of glancing over Stevie, giving her a very dirty eyes.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.360
Where's the other eye looking?

15:29.360 --> 15:31.680
Now, both of them, both of them together, one of them and the other one.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.240
Two eyes.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.600
He's got two eyes on Stevie.

15:36.880 --> 15:42.480
And he's just walking away and walking toward the edge of the cliff while you guys, they've

15:42.480 --> 15:44.480
turned around and they look at you.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.400
Well, Julius, you're right there too, right?

15:46.400 --> 15:46.800
Yeah.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.640
Now I feel like I've made a mistake.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.000
Should you run after him, Stevie?

15:52.400 --> 15:57.520
Um, cut that part out.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.840
Chuck Bidwell continues to walk.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.360
She still hasn't answered my question.

16:01.360 --> 16:07.040
If we don't stop him from jumping off this cliff and hitting himself, he will be unleashed.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.480
He's been trying to do this the whole time.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.600
That's why he's the mayor.

16:09.600 --> 16:15.040
It's this weird, some sort of fucking spell or some shit that's actually real where he's

16:15.040 --> 16:19.760
the mayor and he stays the mayor and it stays the mayor as long as there's a mayor.

16:19.760 --> 16:23.280
But if he dies, there's no mayor and it's loose on everyone.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.880
They put it in the turtle.

16:24.880 --> 16:25.840
Turtles are slow.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.520
And they live for a long time.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.080
Yeah.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.920
And they typically don't kill themselves.

16:29.920 --> 16:30.320
Yeah.

16:30.320 --> 16:30.960
Yeah.

16:30.960 --> 16:31.760
God turtle.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.080
God.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.120
God turtle.

16:33.120 --> 16:33.920
Stevie should go.

16:33.920 --> 16:34.880
Stevie, go get him.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.720
Whatever you say.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.880
And she, and she turns around.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.560
She turns around.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.440
You got it, boss.

16:54.160 --> 16:57.600
Stevie plants their heels into the ground.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.520
She takes off.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.960
Oh, by the way, Stevie uses just like she, they pronouns.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.600
So either one that you decide to use is fine.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.000
Word.

17:06.000 --> 17:06.480
Oh, cool.

17:06.480 --> 17:06.880
Tight.

17:06.880 --> 17:13.520
And when Stevie collides with the wet polo clad Chuck Bidwell, Stevie is trying to hold

17:13.520 --> 17:17.040
on and restrain Chuck Bidwell from walking any further.

17:17.040 --> 17:23.440
However, Chuck Bidwell continues his gate as Stevie continues to plant her heels into

17:23.440 --> 17:25.760
the ground and they're just trying to hold on.

17:25.760 --> 17:31.440
So at this point, because of the dilly dallying, you've got one roll.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.720
You've only got one roll.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.080
Do not let it pass you by.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.520
The classic crap.

17:37.520 --> 17:45.040
Julius is gonna realize what they said and sprint and try to knock him backwards away

17:45.040 --> 17:46.080
from the gorge.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.440
Okay, go ahead and roll.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.040
Roll what?

17:49.040 --> 17:51.040
Because he's just walking slowly.

17:51.040 --> 17:54.240
You can just roll strength if that's higher than unarmed combat.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.320
I'll do an unarmed combat.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.360
Cause you're trying to push.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.200
I got a 31 on a 60.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.280
Got a 52 on a 70.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.420
Damn.

18:04.800 --> 18:11.040
So you go to push onto the front and these thighs, man, what's going on with them?

18:11.040 --> 18:14.400
They're tired from squeezing the life out of Vernon.

18:14.400 --> 18:24.720
These thighs of mine, they're tired of squashing.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.880
Tired from pushing Vernon.

18:26.880 --> 18:32.720
Julius is just a little worn out from, you know, he basically maxed out at the gym today.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.640
On Vernon's head.

18:37.040 --> 18:41.920
And now you are just trying to hold on, but Chuck Bidwell continues.

18:42.640 --> 18:46.320
Darth Vader like walk toward this edge.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.360
Darth Vader win.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.280
Oh, um, 92.

18:51.040 --> 18:51.680
Oh yeah.

18:51.680 --> 18:52.320
The Olympics.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.360
Atlanta?

18:55.360 --> 18:56.080
Come on.

18:56.080 --> 18:56.800
96.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.600
Whatever.

18:57.600 --> 19:03.520
And Colorado, uh, Beck Wilder has.

19:04.080 --> 19:08.320
Zach's referencing when he saw him walking in a parade one time in 1992.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.880
That was the Darth Vader walk.

19:10.880 --> 19:11.280
Uh huh.

19:11.280 --> 19:11.600
Yeah.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.040
Thanksgiving, the year I was born.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.560
He wasn't allowed in the parade.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.000
So people were trying to hold him back.

19:17.040 --> 19:20.640
That Darth Vader walked with such strength and vigor.

19:20.640 --> 19:21.360
Beck Wilder.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.640
I'm doing the same thing.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.880
Stevie has convinced me that I've already seen this crazy shit happen.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.800
And I don't want more of that.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.280
And it sounds like it's going to be real bad if I do.

19:31.280 --> 19:36.480
So he wants to, uh, I want to go over there and try and help block like a, is it a frontline

19:36.480 --> 19:36.800
man?

19:36.800 --> 19:36.960
Yeah.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.800
Like an offensive lineman offensive lineman.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.400
I want to, I want to kind of get into stance.

19:40.400 --> 19:40.560
Okay.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.800
Now are you doing pass blocking or brush blocking?

19:42.800 --> 19:46.000
So pass blocking is going to be kind of on your heels, trying to keep them in front of

19:46.000 --> 19:48.960
you and rush blocking is going to be driving the group forward.

19:48.960 --> 19:52.320
Rush, rush blocking, rush blocking, trying to maybe even get them to the ground.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.560
Once I, once I center mass him.

19:54.560 --> 19:54.960
Yeah.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.000
Like one of the greatest offensive linemen of all time.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.120
Orlando pace.

19:59.120 --> 19:59.920
That's what I was thinking.

19:59.920 --> 20:00.320
Yeah.

20:00.320 --> 20:00.720
Yeah.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.120
Yeah.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.640
And you just lumber over there.

20:02.640 --> 20:08.000
He was like 300 pounds and quicker in 15 yards than Marshall folk.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.560
No shit.

20:08.560 --> 20:09.360
2000.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.240
Yeah dude.

20:10.240 --> 20:10.800
That's cool.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.840
Wildly fast.

20:11.840 --> 20:12.960
Explosive.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.400
Explosive.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.440
A lot, a lot like Beck.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.160
300 pounds.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.360
I don't know what I was rolling on.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.080
Was it good?

20:20.080 --> 20:20.720
But it's good.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.480
Well, what are you trying to use?

20:24.880 --> 20:29.200
I mean, it's either strength or I don't know, like athletics.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.400
Let's go strength.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.840
21 on a 55.

20:31.840 --> 20:32.160
Okay.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.280
Chuck, but it all failed.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.160
Oh shit.

20:34.160 --> 20:34.560
Yeah.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.000
78 over 70.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.440
Then yeah, I'm driving him back.

20:37.440 --> 20:41.120
I don't know if it's strong enough to knock him down, but I'm at least digging in my heels

20:41.120 --> 20:42.320
and he, he was not moving forward.

20:42.320 --> 20:47.760
You have stopped the progress of Chuck Bidwell and it is Cal Colorado's turn.

20:47.760 --> 20:48.480
Dope, dope, dope.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.440
When he comes, he comes panting up like a little out of breath.

20:52.080 --> 20:58.160
And I think he just like grabs on to Julius's shoulders and yanks back and brings like the

20:58.160 --> 20:59.120
whole group with them.

20:59.120 --> 20:59.440
Love it.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.000
Go ahead and roll.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.400
Hopefully you bring the whole group with you in a good way.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.520
What would you like me to roll?

21:05.520 --> 21:08.640
The same thing as them, either a strength or an unarmed combat.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.200
Pass a strength roll with 21.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.280
I've got you beat with a 26.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.280
Ooh, a close one.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.320
Very close.

21:16.320 --> 21:20.000
Well, now I'm embarrassed that I said the, the thing.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.880
The thing about pulling them back.

21:22.880 --> 21:27.600
Cal Colorado runs up and grabs Julius by the shoulders and attempts to pull the whole group

21:27.600 --> 21:27.920
back.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.920
But, uh, he, he merely.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.480
What?

21:30.480 --> 21:31.840
Julius is in the front.

21:31.840 --> 21:38.320
So that makes sense that, but he, I wasn't a little confused about the pulling backwards

21:38.320 --> 21:39.040
part.

21:39.040 --> 21:39.360
Okay.

21:39.360 --> 21:43.040
So in my mind, Stevie is on the back holding back.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.520
Julius was in the front, trying to push him forward.

21:45.520 --> 21:50.400
And then Beck came up behind Julius and was pile driving the two of them.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.280
Yeah, he was.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.160
Well then no one to me grabbing Julius's shoulders.

21:54.160 --> 21:54.960
Exactly.

21:54.960 --> 21:55.680
It didn't help.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.240
It didn't help.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.720
But thankfully you got the momentum on your side.

21:58.720 --> 22:02.320
And so I think we're all feeling pretty good about the outcome of this.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.760
I'm grabbing Stevie's shoulders then.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.960
Me and Julius are, we're between Chuck Bidwell and the chasm is at our back.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.000
Yes, that is correct.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.360
Yes, absolutely.

22:11.360 --> 22:15.120
And it is going to continue with Julius Summers.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.400
This is a good old fashioned tug of war.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.440
It's a good old fashioned tug.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.520
We got a good old fashioned tug of war.

22:19.520 --> 22:20.800
He's only one.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.640
Oh, like that old show Squid Game.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.040
Away.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.480
Still haven't seen it.

22:26.480 --> 22:34.400
Julius is going to continue pushing back and try to give a little tickle to maybe distract.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.360
Now we're talking.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.320
Distract him a little bit.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.000
Armpit, prostate, where are you talking?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.200
A 70 on a 60.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.680
You only put 60 in tickle?

22:42.240 --> 22:42.480
Yeah.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.680
Yeah, that's not going to do it.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.800
As you go to tickle him, you feel the wettest.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.080
Where are you getting in?

22:50.080 --> 22:51.760
Well, it doesn't matter.

22:51.760 --> 22:52.560
It's going to be wet.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.760
It's going to be nasty.

22:53.760 --> 23:00.640
I had my arms on his shoulders, like pushing back and I took one hand off to tickle him

23:01.200 --> 23:04.160
and I put it up into his armpit.

23:04.160 --> 23:08.160
But like the polo is like sopping wet and the tickle.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.760
Well, it's like squeezing a ShamWow.

23:11.760 --> 23:12.160
Right.

23:12.160 --> 23:15.040
It's just there's too much pressure to tickle.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.120
It just feels like I'm poking his armpit.

23:17.120 --> 23:17.680
Gross.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.800
Yeah, absolutely.

23:20.240 --> 23:20.880
He's like, ouch.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.560
Stevie attempts the same.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.400
Will it tickle?

23:26.400 --> 23:27.520
Everybody, tickle him.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.760
Tickle fight.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.040
To the same result.

23:31.040 --> 23:36.000
Finger in armpit, wiggling around, but just poking and sopping wet you.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.600
Beck, we need more tickles.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.200
Oh dude, I'm really good at tickling.

23:41.200 --> 23:41.700
Hang on.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.000
I'm 31 good at tickling.

23:44.880 --> 23:49.680
He's going to spend luck to make that a 42, which is a success.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.960
How does Dougal look?

23:50.960 --> 23:52.320
What cool thing did he do?

23:54.000 --> 24:00.320
Chuck Bidwell continues with one foot over the edge like he you're holding on now.

24:00.320 --> 24:05.040
You've had to move out of the way in order to not get pushed off the back yourselves

24:05.040 --> 24:07.760
and it is all up to Cal Colorado.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.720
Cal Colorado says, hey, look over there and I want to roll persuade.

24:11.440 --> 24:14.000
Success.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.960
I rolled a hundred.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.000
Holy shit.

24:20.000 --> 24:20.240
Right?

24:20.240 --> 24:21.120
That's what that is?

24:21.120 --> 24:21.840
All zeros.

24:23.040 --> 24:23.280
Oops.

24:23.920 --> 24:29.920
So my plan was to shout, hey, look over there and then slap lasagna in his eyes with my

24:29.920 --> 24:30.480
other hand.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.440
But instead I slip trying to get lasagna out of my pockets.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.280
Where you're pointing is just down.

24:38.480 --> 24:39.440
Hey, look down there.

24:41.280 --> 24:41.840
Gladly.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.920
He looks down there.

24:43.920 --> 24:44.560
Sorry guys.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.680
This is one of those let go or don't situations.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.000
Raise your hand if you're audio medium.

24:52.000 --> 24:58.800
Say a holler at if you're letting go of Chuck of Chuck as he is strongly moving over the

24:58.800 --> 24:59.200
edge.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.360
Basically you're choosing whether or not you're going over.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.520
He's not making an attempt to grab at any of you.

25:03.520 --> 25:08.640
However, you do see that he's making an attempt to grab for Stevie.

25:08.720 --> 25:09.920
Can I try and intercept that?

25:09.920 --> 25:10.960
Would I have a chance?

25:10.960 --> 25:11.760
Yeah, let's do it.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.800
This is your moment.

25:12.800 --> 25:17.680
You're not going to stop him from going over because that ship is sailed, but you can stop

25:17.680 --> 25:18.640
him from grabbing.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.320
Just want to slap his hand away.

25:20.320 --> 25:25.120
Because he is going for a very firm grasp based on the rules that I rolled.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.000
It's an 18.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.240
I don't know what you wanted to have that on.

25:28.240 --> 25:28.480
Okay.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.000
He succeeded with a 43.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.480
Can I go for a slap too?

25:34.480 --> 25:38.880
Uh, yeah, absolutely.

25:38.880 --> 25:39.440
Go ahead and roll.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.640
Actually, I want to make this one last tickle.

25:43.440 --> 25:44.720
One last push for a tickle.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.480
A 50 on a 60.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.720
Oh, that is a good enough to tickle the grass leaves.

25:52.720 --> 25:55.680
As he reaches out, you tickle like the inside of his wrist.

25:55.680 --> 26:01.040
Well, yeah, as he's falling, the pressure of the tickle decreases enough just to get

26:01.040 --> 26:02.560
to the perfect tickle pressure.

26:05.360 --> 26:11.120
So with your hand inside his, it goes, it goes from poke to tickle.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.240
The gradient of tickle.

26:14.240 --> 26:14.740
Yeah.

26:15.280 --> 26:20.080
It's turned all the way up to tickle and I get that one good tickle in before there's

26:20.960 --> 26:22.800
before I'm not touching his armpit at all.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.320
And like an involuntary laugh escapes as he lets go of Stevie.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.240
Like this is like weird noise comes out of his throat.

26:31.200 --> 26:38.480
And like releases Stevie as he just falls backwards and looks at you with these like

26:38.480 --> 26:39.680
dead eyes.

26:40.880 --> 26:41.680
Connor Ratliff.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.120
Yeah.

26:43.120 --> 26:43.920
Great podcast.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.520
Have us on.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.240
We'd cast you.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.640
Oh, he would be a great Chuck Bidwell.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.080
He would be a great Chuck Bidwell.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.120
You listening Connor?

26:52.000 --> 26:52.960
Dead eyed motherfucker.

26:56.640 --> 27:00.000
As Chuck falls backwards in the classic fall backwards pose.

27:00.480 --> 27:06.640
With kind of a blurry image behind him of the smooth cavernous crevasse.

27:07.280 --> 27:12.080
And eventually he looking up the sound of body mix when he's ashes on a canyon floor.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.520
I've seen a lot of wily coyote.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.160
I think it's just a.

27:17.840 --> 27:23.040
And when he lands each of you see something incomprehensible.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.480
Your brain does cloud.

27:25.840 --> 27:29.280
Your brain simply won't comprehend it.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.120
Skull and crossbones.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.080
The dust cloud with skull and crossbones.

27:36.080 --> 27:40.240
The crossbones fills your stomachs with dread.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.400
Your hands get clammy.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.720
Your sight seems compromised.

27:44.720 --> 27:51.680
And you feel an air blasting boom so loud that you wonder for a split moment.

27:51.680 --> 27:54.000
If you'll ever hear again.

27:54.640 --> 27:58.960
And I need you each to roll con times five.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.680
To stay conscious.

28:03.760 --> 28:04.320
I pass.

28:05.440 --> 28:06.880
I critically fail.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.040
It's a 77.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.880
You're not going to believe this, but I also critically failed with an 88.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.000
Jesus Christ.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.280
I got a four.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.200
Okay shit.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.520
Thomas and Joe take our headphones off.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.880
Take your pants off.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.280
Take your pants or plans.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.080
Strip Delta.

28:38.480 --> 28:38.960
Boom.

28:38.960 --> 28:39.360
Boom.

28:43.600 --> 28:50.640
Luke, you feel this reverberation in your chest that shakes your entire skeleton inside your body

28:50.640 --> 28:53.040
and just vibrates your entire being.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.720
Your vision goes completely.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.640
Wackity wackity wack.

28:58.640 --> 29:02.960
And suddenly it's extremely dark.

29:02.960 --> 29:06.160
It was a perfectly bright day here in this gorge.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.960
And now it is extremely dark.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.000
I need you to roll grip.

29:11.840 --> 29:19.600
In this darkness, you see that the rest of the can crew, Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, and Stevie

29:19.600 --> 29:24.080
have all fallen to the ground, seemingly unconscious.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.640
I pass with a 39 on a 44.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.400
You only lose one grip.

29:28.400 --> 29:33.840
Julius kind of like shakes it off and clears his vision a little bit and then is going

29:33.840 --> 29:38.960
to try to rush over to his coworkers on the ground and see what's up to kind of try to

29:38.960 --> 29:39.840
slap him away.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.080
Okay.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.440
You're kind of slapping at him.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.600
You see the camera has fallen to the side of Beck Wilder.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.240
You see, you know, Cal's an older guy.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.920
He seems to have fallen okay.

29:49.920 --> 29:53.520
He doesn't seem to like have broken anything in the fall.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.680
Stevie's just completely out.

29:55.680 --> 29:56.960
None of them are getting back up.

29:56.960 --> 30:01.760
And you hear this rumble coming from the bottom of the chasm.

30:01.760 --> 30:07.280
Julius reaches to his phone thinking about making a TikTok, but then sees that the camera

30:07.280 --> 30:12.080
is on the ground and Beck is incapacitated and real footage is better than TikTok footage.

30:12.080 --> 30:17.040
So he's going to grab the camera and he's going to point it at the sound.

30:17.040 --> 30:17.440
Okay.

30:17.440 --> 30:22.640
He's going to walk to walk with camera on his shoulder, you know, looking at the display,

30:22.640 --> 30:24.640
a wall of fog ahead of you.

30:24.640 --> 30:31.360
And the fog is rising up like a push pop being just lifted from something coming up as the

30:31.360 --> 30:34.800
rumbling is growing louder and louder from below.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.040
Yeah.

30:35.040 --> 30:39.840
He's going to kind of, he's going to walk to the, to the ledge, but then kind of use

30:39.840 --> 30:45.200
the camera so he doesn't have to, you know, completely look over it, but aim the camera,

30:45.200 --> 30:48.160
see if he can see anything through the fog as the fog lifts.

30:48.160 --> 30:53.520
Julia Summers through the viewfinder of this camera sees, what does that smell?

30:54.240 --> 30:55.200
What does that smell?

30:55.200 --> 30:56.640
I got weed from work today.

30:58.960 --> 30:59.200
Yeah.

30:59.200 --> 30:59.840
It's dank.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.920
It's like, it's musty, but it's also.

31:02.720 --> 31:08.000
He kind of like smacks his lips a little bit and it's like, he just sucking on salt.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.280
That's exactly right.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.320
I need you to witness this thing.

31:12.320 --> 31:19.360
And in order to witness it, I need you to either ask me one question or three yes, no

31:19.360 --> 31:20.320
questions.

31:20.320 --> 31:20.640
Okay.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.920
I already know that I get a salty taste in my mouth.

31:23.920 --> 31:24.480
Yep.

31:24.480 --> 31:28.960
I know that it sounds like disembodied voices that aren't really saying anything.

31:28.960 --> 31:29.280
Yep.

31:29.280 --> 31:34.960
And I know that as you remember that you begin hearing it and I know that it's a liquidy

31:34.960 --> 31:37.680
human formed this thing.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.160
Yep.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.040
Sorry, give me a second.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.040
I'll just, I'll do yes or no.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.160
Make it quick.

31:42.160 --> 31:42.560
Okay.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.200
That's three.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.160
Do I see it now?

31:44.160 --> 31:44.560
Yes.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.680
Is it coming at me?

31:45.680 --> 31:46.240
Yes.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.720
Does it give off any light since it's so dark in here?

31:51.280 --> 31:51.760
Yes.

31:51.760 --> 32:01.120
This incomprehensible humanoid wet energy structure erupts out of this chasm, lifting

32:01.120 --> 32:08.400
the fog above its head as it rises its shoulders next, you see an enormous torso and you're

32:08.480 --> 32:10.960
staring between the legs of this.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.160
What?

32:14.160 --> 32:20.640
Julius takes a knee to brace himself with the camera and aims the camera up at it.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.160
And as you aim the camera up.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.760
Fluid monster god turtle thing.

32:25.760 --> 32:31.680
You hear all of these voices coming out of the hand that is reaching out toward you.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.560
It's the size of a suburban.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.400
It's coming to scoop you up.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.200
Suburban.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.960
Julius is going to take the camera off his shoulder and set it down on the ground toward

32:42.960 --> 32:44.720
the camera is still kind of facing it.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.800
He's going to run.

32:46.800 --> 32:47.300
Okay.

32:48.880 --> 32:49.280
Okay.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.600
Roll a roll for athletics.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.680
I succeed with a 43.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.680
It was a 69.

33:03.680 --> 33:04.240
No.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.040
I promise.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.400
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:07.040 --> 33:07.600
Holy shit.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.320
Where do you run?

33:08.320 --> 33:10.080
How do you, how do you get away?

33:11.200 --> 33:11.760
I'm going to run.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.560
That's what you want.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.880
I'm going to run back out into Grover's gorge.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.200
Holy fucking shit, dude.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.320
Holy fucking.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.560
You turn the wheel.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.240
Let's go doggies.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.120
Doggies.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.640
You dog the door.

33:25.200 --> 33:30.080
While he's dogging the door, he looks back at his friends and he just goes, Oh, I'll

33:30.080 --> 33:30.720
try to save you.

33:30.720 --> 33:30.960
Okay.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.840
I'd have you roll again, but you rolled the 69.

33:33.840 --> 33:36.000
So you've dogged the door.

33:36.400 --> 33:36.640
Yeah.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.920
He just like flips it and it just spins on its own.

33:39.920 --> 33:40.420
Yes.

33:41.440 --> 33:45.520
And it immediately opens and you grab it on the other side.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.560
Slam it shut.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.120
Dog those doors from the other side.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.880
You are now inside.

33:50.880 --> 33:56.080
Luke just mouthed what the fuck to no one in this room right now.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.080
Just looked at, I don't know what.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.200
Holy fucking shit, dude.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.280
I panicked as you would.

34:04.080 --> 34:04.960
No game plan.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.680
No game plan.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.640
This is what you would call out of the frying pan and into the fire.

34:12.960 --> 34:13.200
Yeah.

34:13.200 --> 34:18.960
Julius like closes the door and locks it, seals it back up again, turns around and looks

34:18.960 --> 34:20.720
at Grover's Gorge and just.

34:20.720 --> 34:20.960
Okay.

34:20.960 --> 34:25.600
You're still like in this big plant space and I'm going to roll the 69 over and say

34:25.600 --> 34:30.080
that you did this all quite stealthily and are able to just kind of blend back into this

34:30.080 --> 34:30.400
wall.

34:30.400 --> 34:35.600
So you're looking out at honestly a pretty normal situation in Grover's Gorge from what

34:35.600 --> 34:36.480
you've seen.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.360
And by that, I mean when you first arrived, not later.

34:39.360 --> 34:45.040
Julius knows that he can't go back into the main part of town and the only person he knows

34:45.040 --> 34:50.400
here that might have any chance of giving a shit about what is going on specifically

34:50.400 --> 34:51.920
with Stevie is Fox God.

34:51.920 --> 34:52.720
Oh my God.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.880
We're going to the GIZ?

34:54.880 --> 34:55.760
Going to the GIZ.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.240
Holy shit.

34:56.240 --> 34:56.480
Okay.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.440
How are you going to get there?

34:57.440 --> 35:03.600
Basically your options are you can, I mean, cross over the track, this bouncy synthetic

35:03.600 --> 35:09.840
colorful material, or you can kind of go around to a sidewalk situation over near the GIZs,

35:09.840 --> 35:14.640
or you can cut all the way through the wall and then go around the backside of the GIZs.

35:14.640 --> 35:19.760
I mean, I would, I'm thinking he's probably the stealthiest option would be to cut around

35:19.760 --> 35:25.280
and go back, but there's not, I don't, I feel he thinks this is pretty fucking urgent.

35:25.280 --> 35:25.600
Okay.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.800
You might get caught.

35:26.800 --> 35:32.320
So I'll give you a straight up stealth against the

35:32.320 --> 35:33.680
perception of the town.

35:33.680 --> 35:37.280
If you go straight there, if you, if you kind of cut around and use the sidewalk, if you

35:37.280 --> 35:40.320
go around back, I'll give you a plus 40 to your stealth.

35:40.320 --> 35:40.560
Okay.

35:40.560 --> 35:40.720
Yeah.

35:40.720 --> 35:47.040
He's going to cut around back and, and just be like, try to be stealthy, but he's booking

35:47.040 --> 35:47.600
it.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.440
Roll that stealth with a plus 40.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.600
They, what did you get?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.440
I got a 47 on an 80.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.320
What do you think the town perception should be on the way in?

35:58.320 --> 35:58.960
It was 80.

35:59.920 --> 36:00.640
What did I roll?

36:02.320 --> 36:04.880
Shit.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.920
He could succeeded with 77.

36:10.240 --> 36:10.560
Okay.

36:10.560 --> 36:13.840
You're creeping through the brush and flowers.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.120
No, I'm not creeping.

36:15.120 --> 36:15.760
I'm running.

36:15.760 --> 36:21.120
You're sprinting through this wall, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, running, running, running.

36:21.120 --> 36:28.480
And as you head around the corner behind these GIZs, you see there's a privacy fence in the

36:28.480 --> 36:29.680
backyard, right?

36:29.760 --> 36:33.280
So you keep going around the back of the privacy fence and you run down.

36:33.280 --> 36:36.800
Now you're running kind of North South based on when you first arrived.

36:36.800 --> 36:37.040
Right.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.360
And you're running toward the far side away.

36:39.360 --> 36:44.080
You're trying to remember where the GIZ was that Fox went into.

36:44.080 --> 36:49.920
And as you're trying to remember, you trip on something in the ground and you look down

36:49.920 --> 36:51.840
and you see a fucking Jackalope.

36:52.800 --> 36:53.300
Nope.

36:54.560 --> 37:00.880
No, there's like a metal cage that is halfway coming out of the ground just a little bit.

37:00.880 --> 37:06.560
And at the head of this body length metal cage is a tombstone.

37:06.560 --> 37:11.440
And as I fall on the ground, right in front of the tombstone, what do I read?

37:11.440 --> 37:12.480
It says, oh.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.360
Julius Sommers.

37:13.360 --> 37:19.200
Julius Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.160
Wait, fuck.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.360
What is the name?

37:21.360 --> 37:22.160
What's the name?

37:22.160 --> 37:23.600
Is it too late to do something?

37:23.600 --> 37:24.320
Yeah, of course it is.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.080
What's the name on this tombstone?

37:26.640 --> 37:28.240
Just give me a good last name.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.200
Cream pie.

37:29.200 --> 37:29.700
Nope.

37:31.120 --> 37:31.680
Crump.

37:31.680 --> 37:32.320
Crumpy.

37:32.320 --> 37:32.880
Crumpy.

37:32.880 --> 37:33.360
Thank you.

37:33.360 --> 37:33.680
Okay.

37:33.680 --> 37:39.520
So it's Jeremiah Crumpy, former mayor of Grover's Gorge.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.240
And as you trip, you hear a voice call out.

37:43.120 --> 37:43.840
Hi there.

37:44.480 --> 37:47.520
Julius looks around to see where hi there's coming from.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.000
Hello?

37:48.880 --> 37:49.280
Hello?

37:49.280 --> 37:56.320
Looking over the privacy fence, you see that there is a man standing on his back porch

37:56.320 --> 37:59.520
in one of the GIZs that you were running past.

37:59.520 --> 38:06.640
He's in a very like fine robe that's monochromatic with green accents.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.000
And he holds up a cup of coffee to you.

38:10.720 --> 38:15.200
Um, aren't you one of them fellas that was about to be on trial?

38:15.200 --> 38:17.360
Aren't you supposed to be over there in the it bit?

38:17.360 --> 38:19.360
Um, I'm not sure about that.

38:19.360 --> 38:22.560
I actually just got into town from the train station.

38:22.560 --> 38:26.960
I have a very important delivery for Fox Gotel and I've got to get to him.

38:26.960 --> 38:27.460
Oh!

38:28.160 --> 38:29.440
Uh, go ahead and roll.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.640
Uh, either disguise or persuade.

38:34.480 --> 38:34.980
Dude.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.720
I got an ought one.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.280
Oh my god!

38:41.280 --> 38:42.560
I'm not gonna move it.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.040
Okay.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.560
But you can look if you want.

38:44.560 --> 38:48.400
Oh!

38:48.400 --> 38:51.200
That's really handy because look what I fucking rolled.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.960
A 22 crit success.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.840
Yes, but an ought one is the best crit success.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.640
It's 669 but you already rolled.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.840
Holy fuck.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.560
Okay, so with an ought one, he's like,

39:02.560 --> 39:03.120
No way!

39:03.920 --> 39:06.960
Yeah, uh, I just was pointed in this direction.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.400
Could you show me where he is?

39:08.960 --> 39:10.320
Where his GIZ is?

39:10.320 --> 39:11.280
Oh yeah, for sure.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.640
He's actually next door.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.200
Fantastic.

39:13.600 --> 39:17.040
I was in such a hurry I seemed to trip over this mayor.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.960
Oh yeah, Jeremiah Ripp!

39:21.760 --> 39:22.480
Yes.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.040
Yes, sir.

39:24.080 --> 39:24.580
Crampy.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.920
Here's a good one, but not long for this world, you know?

39:27.920 --> 39:29.600
Do you mind if I hop your fence?

39:29.600 --> 39:31.600
Oh no, I mean, look at the gate.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.600
Julius looks at the gate and he's like,

39:33.600 --> 39:34.560
Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.600
You know, in a rush, not thinking straight.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.200
It's okay, have a good one.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.400
And he heads back into his GIZ.

39:42.400 --> 39:42.880
Well done.

39:43.200 --> 39:47.360
Holy fuck, uh, Julius fucking uses that gate.

39:47.360 --> 39:52.240
All right, you head into the backyard of Fox Gottles GIZ.

39:52.240 --> 39:59.040
It is absolute mayhem of cool, like, dumb toys and shit.

39:59.040 --> 40:03.280
He's got like a basketball hoop with a trampoline next to it.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.240
He's got a pool.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.440
He's got a hot tub.

40:05.440 --> 40:09.440
He's got one of those, like, you sit in it and it looks like a monster truck and you

40:09.440 --> 40:11.040
drive it and it flips all around.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.040
You know, he's got one of those.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.080
Two of those.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.240
That's crazy.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.440
I can't believe he has three of those.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.680
And there's an actual monster truck there too.

40:21.440 --> 40:26.320
Damn, Julius almost trips over a hoverboard, but doesn't.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.120
Can you describe the GIZ?

40:29.120 --> 40:34.720
Oh yeah, from the back, it's got a nice upper deck and then a nice lower porch underneath

40:34.720 --> 40:35.440
that's covered.

40:36.080 --> 40:43.200
And there is like a huge bar with a built-in grill and a tabletop kind of situation.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.440
Lots of windows in this bad boy?

40:45.440 --> 40:48.880
Fair amount of windows, you know, want to get that natural light in there.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.280
Can I see any movement or anybody in the house?

40:51.280 --> 40:53.120
Yeah, Fox is dancing.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.160
What music do I hear?

40:54.160 --> 40:59.600
In one of the rooms, it's like, you just hear a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

40:59.600 --> 41:02.320
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.200
Just kind of on repeat and he's just kind of getting it.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.200
Under his breath, Julius mutters,

41:07.200 --> 41:08.240
Everybody.

41:10.560 --> 41:15.760
And Julius is going to take his shot and go, he's going to close his door.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.720
Just no knock or anything.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.080
I'm going straight in.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.560
No fucking way, dude.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.360
Oh shit.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.960
Hey, what's up, my guy?

41:24.960 --> 41:26.880
You came in through the back?

41:26.880 --> 41:28.960
That is really something else.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.440
I, uh, wait, did he talk more like this?

41:31.440 --> 41:31.920
I think.

41:31.920 --> 41:32.640
I think so.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.680
Oh wow.

41:33.680 --> 41:34.400
No way.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.920
Oh my goodness.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.320
It is fairly wonderful to see you.

41:38.320 --> 41:38.960
Good, sir.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.400
Where are your compatriots?

41:40.400 --> 41:41.920
And you came in through the back.

41:41.920 --> 41:42.720
Wowzers.

41:42.720 --> 41:47.280
Julius goes to give him like the clap, clap, bro hug.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.760
Yeah, clap, bro.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.720
Yes, of course.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.240
We are friends now.

41:52.240 --> 41:54.720
Fox, we need your help.

41:54.720 --> 41:55.680
Whoa, whoa.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.280
Slow down there, buddy.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.480
What's going on?

41:58.480 --> 42:00.880
Do you know about the mayor?

42:00.880 --> 42:02.000
Lovely turtle.

42:02.000 --> 42:02.240
Yes.

42:02.240 --> 42:02.960
Best turtle.

42:02.960 --> 42:03.520
Best mayor.

42:03.680 --> 42:09.040
Are you aware of the whole mayor lore?

42:09.040 --> 42:10.160
The mayor lore.

42:10.720 --> 42:11.200
The God.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.680
Told, do you want to finish that, sir?

42:14.720 --> 42:15.840
It's my last name.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.360
Were you halfway through it?

42:17.360 --> 42:20.000
Julius thinks this makes this a whole lot harder.

42:22.880 --> 42:27.840
Is there an army in Grover's Gorge?

42:27.840 --> 42:28.880
No, no, no.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.040
We have no need for an army.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.720
We have the landlord.

42:32.720 --> 42:37.120
Mr. Vernon Covington takes care of all of our aggressive needs.

42:38.400 --> 42:42.400
Julius is doing what I'm doing, and he's just kind of like licking his lips and kind of

42:43.120 --> 42:45.600
just, what the fuck am I going to do?

42:47.520 --> 42:51.680
I had plans for if you failed a bunch of things, but the succeeding is...

42:52.320 --> 42:53.120
It's unusual.

42:53.120 --> 42:53.840
It's nuts.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.200
Fox, I'm going to be straight with you.

42:57.200 --> 42:57.760
Please.

42:57.760 --> 42:58.880
We don't have a lot of time.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.360
My coworkers...

43:01.360 --> 43:01.860
Sure.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.840
The can people.

43:03.840 --> 43:04.480
And Stevie.

43:05.040 --> 43:05.360
Yes?

43:05.920 --> 43:06.240
Faith.

43:06.880 --> 43:11.680
He kind of turns his head to the side like a dog when you say squirrel.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.520
I said faith, not squirrel.

43:13.520 --> 43:14.000
Squirrel?

43:15.440 --> 43:16.080
Your faith.

43:16.640 --> 43:19.680
Yes, my dearly departed sister Faith.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.320
She's actually alive.

43:23.040 --> 43:28.000
Stevie is Faith, but she might be dearly departed soon if you don't help.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.160
Whoa, okay, okay, okay.

43:31.440 --> 43:38.800
I've still got a grip on what's going on here, so I'd say that I will help.

43:38.800 --> 43:45.120
I don't believe you that my sister is Stevie that didn't even look like her.

43:45.120 --> 43:48.720
If something were to happen to Sandro, who would be the mayor?

43:48.720 --> 43:49.600
Chuck Bidwell.

43:49.600 --> 43:52.560
If something happened to Chuck, who would be the mayor?

43:52.560 --> 43:59.680
Well, he kind of scratches his chin, looks around at all of his things.

44:00.640 --> 44:01.840
Do you want to play VR?

44:02.720 --> 44:03.680
Maybe later.

44:04.480 --> 44:08.640
Gee, who, who, who?

44:08.640 --> 44:09.600
Oh, right, yes.

44:09.600 --> 44:14.400
You were asking about who would be mayor if it weren't Chuck Bidwell.

44:14.400 --> 44:20.640
Well, there's got to be a line in case, you know, something, a line of succession in case

44:20.640 --> 44:22.240
something awful happened.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.600
No, I don't think there is.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.280
Would you want to be the mayor?

44:25.520 --> 44:29.920
I suppose I could be the mayor.

44:29.920 --> 44:30.800
Fantastic.

44:30.800 --> 44:32.320
I, I would vote for you.

44:32.320 --> 44:34.080
Let's hold an election right now.

44:34.080 --> 44:34.880
Hmm.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.480
Well, this is a wild thought.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.480
I wasn't expecting to become mayor today.

44:38.480 --> 44:40.720
Well, why wouldn't Chuck just be mayor?

44:40.720 --> 44:42.480
This is purely hypothetical.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.440
Hypothetical.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.280
I mean, I didn't even run in the election.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.920
Did anyone else besides Chuck?

44:47.920 --> 44:49.440
No, of course not.

44:49.440 --> 44:52.800
Well, I mean, you, you've got a really cool house.

44:52.800 --> 44:53.920
I think you should be mayor.

44:54.800 --> 44:55.520
Wow.

44:55.520 --> 44:58.000
Flattery works on this guy.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.520
Let's do this, buddy.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.080
Cool.

45:00.080 --> 45:05.440
Come with me to certify you in case you had to be the third in line for mayor.

45:05.440 --> 45:06.240
Okay.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.680
Let's go do that.

45:07.680 --> 45:08.800
How do we do that?

45:08.800 --> 45:10.800
By talking to your sister.

45:10.800 --> 45:11.360
Okay.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.000
Hmm.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.960
She's in the train station.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.320
She just had come back and she was about to see us off.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.120
Okay.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.240
Let's go now though.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.160
And let's take these hoverboards.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.560
I like the hoverboards.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.480
I like the hoverboard idea.

45:24.480 --> 45:26.480
I do want to play VR.

45:26.480 --> 45:29.920
I'm sure that you have a high-tech VR.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.000
What about AR?

45:32.000 --> 45:35.760
Strap it on augmented reality and you can play as we go.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.080
Okay.

45:36.080 --> 45:38.480
Roll persuade with a plus 40.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.680
Cause that was brilliant.

45:43.440 --> 45:47.360
I got a 97 on a 100.

45:47.360 --> 45:50.720
Oh shit.

45:51.520 --> 45:52.640
That's incredible.

45:52.640 --> 45:53.360
He failed.

45:54.320 --> 45:54.800
Let's go.

45:56.080 --> 46:02.080
Julius and Fox both strap on like Oculus has like futuristic.

46:02.640 --> 46:05.120
Got all got chilis headsets.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.920
Turn on the AR function.

46:07.920 --> 46:14.160
And it's like looking through your own eyes, but he has programmed it for us to like, we're

46:14.160 --> 46:16.400
like Pac-Man and we're running.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.680
No, we're like Sonic.

46:17.680 --> 46:21.760
And we're collecting rings as we run towards the train station.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.320
Have you played this one before?

46:24.320 --> 46:25.840
It's got a crazy monster.

46:25.840 --> 46:27.600
Once you collect enough rings.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.720
Well, yes, of course.

46:28.720 --> 46:36.800
I always try to get the septum Gordman, the septum Gordman's head to cut them off.

46:36.800 --> 46:37.600
Fantastic.

46:37.600 --> 46:38.400
Get the rings.

46:39.120 --> 46:39.600
Let's go.

46:40.160 --> 46:40.880
Oh my God.

46:40.880 --> 46:41.120
Okay.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.280
So you're running out the front door.

46:43.280 --> 46:46.320
I figured we would just take the same path I took here.

46:46.320 --> 46:47.040
Oh, why?

46:47.040 --> 46:48.640
Why would we go out the back?

46:48.640 --> 46:49.280
More rings.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.080
More rings.

46:52.640 --> 46:54.880
You brilliant son of a bitch.

46:54.880 --> 47:03.120
And you guys dip out ring collectors on your way through his backyard around the back area

47:03.120 --> 47:06.800
over the corpse with the metal cage around it.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.800
The corpse, the bear.

47:08.800 --> 47:09.440
It's a corpse.

47:09.440 --> 47:13.760
The corpse, the burial site, the bone skeleton, the plot.

47:13.760 --> 47:14.260
Yeah.

47:14.820 --> 47:23.140
With the metal cage around it, head back around the sides and toward that doggy doggy door

47:23.860 --> 47:25.380
and out out here.

47:25.380 --> 47:27.140
Well, we've got to go in.

47:27.140 --> 47:28.180
We've got to go in.

47:28.820 --> 47:35.300
And Julius gives the door a little spin and opens it up.

47:38.020 --> 47:38.420
Okay.

47:38.420 --> 47:38.820
Perfect.

47:38.820 --> 47:40.980
The boys will come back for the rest.

47:40.980 --> 47:42.340
Fuck yeah, dude.

47:44.260 --> 47:52.980
In the back.

47:53.860 --> 47:59.540
Or maybe just like through the skull directly through the brain, get stabbed in the head,

47:59.540 --> 48:01.700
but not hard enough to go through.

48:01.700 --> 48:02.500
Break your bones.

48:03.380 --> 48:06.100
Well, we've got Thomas and Joe back in the room now.

48:06.100 --> 48:06.740
So what happened?

48:06.740 --> 48:08.980
I need everyone to roll an alertness check for me.

48:08.980 --> 48:09.480
Oh shit.

48:10.260 --> 48:10.900
Me too.

48:10.900 --> 48:11.400
Yep.

48:14.260 --> 48:17.380
Fail.

48:17.380 --> 48:19.380
I pass a seven on a 40.

48:19.380 --> 48:20.580
53 on a 70.

48:21.140 --> 48:23.220
Thomas, take off your headphones for me real quick.

48:25.620 --> 48:27.300
Beck Wilder, Julius Summers.

48:29.460 --> 48:30.660
Let's start with Beck Wilder.

48:31.700 --> 48:38.020
You come to your stomach still just queasy, your hands wet and cold.

48:38.020 --> 48:45.140
You're feeling completely disoriented, but you hear this rumble and this noise and this

48:46.340 --> 48:51.700
strange kind of like maybe, oh, what do you, what is that?

48:51.700 --> 48:54.180
And Luke, I need you to take off your headphones too.

48:56.180 --> 49:03.060
You can either ask me one question or three yes, no questions about what it is that you

49:03.060 --> 49:08.980
see down at the bottom of this enormous chasm as you come to and look over the edge.

49:08.980 --> 49:12.340
Can I ask the one question, what do I see at the bottom of this ledge?

49:15.220 --> 49:15.720
Certainly.

49:16.500 --> 49:17.460
I want to ask that.

49:17.460 --> 49:18.100
Okay.

49:18.100 --> 49:21.940
What do you know about this, this thing, this kind of energy that you saw?

49:21.940 --> 49:26.820
I saw that it was super circus, like it was wet and it made Chuck physically wet.

49:26.820 --> 49:30.980
It does the same thing this time where it just kind of like, you see this

49:33.460 --> 49:42.100
like strangely moving wet energy there at the bottom of the chasm and it shoots like a spray,

49:42.100 --> 49:49.220
like a jet stream through the windows of the church, the upside down church,

49:49.220 --> 49:55.060
the upside down church that is at the bottom of this chasm off to your right side.

49:55.060 --> 49:58.020
And I need you to roll grip.

50:03.700 --> 50:05.940
Uh, I fail.

50:05.940 --> 50:06.340
Okay.

50:06.340 --> 50:14.100
You're going to roll a D6 and add one for seeing this extremely unnatural sight

50:14.100 --> 50:20.100
as your brain tries to figure out and kind of make it something that you recognize.

50:21.860 --> 50:23.380
I rolled a five.

50:23.380 --> 50:24.580
Five plus one is six.

50:25.940 --> 50:29.540
So start putting those in order as you lose six grip,

50:30.500 --> 50:35.060
fight, flight, freeze, and take off your headphones, please.

50:37.300 --> 50:38.340
Luke is back.

50:38.340 --> 50:40.420
I'm back, back again.

50:40.420 --> 50:46.580
As you walk in, you see something moving at the bottom of the chasm.

50:46.580 --> 50:49.140
You smell that salty sea spray.

50:50.500 --> 50:53.220
You hear those voices calling out.

50:53.860 --> 50:58.980
And at this point you can once again ask one question or three yes, no questions.

50:59.540 --> 50:59.860
Okay.

50:59.860 --> 51:01.300
How fast has it gone?

51:01.300 --> 51:03.460
Well, it was enormous before, right?

51:03.460 --> 51:03.700
Right.

51:03.700 --> 51:04.900
It was extremely enormous.

51:04.900 --> 51:11.060
Now it's like still kind of similar looking, but it's down at the bottom and it's making its way.

51:11.060 --> 51:16.580
It's still enormous, bigger than a human making its way through the valley toward the church

51:17.140 --> 51:22.980
off to the right side, the upside down church stuck in this unnaturally smooth chasm.

51:23.780 --> 51:27.620
So how, I guess that was how fast is it moving?

51:27.620 --> 51:33.380
This enormous humanoid was sprinting at almost 143 miles per hour.

51:33.380 --> 51:42.580
And then it dives through the glass and into pouring itself into this upside down church.

51:42.580 --> 51:43.080
Roll grip.

51:46.580 --> 51:47.300
Fail.

51:47.300 --> 51:49.140
Roll a D six and add one, please.

51:49.860 --> 51:51.620
It's incomprehensible.

51:51.620 --> 51:53.540
Your mind cannot handle what you see.

51:53.540 --> 51:54.740
Two plus one is three.

51:55.300 --> 52:00.980
As you lose three grip, your hold on reality loosens just so.

52:00.980 --> 52:02.580
That puts me at a 40.

52:02.580 --> 52:03.080
Jesus.

52:03.620 --> 52:04.180
That's low.

52:04.180 --> 52:06.100
With a breaking point at 36.

52:06.740 --> 52:08.100
Oh boy, let's bring them all back.

52:08.820 --> 52:14.500
Beck Wilder, I need you to place an order, fight, flight, and freeze.

52:14.500 --> 52:19.220
It's a freeze number one, flight number two, and fight.

52:19.780 --> 52:20.340
Fight is it?

52:20.340 --> 52:21.940
Yeah, fight is number three.

52:21.940 --> 52:23.060
All right, roll that D six.

52:23.460 --> 52:25.140
It's a six.

52:25.140 --> 52:25.700
Okay.

52:25.700 --> 52:27.940
And what was your top freeze?

52:27.940 --> 52:28.740
Freeze.

52:28.740 --> 52:31.780
Cal stands up from tying his shoe and says, what's going on, fellas?

52:31.780 --> 52:33.940
You feel clammy hands.

52:33.940 --> 52:36.580
You feel your stomach is still completely unsettled.

52:36.580 --> 52:41.700
Your vision is kind of off your head, shaking, vibrating almost still.

52:41.700 --> 52:50.020
And you see Beck Wilder staring directly, completely frozen down toward the church.

52:50.100 --> 52:56.340
And when you look in that direction, you see where you had previously seen like this beautiful

52:56.340 --> 52:59.220
stained glass in the front of this church.

52:59.220 --> 53:05.620
Now you see it has been completely broken and there's a hole in the stained glass that

53:05.620 --> 53:07.220
leads into this church.

53:07.220 --> 53:08.660
Who would do that to a church?

53:09.300 --> 53:09.800
Teens.

53:10.980 --> 53:17.940
You see that Fox Godel is here with Julius Summers and Stevie is coming too.

53:20.340 --> 53:22.820
It's good to see you again, Fox Godel, obviously.

53:23.380 --> 53:27.460
Also Fox and Julius are both wearing VR headsets.

53:27.460 --> 53:28.020
Oh yeah.

53:34.020 --> 53:36.100
We're collecting rings.

53:36.100 --> 53:37.780
How many do you have so far, Julius?

53:38.820 --> 53:39.540
He's rolling.

53:41.940 --> 53:44.660
I only managed to pick up 11.

53:44.660 --> 53:46.660
Oh, I have 79.

53:46.660 --> 53:49.140
That is considerably more than you, sir.

53:49.140 --> 53:49.860
Yes.

53:49.860 --> 53:53.140
Julius was telling me that we're going to make me mayor.

53:53.140 --> 53:53.860
I'm sorry.

53:53.860 --> 53:54.100
What?

53:55.060 --> 53:56.500
When was this discussed?

53:56.500 --> 53:58.260
How long was I tying my shoe?

53:58.260 --> 54:00.420
Trust me, Fox is the mayor now.

54:00.420 --> 54:04.100
He's the emergency mandated mayor of Grover's Gorge.

54:04.100 --> 54:04.980
Stevie, Stevie.

54:04.980 --> 54:05.540
Hold on.

54:05.540 --> 54:06.040
What?

54:06.580 --> 54:07.460
What's going on here?

54:07.460 --> 54:07.860
I don't know.

54:07.860 --> 54:11.220
I feel fucking bad and weird.

54:11.220 --> 54:12.660
What happened?

54:12.660 --> 54:13.380
That noise.

54:14.020 --> 54:14.980
What was that?

54:15.540 --> 54:16.260
It was God.

54:16.260 --> 54:16.760
God.

54:18.340 --> 54:21.460
Beck, did you see God while I was gone?

54:21.460 --> 54:25.220
Beck is just staring down into the church still, but he nods.

54:25.780 --> 54:26.500
Beck, what?

54:27.300 --> 54:28.100
Again?

54:28.100 --> 54:29.620
Beck, did you get it on camera?

54:29.620 --> 54:31.300
I got it on camera.

54:31.300 --> 54:32.740
I feel around for my camera.

54:33.540 --> 54:36.580
Well, your camera was placed back down next to you.

54:36.580 --> 54:41.700
And as we have determined in this game, when Beck is conscious, he is filming.

54:41.700 --> 54:43.860
So yes, you shot what you saw.

54:43.860 --> 54:44.420
Dope.

54:44.420 --> 54:44.820
Yeah.

54:44.820 --> 54:45.320
Yeah.

54:45.720 --> 54:46.220
Yeah.

54:46.840 --> 54:47.160
Dudes.

54:47.160 --> 54:47.800
Yeah, I got it.

54:47.800 --> 54:48.840
I think I got it, dudes.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.200
Show me.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.000
Show me God.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.040
Are we safe?

54:52.040 --> 54:52.680
Should we go?

54:53.720 --> 54:54.120
What?

54:54.120 --> 54:54.600
Fox?

54:54.600 --> 54:56.680
I mean, we're going to make you the mayor.

54:56.680 --> 54:57.800
How would that help?

54:57.800 --> 54:59.880
Stevie, you said that the mayor...

54:59.880 --> 55:01.720
He's already released.

55:01.720 --> 55:04.520
We'd have to do the whole thing to get him back in.

55:04.520 --> 55:05.080
I don't know.

55:05.080 --> 55:05.800
What's the whole thing?

55:05.800 --> 55:07.240
I don't know, but it was a...

55:07.240 --> 55:09.160
I don't know any of it.

55:09.160 --> 55:09.960
I don't know.

55:10.760 --> 55:12.120
Well, does Fox know?

55:12.120 --> 55:13.560
Know what, my good man?

55:13.560 --> 55:14.200
He doesn't.

55:14.840 --> 55:15.880
Where'd you come from, dude?

55:15.880 --> 55:17.480
Yeah, we're...

55:17.480 --> 55:23.240
Oh, I was just hanging out, giving my old record player the spins and just giving my

55:23.240 --> 55:28.360
hips a good loosening when old Julius popped in and suggested we do some AR while making

55:28.360 --> 55:29.960
me the new mayor for some reason.

55:29.960 --> 55:34.440
Or not even the new mayor, but just another backup, was it, behind Chuck Bidwell?

55:35.640 --> 55:36.840
What do you mean Julius showed up?

55:36.840 --> 55:39.160
He's been standing here by us this whole time.

55:39.160 --> 55:40.760
Yeah, I look at Cal.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.000
How long were we out, dude?

55:43.240 --> 55:44.840
Can both of you roll grip, please?

55:46.600 --> 55:47.800
Ooh, I pass.

55:48.920 --> 55:53.480
I'm getting older and sometimes I lose bits of time.

55:54.280 --> 55:56.680
I fail hard, a 97.

55:56.680 --> 56:00.520
Okay, so you're going to lose zero grip, Cal.

56:00.520 --> 56:04.040
However, Beck Wilder, you're going to roll a D4.

56:05.400 --> 56:06.120
It's a one.

56:06.120 --> 56:07.320
Okay, you only lose one grip.

56:08.600 --> 56:10.360
That brings me down to 51.

56:10.360 --> 56:13.160
Stevie, I panicked.

56:13.160 --> 56:19.160
I just thought that the thing had to be in the mayor and if we made someone the mayor,

56:19.720 --> 56:21.160
it would have to go back in.

56:21.720 --> 56:25.480
Okay, that seems right.

56:25.480 --> 56:26.520
Yeah, okay.

56:27.080 --> 56:28.920
How do we make him the mayor?

56:28.920 --> 56:30.360
That doesn't seem right to me.

56:32.760 --> 56:34.280
Well, this is Godel Gorge.

56:34.280 --> 56:40.120
I feel like you guys have, you know, can call Godel Law and make an emergency mandate.

56:40.360 --> 56:40.920
On God.

56:42.200 --> 56:42.920
On God.

56:42.920 --> 56:43.400
On God.

56:43.400 --> 56:43.960
On God.

56:43.960 --> 56:44.600
On God, dude.

56:45.560 --> 56:45.880
Okay.

56:46.440 --> 56:48.840
I'm not as confident as you, Julius.

56:48.840 --> 56:51.880
I'm not, but it's the only thing I could think of.

56:51.880 --> 56:57.640
I hereby, as the oldest Godel in Grover's Gorge.

56:57.640 --> 56:59.640
And Julius is like pointing at Fox.

56:59.640 --> 57:05.560
Declare Fox Godel as the mayor of Grover's Gorge.

57:05.560 --> 57:06.680
Why not you, Stevie?

57:06.680 --> 57:08.920
And as she finishes saying that.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.480
Stevie's older than Fox?

57:12.360 --> 57:13.240
Now she is.

57:13.240 --> 57:14.680
I don't think I caught that earlier.

57:14.680 --> 57:16.840
I was picturing her being the younger sister.

57:16.840 --> 57:18.360
I think I caught that.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Luke and Joe, take off your headphones real quick.

57:28.040 --> 57:28.440
Thomas.

57:30.040 --> 57:35.400
A wildly frenetic, wet energy.

57:36.680 --> 57:46.840
Comes flying out of the church, out of the giant canyon and into Fox Godel, throwing

57:46.840 --> 57:50.920
him backwards, back towards the plant wall.

57:52.360 --> 57:59.080
You can either ask me one question or three yes, no questions about what you see, what

57:59.080 --> 58:05.400
you smell, what you hear, what you feel as this thing kind of zips past you and you're

58:05.400 --> 58:09.400
trying to perceive it, but it's really hard.

58:09.400 --> 58:11.320
Almost like it's incomprehensible.

58:12.200 --> 58:13.480
Has everybody else done this?

58:14.360 --> 58:14.860
Yep.

58:16.280 --> 58:17.960
Did they ask good questions?

58:17.960 --> 58:18.460
Nope.

58:20.120 --> 58:20.680
Pressure's off.

58:22.520 --> 58:23.400
No, they did.

58:23.400 --> 58:24.440
What's its name?

58:24.440 --> 58:25.320
What's its name?

58:27.720 --> 58:34.600
Is that something that you could tell from its appearance or sound or feel or taste?

58:34.600 --> 58:36.840
You said I could ask you one question or three.

58:36.840 --> 58:38.600
About how you perceive it.

58:38.600 --> 58:39.160
Okay.

58:39.160 --> 58:40.120
It's a good question.

58:40.120 --> 58:40.840
What's your name?

58:45.320 --> 58:49.080
Three yes, no questions or one question.

58:50.040 --> 58:52.760
Would you tell me if I asked a question that's already been asked?

58:52.760 --> 58:53.000
Okay.

58:53.000 --> 58:53.960
What's it smell like?

58:54.600 --> 58:55.160
Wait, no.

58:55.160 --> 58:55.960
How do I kill it?

58:56.920 --> 58:58.840
That's also not something you can perceive.

58:59.800 --> 59:00.360
Why not?

59:00.600 --> 59:05.080
How do I kill?

59:05.080 --> 59:06.120
I want to kill God.

59:08.200 --> 59:10.760
Zach, what's a smart question to ask?

59:11.720 --> 59:12.600
I don't know, man.

59:13.160 --> 59:15.240
Well, then why'd you think of this game?

59:15.240 --> 59:16.120
I don't know.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.120
Hey, they came up with questions.

59:20.120 --> 59:20.620
Well.

59:25.160 --> 59:26.600
And that's the end of the episode.

59:27.960 --> 59:28.460
What?

59:31.160 --> 59:33.160
Okay, I'm sure they asked what it looked like.

59:33.720 --> 59:34.220
Did they?

59:35.400 --> 59:37.800
I've got intense decision paralysis here.

59:37.800 --> 59:39.560
I can't think of anything.

59:39.560 --> 59:40.680
Just go through the senses.

59:40.680 --> 59:41.160
I don't know.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.400
Well, they asked, look, what does it look like?

59:43.400 --> 59:45.240
I'm not going to tell you what they asked.

59:45.240 --> 59:46.120
I thought you said you would.

59:46.120 --> 59:49.000
If it had already been asked, you'd tell me to ask something.

59:49.000 --> 59:49.320
Okay.

59:49.320 --> 59:51.240
Luke asked me what it looks like, but okay.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.200
All I heard was I'm not going to tell you what they asked.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:07.800
Boys.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.640
If you can hear me sign to me, I know one of them.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.380
Okay.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.440
How big is it?

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.000
Great question.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.060
It is.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.440
Wait, is it bigger than a bread box?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:23.500
Yes.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:24.920
How big is it?

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.600
Oh my God.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.920
I can't think of three better questions or like two more questions.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.200
Just fucking tell me how big it is.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:41.480
It is like the amount of wet of an Olympic sized pool.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.160
Thousands of gallons of water?

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:43.660
Yes.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.200
Oh, much bigger than a bread box.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:54.200
Just pouring into and through Fox Gottel, lifting him off his feet.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.520
Higher and higher and throwing him over toward the plant wall.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.560
I need you to roll grip.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.680
Uh, pass again.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.480
19.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:03.880
Okay.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.000
You just lose one grip.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.280
Oh, well that breaks me.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.260
All right.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.440
Sorry about that.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.240
That was long.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.040
That was a workout.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.560
That was a long time rolling my ears.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.280
What'd you guys ask?

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:30.600
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:45.080
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.
