Hello and greetings my little wolf babies

00:03.960 --> 00:05.960

00:06.400 --> 00:14.720
Welcome to your crib that sits safely inside of my crib lay down and get ready to get swaddled

00:15.120 --> 00:22.920
Because auntie wolf is here to present yet another broadcast from the radio station known as six nine four point two

00:23.760 --> 00:24.680
PTBP

00:24.680 --> 00:30.280
Warm up the milk and scream to the heavens because we got a new howling with wolf

00:30.400 --> 00:33.120

00:33.720 --> 00:41.360

Eleanor writes, so I'm still recovering from a bad flu

00:54.560 --> 00:56.280
So my head's in a fog

00:56.280 --> 01:03.700
But I'd like to make a shout out for the state of Missouri and the fine people who seem to live there based on you

01:03.700 --> 01:11.380
Guys, and also people should follow me on Twitter for new fun updates on my projects and follow me on

01:11.720 --> 01:17.400
Instagram for butt stuff, but not actually butt stuff, but like vanity stuff

01:18.320 --> 01:22.160
IDK whatever you think is best wear a condom

01:22.680 --> 01:28.520
The state of Missouri more like the state of misery. Am I right ladies?

01:32.240 --> 01:37.200
Make sure y'all follow whom'st ever this human being is now Eleanor

01:37.200 --> 01:44.880
I don't know what following means or what the internet is or whom and Instagram is

01:45.200 --> 01:52.040
Now my producer usually handles all that stuff because I keep forgetting my AOL login

01:52.480 --> 01:58.740
Information if someone could email AOL for me and tell them that wolf is trying to get online

01:59.280 --> 02:01.960
That'd be great. And oh, thanks again

02:02.400 --> 02:08.160

The crew breaks down 10 minutes of audio that was cut from control copy

02:35.780 --> 02:41.960
Because Zach was embarrassed by his countless failures found within this is an episode about learning

02:42.540 --> 02:44.460
about growth and

02:44.460 --> 02:49.340
Mostly about laughing at Zach poor guy just gets torched in this one

02:49.640 --> 02:53.620
Probably has the most laughter of any single episode ever

02:53.780 --> 02:59.500
I actually cried a whole wolfy tear from chortling so god dang hard

02:59.820 --> 03:03.100
But now is not the time for tears in the blues

03:03.460 --> 03:07.140
No doubt it's time for cheers and the news

03:08.220 --> 03:14.340
Last time a paranoid. Dr. Rusty hooch tackled Jerome Dyer to the ground

03:14.980 --> 03:22.560
After some words the two agreed to join forces to wipe all the camera equipment of any evidence out in the van

03:22.980 --> 03:24.980
agent Doreen Maureen

03:25.280 --> 03:28.220
amputated her own foot to avoid an unspeakable

03:29.180 --> 03:36.660
Transformation she bled and bled and almost passed out on the stretcher in the back of the mobile lab while dr

03:36.660 --> 03:38.420
Olivia Miller

03:38.420 --> 03:43.000
Continually failed to find the supplies necessary to aid the situation

03:43.420 --> 03:47.900
Thankfully the Chuckster was there to throw Doreen's remove foot mid

03:48.560 --> 03:55.780
Transformation into the deep freeze rip his shirt off and properly bandage the surely fatal wound

03:56.580 --> 04:03.620
Alright dear listener, I'm taking next week off to get ready for another wild time change

04:03.740 --> 04:07.580

04:18.980 --> 04:20.980
Y'all best get excited

04:21.620 --> 04:26.980

04:29.600 --> 04:34.380
PTBP for its coming-out debut. It's an infant of a track

04:34.380 --> 04:42.320
It is indeed this bangers first rodeo for the last time. It's Molly Healy with circles

04:50.980 --> 04:52.980
Oh

05:20.980 --> 05:22.980
I

05:48.060 --> 05:50.060
Was seeing how many times I could do

05:50.980 --> 05:54.460
Ssippis sssippis sssippis sssippis

05:54.980 --> 05:59.460
so Zach and I were talking last night pillow pillow talking pillow talking and

06:01.260 --> 06:05.220
We were we were talking about the podcast and like the funny moments of it

06:11.540 --> 06:18.580
Yeah, he actually like if sometimes if it's like taking too long and I really try to get it done

06:18.580 --> 06:20.580
I just say like I whisper is here

06:32.340 --> 06:37.380
Him laughing in his in his hands right now means that it's kind of true probably

06:42.700 --> 06:47.060
But it was funny because never takes too long because I was like we were talking about the funny jokes

06:47.060 --> 06:53.500
I was like like when I said piss a sippy and then he was I think I said like piss a sippy and he said

06:53.500 --> 06:58.660
Yeah, that was funny when I made that joke and I was like Zach. I made that joke

06:59.820 --> 07:01.820
Like I spelled out

07:02.260 --> 07:08.960
Pissississippi and then you said piss a sippy and I'm like I was like we have to roll back the tape

07:10.060 --> 07:12.620
Almost immediately. She was like, let's go to the tape

07:13.220 --> 07:18.380
Which we didn't but because I thought Eleanor made that I thought it was Eleanor too

07:18.660 --> 07:25.620
She said yeah, she started that she started the joke train talking about pissing in the Mississippi. I just made the word

07:27.140 --> 07:32.420
This is the thing my my role is to serve and then you guys smash

07:36.020 --> 07:41.760
Just like in high school just like in high school you serve somebody else smashes

07:42.860 --> 07:45.140
Volleyball through fifth grade, so I'm really familiar with

07:53.060 --> 07:55.060
Similar to your dick

07:57.820 --> 07:59.820
Sorry, I

08:00.340 --> 08:01.960
Eleanor thank you for apologizing

08:01.960 --> 08:07.720
Well, I hate having this delay because it literally is me saying like similar to your dick and then one two three

08:08.560 --> 08:14.880
And I'm like kill me which is funny cuz now it's gonna be a delay of us making the joke of the delay laughs

08:16.040 --> 08:20.560
Exactly. That's exactly what I do and I want to right now, but it's fine. Oh

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
We really enjoy this too. Yes

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I

08:33.160 --> 08:41.440
Well, that's great though, I think I think you guys I'm curious to hear more about how you how you talk in bed, but

08:43.520 --> 08:49.880
Real question though, but now I forgot about it. Nevermind. All right, we're now out of combat order. Oh my god

08:49.960 --> 08:51.560
Let's start

08:51.560 --> 08:58.720
With a quick recap of where we ended maybe just some like nice shots. I'm not gonna lie

08:58.720 --> 09:04.520
I thought I just solved all the problems. Yeah, like like I thought the game is over like I fixed it

09:04.520 --> 09:09.720
Well, you do have a point that you have to take the Bigfoot corpse to also

09:09.720 --> 09:13.960
I wouldn't leave a boy's corpse or a Bigfoot foot or

09:14.960 --> 09:21.920
Technically two civilians who know that the unnatural exists. Oh, it's just cleanup. It's cleanup. This episode is cleanup

09:21.920 --> 09:24.160
Oh, that'll be so fun for everyone to listen to no

09:24.160 --> 09:30.520
No, but like I think I think what was a really cool thing that that happened because Chuck like dr. Miller

09:30.520 --> 09:35.960
She was fumbling like crazy, but then Chuck steps in Chuck like the most underrated character

09:39.800 --> 09:42.120
Everyone thinks he's a fucking dumbass, right?

09:43.960 --> 09:45.960
Hey

09:46.000 --> 09:48.800
I've gotten like attack emails to me

09:50.160 --> 09:52.160
associated with this monster, but

09:52.800 --> 09:59.160
He stepped up and freaking saved a day and I feel like we have to play that out because dr

09:59.160 --> 10:04.820
Miller, you know, she thought he was like a buffoon. Maybe I'll get a real purple heart now. Yeah

10:04.820 --> 10:08.720
What do you think from who the government giving you shit?

10:09.200 --> 10:13.680
The president it would be so funny if he's like this wasn't hard at all

10:13.960 --> 10:19.740
You know like this this this is your job that you needed an education for, you know, and she's just like, yeah

10:19.740 --> 10:21.740
He just like goes to medical school

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Dr. Cheese, okay

10:29.920 --> 10:37.600
Yeah, could I get like an honorary diploma or something to be a doctor they do that that's who are you asking the government

10:38.360 --> 10:45.480
The people with the money, dr. Miller is gonna seriously, dr. Miller is gonna step up and and kneel next to him and

10:46.400 --> 10:52.480
Put a hand on his shoulder to be like that was absolutely amazing Chuck or I shall call you Charles

10:52.480 --> 10:58.560
Yeah, I turned completely red and have a big smile on my face. Are you jealous during look at this attention?

10:58.560 --> 11:00.560
I'm getting from this other woman

11:01.640 --> 11:03.840
He's not a love interest of mine

11:03.840 --> 11:08.360
Yeah, but someone else is scratching behind my whippet ears and I'm liking it don't you

11:08.840 --> 11:14.880
Wait, when you said that the only thing that mattered to you is your whippet. I just assumed that that relationship was

11:19.960 --> 11:21.960
Yeah, it's a whippet

11:25.320 --> 11:27.320
We went there, huh

11:28.680 --> 11:30.680
Play with small town folk

11:30.680 --> 11:32.680
You

11:33.020 --> 11:36.120
Don't do that in Sweden, I don't I don't

11:40.200 --> 11:45.400
It's not a bestiality what's darker than BC we have to do something

11:47.760 --> 11:49.760
Okay, so you're having this moment with

11:50.560 --> 11:54.920
Charles now you've called him. Yeah, but I think also but then I on the target, right?

11:54.920 --> 11:59.060
So she's like we need to clean this up though, and we need to figure out what the hell is going on in there in

11:59.060 --> 12:04.020
The cabin. Hey Doreen. Are you going to be okay here? Yeah, do you need anything? Do you need anything like

12:05.820 --> 12:09.220
But I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna pull through water medicine

12:10.220 --> 12:13.940
Would be important. I connect my phone to the Bluetooth and play

12:14.700 --> 12:16.780
tick by big homie G

12:19.820 --> 12:21.820
Just cuz I think she might be bored

12:22.440 --> 12:28.180
Poor Dory might be a little bored. It starts playing through the dope surround sound system in the Sprinter van

12:28.540 --> 12:34.880
That's very important for a lab Doreen starts like kind of like dance in just a little bit. Yes as dr

12:34.880 --> 12:41.580
Miller is getting you some some pain medication. Yeah. Oh morphine. Yeah. Hell yeah, right. You feel good

12:43.980 --> 12:48.780
Zack is very familiar with morphine which also makes me a little nervous for the Zack

12:49.780 --> 12:53.080
Yeah, I I like morphine

12:53.080 --> 12:55.080
More

12:55.720 --> 12:59.400
He was very he was very like oh, oh, yeah, you feel great

12:59.400 --> 13:05.840
I'm never okay. You almost piss your pants as the warmth of a taff million thousand tiny angels

13:05.840 --> 13:12.040
Just like rushes through your bloodstream and you feel better than you've ever felt about anything in your entire life

13:12.040 --> 13:14.960
And I just like giggle a little bit. Yeah

13:15.680 --> 13:19.480
You're not sure whether you just pissed your pants, but you don't I don't care

13:20.480 --> 13:26.800
You're like little angel stop tickling me that's what she says I had surgery one time where I had to have morphine

13:26.800 --> 13:28.800
Oh, I'm not like an addict

13:31.280 --> 13:34.840
I fell through a plate glass window and almost died. It's no big deal. Jeez

13:36.080 --> 13:41.640
Yeah, I was there I had to call his parents to let them know they were four hours away and I was literally I lost

13:41.640 --> 13:47.380
a third of my blood before I made it on the operating table in which they then as they pulled out the 18 inch long piece

13:47.380 --> 13:49.380
Of glass that was stuck in my butt

13:49.460 --> 13:53.020
They hit another artery and I had to have a second blood transfusion

13:53.020 --> 13:58.500
Doctor told me I might not be able to ever walk again, but look at me now motherfuckers not walking not walking

14:03.620 --> 14:09.380
Yeah, that was like less than a year into our relationship and I had to help him pee into a bedpan

14:10.620 --> 14:16.220
So anyway, I knew that we it was real love. Yeah, it's either that or traveling together

14:16.260 --> 14:24.100
It's those two things like uh-huh. Yep bedpans and travel. Yes taking up dump or travel

14:25.000 --> 14:29.620
Yeah, I didn't I didn't help him take a dump. I pressed the nurse button for that

14:29.620 --> 14:33.620
Yeah, the nurse got to wipe me and I just remember I was so hopped up on drugs

14:33.620 --> 14:35.620
but I just kept looking at the nurse and being like

14:36.060 --> 14:38.060
Your job is so weird

14:39.860 --> 14:41.860
She's like I know

14:42.300 --> 14:47.500
Yeah, they don't pay nurses enough Allie inside of this cabin, dr

14:47.500 --> 14:51.340
Rusty Hooch and Jerome Dyer finishing up wiping all

14:52.060 --> 14:53.460
traces

14:53.460 --> 14:56.900
electronic or physical of both the corpse and

14:57.460 --> 15:03.540
The corpse so my last move I like opened up the door to look outside, right?

15:03.540 --> 15:10.780
Can I see like commotion going on out there? Yeah, you you can you can see the light coming out shining down onto the

15:11.660 --> 15:16.340
Freshly powdered ground behind the sprinter van as snow is falling

15:16.380 --> 15:21.040
I mean for a second you thought you heard it's the most wonderful time of the year

15:21.340 --> 15:24.180
but then it leans pretty hard into a

15:24.940 --> 15:26.420
file and

15:26.420 --> 15:27.740
rap

15:27.740 --> 15:29.740
music, okay

15:29.900 --> 15:33.260
So at this point cameras are wiped. I

15:34.140 --> 15:36.140
Know there's not much I can do

15:36.140 --> 15:38.140
I

15:40.980 --> 15:46.980
Was just trying to make the situation realistic that's what you've always been doing

15:48.820 --> 15:54.660
Sorry go ahead, okay cameras are wiped but someone needs to do something about the civilians

15:54.780 --> 15:59.300
So I decide I'm gonna go out to the van and try to switch places with Chuck

15:59.660 --> 16:05.740
Because he needs to take care of these bitches Oh agent dire you watch those two. I run out to the van

16:05.740 --> 16:10.420
He literally motions as you run out. He just motions to a sleeping Carl

16:13.060 --> 16:16.420
Like shrugs at the camera like fucking Jim Halpert

16:18.580 --> 16:26.460
Jack Jack I hop out and then I like give a rice smile and I say notice anything different about what?

16:26.460 --> 16:29.320
I noticed that you looked way uglier than last time I saw you

16:29.920 --> 16:31.920
Damn dude, I

16:32.360 --> 16:36.280
Take it in stride and I say girl. I know this is just your

16:37.040 --> 16:39.440
Insecurity is trying to come out for a boy

16:40.240 --> 16:42.840
Cuz you know that you want this duck

16:46.600 --> 16:52.360
Admit it I turn around and I just like hock a loogie onto the ground because that's the most disgusting thing

16:52.360 --> 16:57.140
I've ever slowly melts into the snow who to know you're softening towards me

16:59.360 --> 17:05.680
And then I do like I do the thing we're like you squeeze one peck at a time and they kind of bounce oh

17:06.480 --> 17:08.480
I become straight

17:13.840 --> 17:16.400
Zero percent in straightness. Sorry

17:19.240 --> 17:22.200
Chuck I don't know what the fuck is going on, but we've got two civilians inside

17:22.200 --> 17:24.680
I've destroyed all the evidence but we've got to get rid of them

17:24.680 --> 17:28.120
Can I can you go inside and take care of that and while while I'm talking to her?

17:28.120 --> 17:31.080
I'm looking over and noticing that Doreen is missing a foot

17:32.480 --> 17:34.480
And I pull a foot out of my

17:36.640 --> 17:42.720
What no, I don't think I roll pull foot out of trench coat, nope, sorry have a zero percent and pull for

17:44.800 --> 17:46.800
Oh y'all need a foot

17:47.240 --> 17:52.880
Dr. Miller would like to go back into the cabin as well if Doreen is stable enough during how do you feel?

17:52.880 --> 17:57.840
I think I can hop because I feel so good from the morphine. I think hopping is gonna be very doable

17:58.120 --> 18:04.960
I can hop. All right, I figured it out girl. I put the foot in the deep freeze

18:05.840 --> 18:10.440
Do not touch it unless you want to use or is it in something? It's loose

18:10.440 --> 18:16.400
Okay, cool. You put a loose foot in the deep freeze. Wait, I didn't did did you get in contact with it?

18:17.100 --> 18:19.100
Probably. Yeah

18:19.200 --> 18:24.240
That bad. Dr. Miller is gonna give dr. Hooch a long meaningful look

18:24.240 --> 18:27.240
Did I do that?

18:28.840 --> 18:34.880
Chuck stayed stay right where you are sit on the ground. Don't move a fucking muscle is Chuck still in their hazmat suit

18:34.880 --> 18:39.800
He's hazmat suit. Yeah, I think everybody is well, I ripped my shirt off. Oh, that's right

18:39.800 --> 18:44.960
You must have ripped the hazmat. So you've got he's shirtless and has the hazmat tied around his waist

18:46.000 --> 18:51.040
Great, so he's got the pants of the hazmat. I have the head part on how it's

18:51.520 --> 18:58.920
Detaches, but let it be known when he grabbed the foot and put it in the deep freeze. He had his hazmat suit

18:58.920 --> 19:02.120
Oh, he was wearing gloves. Yeah, we always forget about the hazmat suit

19:03.760 --> 19:08.440
And the hazmat suit. Okay, if you didn't touch it with your bare skin, I'm not worried about it

19:08.440 --> 19:14.420
Okay, it's in the deep freeze if we try to kill it that little alien bugs gonna come out again

19:14.640 --> 19:19.240
So I say we just leave it there forever. I think I've got a fucking get rid of this deep freeze

19:19.480 --> 19:21.480
Isn't there isn't there a delta green

19:22.160 --> 19:29.080
Situation here where we can call upon them or something that to extract you literally have a point like a GPS

19:29.360 --> 19:35.080
Location in each of your phones for a drop-off warehouse where you're going to bring this body

19:35.080 --> 19:38.480
It would be also a great place to bring a foot. Yeah. Yes

19:38.480 --> 19:40.480
It might also be a good place to bring

19:40.480 --> 19:45.640
The civilians you think if you don't want to have to deal with that aspect of it

19:45.960 --> 19:52.040
Although they might get angry at you at the warehouse if you haven't cleaned up everything before you get there. Yeah

19:52.040 --> 19:57.840
Well, I think dr. Miller is gonna I think she's gonna suggest that that's exactly what they do of like cleaning up everything

19:57.920 --> 19:59.920
trying to get the body into a

20:00.560 --> 20:07.880
Secure sort of body bag and then she's gonna try to talk to Carl and Ruth as they wake up

20:08.720 --> 20:10.720
Listen, you've been through a lot

20:10.800 --> 20:14.360
We understand that this must be extremely traumatic. There are help

20:14.400 --> 20:17.280
I mean and she's gonna lie because she doesn't know if there's help

20:18.000 --> 20:22.400
She's got there's help for you waiting and we're gonna be taking care of you

20:22.720 --> 20:28.720
I suggest that you don't tell anyone what you've seen here and what you've done here

20:28.840 --> 20:36.120
But before you talk to your legal counsel, and she knows that there's probably nothing waiting for these people. She's lying

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Because that's her job

20:40.000 --> 20:40.760
Yeah, no

20:40.760 --> 20:42.000
I think I think

20:42.000 --> 20:48.400
Honestly, I'm not gonna have you roll cuz with everything that's happened so far and Jerome is is there and he's known these people for

20:48.400 --> 20:50.400
Three years they trust him

20:50.880 --> 20:54.840
They don't know what the fuck is going on. So they're very confused

20:55.640 --> 21:00.460
We could have a quick montage of the cleanup of the site

21:00.560 --> 21:08.600
You grab a body bag from the sprinter van kind of fold the tarp over the pool table over this boy's corpse

21:08.720 --> 21:12.960
And gently lift it with all of its blood and everything dripping

21:13.400 --> 21:18.880
Into this body bag and you can kind of get it in there seal it up and you can take that out

21:19.160 --> 21:23.120
And get it on the stretcher in the back of this this sprinter van

21:23.120 --> 21:28.540
I feel like typically there's a song that plays during a montage and I just want for the for the listeners out there to

21:28.720 --> 21:31.200
Kind of have something in mind. Yeah, what do you think?

21:31.200 --> 21:34.960
It is the only song that's popping up in my head right now is the what I want you

21:39.320 --> 21:42.080
The candle the candle

21:43.760 --> 21:47.680
I think yeah, it feels appropriate. Yeah

21:49.440 --> 21:53.120
As we as we package away the dead child exactly

21:54.680 --> 22:01.080
Dreams come true plays. Well, it's how it's how Doreen marine feels about Chuck now

22:02.480 --> 22:05.120
it's actually only playing in her head the rest of us are like

22:09.080 --> 22:16.000
When it's a montage from her perspective, it's that song playing and for everyone else it's like a fucking funeral dirge

22:21.000 --> 22:26.520
Marina's just like smiling so big the whole time. Everybody's just so distraught and she's just like

22:28.460 --> 22:31.640
Bopping to an invisible tune invisible. Yeah

22:31.640 --> 22:33.400
Okay

22:33.400 --> 22:40.280
Okay, so I can have Jerome I'm Jerome fuck it's been a long day

22:40.280 --> 22:47.320
I can have Carl and in Janus if you guys want to ride with me and then I'll follow you

22:47.320 --> 22:50.120
You said there's a place that we can go. Do you have a

22:50.640 --> 22:53.840
Day of location. How about I ride with you Jerome? And then

22:54.400 --> 22:57.320
Yes, we have the coordinates Chuck will drive the other car

22:57.320 --> 23:02.620
I got it. Doreen is like so happy and she knows she drove on the way here and still has her right foot

23:03.760 --> 23:05.360
Was it my right foot?

23:05.360 --> 23:12.240
It was your left foot. Of course if you drive with your right foot. Yeah. Yeah, and so I like try to fight Chuck on driving

23:13.080 --> 23:14.760
Come on

23:14.760 --> 23:16.760
Well, that wouldn't be my voice

23:16.760 --> 23:18.760
I

23:24.160 --> 23:29.400
Messed with this hair. I immediately can see didn't say, okay

23:34.120 --> 23:39.880
Amazing like I said, I'm going in the other car like tight tight tight. You got this. I trust you

23:40.240 --> 23:42.240
Rusty who'd you letting this happen? I?

23:43.840 --> 23:45.200
Damn

23:45.200 --> 23:47.200
Yeah, I'm gonna let you drive bitch

23:49.280 --> 23:51.280
Cuz I got him I gotta watch the foot

23:53.960 --> 23:55.960
Guys pack up

23:56.040 --> 24:00.740
Everything any evidence you've cleaned up. I need whoever who has the highest forensics

24:01.560 --> 24:03.560
20 40

24:03.560 --> 24:05.560
50 okay, so

24:05.680 --> 24:12.680
You're gonna let the girl and morphine do our forensic check. You would actually have a negative 20 on this much morphine

24:12.680 --> 24:17.740
So it's 30. So who had the 40? Okay. So yeah, and that makes sense. She's been cleaning up

24:17.740 --> 24:26.060
Anyway, that was like her whole situation inside this this this little cabin shack thing lean to a huge lean to with the toilet

24:27.080 --> 24:30.200
Can you can you roll forensics for me?

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
Just to make sure you don't miss anything

24:33.960 --> 24:35.760
And

24:35.760 --> 24:43.440
Do you want I am 91 you nailed it you wait what you are positive that you cleaned it this side up perfectly

24:43.440 --> 24:47.480
And so you guys are going to head on out

24:50.680 --> 24:52.560
It's a lovely

24:52.560 --> 24:54.440
lovely January night

24:54.440 --> 24:59.680
wind is whipping up the snow into a bit of a frenzy and

25:00.080 --> 25:06.400
It is just biting your noses as you pack up everything into the sprinter van and

25:07.440 --> 25:12.880
into one of the trucks that is on this site Jerome's truck is here and

25:13.720 --> 25:15.720
They're gonna hop into that one. You see a

25:16.360 --> 25:19.600
Older and like lifted and souped up

25:19.600 --> 25:25.800
It says bush on the side of it with a bullet hole for the period after each letter

25:26.080 --> 25:28.080
You're pretty sure that one's Carl's

25:28.080 --> 25:35.180
Yeah, Jerome's just got a nice like f-250 or something like that with four doors. So it's got the extended

25:35.180 --> 25:39.580
I don't know why I'm getting so into these fucking trucks. It doesn't matter you get into the trucks

25:40.440 --> 25:43.080
You get into the truck. Dr. Miller with

25:43.500 --> 25:50.600
Jerome driving and you've got Carl and Janice in the backseat kind of smushed together in the backseat and

25:51.440 --> 25:52.360
And

25:52.360 --> 25:57.280
We're gonna leave this fucking horrible mess of a site

25:58.120 --> 26:00.200
Yeah, it's just memes guys. So

26:01.920 --> 26:06.520
You drive down the long gravel driveway to get out

26:06.880 --> 26:13.860
Jerome hits a like a garage door opener that opens the gate for the sprinter van that's in the lead and

26:14.280 --> 26:18.420
Doreen puts her one good foot to the pedal

26:21.120 --> 26:26.280
And turns onto the road following the GPS coordinates

26:26.800 --> 26:30.320
which is much easier now that Jerome Dyer has

26:30.840 --> 26:36.980
Kind of released the cellular grip that he had on this area. And so you all have full bars again

26:37.720 --> 26:40.480
obviously, dr. Hooch's phone starts blowing up and

26:41.480 --> 26:46.240
Doreen is driving. Is anyone sitting shotgun or the two of you just in the back?

26:46.400 --> 26:50.360
I'm in the back next to the fridge. I'm next to Doreen just cuz I

26:50.800 --> 26:53.800
I'm never gonna say no to her but I do think it's smart to

26:54.560 --> 26:57.560
Check out the road as we go. I think that's really smart

26:59.520 --> 27:04.280
Yes, and so everything seems to be going smoothly

27:05.760 --> 27:11.000
Doreen and the Chuckster are getting along like fucking gangbusters

27:11.000 --> 27:16.920
Like y'all are just like especially in Doreen's loosened lucid lucidity

27:17.720 --> 27:23.880
especially after the release of all of these endorphins that you've just had Doreen it sort of seems like this is a

27:24.440 --> 27:28.920
Party and then I pull out a beer and I'm like, I'm catching up and then I crack it

27:30.480 --> 27:34.400
Cuz I want to be on her level while you're monitoring her driving, that's right

27:34.400 --> 27:39.320
I just remember that she has refrigerated pants and I have unrefrigerated

27:39.520 --> 27:44.120
Mentos in my pockets and I think about how much I like those nice cold Mentos and I asked I

27:45.000 --> 27:50.140
Asked Chuck if he will store my loose Mentos in his refrigerated pockets, please

27:50.360 --> 27:54.400
Yeah, we could do that, but it could probably get a lot pulled a lot faster in the deep freeze

27:57.840 --> 28:02.580
Just a thought Maureen may feel really nice good, but she's not

28:03.240 --> 28:04.880
at that

28:04.880 --> 28:08.040
Sentence the camera pans back through to see dr

28:08.040 --> 28:14.360
Rusty hooch just like staring at this deep freeze and we see this body bag is sitting on the stretcher

28:14.640 --> 28:22.840
Okay, I'm in the back. I'm here Doreen and Chuck being idiots up in the front drinking on the way to the drop-off. I

28:23.480 --> 28:29.640
Immediately realized that I don't trust them. I don't trust that they inspected this foot. So I open up the freezer

28:29.640 --> 28:39.400
The camera pans into the freezer and out through the back of the sprinter van

28:40.120 --> 28:44.840
onto the windshield of the truck driving behind and we see Jerome Dyer and

28:45.800 --> 28:49.240
Dr. Miller having a conversation in the front

28:50.240 --> 28:56.760
Though it is silent for some time. I would assume in this truck before Jerome's finally like

28:57.760 --> 29:02.320
That was weird it always tend to be I'd almost forgotten

29:05.200 --> 29:08.840
It's kind of it's been a nice break, right

29:09.880 --> 29:11.480
Where are you from?

29:11.480 --> 29:17.880
Fort Worth, how did you get in with these people? Like, you know better. I believed Carl

29:18.760 --> 29:26.960
The camera you Jerome reaches for the rearview mirror and adjusts it to see Carl with his head like slung back

29:35.600 --> 29:39.520
Still just knocked out cold because Ali hasn't snapped your fingers yet

29:39.520 --> 29:41.520
I

29:45.080 --> 29:52.120
Just trusted him I believed his story and I knew that they were onto something and I knew that I needed to be here

29:53.400 --> 29:55.400
for when it happened and

29:55.960 --> 30:02.400
Janice is in the backseat. Just like fuck. Are you guys talking about nothing, honey? Nothing you have to worry about

30:03.520 --> 30:05.520
Here have one of these and she picks out

30:06.200 --> 30:11.160
Some sort of pill that will make her probably at least try to cool her nerves

30:11.480 --> 30:19.000
Not as strong as the whatever potion that pooch made but something that to just have her not listening on us and calm down

30:19.200 --> 30:21.200
Okay, so after a bit longer

30:21.720 --> 30:23.520
silence in the car

30:23.520 --> 30:27.360
You look back Janice is like over with her head on

30:28.040 --> 30:29.640
Carl's shoulder

30:29.640 --> 30:33.360
Janice Ruth with the most like deviated septum of all time

30:35.680 --> 30:39.920
And Carl Lambert's king of the loogie

30:45.640 --> 30:50.320
Dr. Miller is gonna continue to talk to Jerome. I mean you weren't that far off

30:50.840 --> 30:55.440
It's just that it never is, you know, it's never it's never religion behind it

30:55.440 --> 31:01.180
It's never you know, one of these stories. It's just stories that people come up with to explain whatever it is, but

31:01.920 --> 31:03.920
The truth is always darker. I found

31:05.760 --> 31:11.960
Yeah, I suppose you wouldn't believe that one day you find out or hear about like a man big fat man

31:11.960 --> 31:17.680
We're dressed in red. You wouldn't assume that it's Santa. It's always, you know some alien or some

31:18.200 --> 31:22.760
Disgusting pedophile or whatever. I know. Okay, maybe not that but are we saying that Santa's

31:25.760 --> 31:27.760
She's gonna be like

31:28.320 --> 31:30.320
It's always worse

31:30.320 --> 31:32.320
Oh

31:33.480 --> 31:38.120
Just looks at you with a confused look and we are gonna have a

31:38.600 --> 31:43.120
Drive check from Doreen marine. Oh at a negative 20

31:44.400 --> 31:46.600
For being hopped up on morphine

31:54.040 --> 31:57.340
92 wait. Yeah 92. Yeah 92

32:00.320 --> 32:02.320
Oh

32:02.360 --> 32:04.360
No

32:06.560 --> 32:11.540
Fucking pigs. Hey, it's good. You're an actual. Okay, wait

32:13.200 --> 32:18.960
It's cool. It's cool. It's cool Doreen. Do you have your FBI agent?

32:21.000 --> 32:28.320
Doreen puts her hand in the back pocket where she usually keeps her firearms and pulls out her wallet and it's filled with loosement

32:28.320 --> 32:30.320
And identification

32:34.880 --> 32:41.080
She grabs a loose mentos and sticks them in Chuck's pocket or in my mouth to make me not talk

32:43.920 --> 32:47.760
Dr. Miller you and Jerome Dyer see this as well and

32:48.360 --> 32:51.760
This cop car is about to make a move

32:52.200 --> 32:56.640
You're on a two-lane country road again these trees

32:57.040 --> 33:02.500
Connecting over the top build the canopy to the moonlight to just kind of like

33:02.720 --> 33:05.600
Hit you every once in a while as you're driving just like

33:07.600 --> 33:13.320
Almost like the lights was you're driving through a tunnel, but it's the moonlight through this tunnel of trees. Oh

33:13.920 --> 33:15.920
Oh

33:21.520 --> 33:25.220
You you are the first to notice and this cop is about to

33:25.560 --> 33:30.760
Pass you on this two-lane road to get in between you and the and the sprinter man

33:31.760 --> 33:35.760
Shit shit shit shit shit shit. Play it cool. Play it cool

33:36.120 --> 33:42.720
We have we have our papers in order, you know the protocol so as Jerome begins to kind of

33:43.320 --> 33:48.480
slow down and pull over onto the side of the road the cop car just continues on past and

33:49.000 --> 33:53.960
Is right behind the sprinter van with its lights on siren going?

33:54.560 --> 33:58.480
Doreen pulls over we're good. We're ready Chuck. Shut the fuck up

33:58.480 --> 34:05.360
Don't say a fucking word as you pull over you see the truck just fucking fly by you as Jerome Dyer continues past

34:05.640 --> 34:11.800
Hey, hey Jerome, what the fuck? Well, you said be cool. I know he wasn't pulling me over. Should I pull over now?

34:11.800 --> 34:17.960
Yeah, okay. Okay. Sorry. Sorry shit. The mission is back there. Like do you think those three dumbass is gonna be able to

34:18.680 --> 34:25.480
So as you're saying that he's like and he pulls over so now the sprinter van is like shining its lights

34:26.440 --> 34:31.880
You see the truck that Jerome Dyer's driving pulled over in the distance ahead of you

34:32.340 --> 34:34.340
Cop is behind you lights on

34:34.520 --> 34:39.000
Sprinter vans pulled over cop gets out of the car as he walks up

34:39.680 --> 34:41.680
Around the back of the sprinter van

34:42.000 --> 34:50.100
he gives it a weird like hand tap on the back like they always do it's like they'd have to touch your car as they

34:50.100 --> 34:52.100
approach it and

34:52.640 --> 34:59.400
He knocks on the window Dorian rolls down the window and she says howdy officer, how's it going tonight on his chest?

34:59.400 --> 35:01.400
It says officer

35:01.720 --> 35:03.400

35:03.400 --> 35:10.480
Shout out to Jesse Mowry, Jesse Mowry, Jesse Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Jesse Mowry

35:10.960 --> 35:12.600

35:12.600 --> 35:20.160
Patron who created Steve McGovern who is basically Dale Gribble with a beard Dale Gribble being the Dale

35:20.160 --> 35:22.160
man from King of the Hill

35:22.800 --> 35:26.960
So this is him with a beard and this is Steve McGovern

35:28.080 --> 35:33.240
Thanks, Jesse. Thanks for being a patron at least the $10 level. That's dope. Thanks for making see McGovern

35:33.880 --> 35:36.060
Let's dive into Steven government. He is like

35:37.600 --> 35:39.600
licensing registration

35:39.640 --> 35:47.600
Doreen pulls out her wallet and shows license registration along with her her federal identification and card. Hmm

35:50.320 --> 35:52.320
I'll be right back

35:52.640 --> 35:57.920
And he goes back and sits in the cop car through my mouth of Mentos

35:58.080 --> 35:59.080
I go

35:59.080 --> 36:04.240
And then I give her a high-five y'all we need a plan B. I don't I don't feel right about this

36:04.240 --> 36:09.200
I think we need to play it cool for now, but I I'm also feeling a little a little shaky about it

36:09.200 --> 36:13.920
All right, he opens this back door. I can't promise I won't shoot him in the face. I think that's fair

36:13.920 --> 36:17.440
I think it's fair to I don't know. I don't see another way out of here

36:18.080 --> 36:19.680
after a while

36:19.680 --> 36:21.840
You notice a second

36:22.640 --> 36:24.640
Cop car pulls up behind his

36:24.760 --> 36:26.120
Fuck

36:26.120 --> 36:29.080
I'm actually getting a little anxious. He gets out of the car as

36:30.120 --> 36:31.760
does the

36:31.760 --> 36:38.700
Backup and they talk for a second the guy who is in backup mode goes and gets back in his car

36:39.960 --> 36:41.760
Car stays put

36:41.760 --> 36:48.800
Officer McGovern comes back up to the window. He hands you back your identification. You know anything about

36:50.680 --> 36:53.560
Shotgun being fired woods

36:54.680 --> 37:00.640
No, sorry officer. I don't I don't know anything about that. He shines a light in your eyes

37:01.360 --> 37:09.680
Ma'am, I I know that you're a federal agent. But are you under the influence right now? I don't believe I understand your question, sir. I

37:11.720 --> 37:13.720
Need you to roll law

37:16.600 --> 37:19.620
She's also bleeding from a leg

37:19.620 --> 37:23.660
Yeah, he can't see that yet

37:32.020 --> 37:34.020
Lindsay have you passed a single role?

37:38.140 --> 37:45.820
That's a 51 on a 30 51 on a 30 is not gonna do it ma'am. Will you step out car real quick?

37:45.820 --> 37:47.820
Dorian

37:49.580 --> 37:56.100
Turns and gives a shoots a quick look at rusty huge and

38:00.140 --> 38:02.420
Slowly with a big smile

38:05.200 --> 38:08.740
Opens the door and swings out

38:08.740 --> 38:10.740
That

38:11.740 --> 38:13.740
T-shirt tied nub

38:14.340 --> 38:16.340
And hops down

38:16.900 --> 38:18.380
to the ground

38:18.380 --> 38:25.860
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened? Did you shoot your foot off? What kind of a stupid-ass question is that?

38:25.860 --> 38:27.860
No, I did not shoot

38:28.260 --> 38:32.780
Here, I'm here looking for people who may have been oh

38:32.780 --> 38:36.960
I don't know firing shotguns in the woods and here you are

38:37.600 --> 38:44.320
Missing a foot I got attacked by a bear in the woods if you need to really know you're rusty

38:44.320 --> 38:46.320
You want to make us a potion?

38:46.560 --> 38:53.280
Okay, can I climb over the middle console and jump in the driver's seat and grab dr. Miller?

38:53.280 --> 38:59.480
You are like turned around looking at this situation and you see dr.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.480
Hooch like climbing over

39:01.480 --> 39:03.480
The

39:03.600 --> 39:07.320
Chuckster in the front seat after Doreen has gotten out

39:07.880 --> 39:12.400
Would I realize that they're planning on killing the cops? I have no idea

39:13.400 --> 39:16.100
I wouldn't have thought they were gonna kill the cop. I don't know

39:17.400 --> 39:24.480
No, I'm not saying I'm I'm not saying I'm killing the cop. I jump in the driver's seat and grab Doreen and drive away

39:24.880 --> 39:26.880
Yeah, she's trying

39:27.720 --> 39:30.320
So we're escaping the cops instead

39:31.800 --> 39:35.920
I don't know if I'm strong enough to do that, but I feel like I could that fucking rules

39:36.520 --> 39:39.120
Let's find out what happens with dice rolling

39:40.960 --> 39:47.040
You you dr. Hooch, yeah as you climb into the driver's seat of the sprinter van

39:47.400 --> 39:49.680
Also, I've forgotten to close the freezer door

39:53.600 --> 39:55.600
My anxiety

39:55.600 --> 40:01.020
I was in a panic clearly. I need either I think athletics

40:01.480 --> 40:03.160
or

40:03.160 --> 40:05.160
strength in order to

40:06.320 --> 40:14.360
Grab and hold on to Doreen as you want to like punch it out of here. Okay, I'll roll on athletics or on strength

40:15.360 --> 40:20.920
Being the person that she's grabbing. Can I also roll to see how I don't know Lindsey. You're a your track record

40:21.580 --> 40:25.400
Okay, you're gonna roll alertness of a negative 20 for being on morphine

40:25.400 --> 40:30.800
But if you know if you can sense what's happening, then you're gonna give her a plus 20 nice

40:32.480 --> 40:34.480
Thing he's crossed

40:35.880 --> 40:39.160
God damn it. She rolled a fucking 97. I

40:40.040 --> 40:46.120
Hate these die. So I'm just rolling on my you're just rolling on athletics or strength. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna roll on string

40:47.600 --> 40:50.720
Three on a 50 that's good you grab

40:51.200 --> 40:56.800
Doreen marine and you pull her up to where she can at least get one foot on that like step

40:56.840 --> 41:00.160
Part to get up into the sprinter van. Is it her foot or nub? Oh

41:01.080 --> 41:04.760
It would be my foot because it's my right foot is the one I still have nice

41:05.040 --> 41:12.220
Your foot plants on to that as she grabs on to you and you fucking punch it immediately that backup cop just

41:13.440 --> 41:17.240
Sirens blaring again and you see officer Steve McGovern

41:17.720 --> 41:20.880
sprints back to get into his police car and

41:21.600 --> 41:28.760
The game is now afoot. Once again, Jerome Dyer is in the car with dr. Olivia Miller and he's like, what do I do?

41:28.760 --> 41:33.520
What do I do? What do I do? We have to I guess we're driving we have now

41:35.000 --> 41:38.600
Unbelievable drive just drive. All right, or actually

41:39.880 --> 41:44.680
We could block them. We could block the cops give the other team a chance

41:44.680 --> 41:50.800
I love that and the sprinter van drives past you on the road and Jerome just like

41:51.320 --> 41:52.360
Sploosh

41:52.360 --> 41:57.400
Slams on the gas the wheels start turning on this truck as the back end just whips around

41:57.800 --> 42:00.120
grabs hold of the ditch and just

42:01.080 --> 42:08.440
Kind of flings itself up onto right in the middle of this two-lane country road as the cops begin to drive up

42:08.800 --> 42:14.400
he rolled a 26 on his drive against fail on the cop the cop just

42:14.800 --> 42:18.700
Cannot get through on in time and literally just stops in the road

42:18.780 --> 42:21.540
You are looking past Jerome Dyer and

42:22.340 --> 42:29.320
Through the driver's side window. You can see this cop. It's headlights shining directly in on this truck

42:29.320 --> 42:34.280
You have two asleep people in the back and his sirens are going and the other cop is

42:34.540 --> 42:39.780
Driving down into the ditch to get around you. Dr. Miller. What do I do? What do I do? Fuck?

42:40.300 --> 42:42.580
He rolls down the window and he's just like sorry

42:42.980 --> 42:44.740
Sorry, sorry

42:44.740 --> 42:50.900
Drive drive block the other one as well and just fumble like we pretend that we're making a mistake here, you know

42:50.900 --> 42:52.900
like continue, okay, so he's

42:55.140 --> 42:58.960
Fucking 22. Yes. Okay with it

43:00.300 --> 43:05.300
With a 22 he he's like you're brilliant. You're brilliant. I'm an idiot

43:05.300 --> 43:11.320
We're fumbling and he's just like doing that like Austin Powers like reverse for

43:12.160 --> 43:13.280
Reverse for sorry

43:13.280 --> 43:18.960
I'm not used to a stick shift leaning out the side of the window as he just continues to block one

43:18.960 --> 43:23.760
And then the other one starts to go and he blocks that one and then he goes back the other way and he's like, sorry

43:24.120 --> 43:26.120
Sorry. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry

43:26.680 --> 43:28.680
Perfect. It's perfect

43:33.640 --> 43:38.800
You're right everything up to this point has been really we've been making perfect sense up until now

43:41.640 --> 43:43.640
Oh my god

43:46.520 --> 43:53.760
With a critical success, I'm not gonna have them get like super angry or like too upset there they buy the whole

43:56.680 --> 43:58.680
They're like honest mistake

43:59.280 --> 44:05.480
Well, honestly Jerome Jerome Dyer looks like a nerd and these two Arkansas cops are just like wow

44:05.880 --> 44:09.560
This fucking idiot cannot drive this truck

44:09.800 --> 44:16.960
He honestly doesn't even deserve to be driving that f-250 that thing is a nice machine and I just don't understand how

44:17.500 --> 44:19.500
You know someone like diet

44:20.360 --> 44:25.760
They and with that I'm gonna need one more drive check from

44:26.520 --> 44:33.360
dr. Hooch, so I've pulled Doreen into my lap at this point. Mm-hmm and

44:34.240 --> 44:39.440
Shut the door, so I'm driving with Doreen on my lap as fast as I can

44:39.920 --> 44:44.280
Uh-huh. I like the thing Chuck. Do you want to pull the rain off? I

44:45.440 --> 44:47.440
Mean not like that. Do you want to?

44:49.840 --> 44:53.220
Do you wanna get Maria I would love to get her off. Yeah

44:55.040 --> 45:01.120
Off of the driver dr. Hooch and dr. Hooch as you're driving on these long winding country roads

45:01.480 --> 45:07.600
You're gonna need to make a drive check to get away clean if you can pass a drive

45:08.000 --> 45:13.120
I'm gonna say at a plus 20 because of the extreme effort of

45:13.720 --> 45:16.960
Jerome Dyer and dr. Miller if you can pass

45:17.600 --> 45:22.520
This then you will get away Scott free shit. All right, I'm rolling on a 40

45:23.640 --> 45:25.640
Are you so nervous? Yeah

45:27.200 --> 45:30.380
Damn it 96. This is not a crit

45:31.240 --> 45:33.240
sacletus go

45:33.520 --> 45:37.320
Maybe like we still make it we just run over like a rabbit or something

45:41.160 --> 45:47.400
It's a rabbit someone has to be something has to be sacrificed. Oh, no, no, no, sorry, that's my bad. You make it

45:47.400 --> 45:49.400
Yeah, of course

45:50.200 --> 45:56.840
Excellent, we're we're rabbits. We're any rabbits harmed. No big deal drive. No deal whatsoever. Uh

45:57.680 --> 46:04.880
Yeah, for sure no doubt no doubt no doubt no doubt I eventually Jerome Dyer

46:06.960 --> 46:15.000
After just apologizing his ass off these cops head past you move on and he looks at dr. Miller and he's like

46:15.760 --> 46:17.760
staples

46:17.920 --> 46:23.440
Where are we where we head? Well, hopefully we've given them enough time to get to the coordinates

46:23.760 --> 46:30.080
We should head over there as well. Yeah for sure. Okay. So, um, you did well well done Jerome. Oh, thank you

46:30.320 --> 46:32.320
Thank you. Your team is

46:33.080 --> 46:38.880
Wild. Yeah, have you worked with him before I have not and I never will again

46:42.080 --> 46:44.080
Cut to

46:46.160 --> 46:50.480
No, it's fine you don't have to work with us it's just cut to Christmas

46:53.480 --> 46:54.600
And

46:54.600 --> 47:02.480
Doreen and Chuck and the whippet are all wearing matching Christmas sweaters and zooming with with rusty and dr

47:02.480 --> 47:04.200
Miller and

47:04.200 --> 47:06.000
What song was playing?

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
white Christmas

47:12.640 --> 47:17.600
Over the radio not yet. So you guys are driving to your drop-off point

47:17.960 --> 47:21.040
It's like I gave it such a nice little bowtie at the end

47:23.440 --> 47:26.920
You're right the sprinter van and the truck with

47:27.960 --> 47:31.800
Jerome and dr. Miller Carl Lambert and Janice Ruth

47:32.800 --> 47:34.400
both arrive

47:34.400 --> 47:39.360
down in this warehouse district in a small town in Arkansas as

47:40.320 --> 47:46.440
a huge warehouse door and the pin that is dropped on each of your clean phones

47:47.280 --> 47:49.740
with cases on them

47:50.460 --> 47:54.520
Allie I actually saw dr. Hooch take hers off and throw it out the window

48:00.140 --> 48:02.540
You guys arrive at roughly the same time and

48:03.300 --> 48:07.260
The pin is inside this one specific warehouse

48:07.860 --> 48:15.200
It's got a normal door next to one of those like enormous like corrugated metal doors that can open up for like

48:15.340 --> 48:18.560
You know a sprinter van to drive through it or something like that

48:19.480 --> 48:21.360
When you guys arrive

48:21.360 --> 48:22.480
the

48:22.480 --> 48:28.520
Large door begins to roll up and inside you just see like bright lights

48:29.160 --> 48:33.800
Shining out so that you can't really see into the darkness inside this warehouse

48:34.480 --> 48:36.360
Sprinter van drives in

48:36.360 --> 48:38.360
red truck drives in

48:39.160 --> 48:40.760
As

48:40.760 --> 48:46.680
The doors close you see a single police car pulling up

48:48.560 --> 48:53.460
There are two men in this warehouse that is

48:54.040 --> 48:57.920
Blocked off to where you can't really see what's going on in the back of the warehouse

48:57.920 --> 48:59.920
There's some makeshift walls up front

49:00.280 --> 49:07.760
Just kind of like dividers and they're the only two people on this side of the dividers. One of them's like ah

49:08.560 --> 49:12.980
Man, Jim, we got cops. You wanna go take care of it

49:13.180 --> 49:15.180
Oh

49:15.380 --> 49:21.620
Okay, yeah, yeah for sure should I go what do you think Santa Claus or Easter Bunny

49:27.500 --> 49:33.260
Guy comes back out like two minutes later as you know, the first guy with the high voice he comes around

49:33.680 --> 49:37.820
He's talking to you guys. She's like, okay, what's the deal? Give me the rundown?

49:38.460 --> 49:43.180
You start talking telling stories like you're trying to be pretty vague

49:43.180 --> 49:46.860
But you have to let him know about this fucking foot inside the freezer

49:46.860 --> 49:52.260
And as you're about to start describing like the actual gritty details of it

49:52.260 --> 49:56.020
the other guy comes out literally in full Santa regalia and

49:57.020 --> 50:00.620
he's putting a silencer on the end of a pistol and

50:01.420 --> 50:03.420
He looks at you guys and he's like

50:04.420 --> 50:06.420
If anybody sees and they tell

50:07.100 --> 50:09.700
What are they gonna fucking believe Santa's out killing cops?

50:10.260 --> 50:14.580
So he heads out the front door with the gun behind his back

50:15.100 --> 50:18.380
Maybe if he's an alien pedophile Santa

50:19.500 --> 50:21.500
Colbeck

50:23.940 --> 50:26.140
Okay, so we're gonna want to get everything

50:27.580 --> 50:32.900
There's a lot of you is this one team or two teams what's going on here? We're one big happy team

50:33.420 --> 50:36.460
Ain't that right? What about the sleeping couple?

50:37.140 --> 50:41.580
What's their deal? Those are civilians civilians that were on the scene

50:41.620 --> 50:47.060
you will need to take care of them to she glances at the silencer and she's like

50:47.660 --> 50:53.620
The perhaps not that way but yeah, I was gonna say did it do they have any evidence?

50:54.300 --> 51:00.860
No, are they like trusted in society is like people with like they have a YouTube following what kind?

51:01.300 --> 51:08.260
Probably like 200 people max. I don't know. Yeah, it's like I think I wrote down. It's a hundred and seventy-nine loyal followers

51:09.180 --> 51:13.380
Well, it's like they say the first hundred followers is toughest one

51:15.580 --> 51:18.060
But she's like I'm sure that

51:18.820 --> 51:26.320
I'm sure that they can be convinced that you know something went down here, but they don't have any evidence and as far as I know

51:27.160 --> 51:33.560
Yeah, if they don't if they don't know where this is and they don't have any evidence no one's gonna believe them

51:33.560 --> 51:35.560
You said it was a fucking

51:35.600 --> 51:40.400
Bigfoot that turned into a boy corpse. So they're gonna be fine. They're gonna go back out in the world

51:40.400 --> 51:44.320
I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen. They're gonna go back out in the world. They're gonna keep making their YouTube thing

51:44.320 --> 51:51.000
they're gonna be like this guy who helped us was in on the government conspiracy and then anyone who knows anything is gonna be like

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I

51:53.240 --> 51:58.720
Was a really good heart sound I think and when she looks at the sleeping Carl

51:59.480 --> 52:01.480
It seems to be his brother

52:01.780 --> 52:04.480
Actually, we could also make an argument that

52:05.260 --> 52:07.260
He killed his own brother

52:08.200 --> 52:14.000
That's cold. Wow, that's a huge age difference between these siblings, right?

52:15.480 --> 52:19.700
Actually, yes, let's not play that one then because his brother disappeared a long time ago

52:20.260 --> 52:26.900
Damn oh shit. I bet he's done. He opens up the warehouse door and Santa Claus drives the cop car

52:30.140 --> 52:33.580
All right, well I've got a clean car for you guys and

52:35.420 --> 52:38.380
Make sure to tell Santa what you want for Christmas on your way out

52:40.740 --> 52:45.460
I think you all did great. Thank you so much for working with me on this

52:45.460 --> 52:49.140
I'm sure I will be seeing you around she says lying and

52:50.420 --> 52:51.820
then

52:51.820 --> 52:54.860
Gets into one of the cars and he talks to Jerome

52:54.860 --> 53:01.820
He's like, could you drop me off and then she says like a nondescript station where she can get out get on like a train

53:01.820 --> 53:07.060
Or bus or something does not give her Facebook name to these people

53:08.660 --> 53:15.980
And sends a text to her daughter expecting to not get a response fucking teenagers I

53:15.980 --> 53:17.980

53:18.420 --> 53:21.220

I just had like a parachute Chuck. You gotta take me to the hospital

54:53.860 --> 55:00.500
Hospital do they have lasagna? I'm sure they do. It's probably not your mama's lasagna, but I'm sure they got it tight

55:01.420 --> 55:02.780
I

55:02.780 --> 55:07.020
Love that neither of me or dr. Miller thought to take you to the hospital

55:07.020 --> 55:10.020
I'm just like bleeding

55:12.020 --> 55:14.020
That was

55:18.180 --> 55:24.660

Did make you happy? No, it's it's a great system though

56:17.040 --> 56:23.160
I must say that like it's probably one of the most like the system really makes sense. It's easy to get into I

56:23.720 --> 56:26.440
Really enjoyed it. It's a lot of fun and I love that

56:26.440 --> 56:30.720

You know you do one thing and it's just like alright next up. It's it's really cool. I like it a lot

56:34.840 --> 56:40.440
Yeah, I love Delta Green for getting new people into role-playing because that you don't need to know anything

56:41.240 --> 56:45.800
Really too much, you know, if your handler is willing to walk you through some stuff

56:45.800 --> 56:50.160
You can get new people into role-playing really easily, which is fun, which is super fun. So

56:51.200 --> 56:52.480

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.680
Oh

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.680
Oh

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:05.200
Carl Lambert and Janice Ruth were dropped off back at Bush HQ where their trucks were parked when they went inside

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.420
Carl found a thumb drive in the pocket of a jacket. He had worn sometime before

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.000
Dr. Ann Falsom arrived

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.680
Oh

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:25.320
Officer Steve McGovern was reported missing sometime near the end of that shift

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.600
His GPS location was tracked to the warehouse district

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.160
Inside an empty warehouse

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.200
Sat an elegantly wrapped present in red and green gold

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:47.840
And after a special unit opened the gift they received just about the worst thing

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.160
could ever get a

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.160
lack of closure

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.480
However

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.360
earlier in his shift

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:14.400
Officer McGovern called for backup and then failed to get into a high-speed pursuit and

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.880
After he called in the plates of this fan. He had tried to pull over

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:27.840
He called back to get it on the record that the chase involved a sprinter van

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.200
driven by an intoxicated FBI agent named

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.280
Doreen

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.360
Oh

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.360
Oh

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.360
Oh

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:55.560
For Christmas, I would like some Mentos whip it Christmas is where it's at. Let me tell you we'd be Christmas
