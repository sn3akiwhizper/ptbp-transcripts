00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
Slap a can of beans and throw it at your mama.

00:03.160 --> 00:06.280
It's Wolf the Dog here to give you bad advice

00:06.280 --> 00:09.400
regarding your parental figures.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.200
And I'm coming at you dead.

00:11.200 --> 00:16.200
From 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station

00:16.840 --> 00:20.640
that utilizes a bean-based biofuel

00:20.640 --> 00:25.520
to make the electricity absolutely electric, my babies.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.200
We also use coal, apparently.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.600
People still use coal?

00:30.600 --> 00:32.120
That shit is nasty.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.680
What is not nasty is that this edition

00:34.680 --> 00:37.040
of Howlin' with Wolf is from Jack.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.160
Jack tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,

00:41.160 --> 00:44.720
which is one of the greatest feats a tweet can achieve.

00:44.720 --> 00:48.720
They write, my dearest wolf, in times like this,

00:48.720 --> 00:51.380
it is such a comfort to listen to your news

00:51.380 --> 00:56.040
from contention, murderous ooze, orphan experiments,

00:56.040 --> 00:59.920
inscrutable aliens, blood magic feds,

00:59.920 --> 01:02.800
spine-rippin' robot balls,

01:02.800 --> 01:06.760
the unspeakable whore come to eat the world.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.680
These terrors keep the even larger daily ones at bay

01:10.680 --> 01:14.160
for an hour or so, and for that, I am grateful.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.180
Even when the world's a dumpster fire,

01:16.180 --> 01:19.360
you still find us all the scrumptious,

01:19.360 --> 01:22.220
unscorched, slop to slurp.

01:22.220 --> 01:26.260
Love to my contention folks, Jack.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.340
Hey there, Jack.

01:28.340 --> 01:30.740
I always love when a fan of mine

01:30.740 --> 01:33.460
talks about slurpin' that slop.

01:33.460 --> 01:37.540
It makes my orifices tingle with anticipation.

01:37.540 --> 01:42.540
My pores ooze with, ooze.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.180
If you want me to read your words

01:44.180 --> 01:46.420
on a segment similar to this one,

01:46.420 --> 01:50.140
similar because it would be on this exact same segment,

01:50.140 --> 01:52.700
go on and tag at Pretendin' Pod

01:52.700 --> 01:55.860
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

01:55.860 --> 01:57.300
and report that review

01:57.300 --> 02:01.500
to your Wolfie at pretendinpod at gmail.com.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.220
I promise I definitely read all of them

02:04.220 --> 02:06.900
and it's not forced on my producer.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.800
I'm fuckin' hungry, y'all.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.120
And speaking of the rich,

02:12.120 --> 02:15.140
we're rich with theme songs in this final recap

02:15.140 --> 02:17.580
of season one of Pretending to be People

02:17.580 --> 02:20.740
here at 694.2 PTBB,

02:20.740 --> 02:24.540
Contingent's newest and only radio station.

02:24.540 --> 02:27.720
But all arouse the menage a trois with a banger.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.560
Banger?

02:28.560 --> 02:29.660
Barely knew her.

02:29.660 --> 02:32.580
It's Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual.

02:35.580 --> 02:36.420
Mmm.

02:36.420 --> 02:39.000
["Pretty People"]

02:50.080 --> 02:52.340
Don't make me pretty, baby.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.260
This is real love dream.

03:02.940 --> 03:05.440
I knew I'd make you be pretty.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.100
I knew I'd make you be pretty.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.580
The tops of trees,

03:15.580 --> 03:19.620
thick enough to obscure any view of what was below,

03:19.620 --> 03:21.580
covered in a layer of kudzu,

03:21.580 --> 03:24.720
seemed to go on endlessly.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.820
Up and down, over hills and valleys,

03:27.820 --> 03:29.580
mountains and gorges,

03:29.580 --> 03:33.900
there was nothing but dense, verdant forest.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.500
A circular, calm lake found itself

03:36.500 --> 03:39.720
somewhere in the midst of this lush wilderness

03:39.720 --> 03:42.220
and in the middle of that lake,

03:42.220 --> 03:45.420
a small island with less than a quarter mile

03:45.420 --> 03:47.100
from shore to shore.

03:47.100 --> 03:50.580
A long wooden dock on the north side of the island

03:50.580 --> 03:53.580
led to a charming two-story boathouse

03:53.580 --> 03:55.860
with six well-kept cedar canoes

03:55.860 --> 03:59.500
tied up below the second-story apartment.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.820
If the island was the face of a clock,

04:01.820 --> 04:04.240
that dock was at high noon.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.360
There were six cute, cozy little cottages

04:07.360 --> 04:10.460
evenly dispersed along the shore of the island

04:10.460 --> 04:13.380
at one o'clock, three o'clock, five o'clock,

04:13.380 --> 04:16.800
seven o'clock, nine o'clock, and 11 o'clock.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.660
Five of the six cottages were in pristine condition.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.060
The 11 o'clock place might have been two,

04:23.060 --> 04:25.640
but it was impossible to tell from the outside

04:25.640 --> 04:28.500
since the entire building was covered

04:28.500 --> 04:31.060
by a massive blue tarp.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.220
Truly master craft landscaping

04:33.220 --> 04:35.800
surrounded each of these cottages.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.860
Stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape

04:39.860 --> 04:42.580
filled varied gardens and planters

04:42.580 --> 04:45.260
that somehow both overran the terrain

04:45.260 --> 04:47.940
and complemented it perfectly.

04:47.940 --> 04:50.660
Each cottage had a cobblestone walkway

04:50.660 --> 04:53.740
lined on either side by these lovely flower beds

04:53.740 --> 04:55.940
and the walkways all made their way

04:55.940 --> 04:57.980
to the center of the island

04:57.980 --> 05:00.460
where a large, equally cute and cozy

05:00.460 --> 05:02.980
hexagonal building sat.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.700
There was a small welcome sign

05:04.700 --> 05:07.620
on the south side of this building right at six o'clock

05:07.620 --> 05:12.620
and it read, welcome to calm, comfy campground.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.500
The circle of knowledge used this land

05:16.500 --> 05:18.500
isolated by both geography

05:18.500 --> 05:20.840
and some sort of unnatural perimeter

05:20.840 --> 05:24.060
to execute a brainchild of Jim Cook

05:24.060 --> 05:27.180
called Operation Hole Puncher.

05:27.220 --> 05:29.740
This operation utilized the potent pheromone

05:29.740 --> 05:32.980
from their newly developed experimental family of flowers

05:32.980 --> 05:35.380
named Sanferra Blom.

05:35.380 --> 05:37.780
This pheromone made the uninoculated

05:37.780 --> 05:39.980
unnaturally suggestible.

05:39.980 --> 05:43.680
The targets of this mission were so malleable

05:43.680 --> 05:46.700
entire backstories could be prescribed

05:46.700 --> 05:49.860
in order to extract specific information.

05:49.860 --> 05:52.200
Roger Fairfield, an archeologist

05:52.200 --> 05:55.140
with access to a new excavation site

05:55.140 --> 05:57.820
designated The Nameless City,

05:57.820 --> 06:02.460
was made to believe he was married to a woman named Angela,

06:02.460 --> 06:05.460
actually played by Anne Love.

06:05.460 --> 06:09.940
Alan Grimes, a child trafficker with government contracts,

06:09.940 --> 06:13.020
was convinced a boy from one of his warehouses

06:13.020 --> 06:16.860
was an artificial intelligence.

06:16.860 --> 06:20.740
Each mark had something the circle of knowledge wanted.

06:20.740 --> 06:23.320
Charles Digby had enough compromising evidence

06:23.360 --> 06:26.400
to blackmail every important person in the city.

06:26.400 --> 06:30.280
Martin Cupertino was in the midst of creating Cube,

06:30.280 --> 06:33.520
the future of personal technology.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.480
Pliable guests were duped

06:35.480 --> 06:38.420
into signing extensive contracts.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.140
The aim of Operation Hole Puncher

06:41.140 --> 06:46.140
was to acquire as much information and access as possible,

06:46.200 --> 06:49.040
but the system didn't always work smoothly.

06:49.040 --> 06:52.520
Groups would sometimes trigger reality for each other.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.640
They would need to be reset.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.800
With Fairfield, the Grimes, Digby, and Cupertino,

06:57.800 --> 07:01.160
even the fifth reset didn't quite stick,

07:01.160 --> 07:05.100
and Cupertino somehow escaped before the sixth reset.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.380
He was an anomaly.

07:07.380 --> 07:08.960
And of course, there were some folks

07:08.960 --> 07:10.680
who refused to share their secrets

07:10.680 --> 07:12.700
regardless of their altered state.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.960
A completely random example would be

07:15.960 --> 07:17.720
Eunice and Jerry Bishop,

07:17.720 --> 07:20.120
who at the time possessed a rare

07:20.120 --> 07:23.200
and specifically sought-after book.

07:23.200 --> 07:27.240
No matter what Jim Cook, Leon Simpson, or Ann Love tried,

07:27.240 --> 07:30.240
friendship, torture, worse,

07:30.240 --> 07:33.480
the bishops never surrendered their knowledge

07:33.480 --> 07:36.600
of where the book was hidden.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.160
This is the kind of environment

07:38.160 --> 07:40.880
in which young Maggie Cook was raised.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.000
She quickly found her life much more interesting

07:44.000 --> 07:46.760
when the victim suspected or saw reality

07:46.760 --> 07:49.560
through their flower-induced haze.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.080
So she began to play her own games

07:52.080 --> 07:53.840
with the temporary tenants.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.520
It started innocently enough

07:55.520 --> 07:58.480
she would talk to Circle of Knowledge members

07:58.480 --> 08:00.680
when they were undercover with a mark.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.940
Then she planted walkie-talkies in the cottages

08:03.940 --> 08:05.840
to taunt the visitors.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.120
But little Maggie eventually took it upon herself

08:08.120 --> 08:12.400
to actually inoculate guests while they slept.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.760
She was bored.

08:13.760 --> 08:18.280
And some kids just like to watch the chaos they've created.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.320
She watched from the roof of a cottage

08:20.320 --> 08:22.520
the night she first saw the thing

08:22.520 --> 08:26.120
that lived in the brackish waters of Lake Calm.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.520
The six of them paddled the three canoes

08:28.520 --> 08:31.000
like their lives depended on it.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.560
Jack Russell always says,

08:32.560 --> 08:34.440
"'To do a canoe.'"

08:34.440 --> 08:37.560
She wondered if it was the last thing he said.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.880
An unspeakable worm-like abomination

08:40.880 --> 08:44.140
erupted above the surface of the water.

08:44.140 --> 08:48.040
The thing rose 10 feet out of the ichor.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.680
It was tube-like, covered in a squamous,

08:51.680 --> 08:54.880
black, partially translucent membrane.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.840
Its body was segmented,

08:56.840 --> 09:01.000
and toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins

09:01.000 --> 09:04.760
were visible through its thin-looking exterior.

09:04.760 --> 09:08.080
It had no identifiable eyes or nose,

09:08.080 --> 09:11.280
and its cavernous, circular mouths,

09:11.280 --> 09:13.640
one sat just inside the other,

09:13.640 --> 09:16.080
were lined with hooked teeth,

09:16.080 --> 09:17.820
and it spit out a saliva

09:17.820 --> 09:21.200
that was somehow darker than black.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.660
From its maw, a sharp stylet protruded,

09:24.660 --> 09:28.960
like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.680
It plunged down, attached to the top of Jack Russell's head,

09:33.680 --> 09:38.060
and ripped him up and out of the back of the canoe.

09:38.060 --> 09:40.800
The thing sucked the short, portly man

09:40.800 --> 09:43.680
into its round, teeth-encircled mouth

09:43.680 --> 09:47.000
before it slipped quickly and quietly

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
back into the pitch-black water of Lake Calm.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.640
She half-expected Jack Russell

09:55.640 --> 09:58.560
to be standing at six o'clock the next day

09:58.560 --> 10:01.740
with that dumb, blank expression on his face

10:01.740 --> 10:04.800
like all the others would after a reset.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.880
She liked watching their faces change.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.560
It was impossible to tell, even for her,

10:09.560 --> 10:13.580
if it was their last time being greeted by that sign.

10:14.420 --> 10:17.460
Welcome to Calm, Comfy Campground.

10:17.460 --> 10:28.580
Hip-hop music

10:47.460 --> 10:54.740
John Lee Pettymore IV, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna felt eyes on them, all over them,

10:54.740 --> 10:59.660
outside of their own bodies, floating in this vast nothingness.

10:59.660 --> 11:05.740
They saw Keith Vigna open a door until D.B. Mitchell was there on the other side, curled

11:05.740 --> 11:12.120
up in the fetal position, and her body began deteriorating hastily, like she had leprosy

11:12.120 --> 11:13.120
in time-lapse.

11:13.120 --> 11:17.560
However, she grew larger with each passing moment.

11:17.560 --> 11:22.920
Clark Bishop handed an old piece of parchment to a young boy with a balloon-shaped head,

11:22.920 --> 11:26.280
an eye so dark that the irises looked black.

11:26.280 --> 11:30.880
And immediately, the boy's feet caught fire, and the fire grew and grew to consume the

11:30.880 --> 11:36.100
young black-eyed boy in three voices, cried out in pain.

11:36.100 --> 11:42.480
John Lee Pettymore IV crouched down, stared at a television, a blank white screen.

11:42.480 --> 11:46.760
He reached out and touched the screen like Vanna White, but instead of a letter popping

11:46.760 --> 11:52.800
up, Clark Bishop's parents, Eunice and Jerry, the size of action figures, jumped out of

11:52.800 --> 11:59.100
the screen and ran up John Lee Pettymore IV's arm, climbed his shoulder, and flinged their

11:59.100 --> 12:02.400
tiny selves into John's head.

12:02.400 --> 12:06.780
It looked like the Bishops were going to disappear right into Pettymore's brain, but they both

12:06.780 --> 12:09.640
got stuck halfway in.

12:09.800 --> 12:15.440
Their legs writhed about and flailed in this never-ending dreamscape.

12:15.440 --> 12:22.360
Oily, viscous sludge began dripping, and then sprayed out of John Lee Pettymore IV's head

12:22.360 --> 12:27.840
where the Bishops had lodged themselves, and the ooze began collecting on a ground below,

12:27.840 --> 12:29.440
then made of light.

12:29.440 --> 12:35.180
And the ooze dripped, dripped, dripped, and then poured, until a laminar flow connected

12:35.220 --> 12:41.460
the head of John Lee Pettymore IV to a pool of this inky substance that began shaping

12:41.460 --> 12:44.060
itself into a large saucer.

12:44.060 --> 12:50.820
But as the pool grew, the walls began rising outward, creating an imposingly colossal bowl,

12:50.820 --> 12:56.300
and our view was forced to back up leagues as this shape continued to form, a mirror

12:56.300 --> 12:58.220
of what was then below.

12:58.220 --> 13:03.580
The miniscule body of John Lee Pettymore in the far distance continued to fill this thing's

13:03.580 --> 13:14.360
final form, an incomprehensibly massive sphere, and it continued to grow, and grow, and then...

13:14.360 --> 13:20.260
The three contention boys woke up in the mausoleum for the third time, in shock, cursed with

13:20.260 --> 13:25.100
the memories of their recent trip to City State University.

13:25.100 --> 13:30.300
Their stomachs were strangely full, their ears rang, and their eyes adjusted to the

13:30.300 --> 13:32.820
dark, cold tomb.

13:32.820 --> 13:37.060
A turned over coffin sat next to a pool of blood on the ground.

13:37.060 --> 13:42.820
John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd in black tactical gear, Keith Vigna in his bright polo and boat

13:42.820 --> 13:49.040
shoes, and Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform, all felt the searing pain where

13:49.040 --> 13:52.560
names had been burned into their skin.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.060
Marvin on each chest was still crossed out.

13:56.060 --> 14:01.020
Maggie on the sole of each left foot was now crossed out as well.

14:01.020 --> 14:06.700
The other two names on their backs and inside their dominant hands read respectively Drew

14:06.700 --> 14:07.700
and Tildy.

14:07.700 --> 14:10.900
It was 3pm on December 6th.

14:10.900 --> 14:16.300
Two hours had passed since their last experience waking up next to Ari Manstein's corpse.

14:16.300 --> 14:21.380
They walked out into the light past the three downed androids near the crawfish boil and

14:21.380 --> 14:27.900
decided to return to contention, determined to cross Drew off their list.

14:27.900 --> 14:34.700
As they departed from the funeral setting, the massive, gaunt creature reappeared, screaming,

14:34.700 --> 14:35.980
and they took off running.

14:35.980 --> 14:39.260
At the entrance, they ran into the old woman in the wheelchair.

14:39.260 --> 14:45.580
With massive, deranged eyes, she sobbed at the sight of the repeating men.

14:45.580 --> 14:49.620
John Lee Kevinmore pushed her wheelchair toward the parking lot.

14:49.620 --> 14:56.100
The creature had no hair, big red pupils, eye slits that opened from the bottom, and

14:56.100 --> 15:02.740
it wore a familiar black suit, cried out into the sky as it pursued the group from

15:02.740 --> 15:05.900
behind.

15:05.900 --> 15:10.300
John gave the old woman his gun as they approached the empty parking lot.

15:10.300 --> 15:17.700
Empty that was, until a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse drifted across the lot toward them,

15:17.700 --> 15:25.380
and all could see behind the wheel sat Drew Andrews, the Baby Drewver.

15:25.380 --> 15:31.820
Behind them, the creature spoke, and it somehow forced everyone to freeze in place.

15:31.820 --> 15:35.780
Their bodies locked, and they turned to face the creature.

15:35.780 --> 15:39.620
It didn't speak aloud, but they heard it inside their heads.

15:39.620 --> 15:42.580
It apologized and spoke of a glitch.

15:42.580 --> 15:46.180
There could not be two Clark Bishops.

15:46.180 --> 15:51.740
The creature addressed each former officer by name and revealed Keith's full name,

15:51.740 --> 15:53.540
Ashley Keith Beans.

15:53.540 --> 15:57.260
He became flustered and pulled his gun, but he couldn't fire.

15:57.260 --> 16:03.380
Clark's face turned red with rage, unable to move, and Kevinmore twitched helplessly.

16:03.380 --> 16:09.620
The creature thought inside their heads, implored them not to be afraid, and a calming wave

16:09.620 --> 16:12.420
overtook each upset man.

16:12.420 --> 16:22.020
The old woman, finally at peace, closed her eyes and exhaled for the last time.

16:22.020 --> 16:27.540
Drew whipped the car around, saw the creature, and screeched to a stop a few feet away.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.380
The creature repeated itself in their minds.

16:30.380 --> 16:36.140
It sought information on the Clark glitch, and was willing to trade knowledge.

16:36.140 --> 16:45.340
It introduced itself as 43629 DC FBI, and it confirmed it was alien, better than human,

16:45.340 --> 16:46.820
from Myriad.

16:46.820 --> 16:52.700
Keith pulled out the ring they retrieved from Jim Cook's house and claimed to be Jim trapped

16:52.700 --> 16:54.500
in Keith's body.

16:54.500 --> 16:59.100
The creature from Myriad was ecstatic to hear this news, and was quick to communicate something

16:59.100 --> 17:03.220
in its strange manner to seemingly no one in sight.

17:03.220 --> 17:07.260
When Clark asked how Jim and the creature knew each other, it confirmed they worked

17:07.260 --> 17:09.580
together at Myriad.

17:09.580 --> 17:16.300
John convinced 43629 to reveal more information about its discreet co-worker so they could

17:16.340 --> 17:18.940
do something nice for him on his birthday.

17:18.940 --> 17:20.620
The creature obliged.

17:20.620 --> 17:29.020
Jim's birthday was on December 1st, and he always visited Prairie Pie in the city.

17:29.020 --> 17:35.420
The creature asked if Jim was in Keith's body to repair the relationship between Myriad

17:35.420 --> 17:40.740
and just James in regards to Operation San Ferra Blum.

17:40.740 --> 17:41.860
He said yes.

17:42.020 --> 17:47.140
Clark told the creature what they knew about Clark Old, and the alien reached out its long

17:47.140 --> 17:51.540
arm toward the group to wipe their memories of this conversation.

17:51.540 --> 17:58.620
It didn't work, but believing it had, 43629 just turned and left.

17:58.620 --> 18:04.300
As Drew pulled around in front of the group, he leaned out the window, a bit too cool for

18:04.300 --> 18:05.300
Drew.

18:05.300 --> 18:10.180
Hello, contention police officers, please get in the car and come with me.

18:10.180 --> 18:13.820
The gang, excited to see Drew, hopped in and took off.

18:13.820 --> 18:19.100
Drew let them know he'd been unable to receive any calls or texts due to having gotten wet,

18:19.100 --> 18:20.940
which destroyed his phone.

18:20.940 --> 18:26.180
The contention boys explained John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirst's whole situation, that they've

18:26.180 --> 18:33.140
killed or soon will kill Marvin Glass, and that Keith killed the Duke, which was actually

18:33.140 --> 18:36.140
Keith's brother, Ferguson Beans.

18:36.140 --> 18:39.140
Drew ran down the current state of contention.

18:39.180 --> 18:44.940
Pastor Adam Cain, aka Daddy, took control of the town.

18:44.940 --> 18:50.380
The First Creek Family of Contingent created a network of puddles for the survivors to

18:50.380 --> 18:58.180
hop into if they saw the residue, which only animals, kids, and insane people can see.

18:58.180 --> 19:05.280
They captured the ooze using fish, and Daddy Pastor Cain collected it in a central location.

19:05.280 --> 19:11.200
They hatched a plan to grab the watch from Keith's room at Hotel Motel, but after extensive

19:11.200 --> 19:16.440
questioning, the boys smelled something fishy in Drew's attitude and speech.

19:16.440 --> 19:21.160
John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirst's eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he thought

19:21.160 --> 19:26.840
real hard about whether or not they should trust Drew.

19:26.840 --> 19:34.440
Deep in the void of John's memories, where they reached out and met the collective unconscious,

19:34.800 --> 19:40.360
John saw a reflection of his father, John Lee Pettymore the Third, in a blank television

19:40.360 --> 19:46.400
screen, but he was much younger than the body John currently inhabited back in reality.

19:46.400 --> 19:52.280
The TV turned on, and the screen showed the contention police station as it was last seen,

19:52.280 --> 19:55.680
an absolute wreck with water pooled everywhere.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.920
The channel changed.

19:56.920 --> 20:03.020
Jim Cook briefed three people, and John recognized the faces from the file in Marvin Glass's

20:03.020 --> 20:08.700
compound labeled K-Cel, Kyle, Karen, and Kevin.

20:08.700 --> 20:16.860
Kyle, the unknown who died at Kevin's forced hand, Karen, also known as Ann Love, the woman

20:16.860 --> 20:24.540
who killed Clark Bishop's parents, and Kevin, John's daddy, John Lee Pettymore the Third.

20:24.540 --> 20:31.620
On the television screen, Jim called Karen over to speak privately, and the channel changed.

20:31.620 --> 20:36.120
Back in the mess of a police department, Drew leaned on a plastic service cart and

20:36.120 --> 20:38.560
headed to the evidence locker.

20:38.560 --> 20:46.020
He loaded up the radio, the helmet, and a briefcase that contained $5 million, his cut

20:46.020 --> 20:48.280
from the deal with the Duke.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.980
The channel changed again.

20:49.980 --> 20:57.560
Drew pushed the loaded cart up through the now emptied sanctuary of the First Church

20:57.560 --> 20:58.980
of Contention.

20:58.980 --> 21:00.940
The TV turned off with a click.

21:00.940 --> 21:05.940
The charcoal glass of the screen rolled down like a car window as Karen screamed,

21:05.940 --> 21:11.580
WHERE IS IT?

21:11.580 --> 21:17.920
Clark's parents, Eustace and Jerry Bishop, at gunpoint, refused to tell Ann Love what

21:17.920 --> 21:19.700
she wanted to know.

21:19.700 --> 21:25.500
Behind the lowered screen of the television sat a book made of strange, uncured leather

21:25.500 --> 21:29.900
with hair and maybe a few freckles.

21:29.900 --> 21:30.900
John blinked.

21:30.900 --> 21:34.740
The television screen suddenly looked completely normal again.

21:34.740 --> 21:37.620
He stared at his father's reflection.

21:37.620 --> 21:42.000
Karen laughed maniacally as she shoved the gun into Jerry's mouth.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.740
She forced Eustace to watch.

21:44.740 --> 21:50.340
John felt a decision being made inside himself.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.780
Kevin turned to Karen.

21:52.780 --> 21:54.580
THE BOOK ISN'T HERE!

21:54.580 --> 22:02.820
Karen's eyes lit up as she began chanting in an alien, ancient tongue, and Clark's parents

22:02.820 --> 22:09.220
began to rise off the thick carpet on the floor of their living room.

22:09.220 --> 22:12.380
John's vision again changed perspective completely.

22:12.380 --> 22:19.860
A man's left hand was outstretched, a trickle of red flowed across the soft skin.

22:19.860 --> 22:28.700
Suddenly Drew leaned in and kissed a ring on a finger that dripped with blood.

22:28.700 --> 22:35.000
John came to in the car and asked Drew to pull over as convincingly as he could without

22:35.000 --> 22:40.620
arousing suspicion, which amounted to pleading and saying he was about to shit his pants.

22:40.620 --> 22:46.260
After some resistance, Drew pulled off down a quiet road next to an empty cornfield, and

22:46.260 --> 22:50.620
as soon as the car stopped, John pulled out his gun and aimed it at Drew.

22:50.620 --> 22:54.980
John demanded the keys, and Clark put him in handcuffs.

22:54.980 --> 22:57.920
John explained his vision as they gave him a pat down.

22:57.920 --> 23:03.700
Drew confessed he was tortured and forced to give the items to the church.

23:03.700 --> 23:08.980
In their search, they discovered a small, cheap piece of carpet in Drew's pocket.

23:08.980 --> 23:15.580
Apparently, he would intentionally choke himself with it in order to see things he shouldn't

23:15.580 --> 23:17.060
be able to.

23:17.060 --> 23:23.020
Apparently, that's how he was able to find the boys at the city cemetery.

23:23.020 --> 23:28.380
Keith shoved the carpet in Drew's mouth and said, Tildy B. Mitchell.

23:28.380 --> 23:30.640
Drew choked for a few minutes.

23:30.640 --> 23:36.620
When he caught his breath, he told them she was still alive, but she was trapped somewhere

23:36.620 --> 23:39.740
she can't escape.

23:39.740 --> 23:45.780
In the distance, Drew noticed a black lab bounding up to them, and with reckless joy,

23:45.780 --> 23:48.100
he screamed out, Tyler!

23:48.100 --> 23:54.300
Well, Tyler, a black lab that belonged to Councilwoman Carrie Pages, had gone missing

23:54.300 --> 24:00.140
on December 2nd, and Drew's face brimmed with affection as he gushed that Tyler was the

24:00.140 --> 24:05.340
bestest dog that had ever existed, and he was afraid Tyler had been eaten by homeless

24:05.340 --> 24:06.840
people.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.800
Clark noticed the slip-up.

24:08.800 --> 24:14.920
Drew repeated verbatim what Councilwoman Carrie Pages had said several days before.

24:14.920 --> 24:21.000
Keith tricked Drew into admitting she was, in fact, Carrie Pages.

24:21.000 --> 24:27.480
Exposed, Drew Carrie spilled the details about how they switched bodies at the church with

24:27.480 --> 24:31.800
the radio under Daddy Kane's direction.

24:31.800 --> 24:35.060
The contingent boys struck a deal with Drew Carrie.

24:35.060 --> 24:37.440
She would be a double agent for them.

24:37.440 --> 24:41.480
They threw the handcuff Drew Carrie into the trunk and took off.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.160
Tyler the black lab sat comfortably in the passenger seat.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.160
Their destination?

24:46.160 --> 24:48.020
Hotel Motel.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.020
Their goal?

24:49.020 --> 24:54.080
Acquire the watch in Keith's room safe that he took off his dead brother's wrist, the

24:54.080 --> 25:00.600
same watch their father, William Beanes, had given Ferguson so many years before.

25:00.600 --> 25:06.040
As they approached contention, they reached a blockade made of church pews with a sign

25:06.040 --> 25:10.920
that pointed off to the side and indicated the path of a detour.

25:10.920 --> 25:17.120
The group pulled over, continued on foot, and left Drew Carrie in the trunk.

25:17.120 --> 25:20.960
Uncereptitiously, the boys traveled along the highway.

25:20.960 --> 25:28.220
In the distant skyline, a massive wall of water surrounded the property of the First

25:28.220 --> 25:30.600
Church of Contention.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.640
Clark stared.

25:32.640 --> 25:39.040
He couldn't contain his obsession with the fish flopping around inside this enormous

25:39.040 --> 25:41.680
unnatural water wall.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.800
At Hotel Motel, all of the doors were open.

25:44.800 --> 25:50.640
A dunking booth sat in the middle of the parking lot, and a young, larger boy with round cheeks

25:50.640 --> 25:55.160
sat precariously atop the trapdoor-style chair.

25:55.160 --> 26:00.000
He stuffed his face with cheesy ziti and surveyed the area.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.960
This omnomny lookout was easily fooled by Keith's quick disguise.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.720
Mud spread across his face like a beard.

26:07.720 --> 26:13.360
The inside of Keith's room at Hotel Motel was ransacked, but luckily his safe and the

26:13.360 --> 26:16.040
watch inside it had remained hidden.

26:16.040 --> 26:20.680
He stuffed the watch in his pocket and left, but when Keith rejoined the group, he handed

26:20.680 --> 26:24.140
the watch to John, who promptly put it on.

26:24.140 --> 26:31.660
As the watch slid on, John's consciousness phased out of reality, like a TV changed channels.

26:31.660 --> 26:37.380
He found himself in contention, as it was in the 1880-somethings.

26:37.380 --> 26:45.660
All the wet grass suddenly dried, the dirt turned to dust, and he saw a man face down,

26:45.660 --> 26:47.280
unmoving.

26:47.280 --> 26:51.760
Suddenly he saw a mostly buried metal door with an inscription that read,

26:51.760 --> 26:54.440
Pettymore Forevermore.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.120
The watch slid off.

26:56.120 --> 27:00.640
John shared his experience with the others and slapped the watch on Clark, who saw the

27:00.640 --> 27:06.620
same foreboding vision, but instead of John's door, Clark saw Chief Maggie Cook's house

27:06.620 --> 27:12.120
floating in the air, his door buried within, and the inscription read,

27:12.120 --> 27:19.680
1522518195518, the numbers for The Overseer.

27:19.860 --> 27:25.620
Another watch swap, Keith saw the same scene in the Old West, just outside the new town

27:25.620 --> 27:27.140
of contention.

27:27.140 --> 27:30.840
He saw a man face down in the dust, unmoving.

27:30.840 --> 27:36.460
He saw his hands tremble, and he rolled the body over, the man was dead.

27:36.460 --> 27:42.980
A tri-folded piece of parchment fell out of the man's pocket, it was a job advertisement

27:42.980 --> 27:53.540
that read, we is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight, plenty of work, hesitate not.

27:53.540 --> 27:58.880
The watch slid off Keith's arm and he let out a small scream.

27:58.880 --> 28:03.260
Clark tripped over the edge of sanity and pinned Keith to the ground.

28:03.260 --> 28:07.740
He ripped off the watch and threw it away, but John grabbed it and slapped it back on

28:07.740 --> 28:09.720
his own wrist.

28:09.720 --> 28:15.340
The watch traded hands several more times back and forth before they found out that

28:15.340 --> 28:20.400
by joining hands, they could all share the foreboding sights.

28:20.400 --> 28:26.700
They saw Tildy B. Mitchell walk slowly backwards into Bean's pond, steadily, until the water

28:26.700 --> 28:31.540
rose above her head and she disappeared from sight.

28:31.540 --> 28:37.280
The channel changed, they sat in a tavern, their own face reflected in the mirror behind

28:37.280 --> 28:43.240
the bar, but they wore the thick hand-stitched clothes of the dead man from out on that old

28:43.240 --> 28:45.060
dusty road.

28:45.060 --> 28:49.960
The barmaid refilled their glass and attempted some friendly small talk, so you're the new

28:49.960 --> 28:54.080
miner in town, who rode ahead looking for a room?

28:54.080 --> 29:01.240
Three men, each in their own vision, affirmed her query with a nod, well, welcome to contention,

29:01.240 --> 29:03.400
Silas Cole.

29:03.400 --> 29:07.720
Another channel change, a hooded figure lurked in the shadows.

29:07.720 --> 29:13.740
Suddenly, light flooded in and illuminated a decrepit and haggard Clark Bishop.

29:13.740 --> 29:20.600
Inside this tomb, he read a strange book made from uncured leather.

29:20.600 --> 29:28.200
Blood dripped from the spine, a tall, gaunt creature entered and croaked out in its unnatural

29:28.200 --> 29:29.200
speech.

29:29.200 --> 29:45.760
The two figures charged each other and a blinding light cleansed the interior of the tomb.

29:45.760 --> 29:51.400
Just then, the three contention officers entered the empty mausoleum.

29:51.400 --> 29:57.760
They carried the casket of Ari Manstein, they sat it down gently and closed the door behind

29:57.760 --> 29:59.820
them as they left.

29:59.820 --> 30:03.280
After a bright flash of light, the scene changed.

30:03.280 --> 30:09.120
Three individuals, two humans and one towering translucent creature in a black suit, stood

30:09.120 --> 30:11.840
in an old abandoned warehouse.

30:11.840 --> 30:17.440
Moonlight streamed in from the cracks and holes in the roof and reflected in puddles

30:17.440 --> 30:20.240
of stagnant water on the ground.

30:20.240 --> 30:27.120
The creature from Myriad handed a manila envelope to the two humans, a man and a woman.

30:27.120 --> 30:31.080
Inside, there was a drawing on a small piece of paper.

30:31.080 --> 30:35.200
It was a circle encircled by six circles.

30:35.200 --> 30:41.640
Another bright flash of light, James the mill worker dragged these two now lifeless bodies.

30:41.640 --> 30:47.040
From above, they saw the two corpses at the bottom of a man-made pit and then there was

30:47.040 --> 30:52.560
a time lapse of the bodies as they bloated and changed color.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.320
A real Clark Bishop fell into the pit.

30:55.320 --> 30:59.320
A final flash of light revealed Chief Maggie Cook.

30:59.320 --> 31:06.680
She gave orders to a looming overweight man in an all-black combat uniform.

31:06.680 --> 31:10.440
He had a large scar over his right eye.

31:10.440 --> 31:18.600
Charged with his mission, the android created by Myriad headed off to James the mill worker's

31:18.600 --> 31:19.880
house.

31:19.880 --> 31:24.880
After the visions from William Beanes' watch, they returned to the real world and stepped

31:24.880 --> 31:26.280
back from each other.

31:26.280 --> 31:31.160
Clark saw the black ooze pouring out of John Lee Kevinmore the third.

31:31.160 --> 31:36.400
It dripped from his eyes, ears, and mouth all the way down to his hands.

31:36.400 --> 31:42.640
It was on Clark and Keith's too and a string of ooze bridged all six of their hands, drizzled

31:42.640 --> 31:46.120
down and collected on the ground.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.680
It moved toward Clark but he blinked and it was gone.

31:49.680 --> 31:53.800
A truck nearby idled and a man's voice hollered,

31:53.800 --> 31:56.960
All right, come on out of there, Randy.

31:56.960 --> 32:01.320
We can do this the easy way or you can disappear.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.640
How much worse can you possibly get?

32:03.640 --> 32:08.840
You don't want to give daddy a shot, he can go back and fix everything back to normal.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.680
We need more bodies, Randy.

32:11.680 --> 32:18.780
Keith recognized the voice of Terrence Elizabeth Licker from Lickers Lickers as he shouted

32:18.780 --> 32:20.660
at Randy Angst.

32:20.660 --> 32:27.220
Keith Vigna angry relayed that Licker had shorted him three dollars and shook up his

32:27.220 --> 32:28.300
beer.

32:28.300 --> 32:33.460
They headed toward the voice, guns out with Vigna in front.

32:33.460 --> 32:37.720
Keith made his way to the side of the house and peeked at the idle truck.

32:37.720 --> 32:43.520
The truck bed layered with tarps was filled with water and fish as well as Jimmy Sanders,

32:43.520 --> 32:49.020
the manager of Subtropolis and John Lee Pettymore's cousin, who called in the oil spill several

32:49.020 --> 32:50.220
days earlier.

32:50.220 --> 32:57.580
His eyes were wide and wild and he muttered something about a number four with no tomato.

32:57.580 --> 33:00.320
Keith ran for the keys of the truck and turned it off.

33:00.320 --> 33:04.560
John popped out to get Jimmy's attention and the hippie's eyes widened.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.460
Terrified at the sight of John, he dipped down into the water.

33:08.460 --> 33:14.740
John looked into the living room and watched T. Licker and another man, Luca Fade Fudgevitz,

33:14.740 --> 33:18.280
shove Randy Angst down onto the carpet.

33:18.280 --> 33:23.440
When the truck shut off, the two men turned their attention outside.

33:23.440 --> 33:28.520
Inside the truck, Keith opened the glove box and found a mag light and a folded up picture

33:28.520 --> 33:35.080
of himself, Keith Vigna, with an inscription that read, Collect Alive.

33:35.080 --> 33:39.780
John attempted to pull Jimmy Sanders out of the water, but Jimmy dove right back in.

33:39.780 --> 33:43.680
Fade and Luca saw John and Keith as they exited the house.

33:43.680 --> 33:47.900
Fade approached Keith, crowbar drawn, and Luca reached into his back pocket.

33:47.900 --> 33:51.860
Clark crept inside and told Randy Angst to find cover.

33:51.860 --> 33:58.180
Keith drew his gun, pointed it at his own head, and threatened to fire if they moved.

33:58.180 --> 34:04.660
John, with no grace whatsoever, shot Fade in the shoulder, yelled to drop their weapons,

34:04.660 --> 34:06.980
and used the truck as cover.

34:06.980 --> 34:12.360
Luca dropped the crowbar and left a trail of blood along the white paint as he slumped

34:12.360 --> 34:18.040
back into the garage door and then down onto the driveway.

34:18.040 --> 34:21.280
Terrence Licker pressed his gun against his own head.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.620
Think you can play games with me?

34:24.620 --> 34:29.440
Clark sprang from behind, grabbed the gun of T. Licker, and wrestled him to the ground.

34:29.440 --> 34:34.580
Keith smashed Terrence in the mouth with his own mag light and sent teeth flying out into

34:34.580 --> 34:36.580
Randy Angst's front yard.

34:36.580 --> 34:41.620
John zip-tied Luca's hands together, and Clark retrieved the loose gun on the driveway.

34:41.620 --> 34:51.580
Keith rolled Licker over, grabbed his wallet, removed three one-dollar bills, and smiled.

34:51.580 --> 34:57.940
Beat and shaken, Terrence explained they gathered bodies for Daddy Pastor Kane to sacrifice

34:57.940 --> 35:00.660
so he could go back in time to fix everything.

35:00.660 --> 35:04.140
Daddy said Keith Vigna was especially important.

35:04.140 --> 35:11.100
John shoved a piece of carpet from Drew Carey into Terrence's mouth and demanded, Daddy.

35:11.100 --> 35:15.140
A few seconds of choking later, he coughed it up, looked at John Lee Kevin Moore the

35:15.140 --> 35:21.300
3rd, and freaked out, you're one of them, it's in you.

35:21.300 --> 35:25.220
John caught a brief reflection of himself in the rearview mirror.

35:25.220 --> 35:30.180
Black ooze ran out of his eyes, nose, and ears.

35:30.220 --> 35:34.620
He dove into the truck bed pool, the teeming puddle with Jimmy Sanders.

35:34.620 --> 35:38.460
John felt the strangest sensation.

35:38.460 --> 35:44.540
His head vibrated and heated up, and then a sudden feeling of comfort washed through

35:44.540 --> 35:47.140
his cranial cavities.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.460
He resurfaced.

35:48.460 --> 35:54.780
There was an overpowering smell of rancid fish, and John vomited back in the water in

35:54.780 --> 35:56.700
which he and Jimmy stood.

35:56.740 --> 36:03.340
Jimmy looked over calmly, unafraid of John for the first time, and in the lull, Randy

36:03.340 --> 36:07.900
stumbled out of his house, but something was off.

36:07.900 --> 36:12.460
Randy didn't remember the encounter with the robot man at James the millworker's house,

36:12.460 --> 36:17.820
but he did say Pastor Kane had been a real dick since he lost his family in that car

36:17.820 --> 36:19.980
accident a few days ago.

36:19.980 --> 36:25.500
Terrence blamed the crash on the three contentioned police officers, and Clark, Keith, and John

36:25.500 --> 36:32.660
noticed Randy's cane was topped with a Rubik's cube instead of a tooth.

36:32.660 --> 36:37.020
It was clear that this somehow wasn't the same Randy Angst.

36:37.020 --> 36:43.460
Similar, sure, but their Angst was a dentist and a realtor, and the head of the contentioned

36:43.460 --> 36:46.660
historical society, and a lover.

36:46.660 --> 36:51.380
This Randy Angst was the director of the Children's Museum?

36:51.380 --> 36:56.460
The trio, disassociated with their current reality, acted a bit rashly.

36:56.460 --> 37:01.160
Clark barged into the house, knocked Randy to the ground, and screamed into his face

37:01.160 --> 37:04.740
about who he was and who he was not.

37:04.740 --> 37:11.900
Keith pulled his gun, fired wildly, and put a stray bullet directly through Fade's head.

37:11.900 --> 37:16.820
Pushed further past the brink, he noticed the ooze that dripped down John's face.

37:16.820 --> 37:23.180
Keith aimed the gun at John, and ordered him to get back in the water.

37:23.180 --> 37:28.780
Clark smashed Angst's head into the linoleum floor, then realized what he was doing and

37:28.780 --> 37:32.220
meekly apologized as he backed out of the house.

37:32.220 --> 37:38.060
John resurfaced, momentarily rid of the ooze that consistently dripped from his orifices,

37:38.060 --> 37:41.060
if one was in a certain frame of mind.

37:41.060 --> 37:44.820
And off in the distance, they heard the rumble of vehicles.

37:44.820 --> 37:50.320
The contention police posse piled into the truck and drove off, intent to grab their

37:50.320 --> 37:54.540
original car, Drew Carey, and head to Bean's Pond.

37:54.540 --> 37:58.500
John took the driver's seat, Keith called shotgun, and Clark jumped in the truck bed

37:58.500 --> 38:00.700
to play with the fish.

38:00.700 --> 38:06.180
Suddenly, two vehicles approached, one from either end of the street, a truck with a hot

38:06.180 --> 38:11.860
tub in tow, and an Impala with a refrigerator on its side strapped to the top.

38:11.900 --> 38:18.100
In the Impala, John could see Asher and Avery Little, the parents of the two children that

38:18.100 --> 38:22.700
were absorbed by the goo in front of James the millworker's house.

38:22.700 --> 38:27.700
John punched it into reverse, cut through a field, and the two cars attempted to tail.

38:27.700 --> 38:34.180
One sweet handbrake 180 later, John hit the road unaccompanied, foot all the way down

38:34.180 --> 38:35.860
on the gas.

38:35.860 --> 38:40.940
They pulled along agent Trent Chad's red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse, where they left Drew

38:40.940 --> 38:45.900
Carey, and Clark hopped out of the truck bed, sprinted to the trunk, and threw Drew

38:45.900 --> 38:51.320
Carey and Tyler, the black lab, into the fish-filled tarp-tub truck bed.

38:51.320 --> 38:56.500
The two vehicles in pursuit were able to catch up while the unlikely protagonists collected

38:56.500 --> 38:59.480
their co-worker's body and their double agent's dog.

38:59.480 --> 39:06.220
But a gruesome scream came from the Impala refrigerator as the Littles pulled up.

39:06.540 --> 39:07.540
Glass shattered.

39:07.540 --> 39:12.020
A body was snatched up and slammed into the side of the nearby truck.

39:12.020 --> 39:16.220
That truck's driver climbed out the window and attempted to jump into the hot tub, but

39:16.220 --> 39:20.580
something nabbed his foot and dangled him mid-air.

39:20.580 --> 39:25.060
A blink revealed the thickest wave of ooze yet.

39:25.060 --> 39:30.740
The driver, being slowly consumed by the inky substance, desperately grabbed onto the man

39:30.740 --> 39:35.420
already in the hot tub, only to seal his fate as well.

39:35.420 --> 39:41.180
The ooze ripped the two men up into the sky and slammed them down into the concrete below,

39:41.180 --> 39:47.480
repeatedly leaving bright red smears across the cold ground.

39:47.480 --> 39:52.060
With the whole group somehow intact, John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd peeled away.

39:52.060 --> 39:59.260
In his rear-view mirror, John saw the incomprehensibly massive wave of ooze crashing forward slowly

39:59.260 --> 40:02.740
but relentlessly toward their vehicle.

40:02.740 --> 40:04.660
They soon reached a roadblock.

40:04.660 --> 40:10.980
A crane, loaded heavily with construction tube pipes, intentionally blocked the highway.

40:10.980 --> 40:15.060
John went to whip the truck around the obstruction, but a tire caught an edge.

40:15.060 --> 40:21.260
The truck turned over, smashed into the ground, and all five occupants were thrown clear of

40:21.260 --> 40:22.300
the vehicle.

40:22.300 --> 40:27.220
The truck continued to roll, tumbled into a billboard for owls, tires, and tigers, and

40:27.220 --> 40:28.720
exploded.

40:28.720 --> 40:35.200
The discombobulated set of sitting ducks saw Gary Daley emerge from a storm drain.

40:35.200 --> 40:39.360
He shrieked and hollered for them to join him in the sewers.

40:39.360 --> 40:45.440
As they looked back, the officers saw a massive surge of ooze, bigger than any they had seen

40:45.440 --> 40:48.600
before, and it steadily flowed toward them.

40:48.600 --> 40:54.360
Clark picked up Drew's unconscious body and carried it toward Gary, who had popped his

40:54.360 --> 40:55.920
head out of the storm drain.

40:55.960 --> 41:00.920
A disoriented Keith got up from on top of Jimmy Sanders, and he and John helped him

41:00.920 --> 41:04.080
toward the sewer with Tyler on their heels.

41:04.080 --> 41:09.760
After they confirmed Gary's identity with a fact only he would know, the wrecked crew

41:09.760 --> 41:11.920
dove down into the drain.

41:11.920 --> 41:17.920
Gary, eyes covered by his hands, explained that the goo only chased you if you looked

41:17.920 --> 41:18.920
at it.

41:18.920 --> 41:23.760
Gary led the group through the tunnels while they discussed John's body swap situation.

41:23.760 --> 41:29.360
Also, Gary was tripping a bit, apparently so he could see the goo when he needed to.

41:29.360 --> 41:34.680
He was especially perturbed by the goo that dripped from John's orifices.

41:34.680 --> 41:38.720
Gary expressed how much he'd been hoping to see them since the events of the last couple

41:38.720 --> 41:39.720
days.

41:39.720 --> 41:44.740
He described how the pastor put up a wall of water around his church, developed a strong

41:44.740 --> 41:50.280
following in the town, got everyone to start calling him daddy, and said he would be able

41:50.280 --> 41:56.800
to go back in time to fix everything as long as they got a hold of Keith Vigna.

41:56.800 --> 42:01.800
Gary then pointed them toward a blog post from Harold Dorsey that had been wiped from

42:01.800 --> 42:03.120
the internet.

42:03.120 --> 42:10.520
The post was entitled Operation Samfara Blom and a Rogue Police Chief in Contention.

42:10.520 --> 42:17.160
It described Dorsey's experiences in The Scrap Pit and The Den of Sin, as well as his new

42:17.160 --> 42:20.120
investigation in Contention.

42:20.120 --> 42:27.480
Maggie had been in touch to, quote, open people's eyes and talk to him about Samfara Blom, the

42:27.480 --> 42:33.040
flowers in the city, Jim Cook, the Circle of Knowledge, Bar Corps, and the mill on the

42:33.040 --> 42:34.920
other side of the city.

42:34.920 --> 42:39.920
Maggie appeared spooked by the murder of her father and called off the arranged meeting,

42:39.920 --> 42:42.280
so Harold was going to find her.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.200
The boys confirmed this was all true.

42:44.200 --> 42:49.120
Gary said he could get them wherever they needed to go through the tunnels, so they

42:49.120 --> 42:53.200
set off for Maggie's house and Bean's Pond.

42:53.200 --> 42:58.960
On the way, they entered an underground chamber where Gary Daley, Harry Klinker, and others

42:58.960 --> 43:01.920
had set up a makeshift campsite.

43:01.920 --> 43:07.040
As they approached, Mildred Mitchell ran into a tent away from a woman who was questioning

43:07.040 --> 43:08.040
her.

43:08.040 --> 43:14.040
Casey Kristoff, a janitor at the First Church of Contention, leaned against a column and

43:14.040 --> 43:15.880
read a book.

43:15.880 --> 43:18.600
Harry was relieved to see them all safe.

43:18.600 --> 43:22.600
Gary introduced Clara Blankenship, a woman from the city.

43:22.600 --> 43:27.800
She was here visiting friends whose cat had disappeared and who recently joined the First

43:27.800 --> 43:30.760
Creek family of contention to find the kitty.

43:30.760 --> 43:35.680
The FCFC collected all the animals in contention behind the fish wall.

43:35.680 --> 43:41.980
They discussed Clara's tattoo, which portrayed a robed figure that carried a ball of light.

43:41.980 --> 43:47.380
It was inspired by a crazy dream she'd had a couple years ago of this figure pulling

43:47.380 --> 43:51.160
a ball of light out of a television.

43:51.160 --> 43:57.020
Not really paying attention to the important conversation, Keith noticed that Casey seemed

43:57.020 --> 44:00.680
to be listening in rather than reading his book.

44:00.680 --> 44:07.700
Harry and Clark used smelling salts to rouse Drew Carey, who was over the moon to see Tyler

44:07.700 --> 44:08.700
again.

44:08.700 --> 44:14.820
She confirmed her assigned task was to bring the trio back to the FCFC so daddy could hold

44:14.820 --> 44:20.400
them accountable for the death of his family and also use Keith to time travel.

44:20.400 --> 44:26.860
The officers explained the body swap situation to the others in camp to everyone's astonishment.

44:26.860 --> 44:32.400
Then they asked Gary about his experiences with magic, the spell he cast on them as children,

44:32.400 --> 44:33.920
and the book they found.

44:33.920 --> 44:39.560
They asked Gary what he did with his spell book and he began to weep.

44:39.560 --> 44:42.960
He'd given it to Clark's parents.

44:42.960 --> 44:46.780
He was scared that's why Eunice and Jerry were killed.

44:46.780 --> 44:52.180
Gary's grandfather received the book from a figure that looked like the one on Clara's

44:52.180 --> 44:53.800
tattoo.

44:53.800 --> 44:59.540
John reported a similar figure had given him a note in binary that confessed he had killed

44:59.540 --> 45:02.020
the chief's father, Jim Cook.

45:02.020 --> 45:07.080
The figure also asked John to say hi to him for him.

45:07.080 --> 45:11.020
Clark remembered an incident in the library when he was young.

45:11.020 --> 45:12.920
Gary confirmed Clark's memory.

45:12.920 --> 45:17.220
That figure from the tattoo had locked them in the library and was chased away by the

45:17.220 --> 45:19.760
tall gaunt creatures in suits.

45:19.760 --> 45:25.400
Claire then showed them a video from John Peters that had been scrubbed from the internet.

45:25.400 --> 45:31.360
He spoke about a strange vision he had during his coma in which he was led to a parallel

45:31.360 --> 45:38.440
dimension by a man with a black Nike bag who could burn folks with his hands.

45:38.440 --> 45:42.580
Clara queried what a black Nike bag had to do with another world or a person who could

45:42.580 --> 45:45.060
burn folks with his hands.

45:45.060 --> 45:51.980
John explained his uncle, Don D. Pettymore, had the ability to burn things with his hands.

45:51.980 --> 45:57.780
Don called it devil hands and it was mostly used as a party trick so John didn't think

45:57.780 --> 45:58.780
much of it.

45:58.780 --> 46:03.360
But when Clark asked Clara if she'd seen anyone with hot hands in their dreams of the

46:03.360 --> 46:06.580
robed figure, it jogged John's mind.

46:06.580 --> 46:12.480
The last time he'd seen his uncle, they were being pursued by those translucent gaunt

46:12.480 --> 46:15.260
alien things in black suits.

46:15.260 --> 46:20.560
John needed to know more so when Keith pulled out the watch he'd stolen from Ferguson,

46:20.560 --> 46:24.120
John snatched the timepiece and slapped it on himself.

46:24.120 --> 46:29.080
The channel on John's reality began to change as expected and then it stopped and he saw

46:29.080 --> 46:32.140
the kitchen of his childhood home.

46:32.140 --> 46:37.800
His daddy, John Lee Pettymore III, younger than John ever remembered seeing him, paced

46:37.800 --> 46:39.880
back and forth anxiously.

46:39.880 --> 46:46.800
His face turned hopeful as John's mother entered the room but she slowly shook her head no

46:46.800 --> 46:50.640
and tears poured down her face.

46:50.640 --> 46:54.040
Her husband rushed to embrace his shaking wife.

46:54.040 --> 46:59.880
Her body convulsed rhythmically to the sobs as a negative pregnancy test fell from her

46:59.880 --> 47:03.000
grasp onto the cold tile floor.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.400
The channel changed.

47:04.400 --> 47:10.860
John saw his daddy again, eyes completely wide and bloodshot, knuckles white as he gripped

47:10.860 --> 47:17.460
the steering wheel of his black 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.

47:17.460 --> 47:23.660
Backlit by a home completely engulfed in flames, he looked into the rearview mirror to make

47:23.660 --> 47:26.220
sure he wasn't being followed.

47:26.220 --> 47:29.860
He spoke into a large car phone.

47:29.860 --> 47:33.380
The vector adopted by the Cain family has been eliminated.

47:33.380 --> 47:38.280
Casualties unfortunately include the rest of the family.

47:38.280 --> 47:44.840
A Fincher-esque aerial shot of this entire scene slowly zoomed in on the fire and a young

47:44.840 --> 47:49.640
boy crawled out from this completely consumed building.

47:49.640 --> 47:55.400
He had a balloon-shaped head and eyes so dark the irises looked black.

47:55.400 --> 47:59.240
Back to John's black muscle car as he drove off into the night.

47:59.240 --> 48:03.500
The camera did that cool thing where it moved through the license plate into the trunk and

48:03.500 --> 48:11.360
there a baby swaddled in a black suit jacket laid on top of adoption papers.

48:11.360 --> 48:16.180
Back in the contention sewer tunnels, the watch fell off John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth's

48:16.180 --> 48:17.180
hand.

48:17.180 --> 48:24.380
He slumped to the ground wide-eyed, dazed, and he repeated three words over and over

48:24.380 --> 48:27.980
to himself.

48:28.480 --> 48:31.140
The vector.

48:31.140 --> 48:37.280
As John dry heaved, Keith confessed he'd seen tall gaunt things in black suits when he was

48:37.280 --> 48:38.280
a kid.

48:38.280 --> 48:42.840
They'd invaded his family's estate from the sky.

48:42.840 --> 48:49.360
Alarms blared, he and Ferguson ran, security was able to take care of the translucent intruders.

48:49.360 --> 48:54.280
That night Keith watched their father give Ferguson the watch.

48:54.420 --> 48:58.540
William said Ferguson was going to be, quote, the savior.

48:58.540 --> 49:02.700
And when the time came, the watch would fit.

49:02.700 --> 49:08.660
Now that Ferguson was dead, Keith wondered if maybe he was the savior.

49:08.660 --> 49:11.620
After all, the watch did fit him.

49:11.620 --> 49:15.820
He proved it, and reality changed channels like before.

49:15.820 --> 49:19.420
Suddenly Keith saw Bean's pond.

49:19.420 --> 49:23.380
Three figures stepped over his vision toward the pond.

49:23.480 --> 49:28.080
As Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and John Lee Pettymore the Thirth approached the bank of

49:28.080 --> 49:33.000
Bean's pond, John trailed the other two by a few yards.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.200
Focused on searching for something in the water, Clark and Keith failed to see their

49:37.200 --> 49:39.600
partner betray them.

49:39.600 --> 49:46.320
John raised his gun, took a deep breath, and fired two shots, one for each of them.

49:46.320 --> 49:52.560
He quickly finished the task with four more bullets, crouched down, and pulled the watch

49:52.560 --> 49:55.420
off Keith's inert wrist.

49:55.420 --> 50:04.300
John stood, slipped the watch over his bloody hand, and walked slowly into the frigid water

50:04.300 --> 50:08.100
of Bean's pond.

50:08.100 --> 50:12.420
Clark and John saw Keith's eyes readjust to their underground reality.

50:12.420 --> 50:19.660
However, unlike the other times when one of them came out of a vision, the watch remained

50:19.660 --> 50:21.180
on his wrist.

50:21.400 --> 50:25.680
Keith and John's eyes met, and John saw a great fear.

50:25.680 --> 50:31.920
All Keith could see was the black ooze that poured from every orifice on Pettymore's face.

50:31.920 --> 50:32.920
He stammered.

50:32.920 --> 50:36.400
He'd just seen them all die at the pond.

50:36.400 --> 50:41.920
Keith turned back to the goo-covered face of his partner, John Lee Kevinmore, and weirdly

50:41.920 --> 50:46.160
asked him to please hand over his gun.

50:46.160 --> 50:52.020
John moved a hand to his holster, and everyone else in the room nervously sought cover.

50:52.020 --> 50:55.840
Keith whispered what his vision revealed into Clark's ear.

50:55.840 --> 51:01.220
The paranoia was growing, so the trio decided to share what they had seen in order to grow

51:01.220 --> 51:02.220
some trust.

51:02.220 --> 51:07.880
John said he'd seen confirmation that he was a child of destiny.

51:07.880 --> 51:13.200
His daddy, Kevin Lee Pettymore, was sent to kill the Cain family.

51:13.200 --> 51:18.420
He set fire to the house, but Adam managed to escape undetected.

51:18.420 --> 51:23.600
More importantly to Kevin, the Cains had recently adopted a little baby.

51:23.600 --> 51:27.280
Pettymore stole the baby, adoption papers and all.

51:27.280 --> 51:31.060
That baby was John Lee Pettymore IV.

51:31.060 --> 51:34.480
He was meant to be Adam Cain's brother.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.480
But he was so much more than that.

51:37.480 --> 51:45.060
In the vision, Kevin radioed over to K cell that he had quote, eliminated the vector adopted

51:45.060 --> 51:47.320
by the Cains.

51:47.320 --> 51:53.260
He, John Lee Pettymore IV, was the vector.

51:53.260 --> 51:58.720
Clark told John that Keith's vision was of Kevinmore III executing them so that he could

51:58.720 --> 52:00.780
have the watch.

52:00.780 --> 52:05.040
The three argued which of them was most likely to be the savior.

52:05.320 --> 52:10.280
Keith, whose family possessed the watch that recently stayed put on his wrist.

52:10.280 --> 52:13.360
John, the original vector, the ball.

52:13.360 --> 52:19.760
Or Clark, the overseer and future founder of the circle of knowledge in the past.

52:19.760 --> 52:25.160
The tension grew and grew until Keith silenced them with the thought that maybe the real

52:25.160 --> 52:29.340
deal here was the three of them needed to come together.

52:29.340 --> 52:32.360
Maybe they needed each other, like pieces of a puzzle.

52:32.360 --> 52:35.280
John agreed, they could all potentially be vectors.

52:35.280 --> 52:40.880
And Clark reminded them the spell Gary put on them as children was meant for all three.

52:40.880 --> 52:47.120
If there was only to be one quote, chosen one, why would the spell work on three?

52:47.120 --> 52:52.480
To make Keith feel better, John handed over his pistol but immediately regretted his decision

52:52.480 --> 52:54.560
and pleaded for its return.

52:54.560 --> 52:59.760
As the disagreement continued, the tent at the far end of the underground chamber rustled

52:59.920 --> 53:03.160
and out popped a haggard Mildred Mitchell.

53:03.160 --> 53:07.760
She held out a piece of paper in one hand but promptly put it in her back pocket and

53:07.760 --> 53:10.600
held up a picture with her other hand.

53:10.600 --> 53:15.120
Flustered, she sputtered that the picture had changed just then in the tent.

53:15.120 --> 53:19.720
She said it was John and then boom, it was Keith.

53:19.720 --> 53:24.520
Mildred shoved a picture of the founders of contention into their faces.

53:24.520 --> 53:28.200
In the picture was Silas Cole, but she was onto something.

53:28.200 --> 53:33.080
It wasn't the Silas Cole the officers remembered learning about in school.

53:33.080 --> 53:37.760
That Silas Cole was an extremely handsome man.

53:37.760 --> 53:40.740
This Silas Cole had a familiar face.

53:40.740 --> 53:42.800
It was Keith Vigna.

53:42.800 --> 53:44.640
Clark was the first to put it together.

53:44.640 --> 53:49.920
Whoever wore the watch would become Silas Cole.

53:49.920 --> 53:55.000
Mildred Mitchell shoved the picture in Keith's face and pointed to a faint reflection of

53:55.000 --> 54:00.100
a figure that resembled her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell.

54:00.100 --> 54:03.600
Mildred blamed Clark for Tildy's presence in the picture.

54:03.600 --> 54:07.860
Clark replied he wasn't the one who loaded and pulled the trigger on the strange gun

54:07.860 --> 54:09.560
that sent folks to the past.

54:09.560 --> 54:11.640
Tildy had done that herself.

54:11.640 --> 54:16.960
During this brouhaha, Keith tried to take the watch off to see how it affected the picture

54:16.960 --> 54:21.520
of himself as Silas Cole, but it didn't budge.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.440
The thing wouldn't move.

54:23.440 --> 54:29.300
Frantic, his panic grew and grew until he snapped and lunged at Mildred Mitchell.

54:29.300 --> 54:36.360
Keith tackled her to the ground and viciously slammed his fist down onto the frail old woman.

54:36.360 --> 54:42.000
Clark and John were able to pull Keith off of her, but not before he had beaten Mildred

54:42.000 --> 54:43.520
unconscious.

54:43.520 --> 54:46.960
Keith looked down at his bloody hands and puked.

54:46.960 --> 54:53.520
The sick hit a piece of paper that had fallen out of Mildred's pocket in the scuffle.

54:53.520 --> 54:55.600
On it, she had written,

54:55.600 --> 54:58.920
I'naha for Sa Saia.

54:58.920 --> 55:02.680
Harry and Gary approached with guns drawn on Keith.

55:02.680 --> 55:06.760
John put himself between them and Keith as he tried to calm tensions.

55:06.760 --> 55:13.280
Keith, frightened and embarrassed, fled down the sewer tunnel that led to Bean's Pond.

55:13.280 --> 55:18.620
Harry had a dream that if things got too heated, everyone would die.

55:18.620 --> 55:23.920
He swiftly and forcefully told the contention officers they needed to leave.

55:23.920 --> 55:30.840
Clark asked if Harry and Gary would still be willing to keep an eye on Drew Andrews.

55:30.840 --> 55:31.840
And they agreed.

55:31.840 --> 55:37.680
The air in the underground chamber was so thick with regret and loss, it was hard to

55:37.680 --> 55:39.880
breathe properly.

55:39.880 --> 55:45.840
And after turning their backs on the only citizens of contention who had trusted them,

55:45.840 --> 55:51.800
John and Clark followed Keith down the sewer tunnel toward Bean's Pond.

55:51.800 --> 55:57.600
As they walked through the underground cylinder, Keith continued his attempt to rip the watch

55:57.600 --> 56:00.040
away from the skin on his wrist.

56:00.040 --> 56:05.720
Tears streamed down his face, and Clark and John attempted to console their partner as

56:05.720 --> 56:11.760
they all avoided stepping in the shit sludge that slowly flowed between the walkways that

56:11.760 --> 56:15.600
ran along the sewers underneath contention.

56:15.600 --> 56:20.260
The trio discussed the probability of each one of them being the savior of contention

56:20.260 --> 56:22.300
and perhaps the world.

56:22.300 --> 56:28.680
John made things interesting by insisting they take bets on who was actually the chosen

56:28.680 --> 56:29.680
one.

56:29.680 --> 56:34.760
When they arrived beneath the street across from Bean's Pond, they looked out the drain

56:34.800 --> 56:39.040
and saw there was no water in the pond.

56:39.040 --> 56:41.280
It had been completely emptied.

56:41.280 --> 56:46.700
All that was left was a muddy concavity and a mostly buried metal door.

56:46.700 --> 56:51.560
But the three contention police officers saw three different additional objects at the

56:51.560 --> 56:54.200
bottom of this barren basin.

56:54.200 --> 57:00.320
Clark saw a large aquarium filled with an absurd amount of fish as well as one gaunt

57:00.320 --> 57:01.600
little boy.

57:01.760 --> 57:06.640
But there were so many fish that the boy couldn't make it up past them to break the surface.

57:06.640 --> 57:09.340
He was stuck, drowning.

57:09.340 --> 57:16.480
John saw Adam Kane wearing an odd motorcycle helmet with glass tubes and a red light lit.

57:16.480 --> 57:20.920
He drew his gun and ordered the pastor to remove his helmet.

57:20.920 --> 57:26.880
Keith saw that same helmet sitting in the mud next to the half buried door, green light lit.

57:26.880 --> 57:32.440
A gunfight broke out while the contention police officers were still very much unaware

57:32.440 --> 57:34.920
of what was real and what was not.

57:34.920 --> 57:39.680
Their grip on reality took a toll, but they were able to eliminate their opposition, which

57:39.680 --> 57:46.400
turned out to be Asher and Avery Little, the parents of the twins, Aiden and Alice Little,

57:46.400 --> 57:52.320
that unknowingly sacrificed themselves to an ooze-filled vacuum bag in an attempt to

57:52.320 --> 57:58.640
save James the mill worker, who still died just two or three episodes later.

57:58.640 --> 58:03.920
Suddenly, the trio felt their perception shift back to what they considered standard.

58:03.920 --> 58:12.080
However, that reality included a six-story-tall wall of water encircling Bean's Pond.

58:12.080 --> 58:17.160
Ice formed on the water as fish broke the surface and then broke the theory of gravity

58:17.160 --> 58:22.240
as they fell sideways back into the vertical pool.

58:22.240 --> 58:28.640
And across the empty pond on the opposite bank, just inside this water wall, Casey Kristoff

58:28.640 --> 58:34.380
held a pistol to the back of Kerry Page's body's head.

58:34.380 --> 58:40.720
Next to them, Adam Kane gripped the handlebars of the four-wheeler and donned the strange

58:40.720 --> 58:43.800
motorcycle helmet, red light lit.

58:43.800 --> 58:49.480
Strapped to the back of this four-wheeler was the unnatural radio, green light lit.

58:49.480 --> 58:57.320
And atop that bizarre electronic airwave communicator, an extremely determined black cat utilized

58:57.320 --> 59:01.440
his claws and held on tight.

59:01.440 --> 59:06.420
Surrounded by the water wall, this standoff on either side of the muddy basin stayed still

59:06.420 --> 59:11.420
for slightly a second before Keith Vigna rushed down toward the metal door buried equally

59:11.420 --> 59:13.480
in between the two groups.

59:13.480 --> 59:20.400
However, he ate shit on his drop-in and slid face-first down into the empty bowl.

59:20.400 --> 59:24.760
Pastor Adam Kane took the four-wheeler tips down directly toward Keith Vigna.

59:24.760 --> 59:30.080
Guns were drawn and aimed, but Casey Kristoff threatened to execute Drew Andrews in the

59:30.080 --> 59:36.360
body of Councilwoman Kerry Page's if Clark or John fired at Adam Kane, the former pastor

59:36.360 --> 59:42.600
of the First Church of Contention with unsettlingly black eyes and a balloon-shaped head.

59:42.600 --> 59:47.260
The current daddy of the First Creek family of contention whipped the back end of his

59:47.260 --> 59:53.580
four-wheeler around and sprayed Keith Vigna, already face-down in the stuff, with even

59:53.580 --> 59:54.960
more mud.

59:54.960 --> 01:00:00.900
And Agent Trent Chad in the body of Salem, Dr. Marie Jacobs' cat, turned on the strange

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:04.460
radio and prepared for a body swap.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.480
But Keith wasn't going to let his consciousness get ripped out and stuffed into the body of

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.140
a cat without a fight.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:15.360
He shoved his mechanical cocaine finger deep into his nasal cavity and sniffed like his

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.280
life depended on it.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:22.200
With the glass family special powder coursing through his veins, Keith pulled himself up

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:28.760
from the mud and smashed one of the odd glass tubes on the radio, just before Agent Cat

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.680
Chad could initiate the switch.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:39.760
Pastor Daddy Adam Kane, furious, grabbed a fish from his saddlebag, lifted it above his

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:46.380
head and crushed the creature over the odd motorcycle helmet, which activated the green

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.380
light.

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:52.540
And suddenly, the former contention police officers were forced to face very real visions

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.940
of their biggest regrets.

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:58.820
Clark saw the Kane family burning up in their minivan.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:04.400
John watched Aidan and Alice Little become enveloped in the ooze.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:10.340
Keith relived the murder of his only brother, Ferguson.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:16.740
When the party snapped back to their current existence, they realized time had passed.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:23.040
Agent Trent Cat had disarmed John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd, and Adam Kane was in the process

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:32.860
of dragging Keith Beans toward the half-buried metal door, which began to slowly slide open.

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:39.200
The next six seconds were an absolute whirlwind.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.400
Daddy Kane dragged Keith toward the open hatch that, for some reason, existed at the bottom

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.080
of Beans Pond.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:52.240
The sound of a fired gun matched up perfectly, with Casey Kristoff's trigger hand exploding

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.440
and spraying blood everywhere like a water balloon popped in slow motion.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.800
Drew Andrews took advantage and grabbed the fallen gun that had just been pointed at the

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.540
head of the body he occupied.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:10.900
John looked down and saw that Agent Trent Cat had filled his pistol, named Seth, coincidentally

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:15.880
the same name the Kane family originally gave to John, with mud.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:21.760
And as Keith failed in his attempt to fight off Adam Kane, the two of them crashed down

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:27.980
into the hole in the ground, and the metal plate closed back over the top of them.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:34.240
In that underground room, Keith saw that Kane had been knocked unconscious by the fall,

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.440
which broke the glass tubes fixed to the strange helmet on Adam's head.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.720
Above ground, in the muddy basin that was once Beans Pond, John Lee Kevinmore slammed

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.260
his fist down on the closed, half-buried metal door.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:56.760
With advice from John, Keith fired his pistol into both of Kane's feet, and then continued

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.980
into an elevator, his only forward path in this new and underground space.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:09.440
After he descended even further into the earth, Keith arrived at a blast door, which he opened

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:16.460
by spinning a heavy metal wheel and lifting a thick metal hatch.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:24.680
Beans entered an unfamiliar underground laboratory in a cave furnished with file-covered workstations,

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:31.260
busy shelving, and massive copper vats housed under a giant rock ceiling.

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:37.740
And across the enormous lab, there was another blast door with a round window, a porthole,

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:44.980
where the viewer could potentially see whatever it was that was being kept on the other side.

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:51.580
In the files and paperwork, Keith found blueprints for three familiar-looking objects, a gun,

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.960
a radio, and a camera.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:04:00.740
There were also a bevy of phrases listed, written in a seemingly ancient and alien language.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:07.220
The goal of one specific incantation seemed to be eternal life, but there were myriad

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.820
side effects listed.

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:15.540
Finally, Beans found the project called Manipulating Activator Robot.

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:23.900
Versions A through X were a bust, but Manipulating Activator Robot Y had been a success.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:34.480
That project created silver balls, one inch in diameter, and the acronym spelled M-A-R-Y.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.780
Mary.

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:41.420
Back above ground, John and Clark yelled to the now-safe Drew Andrews that his body was

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.600
secured down in the sewers.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.140
But suddenly, Anne Love appeared.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:52.200
She revealed herself to be Casey Kristoff's Hands Executioner, and greeted her old cellmate

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.900
Kevin as Clark aimed his weapon at this woman who murdered his parents.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:04.420
She calmly explained that had been done on orders from Jim Cook.

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:11.220
After Casell fucked over Marvin Glass by stealing all of his cocaine, Jim initiated what was

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:17.300
left of his team, literally just her, into the Circle of Knowledge.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:24.100
Down in the previously undiscovered laboratory below Beans Pond, Keith Beans recited the

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:29.180
words of the spell the document suggested imparted eternal life.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:36.540
His words, however, encouraged his bones to vibrate unnaturally, and his nails began to

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:43.960
pop off like keratin popcorn, and then BOOM, a hearty thud came.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:52.460
From something on the other side of the closed, thick metal blast door.

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:57.560
Clark Bishop, John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth, Drew Andrews and the body of Councilwoman

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:04.160
Carrie Pages, and Anne Love stood in the empty Beans Pond and traded information as Clark

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.760
and John attempted, unsuccessfully, to open the impassable metal plate.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:15.800
Clark lied when Anne asked about Leon Simpson's whereabouts, but she was practically congenial

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:21.300
as she answered questions about Maggie Cook's brutal takeover of the Circle of Knowledge,

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:28.100
and the necessary death of Maggie's own father, her and Kevin's handler and Casell, Jim Cook,

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:31.620
due to the revelations of the overseer.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:38.160
She went on about San Ferra Blum and its ability to pacify entire populations, though it didn't

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.640
work well enough on Clark's parents.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:48.120
As for Myriad, Anne believed it was a shadow organization that actually ran the government.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:53.260
Drew explained that Adam Kane performed the body switch between him and the Councilwoman

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.240
after Drew was kidnapped by Fade.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.720
Clark and John explained how to find Harry and Gary, who were babysitting Drew's body,

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:07.680
down in the sewers, and sent him off on the four-wheeler with the broken radio and Agent

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.320
Trent Catt.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:14.880
Clark Bishop and two-thirds of the bodies from Casell stared down at the impassable

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:20.600
metal plate when suddenly the water wall came crashing down.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:27.160
The pond, no longer held back unnaturally, roared back into the muddy basin it had previously

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.640
called home.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.800
Clark was able to swim through the rushing swell, but John's new body, with the modifications

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:40.080
the Glass family had implanted in Kevin, sank, unable to rise up to breach the quickly

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.960
ascending surface.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.460
But Anne Love wasn't going to let her old Casell colleagues stay down.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:52.480
She chanted in an unfamiliar tongue, Kevin Moore's heavy metal body unnaturally moved

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.520
up and after a moment emerged with a gasp for air from the bionic man.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:04.840
Anne continued her incantation and Clark watched in awe from the shore as she and John stood

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:10.800
on the surface of Bean's pond as if it were solid ground.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:18.080
Back down below the impassable metal door in the underground laboratory, a nail-free,

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:25.380
impossibly curious Keith Beans peered through the porthole on the thick metal blast door.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:31.940
On the other side, he saw a skeletal creature with skin so thin bones protruded into the

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:33.380
dank air.

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:40.460
Her nail beds matched Keith's and bruises and lesions covered the body of this teenage

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.460
girl.

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:48.520
But even through her hideous transformation, Keith recognized Tildy B. Mitchell.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:55.440
With pure hatred in her eyes, she shrieked and slammed her fragile frame into the door

01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:00.000
of her seemingly eternal prison cell.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.020
Keith startled and shaken fell backwards onto the ground.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:09.720
The watch on his wrist seemed to activate a small compartment in the ground next to

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.240
where he landed.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:18.760
In this hidden chamber, there sat an odd revolver adorned with glass tubes and a green

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.400
light lit.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.780
He searched the rest of the floor and found one more clandestine cubby which contained

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:30.660
a silver metal sphere about one inch in diameter.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:36.200
Keith pulled out the crumpled picture of himself as Silas Cole turned it over and recited the

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.440
words written by Mildred Mitchell.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.040
Again, Keith's bones vibrated.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:50.400
But then, the metal that formed his upgraded glass family body heated up and his skin,

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:56.160
starting with the coke finger, unzipped and bisected the back half from the front half

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:01.760
as all the metal detached and fell off of his skeleton.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:08.800
His alloy septum hit the ground with a clank and cocaine poured endlessly from the skinless

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.800
face.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:16.400
Empty skin just draped over a partial skeleton and then, with nerve endings still popping

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:23.300
off like the finale of a fireworks show, the pain indescribable, his bones reformed and

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:30.240
his skin sealed itself back around his natural, original physique.

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.920
Ironically though, being biologically made whole again demanded the little that was left

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.240
of Keith's mental stability.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:45.840
Unhinged, Keith walked over to the workstation, stuffed his pockets with blueprints and notes,

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:53.060
grabbed the strange gun, already loaded with an old, oddly large single bullet, smiled

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.360
and pulled the trigger.

01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:04.400
A blinding flash of light dissipated and Keith Bean stood on the dirty, sandy road to contention

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.880
in the year 1880-something.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:14.540
He immediately stripped nude, ran toward a man in the near distance and called Silas

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:21.640
Cole by name as he sucker punched this stranger whose life and name he was about to take.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:27.320
Keith snapped Cole's neck before the man could speak, rolled him over and a tri-folded piece

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.220
of parchment fell out of the jacket pocket.

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:35.700
It was a job advertisement for the contention mining company and it read,

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:45.980
We is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight, plenty of work, hesitate not.

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:52.100
Anne's miraculous rescue of John Lee Pettymore from the Bean's pond deluge left John Lee

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.780
Kevinmore III and Clark Bishop shook.

01:11:55.780 --> 01:12:00.700
Anne cackled at their shookethness and after they expressed desire to learn, she agreed

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.360
to teach them the spell.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:09.940
It allowed her to do many things, even walking through doors or leaving folks inside walls.

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.620
Clark's heart sank.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:17.340
He announced he no longer wanted to learn the incantation.

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.720
Anne turned the conversation toward the book.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.720
She needed it.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.360
The overseer was coming and if the circle of knowledge didn't have the book, Maggie

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.080
said that would be the end of everything.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:34.200
John and Clark played it cool and didn't let on that the overseer was likely standing

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.440
right in front of her.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.960
They asked what this overseer was supposed to do when he came.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:45.480
According to the revelation of the overseer, Jim would die.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:52.680
Maggie believed it was, as the phrase went, only through death that he may rise again.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.120
The overseer founded the circle of knowledge.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.280
It was only fitting he would come back at the end of everything to save it.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.080
Considering the door at the bottom of Bean's pond said Keith was the savior of the world

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:12.640
and he believed Clark to be this all-important overseer, John asked Anne if hypothetically

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:18.380
there was a third cool thing for a third special person.

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:25.040
He was given the answer when his shattered sense of self betrayed the ruse that he was

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:31.960
indeed Karen's K-cell partner, Kevin, and he revealed that he was ball.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.200
Anne was curious about its mindset.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.000
Did it think it was human?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.280
John was all too familiar with balls, or vectors as she called them.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:48.120
K-cell's mission had been to eliminate the vectors that were implanted in babies at Cole's

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:56.080
orphanage, New School under modern etiquette, and to wipe all records of its existence.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.140
John fumed.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:01.380
Clark asked Anne to define her goals.

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:06.480
The best case scenario, based on what Maggie told her, was to acquire the book in order

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.200
to summon the overseer to save the world.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.400
Anne made an offer.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.480
If they showed her the book, she would get them through the impassable metal door at

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.680
the bottom of Bean's pond.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:24.040
Clark and John turned their backs in a huddle to confer and decide the best course of action.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:31.120
A decision was not reached before a chanting Anne surprised them both by driving a large

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.480
knife down through John's skull.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:40.720
Clark speared her back down to the ground and wrapped his arms around her windpipe.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:48.320
John shot her in the knee, and Clark dug his fingers into the squirting, fresh wound.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:55.040
Anne clenched her jaw so fucking tight, her teeth shattered, and she spit the shards into

01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.600
Clark's face as she broke his grapple and resumed chanting.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:08.560
This new incantation telekinetically pushed her blade deeper into John's skull, and blood

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.040
gushed down his face like a chocolate fountain.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:17.680
As John screamed and fell to his knees, Clark saw the knife move further down through the

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.040
back of his throat.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:26.880
Anne jumped up and kicked down onto the butt of her knife, and John fell face first, unmoving

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.600
into the sloshing mud.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.800
She turned to Clark and demanded the book.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.240
He was stunned.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.480
Why did she kill John?

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.040
Her answer was simple.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.480
The vector was her mission.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:48.820
John Lee Kevinmore the Thirth, face down in the mud, felt his ball reach out to the collective

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:54.280
unconscious of the entire universe to pick out specific memories.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:16:01.040
His vision showed Gary Daley pass a book made of uncured leather with acne and stretch

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.560
marks along the binding over to Eunice and Jerry Bishop.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:11.520
Reality turned and changed, and inside the Bishop home, Clark's parents hid the book

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:20.000
in a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry below their television inside a hidden compartment

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.080
within the entertainment center.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:30.960
Barely clinging to life, John lifted his knife-clogged head from the muck in the mire

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.280
and told Anne he knew where the book was.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:43.520
Anne chanted swiftly withdrew her blade, made a bloodletting cut on her own hand, and a

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.620
stream of her blood coagulated to fill the vacant wound.

01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.100
Clark's mind snapped.

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:55.140
He ripped the knife away from Anne and mirrored her actions step by step.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:17:03.900
He chanted, made a cut on his thumb, and similarly, the blood flowed over and into John's orifices,

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:05.220
healing him.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:09.040
This new power confirmed Clark's suspicions.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.720
He was the overseer.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:17.620
He screamed as he executed the woman who killed his parents.

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:21.880
They didn't need her anymore.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:29.860
Clark Bishop plunged Anne Love's own knife into her skull, and she died.

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:35.060
As they walked to the Bishop house, the pair heard screams from the direction of the First

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.120
Church of Contention.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:44.720
Clark assured John that when they found the book, the return of the overseer, his return,

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.300
would fix everything.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:53.560
When they arrived, John revealed a false compartment beneath the television.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:59.840
Inside his entertainment center, Clark found a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.180
He remembered the words of his mother.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.260
Life is like the bonus round.

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:07.040
We were already given the best letters.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:14.700
He typed in R-S-T-L-N-E and the door unlocked.

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:21.840
Inside was a book bound in uncured leather with some acne scarring and stretch marks

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.460
on the spine.

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:28.620
Clark grabbed the book, and his vision turned blank.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:33.300
Suddenly he stood in the abandoned water park Splashylvania.

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:39.500
He looked up at the two-fanged plunge, and Julie Maxwell fired a bullet through Leo Piston.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:45.560
Clark raised his firearm and shot Julie Maxwell, whose body joined Leo's as they slumped and

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.220
slid down the pair of intertwining waterslides.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.660
Then he was in the street outside of Dr. Marie Jacobs' house.

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:59.220
He saw James the mill worker float off the ground as Aiden and Alice Little bravely held

01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:01.460
a vacuum up to the man's feet.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:08.820
The vacuum bag burst open, and a squeamish black ooze covered the twin children.

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:13.020
Clark saw the children fight violently against the muck that encompassed them.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.380
He looked over to John.

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:19.100
The residue dripped from every orifice in his face.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:24.740
With another blink, Clark sat in a cage with a gaunt young boy above a debaucherous crowd.

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:31.840
Electric shocks racked their bodies, and the ceiling slowly descended.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.700
Clark didn't want to do it, but it was either one of them died, or they both died.

01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:43.660
Clark pushed the boy back into the juice box just as the ceiling came down, and squeezed

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:47.380
the boy pulp all over the crowd below.

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:53.620
Another blink, and Clark saw himself all over CSU campus in a grotesque montage, murder

01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.540
after murder after murder.

01:19:55.540 --> 01:20:02.880
It culminated in the moment when Clark jammed a sharpened screwdriver into his own eye until

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.700
the handle was flush with his socket.

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:12.980
Blood dripped down his face, and Clark Bishop crumpled to the ground, limp and lifeless.

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:13.980
Blink.

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:17.140
Clark stood in the muddy water of Bean's pond.

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:20.860
He knew what he was capable of, what he was.

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:26.660
He buried the knife into Anne Love, the woman who murdered his parents.

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:28.260
A final blink.

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:31.060
He was back in the living room of his parents' house.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:36.500
His hands were covered in blood, and the blood moved between the covers of the book

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:41.460
and formed new pages, a record of his actions.

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:47.020
The book flung open, and these new pages flitted indecisively before they settled on a page

01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:53.000
on which Clark's blood formed the letters of a new incantation over a picture of a hooded

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.900
figure that was clearly a young Clark Bishop.

01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:02.100
Compelled, Clark chanted the spell again and again.

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:08.140
John saw a blinding flash of light, and then Clark disappeared as if he had never been

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.500
there.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.660
Clark was gone.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.560
The book was gone.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:19.420
John pressed play on the VCR, laid down on the couch, and watched some Wheel of Fortune.

01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:21.720
But Clark?

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:28.000
Clark stood in a dark alley on the night of December 1st, across from a man he recognized

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.620
as Jim Cook, the man who gave the orders to murder his parents.

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:38.920
The handler of Kacelle, a member of Myriad, the former leader of the Circle of Knowledge,

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:42.480
Maggie Cook's father, Jim Cook.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.720
Clark remembered what happened next, he'd seen it in a dream.

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:50.360
Before he could think, Clark pounced on him, his hands wrapped around Jim's neck as he

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360
growled.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.320
They didn't have to die, they didn't have to die, you couldn't find it, they didn't

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.320
have to die.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:04.000
His grip tightened, and Clark Bishop felt the passing as Jim Cook's life was extinguished.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:43.280
Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.280
little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:48.680
Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:52.200
little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:58.600
Can't you hear the wolves howlin' all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:04.200
little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:17.520
Back in 1880-something, when this land was stolen and pioneer towns began to form, Keith

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:24.760
Beans pretended to be Silas Cole as a miner in the mine that employed the town of Contingent.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:31.200
While down in the mines, Keith Bean came upon a familiar odd black substance, and he became

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.900
obsessed with studying it.

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:38.960
The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:45.480
He utilized blueprints he had stolen from the hidden laboratory underneath Beans' pond,

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:50.200
and exploited the residue's unnatural qualities.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:54.040
Silas Cole became an inventor.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:59.160
He made so much money off of his inventions that he bought the mine.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:04.440
He built an office on the top floor of the tall, skinny mining company building that

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.700
sat right above the mine itself.

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:14.080
He harvested the substance and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:21.480
Keith Beans invented wild, magical things like ceiling fans.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:28.320
Each new invention brought him wealth and power, but also released more of this inky

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:31.520
residue into his town.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:38.860
To satisfy his newfound hubris, he began working on the creation of a manipulating activator

01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:43.980
robot, or ball as they had been called in his past life.

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:49.720
Versions A through X were a bust, but Y was successful.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:57.760
The project formed a silver ball, one inch in diameter, and Mary Cole was spawned.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.180
Sometime thereafter, Keith Beans got a blast from the future, his past.

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:07.500
Tildy B. Mitchell appeared on his property in a blinding flash of light.

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:13.660
He became paranoid that townsfolk would see her and realize he was also from the future.

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:18.900
Consumed, he decided this town wasn't big enough for the two of them, and since Tildy

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:23.580
B. couldn't exist, she made for an excellent test subject.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:30.620
But some of those tests turned her real rambunctious like he went to work on building a secret,

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:37.020
subterranean workshop where he could hide her away and continue working on his inventions

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:43.900
some of which he was scared to share with his newly minted confidant, Mary Cole.

01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:49.100
But before it was finished, the mutated Tildy B. Mitchell got out and caused some real trouble.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:55.560
She'd gotten loose before and took out basically the whole saloon staff, but this?

01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:01.220
This was trouble with a capital T, which rhymed with C, and that stood for covered up barely.

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:05.900
Shoot, there were suddenly four good people missing.

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:14.820
Everett Pace, a homesteader, Professor Horace Green, a professor, Jack Perlman, a rancher,

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:21.420
and finally Preacher Sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard all disappeared.

01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:24.580
The heat was on.

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:32.420
We'll end here with the supposed words of Roy Bean, a horrible man and judge from Texas

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:38.580
known for hanging folks who actually didn't really hang many folks.

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:47.580
He allegedly said, you can't tell how good a man or a watermelon is till they get dumped.

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.580
Hmm.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:27:10.580
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.

01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:24.420
I have to hop in here to give the shoutest of outs to Haiku Jason.

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:29.480
This fucker right here helped me out Peter Gabriel style big time.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.060
They wrote six episode recaps and they were good too.

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.200
Jason earned themselves a shirt.

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:43.420
So one final thank you to Jason, I Shot Marvin, Here Be Tigers, Crush 36, Stingray, and Dylan

01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:48.440
B. Y'all made this process so much easier to bear.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.320
Shirts all around!

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.120
As for the rest of you, I sought advice from Taylor on what to say here and she said to

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.360
just be honest.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:02.680
Well, the truth is I still really love playing Delta Green with my best friends and I still

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:11.380
really love making this show, but I was completely unprepared for how much work this job over

01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.040
here in Korea was going to be.

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:19.520
I signed up for like a hundred hours a month, easy peasy I thought, but I'm basically working

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:25.600
full time with a commute on top and working with six to twelve year olds is fucking exhausting

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:30.140
and it has clearly gotten the better of me.

01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:36.040
My contract ends in a little over two months and I am looking forward to having more time

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:42.740
to deliver the quality content I believe in at the release rate I think you deserve.

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:46.300
Even more than that, I'm just fucking stoked to keep role playing with my friends on a

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.300
regular basis.

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.480
I've missed it so much.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:54.600
So while I'd love to give you an exact date for our next episode and say that we'll be

01:28:54.600 --> 01:29:01.100
back to the weekly format, I'm really afraid, like I'm really afraid I won't be able to

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:04.300
deliver and that will destroy me.

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.180
So as Taylor suggested, I'll just tell you the truth.

01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:10.320
Episode a hundred will be out as soon as I can get it finished.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.220
I'm shooting for like two weeks from now.

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:18.680
From there, I do believe we'll be able to release on a more consistent schedule, but

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:23.980
we do have some super fun irons in the fire, merch, bonus episodes, guests, it's all happening.

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:29.420
Thank you all so much who have stuck by us and continued to re-listen to all the episodes

01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:33.460
and care about this story we've spent so much time creating together.

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:39.380
I promise this is not even close to the end of pretending to be people.

01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:43.180
We have so much more smoke in the tank.

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:48.460
Honestly, the thing I'm most scared of is trying to find a jam for season two that's

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:55.640
even close to as bangin' as this new track I just heard like 85, 86 minutes ago.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:01.700
It was Kudzu with no backbone.

01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:06.220
Kudzu with no backbone.

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:10.140
Kudzu with no backbone.

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:15.260
Kudzu with no backbone.

01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:25.100
Kudzu with no backbone.

01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:28.300
Hot dog.

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:51.340
The only one trying to pull over.

01:30:51.340 --> 01:31:00.140
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:06.140
With no backbone.

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:10.140
No backbone.

01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:14.140
No backbone.

01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:18.140
No backbone.
