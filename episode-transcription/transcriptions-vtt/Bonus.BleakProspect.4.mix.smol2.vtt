00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
What's good, my nasty children?

00:02.560 --> 00:07.000
It's your busted ass ass bustin' Buster Wolf the dog.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.520
And I'm here to bust up them eardrums

00:09.520 --> 00:11.880
with my drumstick tongue.

00:11.880 --> 00:16.040
Am I Russian or am I dragon?

00:16.040 --> 00:17.320
Who can say?

00:17.320 --> 00:20.420
Prepare to get whiplashed like JK Simmons

00:20.420 --> 00:22.840
because we got a new Howlin' with Wolf.

00:22.840 --> 00:27.300
Today's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Maury from Seattle

00:27.300 --> 00:28.640
who tweeted about the show

00:28.680 --> 00:30.960
and tagged that pretendin' pod.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.200
They right.

00:32.200 --> 00:36.420
First things first, Wolf, your dulcet tones haunt my dreams

00:36.420 --> 00:39.680
and your musical taste is always on point.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.080
Much respect.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.800
Mad thanks to the PTBP crew.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.120
Y'all introduce this lifetime D&D player

00:47.120 --> 00:50.200
to the fun Delta Green has to offer.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.000
And last things last, shout out to my friends Darian,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.880
Ryan, Robbie, and Mike.

00:56.880 --> 01:00.760
You volunteered so I could learn how to be a good handler

01:00.760 --> 01:05.760
and I promise to murder you all in fun and interesting ways.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.260
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:09.260 --> 01:11.360
Thank you, Maury from Seattle.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.040
I once went to Seattle and I saw a whole bunch of crabs

01:15.040 --> 01:17.940
feasting on a mound of rotten hot dogs.

01:17.940 --> 01:21.740
Now that is a city Wolf can get inside of.

01:21.740 --> 01:25.920
If you wanna howl at your Wolf, tag us on the internet.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.080
Or write a five star review

01:28.080 --> 01:30.400
and shoot us an email or somethin'.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.360
We love hearin' from y'all.

01:32.360 --> 01:36.760
All the links are in the show notes.

01:36.760 --> 01:39.480
And while you're perusin' that vast and mysterious

01:39.480 --> 01:44.480
worldwide spider butt stuff, go ahead and do Wolf a favor.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.800
Follow at Scott Dorward on Twitter

01:47.800 --> 01:50.120
and check out his various projects,

01:50.120 --> 01:53.880
be they podcast or publication based.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.360
And maybe fill up on hugs when you feel strife.

01:57.360 --> 02:01.240
It's Grady Philip Drug with Real Life.

02:01.240 --> 02:06.240
Life, surreal, in retrospect a dream.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.880
Easy times, feel less than serene.

02:13.880 --> 02:18.880
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings

02:18.880 --> 02:23.880
so we long for days gone past us.

02:24.880 --> 02:29.880
Grief and strife, bloody, that's Real Life.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.440
All right, let's get gory and vory, baby.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.080
So the rest of you upstairs,

02:43.080 --> 02:46.840
having heard the orifice of the Earth,

02:46.840 --> 02:50.480
having heard the orifice demanding Rothstein

02:50.480 --> 02:54.160
and having lost Rothstein and his panic through the house,

02:54.160 --> 02:55.640
what are you actually doing?

02:55.640 --> 02:56.920
We gotta go.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.720
And Frederick Mellon runs downstairs, takes off running.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.360
This is the only room that we saw from the outside

03:02.360 --> 03:04.120
with a light on in it.

03:04.120 --> 03:08.000
There were other lights dotted throughout the house, yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.100
I guess I mean upstairs.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.280
No, this was the only one upstairs.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.440
Freddie, wait, what if the brain's in here too?

03:15.440 --> 03:18.960
Do we wanna kill it before we get like the kids?

03:18.960 --> 03:20.520
I don't, I really don't know.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.560
It just might be good information to have

03:22.560 --> 03:24.960
where this thing's like neurological center is.

03:24.960 --> 03:28.040
Yeah, I mean it can hear us clearly talking about it.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.920
Oh yeah, I mean.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.180
Oh yeah, sure.

03:31.180 --> 03:32.700
Well, it seems to be in a lot of pain.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.280
All it wants is Rothstein right now.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.400
It's probably not gonna answer our questions.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.040
I wanna look around and see if I can spot anything hidden

03:39.040 --> 03:41.420
that looks like some ganglia or neurons

03:41.420 --> 03:43.960
or you know, gray matter up on the ceilings.

03:43.960 --> 03:47.160
Oh, maybe that's why this room looks different color-wise.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.980
Hmm, this is the kind of thing

03:48.980 --> 03:51.700
where you should probably consult a medical doctor.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.120
Thomas Dolan, what do you know about this?

03:56.120 --> 03:58.120
I was really, I keep forgetting

03:58.120 --> 03:59.720
that they're not the same kind of doctor

03:59.720 --> 04:00.760
and I was really freaked out

04:00.760 --> 04:03.640
that our medical doctor had just run off, but.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.920
No, he's just a, you know, he's just a psychic.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.160
Doctor, Dr. Coombs, what do you think?

04:09.160 --> 04:12.680
Yeah, it's obviously,

04:12.680 --> 04:14.880
is this a first aid roll or a medicine roll?

04:14.880 --> 04:17.200
Let's say either medicine or biology.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.040
Medicine.

04:20.280 --> 04:23.360
That's a pass, a 58 on a 70.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.120
Okay, you don't see anything in the room here

04:26.120 --> 04:28.400
that looks like gray matter,

04:28.400 --> 04:31.960
but yeah, you're fairly certain that

04:33.080 --> 04:38.000
what's inside this room is maybe,

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
well, maybe working as lungs or something like lungs.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.740
We seem to be in the respiratory system here.

04:45.740 --> 04:50.360
This is all for the breathing of the apparatus here.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.680
The lung and tongue room.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.440
Lung and tongue, yeah.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.800
Maybe the brains are in the attic.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.520
Who said that?

05:02.060 --> 05:03.240
But that is a good point.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.880
Let's have listen rolls off the three of you

05:05.880 --> 05:07.180
who are upstairs.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.720
Just on the off chance you hear something useful.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.000
43 on a 50.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.680
I rolled the worst of the worst, a hundred.

05:16.680 --> 05:17.520
Oh.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.360
I also failed.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.280
Okay, Dr. Coombs is fairly certain

05:22.280 --> 05:26.400
that he has heard from deeper within the house

05:26.400 --> 05:30.820
the sound of a slow, steady heartbeat.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.920
And you may be able to identify what that is.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.100
What Freddy has heard, however,

05:37.100 --> 05:42.100
is the fairly distinctive crunch or cracking sound,

05:43.660 --> 05:46.620
despairing scream and loud splash

05:46.620 --> 05:49.660
of someone falling through the floor in the kitchen.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.660
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.980
I'm no medical doctor,

05:54.980 --> 05:59.060
but I think I just heard someone fall through

05:59.060 --> 06:01.140
that same hole that I fell through earlier.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.500
Carl must have forgotten about the lull.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.580
We should go down there.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.420
There were stairs.

06:06.580 --> 06:07.420
There were stairs down there.

06:07.420 --> 06:09.060
Maybe they lead to wherever that hole leads.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.300
You're right, we should go down the stairs.

06:11.300 --> 06:14.740
Do we wanna be in the digestive area of the home?

06:14.740 --> 06:15.860
What if, wait, real quick,

06:15.860 --> 06:17.620
while we're in this room with the mouth,

06:17.620 --> 06:20.260
what if we, I just wanna loudly say,

06:20.260 --> 06:24.380
a monster house, we don't have Rothstein.

06:24.380 --> 06:26.660
He just fell into your belly.

06:26.660 --> 06:29.620
Do not digest him, please.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.580
Or we can't give you what you want.

06:31.580 --> 06:36.380
As you say that, it takes another deep breath in.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.500
And it says something else.

06:39.500 --> 06:44.500
So hungry.

06:44.740 --> 06:48.300
And as it says that, its tongue starts coming

06:48.300 --> 06:50.300
out of its mouth and moving towards you

06:50.300 --> 06:52.300
like a huge fat worm.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.900
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.540
Out the door, out the door, out the door.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.940
So you are turning and running.

06:58.940 --> 06:59.780
Yes.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.060
Yeah. Yep, yep.

07:01.060 --> 07:01.900
Yep.

07:01.900 --> 07:06.900
Ooh, what's this?

07:08.620 --> 07:10.620
The tongue is the part you talk with,

07:10.620 --> 07:12.860
so let's stay around and try to talk with it.

07:15.660 --> 07:18.020
Yeah, I'm hauling ass for sure.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.340
Okay, and where are you hauling your ass to?

07:21.340 --> 07:23.380
Ah, it's fucking safe call.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.460
I guess we got a fucking safe call, yeah.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.940
Okay, so speaking of cowl,

07:28.940 --> 07:33.940
so you have tumbled down into the darkness below.

07:34.420 --> 07:37.340
There is pretty much no light down here.

07:37.340 --> 07:40.020
There is a faint, just a faint bit of light

07:40.020 --> 07:43.140
coming up through the hole in the ceiling above you.

07:43.140 --> 07:47.140
The good news is the landing didn't hurt.

07:47.140 --> 07:49.340
The bad news is that's because you have fallen

07:49.340 --> 07:53.180
into what feels like several feet of liquid.

07:53.180 --> 07:56.060
I mean, you've fallen below the surface

07:56.100 --> 07:59.620
and you're going to have to come back up before,

07:59.620 --> 08:01.860
obviously before you can breathe.

08:01.860 --> 08:06.100
What I guess I would like is a constitution roll

08:06.100 --> 08:09.140
just to see whether you can avoid gasping

08:09.140 --> 08:11.780
or doing anything unfortunate under the water.

08:11.780 --> 08:12.620
Oh.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.060
Sorry, I said water, it's really not water.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.380
Yeah, it's not water.

08:22.180 --> 08:24.020
I got a 60 on a 40.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.020
Oh.

08:26.020 --> 08:30.540
Okay, yeah, I mean, obviously this is a huge shock.

08:30.540 --> 08:34.780
I mean, you've not managed to get your way up

08:34.780 --> 08:35.620
to the surface.

08:35.620 --> 08:38.740
There's something bumping around overhead.

08:38.740 --> 08:42.580
You're desperately trying not to take a mouthful

08:42.580 --> 08:43.980
of whatever this is.

08:43.980 --> 08:47.180
You can try to push the roll if you want,

08:47.180 --> 08:50.900
just, yeah, but if you fail,

08:50.900 --> 08:54.380
you are absolutely taking a lung full of this.

08:55.220 --> 08:57.180
It's a 40 on a 40.

08:57.180 --> 08:58.020
Hell yeah.

08:58.020 --> 08:58.860
Fantastic.

08:58.860 --> 08:59.700
Oh, that rolls.

08:59.700 --> 09:03.180
Okay, so you managed to push your way up to the surface

09:03.180 --> 09:07.660
and you take a deep gasping breath of this foul air.

09:09.380 --> 09:13.820
But yeah, you didn't inhale any of this,

09:13.820 --> 09:18.820
which you realize is probably a really, really good thing

09:18.980 --> 09:20.780
now that you're above the surface.

09:21.620 --> 09:22.780
Because now that you're getting your bearings,

09:22.780 --> 09:26.860
you can pick up a few things, even though in the darkness.

09:26.860 --> 09:29.860
One, and possibly the most important,

09:29.860 --> 09:33.860
this liquid that you're in is caustic.

09:33.860 --> 09:36.180
It is burning your skin.

09:36.180 --> 09:37.620
It hurts.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.940
It really hurts.

09:38.940 --> 09:40.420
It's stinging your eyes.

09:40.420 --> 09:41.380
You can barely see.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.500
Your eyes are filled with tears

09:43.500 --> 09:47.340
and yeah, you can feel your skin burning.

09:47.340 --> 09:50.380
You also notice that there are other things

09:50.380 --> 09:51.220
in the liquid.

09:51.220 --> 09:53.340
The thing that was stopping you getting up

09:53.340 --> 09:57.060
was maybe an old packing crate that was floating along.

09:57.060 --> 10:01.260
There's masses of organic matter of some kind

10:01.260 --> 10:03.300
that's just floating there.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.620
Some of these solid lumps of something.

10:06.620 --> 10:11.460
And there are also other more solid things

10:11.460 --> 10:15.900
that every now and then you feel wriggling under the surface.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.660
Let's have a sanity roll.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.500
Yeah.

10:21.380 --> 10:22.540
I fail.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.780
Okay, let's have another d6 sand loss.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.540
Three.

10:27.540 --> 10:30.180
Okay, how much sand have you lost in total?

10:30.180 --> 10:32.140
Prior to this, I've lost eight.

10:32.140 --> 10:34.660
Okay, so you've lost 11 total

10:34.660 --> 10:37.340
and how much sand do you start with?

10:37.340 --> 10:38.900
40, so 29.

10:38.900 --> 10:43.100
Okay, so you are now indefinitely insane as well.

10:44.140 --> 10:49.140
So yeah, your grip on what is real and what isn't

10:49.820 --> 10:54.820
down there in the darkness is just falling apart fast.

10:56.100 --> 10:59.180
I mean, you can hear the sound of this girl sobbing,

10:59.180 --> 11:01.380
but you're not quite sure where it's coming from

11:01.380 --> 11:03.900
and every now and then you're certain

11:03.900 --> 11:07.340
you can hear other voices crying out down there.

11:07.340 --> 11:10.860
These things that are wriggling around under the surface,

11:10.860 --> 11:13.940
some of them, yeah, after your experiences

11:13.940 --> 11:17.020
with these things that can phase through matter,

11:17.060 --> 11:18.500
yeah, you're certain some of them

11:18.500 --> 11:20.860
are just wriggling inside you.

11:24.100 --> 11:28.300
Yeah, and some of the things down there,

11:28.300 --> 11:31.420
they feel almost like hands grasping at you,

11:31.420 --> 11:34.140
trying to hold you down, pull you under the surface.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.060
Jesus Christ.

11:40.660 --> 11:45.020
Okay, so Carl's not doing very good.

11:45.980 --> 11:50.020
If I can try to think about grabbing onto that

11:50.020 --> 11:53.980
floating thing and trying to hoist myself up onto it.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.820
Sure, then give me a dexterity roll

11:55.820 --> 11:58.420
to see whether you can pull yourself on top.

11:58.420 --> 12:01.500
44 on a 50, so that's a pass.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.900
Okay, that's good.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.620
Then yeah, you've managed to pull yourself on top.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.460
I mean, the top of it is slippery

12:07.460 --> 12:10.900
and the weight inside is unbalanced.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.140
You're pretty much almost pushing it

12:13.140 --> 12:14.540
completely under the surface now

12:14.540 --> 12:16.660
with your body weight displacing it,

12:16.660 --> 12:21.660
but yeah, you are largely out of the caustic liquid.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.860
You can take two hit points of damage though,

12:23.860 --> 12:26.540
just for the burns you've taken so far.

12:26.540 --> 12:27.380
Okay.

12:27.380 --> 12:31.420
And the rest of you, as you race down to the kitchen now,

12:31.420 --> 12:33.900
yeah, you can see that hole in the kitchen floor

12:33.900 --> 12:37.100
is now larger and there is definitely the sound

12:37.100 --> 12:40.580
of something large splashing around

12:40.580 --> 12:42.700
down in the liquid below.

12:43.140 --> 12:48.140
Can I try to paddle my boat over to a wall of this area?

12:49.740 --> 12:53.260
Yeah, well, let's see whether you end up,

12:53.260 --> 12:56.700
because you're operating on completely faulty

12:56.700 --> 12:59.220
sensory data at the moment, you're completely lost.

12:59.220 --> 13:00.620
Let's just have a luck roll to see

13:00.620 --> 13:02.380
whether you end up anywhere useful.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.660
No, absolutely not.

13:07.100 --> 13:11.700
Okay, so yeah, you're definitely moving.

13:13.180 --> 13:14.620
Okay.

13:14.620 --> 13:18.380
And I'm just gonna try to like use my foot as a paddle

13:18.380 --> 13:21.060
so I don't get more on my hands.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.700
So I'm just spinning around in a circle.

13:25.980 --> 13:28.700
With the skin on your ankle just getting eaten away.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.060
You can't look up and see any light.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.180
Yeah, is there any light coming in

13:38.180 --> 13:40.460
from the hole I fell into?

13:40.460 --> 13:41.660
The hole isn't above me?

13:41.660 --> 13:42.860
Yeah, not anymore.

13:43.460 --> 13:44.300
It was when you fell in,

13:44.300 --> 13:47.180
but obviously you've moved around a bit since then.

13:47.180 --> 13:50.140
Okay, so it's big enough to like have lost

13:50.140 --> 13:51.540
the whole, this room is?

13:51.540 --> 13:53.060
Yeah, you sort of become aware

13:53.060 --> 13:56.020
that it's not just like one big room,

13:56.020 --> 14:00.540
that it's sort of like a network of smaller rooms.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.820
All right, let's save the doctor, yes.

14:05.740 --> 14:07.780
He's right here, what are you talking about?

14:07.780 --> 14:08.820
He's fine, look at him.

14:08.820 --> 14:09.740
The other doctor.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.260
Oh, that's right.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.820
Doctor number two.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.900
I'm about to be.

14:17.820 --> 14:18.660
Alley-oop.

14:25.140 --> 14:27.500
All right, so that room's still real slick,

14:27.500 --> 14:30.140
so should we like crawl along the floor

14:30.140 --> 14:31.940
to look through the hole to see?

14:31.940 --> 14:33.820
We don't wanna trust the ground there though, right?

14:33.820 --> 14:36.500
Like, I mean, it just gave way under your weight, right?

14:36.500 --> 14:39.020
That's a good point, maybe we just go down the stairs.

14:39.060 --> 14:40.780
I think we should try the thing

14:40.780 --> 14:42.700
that's made to be walked down first, yeah.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.420
We've also still got the part of the hose that didn't tear.

14:45.420 --> 14:46.380
Carl.

14:46.380 --> 14:51.300
So yeah, from somewhere that you can't quite make out,

14:51.300 --> 14:54.460
just echoing through these walls all around you,

14:54.460 --> 14:58.580
you can hear the sound of your voice being called

14:58.580 --> 14:59.740
from up above.

14:59.740 --> 15:01.100
Help!

15:01.100 --> 15:05.300
I just do it once and then I listen.

15:05.300 --> 15:09.780
Almost in answer to that, you can hear another voice,

15:09.780 --> 15:13.180
the voice of a little girl from somewhere down there

15:13.180 --> 15:16.500
as well going, help, help, help.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.540
There's a little girl down here.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.740
That's not my voice, but help me.

15:24.460 --> 15:25.740
Try it in your voice.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.300
I need your help.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.340
Because?

15:32.340 --> 15:33.180
Keep going.

15:33.180 --> 15:34.500
This is a little girl.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.140
All right, we're coming.

15:41.740 --> 15:42.580
Thank you.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.140
That could be Esther, right?

15:45.140 --> 15:47.300
That could be one of the kids we're looking for.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.140
Delphinally.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.500
It'd be weird if it wasn't.

15:51.180 --> 15:52.740
So yeah, let's make our way down those stairs

15:52.740 --> 15:54.900
and see just what we see.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.620
Real quick, I don't know if it would be weird

15:56.620 --> 15:58.980
that the people who are kidnapping kids

15:58.980 --> 16:02.660
to put bugs in them, alien bugs, to steal their potential.

16:02.980 --> 16:03.820
I don't know if it would be weird

16:03.820 --> 16:06.220
if they had other kids that we don't know about.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.100
You're like, it would be weird if it wasn't Esther,

16:11.100 --> 16:13.260
but I think it would actually really follow.

16:15.380 --> 16:16.700
Anyway.

16:16.700 --> 16:17.540
I agree.

16:19.300 --> 16:23.220
But yeah, the stairs down to the cellar,

16:23.220 --> 16:25.660
you can see are covered in the same kind

16:25.660 --> 16:28.660
of slick intestinal teeth.

16:28.660 --> 16:32.140
Good thing we put these nails in our shoes, right, guys?

16:32.540 --> 16:34.780
Yeah, that was smart, but if we found a sled.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.580
Then how would that help us getting back up the stairs?

16:38.580 --> 16:40.660
Tie the hose to the sled.

16:41.540 --> 16:42.500
The hose broke.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.740
The bad hose.

16:45.740 --> 16:48.780
Let's go down these stairs with full confidence

16:48.780 --> 16:50.260
that we can get back up them.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.500
By the time you go down just a few of them,

16:53.500 --> 16:55.980
you're cut off enough from the light in the kitchen

16:55.980 --> 16:58.700
that you're in almost pitch darkness.

16:58.740 --> 17:03.540
There is that incredible smell again

17:03.540 --> 17:08.540
of just excrement and acid and just foulness.

17:10.860 --> 17:13.340
Your eyes are watering from it.

17:13.340 --> 17:16.740
And by the time you've made it down

17:16.740 --> 17:18.940
even about a half dozen stairs,

17:18.940 --> 17:22.340
you can feel that you are now stepping in liquid

17:22.340 --> 17:23.660
and it's getting deeper.

17:24.060 --> 17:29.060
I had a friend about 20 years ago, her name was Rose.

17:29.900 --> 17:33.460
She survived the Titanic by floating on a door.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.620
She told me all about it.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.580
What if we did this?

17:37.580 --> 17:39.140
What if we did the same thing?

17:39.140 --> 17:40.980
Did it fit more than one person?

17:42.540 --> 17:44.820
No, but there's a lot of doors in this house.

17:46.540 --> 17:49.140
That was actually a really sad part of a story.

17:49.140 --> 17:51.820
I don't want to make you guys cry right now.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.580
But God damn.

17:56.580 --> 18:00.340
I'm already crying because the air is so accurate.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.340
Well, imagine if you had the greatest love story

18:02.340 --> 18:05.180
of all time on top of that and it ended in tragedy.

18:05.180 --> 18:06.740
That's what happened on a whole door.

18:06.740 --> 18:08.340
So let's get three doors.

18:12.540 --> 18:16.540
I was talking about sleds earlier, we got some doors now.

18:16.540 --> 18:18.620
You're talking about sleds to get down these stairs.

18:18.620 --> 18:23.460
I wasn't saying that it was my idea to float on doors.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.020
I was just saying that we could potentially

18:26.020 --> 18:27.220
sled down the stairs.

18:27.220 --> 18:29.740
And then have sled door boats.

18:30.660 --> 18:31.980
Sled your boats.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.180
I love the idea that you're having this conversation

18:36.180 --> 18:39.660
on the stairs while Rothstein floating around in the muck,

18:39.660 --> 18:43.140
lost in a blind panic, is just overhearing little shreds

18:43.140 --> 18:45.060
of you talking about doors.

18:47.540 --> 18:48.380
And love stories.

18:48.380 --> 18:49.420
And Titanic, yeah.

18:49.420 --> 18:53.380
You brought that screwdriver.

18:53.380 --> 18:56.060
We can bust off a hinge or two real quick, right?

18:56.060 --> 18:57.580
Real quick, squeezy.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.900
Well, I think because time is a little bit

18:59.900 --> 19:02.700
of the essence here because Rothstein is slowly

19:02.700 --> 19:04.740
getting eaten away by this acid.

19:04.740 --> 19:07.340
I think with all the kicking around that you've been doing

19:07.340 --> 19:09.180
in it, trying to steer yourself, I mean,

19:09.180 --> 19:11.260
Rothstein's got to take another hit point of damage

19:11.260 --> 19:13.180
just from acid burns to his legs.

19:13.180 --> 19:14.540
Hey, I'm down to four.

19:14.540 --> 19:15.500
Four hit points?

19:15.540 --> 19:16.380
Yes.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.500
Well comment, don't worry.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.100
Maybe we should just do a one door boat

19:23.100 --> 19:25.020
and we'll try and navigate that one person

19:25.020 --> 19:26.020
through real quick.

19:26.020 --> 19:27.540
Not it.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.220
I think if you're trying to get a door off in a big hurry,

19:30.220 --> 19:32.660
I do want a mechanical repair role for this

19:32.660 --> 19:35.060
just simply because time is a factor.

19:35.060 --> 19:36.660
I believe I have that.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.780
Okay, I've got a 40 in mechanical repair.

19:39.780 --> 19:41.300
We'll see what happens.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.660
Nice.

19:42.660 --> 19:43.580
85.

19:43.580 --> 19:46.340
Yeah, the first door you go up to,

19:46.340 --> 19:49.260
the problem is that this fleshy material

19:49.260 --> 19:51.540
is covered off the hinges and you can't quite see

19:51.540 --> 19:55.220
where the screws are and yeah,

19:55.220 --> 19:59.460
this isn't really going to be a quick job.

19:59.460 --> 20:03.340
You could try potentially going for another door

20:03.340 --> 20:06.380
and pushing the roll like that, but if you fail,

20:06.380 --> 20:09.660
it's going to take way longer than you planned.

20:09.660 --> 20:10.780
Dolan, you're a strong guy.

20:10.780 --> 20:13.100
Maybe you could just like jump into the door

20:13.540 --> 20:14.380
and bust it down.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.260
I try that.

20:16.260 --> 20:17.300
Okay.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.660
Do I use size?

20:18.660 --> 20:20.580
Yeah, I'll take other sizes of strength,

20:20.580 --> 20:22.340
whichever you prefer.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.620
I'm gonna go size with a 29 on an 80.

20:25.620 --> 20:29.900
You do manage to just kick one of the doors off the hinges.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.580
I mean, obviously it gets a bit damaged in the process,

20:32.580 --> 20:34.540
but there's enough of it that you can use it

20:34.540 --> 20:36.340
as a flotation device.

20:38.260 --> 20:40.620
All right, I'll take the door.

20:41.580 --> 20:42.940
I'll float on the door.

20:43.780 --> 20:45.140
You're the perfect size for it.

20:45.140 --> 20:47.300
Well, I am quite big, but we need the dock.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.780
How big are you, Freddie?

20:48.780 --> 20:52.100
I'm smaller than you.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.020
Look at us standing here.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.260
You're right, I can tell in an instant that I'm about,

20:57.260 --> 20:59.820
you know, if you had to put us on a scale between

20:59.820 --> 21:03.300
zero and a hundred, I'd be about an 80.

21:03.300 --> 21:05.420
Yeah, I'd be somewhere around 60,

21:05.420 --> 21:07.300
probably 20 less than you.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.180
I reckon I'd be about a 60 also.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.780
Me and Freddie look about the same.

21:10.780 --> 21:11.620
Yeah, we're about the same.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.340
We're like three quarters of your size.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.060
Unfortunately, we need the doctor.

21:15.060 --> 21:16.980
So maybe you should go on the door, Freddie.

21:16.980 --> 21:17.940
All right, that's fine.

21:17.940 --> 21:20.580
And he puts the door at the top of the stairs

21:21.420 --> 21:24.460
and sits down on it and says, Rosebud.

21:25.860 --> 21:28.140
I don't think we get that reference yet.

21:32.060 --> 21:35.380
Now, I do want to say now with Dr. Rothstein down there

21:35.380 --> 21:38.260
floating on his crate in the dark and the others,

21:38.260 --> 21:40.620
you've heard the other's voices, they've come down,

21:40.620 --> 21:41.740
they've gone back up.

21:41.740 --> 21:44.700
They're having conversations up above.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.900
You can hear little snippets every now and then.

21:46.900 --> 21:50.980
They're talking about doors and boats and stuff like that.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.820
And then they come back down,

21:52.820 --> 21:56.460
but they just seem to be leaving you down here

21:56.460 --> 21:58.700
and in the dark on your own.

21:58.700 --> 22:02.060
And this acid is just eating you away.

22:02.060 --> 22:05.100
Carl thinks it's time to take matters into his own hands

22:05.100 --> 22:08.900
and really focuses on trying to get to a wall.

22:09.060 --> 22:12.340
I think if you're trying to then just focus your mind

22:12.340 --> 22:15.420
like that, that's going to be a sanity role

22:15.420 --> 22:17.380
just to see whether you can gather your wits

22:17.380 --> 22:18.740
because at the moment, yeah,

22:18.740 --> 22:21.620
and just everything is overwhelming you.

22:23.460 --> 22:25.780
I'm pretty overwhelmed still.

22:25.780 --> 22:26.940
Yeah, that's not good.

22:26.940 --> 22:29.380
Then you'd lose another point of sanity as well.

22:31.180 --> 22:34.980
Just in your mind, there's something about this.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.460
I mean, you've seen the way space gets warped

22:37.500 --> 22:41.740
by the Hawke's Device and the way that it's torn through

22:41.740 --> 22:46.300
to other realms and what if there aren't any walls down here?

22:46.300 --> 22:50.980
What if you've seen how all that's leaked out

22:50.980 --> 22:52.100
from the Hawke's Device,

22:52.100 --> 22:56.660
how it's brought other parts of this realm here.

22:56.660 --> 22:58.460
What if you're not in the cellar anymore?

22:58.460 --> 23:01.660
What if you're somewhere else just floating away

23:01.660 --> 23:05.180
further and further away from everything that you know,

23:05.180 --> 23:07.580
everything that's real, just getting lost?

23:09.940 --> 23:11.660
Don't fucking listen to him, Luke.

23:18.380 --> 23:20.260
No, I don't think I'll think that.

23:30.020 --> 23:31.900
Oh shit, dude.

23:31.900 --> 23:36.140
Yeah, Carl just continues in a circle.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.820
While spiraling in his mind.

23:41.820 --> 23:45.900
Yeah, in my just like, in fact,

23:45.900 --> 23:50.900
I just sit down on the raft like with my head in my hands.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.300
Actually, that's not a bad strategy

23:53.300 --> 23:56.100
because at least it's got your leg out of the acid now.

23:56.100 --> 24:01.100
I didn't realize you were doing it to yourself.

24:10.900 --> 24:15.900
So meanwhile, we have Freddy riding a door to victory.

24:16.860 --> 24:19.740
You've got the door, you've got it down the stairs.

24:19.740 --> 24:23.860
You can use it as a fairly unsteady raft.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.700
I'm probably going to ask for a Dex roll at some stage.

24:26.700 --> 24:27.540
Perfect.

24:27.540 --> 24:31.180
You can hear things moving around in the water.

24:32.300 --> 24:35.340
You know, some big things, some small things.

24:35.340 --> 24:39.140
You can hear the sound of the young girl crying.

24:39.140 --> 24:40.580
And now that you're down here

24:40.580 --> 24:44.180
and you've got a better ear for what's going on,

24:44.180 --> 24:47.180
you are 99% sure that the voice you can hear

24:47.180 --> 24:48.460
is that of Esther Frain.

24:48.460 --> 24:51.220
Esther, Esther, we're coming for you.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.540
We can help.

24:52.540 --> 24:55.180
Karl, Karl, we're here.

24:55.180 --> 24:56.100
I'm here.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.860
We're going to get you back out of here.

24:57.860 --> 24:58.700
Hello?

25:04.220 --> 25:05.540
Nevermind, just Esther.

25:05.540 --> 25:06.900
I'm only here for Esther.

25:10.700 --> 25:11.900
Oh, hi.

25:13.740 --> 25:14.700
I'm here.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.740
Yeah, you sound like you're losing your mind.

25:16.740 --> 25:18.780
Well, it also sounds like he is somewhere

25:18.780 --> 25:20.380
completely different in the cellars

25:20.420 --> 25:22.900
and where Esther's voice is coming from.

25:22.900 --> 25:25.780
So who are you heading towards?

25:25.780 --> 25:27.260
Who's closer?

25:27.260 --> 25:28.660
I mean, it's difficult to tell.

25:28.660 --> 25:31.900
I mean, you're judging this entirely on sound.

25:33.340 --> 25:35.060
Rothstein's voice is a bit muffled

25:35.060 --> 25:38.260
because he's obviously not in the same room as you.

25:38.260 --> 25:40.540
Esther's voice is quiet, but then again,

25:40.540 --> 25:45.020
she's a little girl and you don't have any visual cues

25:45.020 --> 25:46.660
to really get your bearings.

25:46.660 --> 25:48.540
Yeah, I'm going after Karl.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.380
Okay.

25:50.380 --> 25:51.220
First.

25:52.580 --> 25:57.580
Then, okay, you splash your way through this noxious,

25:58.020 --> 25:59.940
really acidic liquid.

25:59.940 --> 26:03.780
I mean, by the time you catch up with Karl,

26:03.780 --> 26:07.740
you are going to take one hit point's worth of damage

26:07.740 --> 26:09.620
from chemical burns.

26:09.620 --> 26:10.860
You are covered with this

26:10.860 --> 26:15.340
and as some of the liquid splashes up over the doors,

26:15.340 --> 26:19.300
every now and then you can feel things wriggling in it.

26:22.620 --> 26:24.060
That's unsettling.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.660
Well, then I guess you better make a sand roll.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.740
12 on a 63.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.980
Okay, you don't lose any sand.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.300
Nice.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.140
He's focused.

26:37.140 --> 26:41.940
Frederick Millen I is nothing if not focused

26:41.940 --> 26:45.020
and he is going toward Karl Rothstein.

26:45.540 --> 26:47.060
He thinks two heads are better than one

26:47.060 --> 26:49.660
for continuing our journey

26:49.660 --> 26:54.540
and collecting as many children as possible

26:54.540 --> 26:57.620
to save them specifically.

26:57.620 --> 27:01.100
You splash your way through the liquid

27:01.100 --> 27:05.700
and eventually navigating around a couple of open doorways.

27:05.700 --> 27:10.500
You do eventually find this little sort of cul-de-sac where...

27:10.500 --> 27:14.420
Can I like make marks with my spade from the tool shed

27:14.780 --> 27:18.300
on all the doorways that I'm crossing through

27:18.300 --> 27:19.140
on the hallways?

27:19.140 --> 27:24.140
I'm trying to make marks in the membrane to mark my path.

27:24.380 --> 27:25.980
Sure, okay.

27:25.980 --> 27:28.380
I mean, obviously you're navigating by touch,

27:30.380 --> 27:31.220
but you can try to feel for these.

27:31.220 --> 27:32.500
Oh, right, because it's pitch black.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.980
It is pitch black.

27:33.980 --> 27:35.460
But I mean, you can leave marks

27:35.460 --> 27:36.780
that you can try to feel again.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.580
Deep wounding gouges.

27:39.580 --> 27:40.420
Exactly.

27:41.260 --> 27:46.260
But yeah, yeah, you do eventually find Karl

27:47.300 --> 27:51.660
down this little cul-de-sac.

27:51.660 --> 27:52.780
Karl, thank God.

27:53.740 --> 27:54.860
Who is it?

27:54.860 --> 27:57.900
Oh yeah, he couldn't recognize me from my voice.

27:57.900 --> 27:58.740
That makes sense.

27:58.740 --> 28:00.420
It's Frederick Millen, the voice.

28:01.660 --> 28:05.300
Oh, I get my lighter out and flick it

28:05.300 --> 28:07.540
so that we can see each other.

28:07.580 --> 28:10.780
And he is just a wide-eyed, huge smile.

28:10.780 --> 28:14.860
You can see that, yeah, Rothstein in the light,

28:14.860 --> 28:19.860
yeah, his skin is just red with burns and blisters.

28:20.980 --> 28:23.220
His eyes are swollen up.

28:23.220 --> 28:25.140
We gotta get you to the real Dr. Asap.

28:25.140 --> 28:28.580
You swear you can see things wriggling in his wet hair.

28:28.580 --> 28:32.260
Maybe just run a comb through those locks real quick.

28:32.260 --> 28:34.300
Just like shake it out.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.740
I run my hand through my hair

28:36.780 --> 28:39.300
and some of it just falls out into my hand.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.140
Yep.

28:42.380 --> 28:43.220
We gotta go.

28:43.220 --> 28:47.180
And so he'll put his heels on your raft.

28:47.180 --> 28:51.900
Lock your legs with mine, put your legs on my raft.

28:51.900 --> 28:56.700
That way we both got heels on the other one's raft.

28:56.700 --> 29:00.540
I continue sitting down, just looking up at you.

29:00.540 --> 29:02.360
Karl, Karl.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.180
Whatever.

29:04.180 --> 29:06.440
Karl, you fucking idiot, we don't have much time.

29:06.980 --> 29:08.880
You put your fucking heels on this raft right now.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.200
We got children to save.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.040
We're here.

29:11.040 --> 29:11.880
You hear me?

29:11.880 --> 29:13.400
If you've given up, if you've given, look at me.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.720
See, I am here forever.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.320
That's on you, but there are other people down here

29:17.320 --> 29:20.640
who have not given up and we are going to save them.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.480
You hear me?

29:21.480 --> 29:23.400
We are going to save them.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.680
Okay, you lead the way then.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.080
And I just keep sitting.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.960
I'm gonna give you until the next room to start helping.

29:33.960 --> 29:38.960
So is Rothstein attempting to follow Freddie or?

29:43.960 --> 29:47.960
I thought that, are you staying on my raft or taking yours?

29:47.960 --> 29:48.800
No, no, no.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.320
I've still got my heels on your raft.

29:50.320 --> 29:54.320
So I'm trying to like, I'm trying to paddle backwards

29:54.320 --> 29:56.480
and drag you along with me, I guess.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.920
But I'm literally only giving you one more room

30:00.380 --> 30:01.920
and then I'm leaving you.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.120
Well, then I think, you know,

30:04.120 --> 30:06.160
particularly as you're not getting any help

30:06.160 --> 30:11.080
from Rothstein here and you're trying to pull both of these,

30:11.080 --> 30:14.560
I do want to roll just to see whether you can do this

30:14.560 --> 30:16.800
without upsetting your raft.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.400
And I think actually, because this is a feat of strength,

30:20.400 --> 30:22.360
let's do this as a strength roll.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.920
Yeah, that's worse.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.640
It's also Robin at Men in Tights style strength of feet.

30:28.640 --> 30:29.480
Oh.

30:33.600 --> 30:38.320
Okay, so I rolled a 52 on a 40.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.120
So I am going to spend 12 luck.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.520
Oh, okay.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.240
Rather than pushing this roll.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.160
Nice.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.800
So yeah, I mean, your feet almost slip off.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.000
I mean, this is really slick.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.280
And yeah, in the little bit of light

30:54.280 --> 30:58.080
that you've seen from Rothstein's Zippo.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.200
Yeah, I mean, this is absolutely smeared

31:00.200 --> 31:02.520
with what is undeniably shit.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.520
Awesome.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.680
And you've been feeling your way through.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.800
Rothstein, you don't happen to have like a snack on you

31:18.800 --> 31:20.360
or anything, I'm kind of hungry.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.280
They are just snacks in here.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.360
Oh, fuck.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.640
Once we get to the next room,

31:30.640 --> 31:34.400
I kind of snap out of it and I look at Frederick.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.360
But what do you want me to do?

31:37.360 --> 31:39.440
I've got an idea.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.800
You asked me a question and proposed your own,

31:42.800 --> 31:44.800
like you're about to keep talking.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.240
We don't have time to discuss how to talk.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.320
And that's a statement.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.800
So what's happening?

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
If we kick the stomach, maybe it will throw us up.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.280
Okay, let's go get Esther.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.880
She would get thrown up too, saved us time.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.560
Let's make sure she's with us when that happens.

32:06.560 --> 32:10.120
I stand up and start helping,

32:10.120 --> 32:11.800
but as soon as we get close to a wall,

32:11.800 --> 32:13.000
I'm gonna start kicking it.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.960
But I don't tell him that.

32:14.960 --> 32:18.200
When you say stand up, you mean in the liquid, do you?

32:18.200 --> 32:23.200
Because it's not really feasible to stand up on the raft.

32:23.240 --> 32:26.960
Then I just paddle with my leg or whatever,

32:27.040 --> 32:28.640
but don't stand up.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.200
Thank you for finally helping.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.040
Okay, now let's go.

32:32.040 --> 32:37.040
Let's, I mean, you're trying to get to the sound

32:37.760 --> 32:40.760
of Esther's crying as quickly as possible.

32:40.760 --> 32:45.760
Let's again, I think do this as a strength roll.

32:46.440 --> 32:51.440
So one of you can make this whichever one of you wants.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.000
What's your strength?

32:53.000 --> 32:54.440
I'm pretty weak.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.480
I'll do it.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.960
Okay.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.400
Because I mean, you'll get there either way,

33:00.400 --> 33:02.600
but it's just a question of how much damage

33:02.600 --> 33:05.440
you're going to take on the way from the acid.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.960
How long it all takes.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.360
47 on a 50.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.440
Ooh.

33:12.440 --> 33:17.080
So yeah, you each take one hit point of damage

33:17.080 --> 33:19.920
from the acid as you make your way across.

33:19.920 --> 33:20.760
Ouchie.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.360
I'm down to three.

33:22.360 --> 33:25.040
The skin is like completely gone from my foot.

33:25.960 --> 33:29.400
You can feel you're not quite getting the full range

33:29.400 --> 33:32.680
of mobility that you used to get in that foot now.

33:32.680 --> 33:36.800
And it's probably best not to try to think too hard

33:36.800 --> 33:38.320
about why that is.

33:43.440 --> 33:46.480
But yeah, you make your way over.

33:46.480 --> 33:51.160
Are you still using Rothstein's lighter for light

33:51.160 --> 33:53.400
or are you just checking that on when you need it?

33:53.400 --> 33:54.560
I'm keeping it on.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.480
Okay.

33:55.480 --> 33:56.480
So you keep it on.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.600
And yeah, as you get over,

33:58.600 --> 34:02.320
you can see over in the far corner,

34:03.240 --> 34:07.560
what seems to have been done is someone has built,

34:07.560 --> 34:10.840
it looks almost like a jail cell there.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.360
There are metal bars that reach all the way

34:13.360 --> 34:14.640
up to the ceiling.

34:14.640 --> 34:18.760
I mean, obviously the liquid is as high in there.

34:18.760 --> 34:23.760
You can see that Esther is there on top

34:24.720 --> 34:29.200
of a crate that she's sitting on top,

34:29.200 --> 34:31.440
just huddled, looking panicked again.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.000
She's quite badly burnt.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
There is also a shape floating in the liquid beside her,

34:39.680 --> 34:44.520
which yeah, it takes a little while to identify it

34:44.520 --> 34:46.320
even as being human,

34:47.280 --> 34:49.800
but there isn't really that much left of it.

34:49.800 --> 34:50.640
Esther!

34:51.640 --> 34:53.600
Can you get me out of here?

34:53.600 --> 34:55.440
Can you get me out of here?

34:55.440 --> 34:58.880
Yes, Frederick says confidently

34:58.880 --> 35:01.480
and begins paddling quicker and quicker

35:01.480 --> 35:03.680
to get to the metal bars.

35:03.680 --> 35:08.680
Yeah, you get up to the bars and yeah, there's a door.

35:09.960 --> 35:11.960
Now that you're closer in the light,

35:11.960 --> 35:16.960
you can see the figure that's floating face down maybe.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.680
I mean, it's difficult to tell anymore.

35:20.680 --> 35:24.760
It has got the remains of curly red hair on its head.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.720
Yeah, we didn't make it in time.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.800
Don't look down, Esther.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.640
Just look at us.

35:29.640 --> 35:30.480
We're here to save you.

35:30.480 --> 35:35.080
It's me, Frederick Mellon the first, your favorite,

35:35.080 --> 35:39.120
and Karl Rothstein, your fifth favorite.

35:39.120 --> 35:44.120
After the dead person in the water.

35:44.160 --> 35:47.960
After the dead person in the water.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.120
Nathaniel Coombs and Thomas Tullock.

35:54.120 --> 35:57.640
And yeah, I mean, you make it to the door

35:57.640 --> 35:59.600
and that's the point at which you realize

35:59.600 --> 36:01.640
that the door is locked.

36:01.640 --> 36:02.480
Well, perfect.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.680
I'm the man for the job.

36:03.680 --> 36:04.520
It's a good thing I'm the one

36:04.520 --> 36:06.040
who came down here on this door.

36:06.040 --> 36:09.520
And that the lock is not visible

36:09.520 --> 36:11.560
above the surface of this liquid.

36:11.560 --> 36:15.720
Oh, I spoke too soon.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.560
I mean, I'm still the man for the job,

36:21.560 --> 36:22.680
but I wish I wouldn't.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.600
I've been in the water.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.240
It's be careful.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.360
All right.

36:30.360 --> 36:34.400
You know, I'm doing it.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.280
Like he's not gonna not do it at this point.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.120
He's gonna just go for it.

36:38.120 --> 36:42.400
Yeah, you reckon that the lock is at least a foot

36:42.400 --> 36:45.000
below the surface of this liquid

36:45.000 --> 36:47.240
and that the only way you're going to get an angle on it

36:47.240 --> 36:49.120
is going to be to get off your raft

36:49.120 --> 36:51.560
and basically stand there up to your neck in this liquid

36:51.560 --> 36:52.720
and try to do it.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.920
How do you get a door off?

36:55.920 --> 36:56.760
What?

36:56.760 --> 36:58.720
How do you sexually pleasure a door?

37:03.120 --> 37:03.960
How?

37:03.960 --> 37:06.600
Because he said the only way to do it is to get it off.

37:07.560 --> 37:08.400
Get it?

37:08.400 --> 37:09.240
Do you get it?

37:13.240 --> 37:18.200
So, what is your plan?

37:18.200 --> 37:19.280
Are you trying to pick the lock?

37:19.280 --> 37:22.000
Are you trying to go for the hinges?

37:22.000 --> 37:22.920
What are you doing?

37:22.920 --> 37:27.320
Frederick Millen I knows the best way to break into things.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.160
So can I make an intelligence roll

37:29.160 --> 37:30.880
to see which would be easier for me?

37:30.880 --> 37:32.560
You don't need to make an intelligence roll.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.960
I'll tell you that if you're going to pick the lock,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.640
that's going to be a locksmith's roll.

37:37.640 --> 37:40.640
If you're going to try to get the hinges,

37:40.640 --> 37:42.720
you don't necessarily have the right equipment.

37:42.720 --> 37:45.200
So that's going to be a hard mechanical repair roll.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.560
Well, I'll tell you what,

37:46.560 --> 37:51.560
between having a 70% chance and a 10% chance,

37:53.840 --> 37:58.720
I will go with the 70%.

37:58.720 --> 38:03.720
Okay, so can I lay down belly first on my door

38:04.400 --> 38:09.400
and then put my hands like armpit deep into the wet?

38:11.960 --> 38:13.600
It's far enough down that if you would try

38:13.600 --> 38:14.800
to reach down that low,

38:14.800 --> 38:16.840
you'd be putting your face in this liquid.

38:19.440 --> 38:23.360
All right, then he does that first.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.520
Could try to feel around, doesn't quite get in there.

38:26.520 --> 38:29.400
And then he's like, ah, fuck, ah.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.400
It's more like putting your face in battery acid.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.240
Yeah.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.080
He's not going to actually,

38:36.080 --> 38:38.400
he's just feeling for the lock.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.480
When his nose is about to touch it,

38:40.480 --> 38:42.880
he's like, oh no, okay, I got to get in.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.680
I understand now, right?

38:48.680 --> 38:49.680
I'm with you, Scott.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.440
You said, I'm going to do that first.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.920
I was like, you're going to dip your face in the acid first?

38:54.920 --> 38:56.000
So it's more like.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.640
It's like dunking for apples,

39:00.640 --> 39:02.440
except the apples are turds.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

39:11.160 --> 39:12.000
Yeah.

39:12.920 --> 39:13.760
Okay.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.320
So yeah, go face first.

39:15.320 --> 39:19.600
Well, Frederick Mellon is not, no Lou Reed.

39:19.600 --> 39:23.120
So I'm going to go ahead and get off the door.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.320
Okay.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.240
What was it Thomas?

39:25.240 --> 39:26.520
How do I get off the door?

39:27.440 --> 39:29.280
That's what you got to figure out.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.000
Oh, you jiggle it snob.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.360
Oh, damn it.

39:37.800 --> 39:38.800
God damn it.

39:46.080 --> 39:46.920
Thank you.

39:46.920 --> 39:50.360
That's been pretending to be people with Scott Dorver.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.960
All right, I'm going feet first.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.920
So yeah, you slide off and yeah,

39:58.920 --> 40:01.840
you can, I mean, you're not that tall,

40:01.840 --> 40:05.480
but you can just keep your head above the liquid

40:05.480 --> 40:06.560
as you work.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.840
I mean, you're having to stand on tiptoes to do so,

40:08.840 --> 40:09.840
but you can.

40:12.040 --> 40:12.920
Oh, thank God.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.000
I was just really right.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.520
28 on the 70, so hard success.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.680
Oh, that's a hard success, which is good.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.560
So yeah, I mean, there, I mean,

40:20.560 --> 40:22.880
you're fumbling around with your tools,

40:22.880 --> 40:25.480
unable to see working with this acid

40:25.480 --> 40:27.880
just burning into your skin,

40:27.880 --> 40:31.240
but eventually you can feel the tumblers

40:31.560 --> 40:36.000
click into place and you can pull the door open.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.480
As you do so, the liquid moves

40:38.480 --> 40:42.360
and the floating remains of Billy Spitzer

40:42.360 --> 40:45.360
just float out past you disintegrating,

40:45.360 --> 40:48.480
you know, bits of his body going in different directions.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.320
Fuck.

40:50.320 --> 40:54.320
So he's like, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

40:54.320 --> 40:56.080
yay, oh no.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.960
Yeah, what I'll say is for the time

40:58.960 --> 41:00.920
that you're in the liquid doing all this,

41:01.480 --> 41:04.160
take a D3 hit points of damage.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.000
Okay.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.000
As you are digested.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.520
So I'm down to eight hit points from digestion burns.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.440
But yeah, I mean, Esther is there.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.840
She's still perched on top of this crate precariously.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.840
That's just looking, trying very hard

41:22.840 --> 41:25.600
not to look at the remains of Billy as they float out.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.080
Eyes on me, Esther, eyes on me, okay?

41:28.080 --> 41:29.560
We're gonna get you out of here now.

41:29.560 --> 41:32.760
Look at me, can you tell me, does that flake croak?

41:32.760 --> 41:35.680
Oh, fuck, I'm losing my mind.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.120
Does that crate float

41:37.120 --> 41:39.680
or is it just sitting on top of something?

41:39.680 --> 41:41.840
I don't know, Mr. Hut, I don't know.

41:41.840 --> 41:44.720
Is there anything around that looks like it floats

41:44.720 --> 41:47.040
that we could put her on the door?

41:47.040 --> 41:49.840
You also don't know yet that a child

41:49.840 --> 41:51.360
will overweight the door.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.920
That's a good point.

41:52.920 --> 41:56.000
Jack weighed down rows, that wasn't gonna work.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.160
But those were- He wouldn't have.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.320
I know, he did it dumb.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.160
So if this kid is smart,

42:04.040 --> 42:05.320
you guys should be fine.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.200
Okay, thank you.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.320
That makes me feel better.

42:10.320 --> 42:14.320
So Frederick will kind of push forward.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.440
Okay, just like gently shift your weight

42:17.440 --> 42:19.400
from off the box onto this door.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.800
Well, I think with you guiding her,

42:20.800 --> 42:22.360
let's have you make a Dex roll

42:22.360 --> 42:25.960
just to see whether you can do this without capsizing.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.480
Art seven, I am rocking.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.640
Fantastic, okay.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.040
So you can get both her and yourself on the door

42:32.040 --> 42:33.560
without capsizing it.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.640
All right, Carl, let's get the fuck out of here.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.040
I start kicking the wall.

42:37.040 --> 42:42.040
You kick the wall and something in your foot goes crunch.

42:42.800 --> 42:46.000
It's probably best not to think about that at the moment.

42:46.000 --> 42:46.840
Ooh.

42:48.760 --> 42:53.760
So you managed to kick your way over to the door.

42:53.800 --> 42:54.800
I mean, in the process,

42:54.800 --> 42:57.480
you are going to take another one hit point of damage each.

42:57.880 --> 42:58.960
Okay, I'm down to two.

42:59.960 --> 43:04.400
Okay, and yeah, you are going to have to help

43:04.400 --> 43:06.440
Dr. Rothstein up the stairs

43:06.440 --> 43:09.040
because the foot that he's been kicking

43:09.040 --> 43:11.160
with and navigating with,

43:11.160 --> 43:14.320
there isn't really much of it left anymore.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.000
There's certainly no flesh on it

43:16.000 --> 43:20.080
and a lot of the bones have dissolved away.

43:20.080 --> 43:24.160
It's less of a foot now and more of a nub.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.320
Oh, God.

43:28.680 --> 43:31.840
Jesus, okay, so he'll kind of like,

43:31.840 --> 43:34.720
Fredrick is just kind of like taking on both of them,

43:34.720 --> 43:37.520
you know, and is Esther strong enough to just?

43:37.520 --> 43:40.080
Yeah, you can help her up the stairs.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.880
If they get to the stairs, me and Thomas are there.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.960
I can help grab people.

43:44.960 --> 43:47.960
Fantastic, okay.

43:47.960 --> 43:51.400
Well, I mean, Dr. Coons, as he grabs hold of Esther,

43:51.400 --> 43:53.280
yeah, you can start helping her up the stairs.

43:53.600 --> 43:54.920
You've got hold of her.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.000
What you do notice as you're helping her up the stairs

43:58.000 --> 43:59.800
is under your hands,

44:00.760 --> 44:05.320
you can feel things moving beneath the surface of her skin.

44:06.760 --> 44:10.280
I try and make eye contact with one of the other guys

44:10.280 --> 44:12.880
and give kind of a knowing nod.

44:12.880 --> 44:14.320
We'll be able to take care of you.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.600
This is going to be okay.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.920
Where's Billy?

44:18.920 --> 44:19.760
Did you get Billy?

44:19.760 --> 44:21.720
He was shaking my head like.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.200
Ixnay on the, Billy Bae.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.080
What do you mean, what?

44:26.080 --> 44:29.640
Don't, no, no, just help her.

44:29.640 --> 44:30.560
You went down there.

44:30.560 --> 44:33.480
I punched the dog in the side of the arm.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.920
Esther seems to be pretty much in a fugue state

44:35.920 --> 44:37.240
at this moment.

44:37.240 --> 44:41.320
And by the time you get everyone back up to the kitchen,

44:41.320 --> 44:44.160
there's now enough light that, yeah,

44:44.160 --> 44:47.800
you can see that there are things now moving around

44:47.800 --> 44:49.240
underneath her skin.

44:50.240 --> 44:53.960
You can also see that this is also very much true

44:53.960 --> 44:56.920
of Dr. Rothstein and Freddy.

44:56.920 --> 45:01.480
Oh, no, guys, I don't know what to say.

45:01.480 --> 45:04.760
Clearly you've got things moving under your skin,

45:04.760 --> 45:06.040
probably those bugs.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.960
What if we try to force up them out of you?

45:09.960 --> 45:12.720
Do you consent to that?

45:12.720 --> 45:14.520
The things you can see moving around

45:14.520 --> 45:16.920
are much, much smaller than that.

45:17.920 --> 45:22.480
In fact, what Thomas thinks of very much

45:22.480 --> 45:24.160
is the thing that he saw crawling out

45:24.160 --> 45:25.880
of the man's eye outside.

45:28.360 --> 45:32.360
Doc, do we just shove them down the stairs?

45:36.720 --> 45:38.360
And hope they get digested?

45:41.400 --> 45:44.880
I can't, I swore on oath.

45:44.880 --> 45:49.880
I don't know, but we can't let that get into the camp.

45:51.960 --> 45:53.840
All right, you guys ready to go?

45:53.840 --> 45:54.920
One second.

45:57.960 --> 46:00.120
I need to get to a hospital.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.480
I'm as good as a hospital.

46:01.480 --> 46:04.800
You're okay in my hands.

46:04.800 --> 46:09.400
But they have with medicine, I'm in pain.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.960
And then I point at my foot.

46:11.000 --> 46:11.840
Oh.

46:14.360 --> 46:17.600
Yeah, like I say, foot is overstating it.

46:23.600 --> 46:26.200
What if we quarantine them?

46:26.200 --> 46:29.080
We put them in the lab back there.

46:29.080 --> 46:30.280
We can keep them in there.

46:30.280 --> 46:31.520
I can run some tests.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.680
Quarantine who?

46:35.080 --> 46:35.920
Hold on.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.600
The little girl?

46:37.600 --> 46:39.640
Yeah, yeah.

46:39.640 --> 46:40.480
Why?

46:41.360 --> 46:43.840
She's got some things moving around under her skin.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.880
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.280
Right.

46:50.800 --> 46:54.040
I truly support quarantine for that.

46:54.040 --> 46:57.560
For anybody who's got things moving around under the skin.

46:57.560 --> 46:58.960
Oh my God.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.800
This would be no exercise.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.720
Doc, you know what I just noticed?

47:04.160 --> 47:05.120
This is crazy.

47:05.120 --> 47:06.640
You've got them too.

47:06.640 --> 47:07.640
No, I don't.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.400
No, yeah.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.400
Yeah, they're there.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.800
Maybe we'll start with the little girl as a trial

47:14.800 --> 47:16.000
to see how it goes.

47:17.360 --> 47:19.200
Why don't you, okay, yeah.

47:19.200 --> 47:22.160
Why don't you be the one in there observing her?

47:22.160 --> 47:24.120
There should be exceptions.

47:24.120 --> 47:27.920
So with the idea that we got like a few minutes to end this,

47:27.920 --> 47:30.800
what is your plan at this stage?

47:32.880 --> 47:33.840
Oh God.

47:33.840 --> 47:35.880
I mean, I want to kick him down the stairs

47:35.880 --> 47:37.080
and let him get digested.

47:37.640 --> 47:42.640
All of them.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
It would be so insanely out of character

47:45.000 --> 47:47.040
for Dr. Coombs to be okay with that.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.400
Okay, so it's a contested role

47:51.400 --> 47:53.360
where I see if I can kick you down too.

47:57.600 --> 48:00.760
Now, let me give another idea here

48:00.760 --> 48:04.040
because I think we'll probably want to do some wrap up

48:04.040 --> 48:06.080
and talk about the scenario and stuff.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.760
So are you cool with doing another session?

48:08.760 --> 48:10.480
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:10.480 --> 48:11.320
Perfect, cool.

48:11.320 --> 48:12.440
That does give you a week to see

48:12.440 --> 48:13.800
whether there's anything you might be able to do

48:13.800 --> 48:15.160
about this situation.

48:16.080 --> 48:18.800
Yes, maybe sleep on this decision.

48:20.960 --> 48:23.960
I'm not saying kicking them down the stairs is a bad idea.

48:23.960 --> 48:26.080
I mean, it's probably what I'd do.

48:26.080 --> 48:27.840
I think from a role-playing perspective,

48:27.840 --> 48:29.000
it's a very smart idea.

48:31.680 --> 48:33.920
The only way I'd differ from that personally

48:33.920 --> 48:35.640
if I were playing this is I wouldn't kick them

48:36.160 --> 48:38.200
down the stairs when there's a nice handy hole in the floor

48:38.200 --> 48:40.000
that I could just push them through.

48:41.800 --> 48:44.440
My opinion is if I were you, that's what I would do,

48:44.440 --> 48:46.440
but you shouldn't do it.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.520
Don't do it to me.

48:52.080 --> 48:54.400
You've got a week to find out a convincing way

48:54.400 --> 48:56.160
to save the girl and yourselves.

48:56.160 --> 48:59.200
No, my first thought was to take you down with me.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.600
We're pretty well fucked.

49:08.800 --> 49:11.080
Not if you guys just stay in this house.

49:11.080 --> 49:14.800
I'm not saying that this always ends in the TPK,

49:14.800 --> 49:19.800
but I have had actual play reports from other groups

49:20.800 --> 49:24.120
that have managed to get into some of the situation than you

49:24.120 --> 49:28.280
and actually managed to contrive a positive outcome.

49:28.280 --> 49:31.120
It's never happened when I've run it because I'm a bastard.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.920
Apparently it does happen sometimes.

49:36.600 --> 49:37.680
That's great.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.840
30 seconds of absolute silence.

49:51.720 --> 49:54.200
You're just waiting for us to talk now, aren't you?

49:54.200 --> 49:55.800
Yeah, yeah.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.320
I knew it was gonna be Thomas that broke, but.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.480
I can see the time in audacity, man.

50:01.480 --> 50:05.480
I'm not numbers blind.

50:05.560 --> 50:06.600
Is there a word for that?

50:06.600 --> 50:07.880
Yeah.

50:07.880 --> 50:11.720
Is it neumlexia, neumslex, neumaslexia?

50:11.720 --> 50:14.160
Is it, well, it'll be the lex part that's different

50:14.160 --> 50:17.680
because lex means kind of letters or.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.000
Letter or word, yeah.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.480
So dyspneumia or something like that, I guess.

50:22.480 --> 50:23.320
Dyspneumia.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.880
It's always good to start out with a fun fact,

50:25.880 --> 50:27.920
regardless of if we know it or not.

50:27.920 --> 50:28.760
Yeah.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.760
Regardless of if it's a fact.

50:31.760 --> 50:34.120
Hey, listener, Google that.

50:35.080 --> 50:36.840
See, you learned something.

50:36.840 --> 50:39.040
Welcome back to the middle of this episode.

50:40.360 --> 50:43.360
Yeah, and it's been a few weeks since we recorded, so.

50:43.360 --> 50:48.000
It's, sorry to interrupt right while we get things going,

50:48.000 --> 50:49.280
but it's a dyscalculia.

50:49.280 --> 50:50.120
Dyscalculia.

50:50.120 --> 50:54.120
Aha, okay, that does make sense.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.680
Right, well, now that we've got the rehearsal.

50:57.680 --> 50:58.520
Yeah.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.440
Like a Snapple bottle cup.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.120
That's me.

51:09.080 --> 51:11.200
So yeah, last episode, I think we'd left,

51:11.200 --> 51:12.880
or rather, last recording session,

51:12.880 --> 51:17.360
I think we'd left it so that you'd just recovered Esther

51:17.360 --> 51:19.360
from the flooded cellar.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.920
Yes, the boys floated away in bits.

51:21.920 --> 51:23.920
Yeah, yeah, poor Billy.

51:23.920 --> 51:27.120
But Esther, you did manage to get out in one piece.

51:27.520 --> 51:31.760
The problem is that there are perhaps now too many pieces

51:31.760 --> 51:35.800
that she does seem to be crawling with parasites,

51:35.800 --> 51:38.120
as are some of you.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.720
We left it, I think, with you in the kitchen,

51:40.720 --> 51:42.920
having just made this discovery

51:42.920 --> 51:45.760
that basically everyone who's been down to the cellar

51:45.760 --> 51:47.920
is now infested.

51:47.920 --> 51:50.600
So, what now?

51:50.600 --> 51:53.320
Yeah, we were discussing being rightly fucked.

51:53.320 --> 51:54.160
Mm.

51:55.880 --> 51:58.920
I believe there is a look in Thomas Dolan's eyes

51:58.920 --> 52:02.320
that said he wanted to push us down the stairs

52:02.320 --> 52:04.440
or through the hole in the floor.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.000
Oh yes, yes, yes.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.280
And, you know, maybe he does that.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.960
Why don't you give me one good reason not to do that?

52:11.960 --> 52:15.520
She's a child, we can't just throw her down there.

52:15.520 --> 52:16.960
That's barbaric.

52:16.960 --> 52:19.280
Regardless of the child, okay?

52:19.280 --> 52:20.960
Look at me, look at me.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
We were up in that room and we talked to this fucking house

52:24.000 --> 52:25.680
and you know what we had?

52:25.680 --> 52:26.520
A connection.

52:26.520 --> 52:29.600
Not what the house wanted.

52:29.600 --> 52:31.080
What did the house want?

52:31.080 --> 52:34.080
It said a name multiple times.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.200
It wanted to talk to...

52:36.200 --> 52:40.480
And I start tapping Luke Gintman on the head.

52:40.480 --> 52:43.080
Your character name's not- Karl Rothstein.

52:43.080 --> 52:44.960
Karl Rothstein, yeah.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.560
I start tapping him on the head.

52:46.560 --> 52:49.720
Okay, then I push the doctor down the stairs.

52:49.720 --> 52:50.920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

52:50.920 --> 52:53.000
As you like going to do that, I'm like, no, no, no.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.600
He wanted to talk to him.

52:54.600 --> 52:57.760
The house wanted to talk to Karl Rothstein.

52:57.760 --> 52:58.640
It didn't want to eat him.

52:58.640 --> 53:01.040
It was lamenting the fact that it was so hungry,

53:01.040 --> 53:02.240
in one man's opinion.

53:02.240 --> 53:05.280
I will talk to it.

53:05.280 --> 53:06.840
Hello, hello.

53:06.840 --> 53:09.000
That's what I'm talking about.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.520
I kind of whispered to Karl Rothstein.

53:10.520 --> 53:13.320
I'm like, anything to keep them from pushing us down

53:13.320 --> 53:15.160
into the digestive acid again, you know?

53:15.160 --> 53:18.480
Yes, that was uncomfortable.

53:18.480 --> 53:20.400
Yeah, let's go talk to the tongue.

53:20.400 --> 53:23.000
Oh, take me away.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.440
Yeah, let's see what the tongue,

53:25.440 --> 53:27.120
the house tongue has to say.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.240
Doc, you don't think we should just push these fuckers

53:29.240 --> 53:30.880
down the stairs and be done with it?

53:30.880 --> 53:33.120
I mean, I'm a doctor.

53:33.120 --> 53:35.200
I would prefer to save people.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.200
Yeah, the house is starving to death.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.880
You're not going to save the house?

53:38.880 --> 53:41.640
The trolley problem here.

53:41.640 --> 53:44.120
Two assholes or one house, you know?

53:44.120 --> 53:45.320
Which lever are you going to pull?

53:45.320 --> 53:47.480
There's a chance that the house knows how

53:48.080 --> 53:49.200
to be not a house.

53:49.200 --> 53:52.400
Maybe Karl knows something about this house being

53:52.400 --> 53:53.840
a person house.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.320
That's right, the psychic might be able

53:55.320 --> 53:56.720
to help him be person again.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.320
All right, well, we got him right by these stairs.

53:58.320 --> 54:00.000
It just seems like a real good opportunity

54:00.000 --> 54:02.520
to just shove him down there and get the fuck out of here.

54:02.520 --> 54:04.000
The stairs also go up.

54:05.800 --> 54:09.600
All right, well, can you guys just promise

54:09.600 --> 54:12.040
that if this doesn't work out,

54:12.040 --> 54:14.280
you'll be cool about coming back down

54:14.280 --> 54:16.080
and meeting right here where we are now

54:16.080 --> 54:18.280
and then we push you down this test.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.120
Sure.

54:20.240 --> 54:22.080
We'll be really cool about quarantining

54:22.080 --> 54:25.080
in that stone slab where we saw that big fish.

54:25.080 --> 54:26.160
We could go into the lab.

54:26.160 --> 54:29.200
I'm perfectly fine if you want to put me in the lab

54:29.200 --> 54:30.920
after all this is said and done.

54:30.920 --> 54:34.240
But until then, let's at least try to talk to the house

54:34.240 --> 54:36.360
and see if the house and Karl Rothstein can work out

54:36.360 --> 54:38.200
between the two of them,

54:38.200 --> 54:40.640
how we can make this a better situation

54:40.640 --> 54:43.920
for all the little fishies living inside.

54:43.920 --> 54:44.760
Okay.

54:45.440 --> 54:46.360
My body.

54:46.360 --> 54:49.720
Yes, if you head up stairs again,

54:49.720 --> 54:53.800
obviously you can still feel the warm breath of the house

54:53.800 --> 54:56.320
moving through the corridor.

54:57.200 --> 55:02.200
And as you get back up to the top of the stairs,

55:03.480 --> 55:07.920
yeah, there is still that mouth visible in the wall

55:07.920 --> 55:10.600
through the double doors of the master bedroom.

55:10.600 --> 55:12.160
I don't think we have to be near it

55:12.160 --> 55:14.200
in order to talk to it, personally.

55:14.280 --> 55:18.240
I open the double doors up and walk into that room.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.240
You've, you've wanted to see me?

55:20.240 --> 55:25.200
Yeah, there is this long, long breath that just goes,

55:25.200 --> 55:26.040
Rothstein.

55:31.960 --> 55:32.800
Karl's like trembling.

55:32.800 --> 55:33.640
Save me.

55:38.720 --> 55:41.320
Where are you?

55:41.320 --> 55:46.320
I, I don't know.

55:48.480 --> 55:53.480
This is strange and frightening and I am so very hungry.

55:56.480 --> 56:01.240
Come closer, Rothstein, come closer.

56:01.240 --> 56:04.360
Karl gets a little closer.

56:04.360 --> 56:09.360
Okay, you can see the tongue lolling out of the mouth.

56:09.680 --> 56:14.160
It doesn't seem to be lashing out and trying to grab you,

56:14.160 --> 56:16.080
but at the same time,

56:16.080 --> 56:18.880
it is making tentative little explorations

56:18.880 --> 56:22.520
in your direction, like this monstrous worm

56:22.520 --> 56:25.600
just flapping across the ground.

56:25.600 --> 56:26.440
Foreplay.

56:28.200 --> 56:32.160
Yeah, Karl is just like inching a little closer, like,

56:33.040 --> 56:38.040
uh, um, look, you've got to tell me where you are

56:38.040 --> 56:39.960
so I can find you or help you.

56:39.960 --> 56:43.440
I, I don't know.

56:43.440 --> 56:46.320
I don't know where I am.

56:47.600 --> 56:51.320
I don't know who I am anymore.

56:52.600 --> 56:56.480
Rothstein, I don't know what I am.

56:57.880 --> 57:00.680
It has been so very long.

57:02.160 --> 57:03.760
Well, Karl, it seems like you and this house

57:03.760 --> 57:04.920
have a lot of catching up to do.

57:04.920 --> 57:07.320
So I'm, I'm just gonna split.

57:09.960 --> 57:14.640
I think we've got to find the house.

57:14.640 --> 57:15.920
Austin Hawks.

57:15.920 --> 57:16.880
That's what I said.

57:16.880 --> 57:18.280
We've got to find the Hawks.

57:19.280 --> 57:22.920
When Karl and Frederick both say Austin Hawks in the room,

57:22.920 --> 57:25.840
does the room react to that name?

57:27.000 --> 57:28.320
Not especially.

57:28.320 --> 57:31.720
Can you describe where you, what's around you?

57:32.800 --> 57:34.400
House, man.

57:37.840 --> 57:42.000
Everything is so strange.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.000
I, I am, I am just so hungry.

57:48.680 --> 57:52.320
He says, as his tongue reaches out towards you.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.800
I slap the tongue.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.760
OK, but you're standing your ground.

58:00.760 --> 58:06.240
Yeah, let's, let's do this then as an opposed fighting brawl

58:06.240 --> 58:09.400
roll, just to see whether you can discourage the tongue

58:09.400 --> 58:11.000
from wrapping itself around you.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.400
Because at the moment, this is a little more tentative

58:14.400 --> 58:16.680
than his previous attack.

58:16.680 --> 58:19.400
But on the other hand, you know, it's still,

58:19.400 --> 58:21.040
I think it still wants to eat you.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.880
Yeah, I crit, failed.

58:26.440 --> 58:27.880
So what, what did you roll?

58:27.880 --> 58:29.280
A 44.

58:29.440 --> 58:30.200
Oh, that's fine.

58:30.200 --> 58:32.240
Oh, that's not, that's Delta Green.

58:32.240 --> 58:33.160
That's just a failure.

58:33.160 --> 58:34.440
Oh, that's Delta Green.

58:34.440 --> 58:37.840
Yeah. OK, I just failed regularly then.

58:37.840 --> 58:40.240
Yeah, on the other hand, I rolled a 98.

58:40.240 --> 58:44.120
So yeah, you slap at the tongue.

58:44.120 --> 58:47.120
You're not exactly a powerfully built man

58:47.120 --> 58:49.640
and you're a bit worse for wear.

58:49.640 --> 58:52.840
But on the other hand, as this monstrous, flopping,

58:52.840 --> 58:56.080
muscular tongue comes towards you, you slap at it.

58:56.080 --> 58:58.080
And it just instinctively recoils

58:58.120 --> 59:00.040
and slithers back into the mouth.

59:00.040 --> 59:01.560
Don't get too close to me.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.240
I'm trying to help you.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.840
Maybe ask its name, Doc.

59:04.840 --> 59:06.480
What is your name?

59:06.480 --> 59:07.320
Thanks.

59:07.320 --> 59:10.360
You know me, Rothstein.

59:10.360 --> 59:12.360
We're all like standing at the doorway.

59:14.080 --> 59:17.240
Greek chorus gathered in the corridor outside.

59:17.240 --> 59:18.880
Three heads on top of each other,

59:18.880 --> 59:20.240
peeking around the corner.

59:23.520 --> 59:26.680
You know me, Rothstein.

59:26.680 --> 59:29.600
You know me.

59:29.600 --> 59:32.880
This is my house, Rothstein.

59:32.880 --> 59:35.760
This is my house.

59:35.760 --> 59:39.360
Hawks. Hawks, is that you?

59:40.000 --> 59:42.640
Yes. Yes, that is.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.720
That is my name. Yes.

59:45.720 --> 59:48.520
How has this happened?

59:48.520 --> 59:51.240
Was it the portal? Yes.

59:52.200 --> 59:55.040
Yes, it was.

59:55.080 --> 59:57.880
I stepped through and

59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.320
I was trapped there.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.360
I was trapped somewhere else

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.880
for so very long until

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.640
until I found a way back.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.520
Am I back, Rothstein?

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.280
Am I back?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.520
Am I home now?

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.200
Literally.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.320
I'm so very hungry, Rothstein.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.120
What sounds good?

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.720
Oh, Scott almost spit out his tea.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.680
I'm so hungry, Rothstein.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.040
What sounds good?

01:00:53.320 --> 01:01:01.400
Bring me something to eat, Rothstein.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.600
Bring me something to eat and we can talk.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.120
OK, are the rest of the guys like behind me?

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.960
Are they in the room or where are you guys?

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.680
We're doing the Beatles photo at the door jamb.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.280
Yeah, so you're out on the landing.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.960
Actually, the three of you who aren't involved in the conversation.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.240
Can you give me listen rolls?

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.160
Oh, hell yeah, dude, these ears.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.680
33 on a 50.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.480
Oh, fail.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.320
I failed mine.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.720
OK, you're fairly certain

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.280
that you can hear a car coming up the driveway.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.920
Everybody hear that?

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.160
Yeah, the house is hungry.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.040
Yes, the house is hungry.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.520
But also there's a vroom vroom coming up the bale.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.040
We got a we got we got a car coming up the chute.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.520
Oh, vroom vroom.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.320
Yeah, I didn't look up any slang from this time period,

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.480
so I figured I'd make it up on the fly.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.840
That that that that could be good.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.000
It could be somebody who's in on on all this on all this terribleness.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.440
And or it could be a bad situation who put Austin Hawks in the portal.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.040
So he'd be a good guy to feed to him.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.960
Right. And yeah, maybe we feed him to the house.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.480
Exactly. Yes, we feed him to this giant tongue.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.520
And by the way, around here in these times, they're called

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.720
Chitty Chitty Bang Bangs.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.160
Coombes is going to try and go to the nearest window

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.480
that would look out toward the drive and see what he sees.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.840
Yeah. Yeah. Go out to the window and push the the rather moist

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.400
and meaty curtains aside and take a look out.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.560
And yeah, there is a car inching up the driveway.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.520
Does it look is it just driving up like it would drive up normally

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.040
or is it being sneaky?

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.360
I mean, the lights are on, so it's not be that sneaky.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.360
But on the other hand, it is driving fairly slowly.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.760
Yeah, there's definitely a room of room coming up.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.200
A Chitty Chitty Bang Bang up the up the chute, like it like you said.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.880
The chute. Maybe dinner is delivery tonight.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.040
What should we do? Should we should we meet him?

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.280
Should we meet him at the door downstairs?

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.160
Maybe the house knows where the guns are in the house.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.560
If there were guns in me, I'd know where they were.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.600
This house barely knew it was a house.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.160
Do you know where guns might be in the house? House?

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.240
Hawks? There is just no response to that.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.400
You know what? That's fair.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.240
Does this does this window we're looking at the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang out of?

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.880
Does it open up?

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:45.120
Give me a strength roll to see if it does.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.960
I mean, it's not locked, but on the other hand, it is kind of scabbed over.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.480
Right. Nope, 86.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:00.760
Yeah, I mean, you try and it almost moves, but there's these fleshy strands

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:04.000
that just push it back down again every time you try.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.440
I'm just going to shout out to come up here in a minute.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.440
So you can see what the car is doing is it's pulling over by

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:22.600
the the laboratory outside and in the light that's coming out from the windows of the

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.680
house, you can see that there is a man who's got out.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.840
He's wearing a fairly nice suit.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.400
You can't really make out who he is because he's wearing a mask over his face or at

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.560
least some cloth tied around a bandana, tied around his face.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:51.800
As he gets out, he's got an electric lantern in one hand and you can just make out he's

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.040
definitely got a revolver in the other hand and he's looking around.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.720
I mean, you can't read the expression on his face because all we can see is his eyes,

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:09.400
but from his body language, he's cautious, nervous, just trying to, I guess, make out

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.360
what's going on.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.040
He spotted our caddy.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:17.560
He's going to be disappointed when he finds that that skinless monkey creature in the

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.200
tank is all smashed to bits.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.600
Well, you shouldn't just leave those things lying around.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.640
Yeah, I mean, if you carry on watching from the window behind, he goes over to the

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.920
laboratory, opens up the door and heads in there.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.920
There's a chance that this person maybe knows more about this stuff.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.920
They might have a solution for the little parasite problem we've got on our hands.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.560
Do you think it's worth trying to talk to him?

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.000
As opposed to what?

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.880
Kidnapping him and throwing him in a house mouth?

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.880
Yeah, just instant hostility like we would treat most NPCs.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:06:00.680
Maybe we should talk to him and then back up plan V feed him to the house.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.880
I like this idea.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.400
I mean, it's pretty zany.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.040
It's pretty out there talking, you know.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.920
All right, but let's give it a whirl.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.640
We don't have any like weapons or anything.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.480
So they have numbers.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.400
Yeah, four on one.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.520
That's a lot of talking we can do.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.680
He doesn't know that there's four of us.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.440
So maybe one of us could like hide behind the lab.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.640
And if things go south, they'll just sneak up on him from behind.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.840
Yeah, I'm pretty good at sneaking.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:31.600
Let's try.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.280
Let's try that.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.480
Let's let's do it.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.520
What are you doing with Esther?

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:43.120
Throughout this plan, because you do have a frightened and rather ill 12 year old girl with you as well.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.320
I just assumed she was sitting on my shoulders.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.520
We needed a fourth for the Beatles photo.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:54.720
We could maybe have Esther wait in the car.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.160
No other ideas.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.520
That sounds like the best one.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.440
We could feed it.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.800
We could feed it to the mouth.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.000
Well, you see, that was kind of the whole point of the day.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:09.680
Yeah, but I mean, now there's this whole mouth thing.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:15.400
I feel like it would be a total waste of time if we gave her back.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:27.200
Yeah, we could have just stayed home, slept, drank bad coffee, gone to a different overville that wasn't being taken over by puppets with no faces.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.000
Yeah, but remember when we shot that guy?

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.400
Yeah, that was crazy.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.280
What a day.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:42.760
But with a shotgun call, we threatened to do the same to you.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.840
And it's how we got you to come along on this adventure.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.440
Esther, look at me.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:53.520
This house is a person and you've been trying to be digested by that person, right?

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.240
Right.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:57.760
Okay.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.440
So what we're going to do is we're going to go down to the front door.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.240
All right.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.760
And we're going to find a spot for you that seems like you'll be fine there.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.920
And you're just going to sit on the floor and you'll be right next to the front door.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.200
So on our way out, as we're leaving, you just come with us.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.680
We're going to get into a very nice car.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.400
When was the last time you were in a nice car, Esther?

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.320
Oh, don't answer that.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.800
It was probably when you were being kidnapped.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.360
When would it'll be comfortable?

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:36.360
Sometimes when I keep talking, I dig a hole for myself, but I think everything will be fine.

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:36.800
Look at me.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.640
Everything will be fine.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.040
Look at me.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040
Everything will be fine.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.080
Everything will be fine.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.760
And he just pats her on the head.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:51.320
I think this is a good opportunity for you to make either a charm or a persuade role to see whether you can calm her down enough to sit there and wait patiently while you do this.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.920
Uh, well, this isn't great because looking at my homemade character sheet here.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.520
I'm going to have to ask somebody else.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.040
What are the baseline for charm or persuade?

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.480
Uh, persuade, persuade baseline is 10.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.160
I've got, I've got some charms.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.920
I don't know what the baseline is.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:11.880
Regardless.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.320
I rolled an 89.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.600
Yeah, it is certainly hard than that.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.720
I think the baseline for charm is 20, but are you sure it's not 90?

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.880
Everybody in the world is charming as fuck.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.160
It's a useless skill.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.760
You know, Call of Cthulhu.

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:50.000
So, Esther, she seems to listen to you and she, she certainly goes quiet at this stage, but at the same time, you can see that she's still very jittery and frightened.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.200
You're leading her down to the front door, are you?

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.440
Yeah, this is exactly what kids look like when they know exactly what they're doing.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:16.720
Sure. And yeah, you get down to the front door and at that point, she just looks around, you know, particularly at all the strange fluids dripping down the wall and the squelchy carpet and the strange noises coming from upstairs.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.960
And she bolts out of the front door and starts running off into the darkness.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.440
I think we might have cut out, yeah, the last thing you said there.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.960
Oh, something about into the darkness, which sounds distressing.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.720
Yeah, that was upsetting.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:35.240
Yeah.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.760
I just said that, you know, she obviously in a bit of a panic as you take it downstairs.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.000
Oh, it's still being weird.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:41.720
Oh, shit.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:42.400
Okay.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:50.600
It's like, it was every single time you were saying the thing that matters the most.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.560
Is it better now?

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.520
Looks like it so far.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.040
Seemingly.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:56.400
Right.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:04.040
In which case, yeah, the last thing I said was that, you know, she seems to, if I'd just broken up again.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.120
It did.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.440
It broke up right as you were starting again.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.920
Motherfucker.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.680
I can obviously miss this story.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.360
Timing is incredible.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.120
All right.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.720
Hey, everyone, just, uh, stop your recording.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:25.240
Uh, we're going to fly to, uh, Britain.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.560
Uh, what do you call it?

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.400
What's the name?

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.400
We'll be there in just a couple of minutes.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.240
Milton Keynes.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.160
That's the name.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.200
I will be there very shortly.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.320
Record the same person.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.120
I hope you don't mind.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.120
I have a cough.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.480
Been a little fevery lately, but.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:50.280
Yeah.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.280
Okay.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.720
Well, let's try this one more time.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.520
It seems to be better now.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:54.520
Right.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:00.440
So yeah, I'm saying that, yeah, she seems to be a bit on nervous, a bit on edge.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:10.440
And as you take it down to the front door, she takes a look around at all the creepy shit in the house and then just in a panic runs out of the house into the darkness.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.280
I was afraid that's what you had said.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.440
I'm chasing her.

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.320
I'm just going to call after her.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:16.880
I'm just going to...

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.760
Esther, Esther, no.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.840
Stay with us. You're safer with us.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:29.920
Oh, OK, so you're trying to calm her down as Frederick Mellon I is chasing after her.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:36.120
I mean, I will allow you again to make either a PERSUADE or a CHARM roll, but this is a PUSHED roll.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:47.160
I think at this stage, if you fail this roll, she is going to be so panicked by the situation that she is going to run into real danger.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.600
I'm going to...

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.840
She starts shaking his dice.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.720
I'm doing a charm roll.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.880
Fantastic.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:12:59.960
Bedside Manor.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:00.720
I pass.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.160
It's a 46 on a 50.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.320
Brilliant.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:14.280
OK, so, yeah, as Frederick catches up with Esther and she's run off, she's got into the undergrowth a little bit.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:26.200
But now that she's there in the darkness and can't see what's going on and can hear all the strange things moving around in the garden, she just stops.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:36.840
And as you come up, she turns around and just throws herself at you and just puts her arms around your waist and starts crying.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:43.600
Close to the mover time and we always find a time to shine.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:50.280
This is a song that everybody knows.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:56.720
And when you get older, you're gonna lose your toes.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.560
She's supposed to sing Lose Your Toes.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.520
That's her line.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.000
That was me doing Esther.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.800
That was her voice.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.920
Lose your toes.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.080
It's been a rough day.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.240
That's OK, that's OK.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.520
And I'm just patting her back.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:21.040
And yeah, she's just crying into your chest.

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.520
That like grandpa hug where you just kind of like pat.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.280
Yeah.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:33.680
And yeah, I mean, every now and then as your parm makes contact with her, you can just feel things squirming around under your hand.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:39.920
Should have fed her to the house.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.520
OK, that's OK, that's OK, that's OK.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.920
As I look around my surroundings, where am I at?

01:14:49.440 --> 01:15:02.520
You're only about 10 feet in front of the house, so you're just on the far side of the gravel drive, just as it's going into, I guess, what used to be an ornamental garden or some shrubbery or something.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:06.440
But, you know, has long since just gone completely wild.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.200
Do I notice any movement from over by the laboratory?

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.880
No, the door is ajar.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.520
You can see a bit of light coming out, but you can't see any movement over there.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.000
OK, I'm going to get her to the car and get her in the backseat.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:29.320
So when you say the car, do you mean the one that the guy drove up in or the one that you guys brought?

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.160
Oh, God, no, not his.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.800
It's ours, the one that we brought.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.920
Because it's been so long since we recorded this bit.

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:41.240
Can you remind me, did you park outside the house or did you park on the street outside?

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:56.000
We parked about halfway up the chute, facing out back down the chute, and we took some time to get ourselves dug out from out of the mud.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.720
I remember now, yes.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:03.320
OK, so, yeah, you can sneak it down to the car and get her in the backseat.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.720
Esther, just stay here, OK?

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:10.440
We'll be here in two shakes of a chicken's thigh.

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.000
Should we turn the child locks on?

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.640
Have those been invented yet?

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.320
Not for a while.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.240
I turn off my walkie talkie.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.120
Kids are still dying by the millions on the roadside.

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:29.080
They open the door and launch themselves from the car.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.040
It was an epidemic.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:43.440
OK, but, yeah, Esther crawls inside and she hunkers down in the foot well and just hides there in the darkness.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.600
Nice, very good.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.440
OK, so then I'm going to sneak back up to the house.

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:48.680
OK.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:57.280
Being careful, if I see any movement from over by the fella, actually, you know what, I'm going to go hide behind his car.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.440
That way I can kind of watch his movement.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:17.160
Yeah, now that you're a bit closer, you can hear, yeah, there's the sound of someone basically clattering around inside and swearing and moving big bits of metal out of the way.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:24.520
And just shouting, you know, he seems to be shouting, Brink, you idiot, what have you done?

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.880
Yeah, fuck yeah, I gained sanity.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:46.120
Carl, if we're doing this talking to him tactic, there's a chance that, you know, this guy, if Astin up there has turned into a house and knows you, somebody coming here to do something at this house might know you, too.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.000
That could work for our advantage, right?

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.040
How?

01:17:52.320 --> 01:18:01.320
Maybe you could pretend, you know, a little more than you do or in some way, get him to open up a little more, make him think you're on his side or something.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:01.840
I don't know.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.120
Yes, easy, easy.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.560
Let's do it.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.240
So when you say it, what are you doing?

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:21.720
Yeah, I mean, should we just get his attention, have him come out of the lab or should we try and corner him in the lab?

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.360
Maybe we can go to the lab.

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.080
I mean, what is our ultimate goal?

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.840
What if I get a pair of overalls, right?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:37.720
And I stop by the lab and I'm like, pistol cleaners, can I see a pistol, sir?

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.560
And then you guys come and you talk to him.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.600
But I will have disarmed him cleverly with my ruse.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:52.720
The problem is that I feel the pistol cleaners usually come on Tuesdays.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.560
We can only pray he's too distracted to remember.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.600
I feel maybe this is a good start.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.000
And then we, how you call it, wing it from there.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.800
You asked what the ultimate goal here is.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.400
It's to find out if there's a way to remove the parasites from the from hosts.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.640
I think that's our number one.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:21.040
And if it's impossible or he doesn't want to or whatever, it may be feeding him to the house.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.000
Yes, works for me.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.240
Are you going to be pistol cleaning or should I talk to him?

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.720
I don't think we should complicate it.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.240
Why don't you just go try to talk to him?

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.040
OK, but I will go in and you guys.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:43.480
Maybe do you stay outside or do you come with me to beat holes again?

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.760
Oh, I mean, if you guys stay, there will be trouble.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.320
But if you go, there will be double.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:20:00.520
OK, how about you maybe stay just within earshot outside and I try to get him outside?

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:04.200
Yeah, and we'll keep Frederick over there behind the behind the car.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.000
So I'm behind the car, Nathaniel Coombes, Dr.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:14.760
and Thomas Dolan are inside the like entrance of the house waiting within earshot and Carl

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.800
Rothstein is going to be on the stoop of the house to try to draw him out.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:25.320
Basically, the car is between the front entrance and the laboratory.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.760
I mean, if you think of the laboratory as being off the side, so you've got the front

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:33.000
entrance, then it goes around the front of the house down to the side.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.120
That's where the car is parked.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.520
And then a bit beyond there, there's the laboratory.

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:42.440
I'm cool with the camera, like panning with me as I like sneak like around so he can't

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.040
see me as I move.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:47.560
That's that's really easily done because he's very distracted at the moment.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:53.880
But the problem is that Rothstein is going to have to get a lot closer in order to really

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:54.840
do anything.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.560
I think that's fine.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.120
Let's do that.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:21:01.880
That's just kind of me and Dolan can just form like a henchman line behind you.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.680
So if Dr.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:11.400
Rothstein is creeping over to the lab, yeah, as I said, you can hear the sound of this

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:18.440
man clattering around inside and just swearing angrily to himself over and over

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.240
again.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:27.320
Can I, like, peek into the library to see where he's kind of searching through stuff?

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.160
What I'll ask for is a stealth roll not to be detected.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:35.480
I will give you a bonus die on this because you've got some cover and he's distracted.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.400
No, 93.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.200
OK, and with a bonus die.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:47.720
So if you roll the tens again and take the better of the two results.

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.320
83.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.880
So, yeah, you creep up, but...

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.800
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:12.520
I think it's more that in order to get into position to see this, the light from inside

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.400
is hitting you.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.680
You switch the lights back on inside, it's all fully lit.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:25.080
And yeah, you are just framed there in the doorway and you watch for a moment as he's

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:29.720
just rustling around in the wreckage looking for anything he can salvage.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:37.240
And then he notices you out of the corner of his eye, looks over and immediately starts

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.360
fumbling around for his gun, just shouting, who the hell are you?

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.080
Oh, don't.

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.320
No, come on.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:43.800
Calm down.

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.520
I am the...

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.880
Tell him you're the pistol cleaner.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:57.080
I'm the pistol cleaner for the estate.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:07.960
At this stage, he's got his revolver in his hand and he just indicates, come in here where

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.840
I can see you.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:09.480
Oh, good.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:14.200
It's lit up in here and I can clean your gun very easily in here.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:20.040
Kind of look behind me to signal to the other guys, like I'm in trouble.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.720
And then I walk in.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.320
Are you alone here?

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:26.700
Yes.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.000
At the moment.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.360
He shoots you instantly.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:37.720
I'm going to take that incredible bit of unconvincing acting there as being in character,

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.480
if you don't mind.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.400
So yeah, he's not buying that for a moment.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.640
He says, right, who else is here with you?

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.600
The house is my friend and it's alive.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:59.480
He just looks at you.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.320
I mean, you can only see his eyes.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:07.560
I mean, he's got this white silk kerchief tied around his face and he's looking at you

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.520
over the rims of that.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:15.160
But I mean, even just seeing his eyes, you can see just the undeniable, unmistakable

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.240
expression of what the fuck in them.

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.720
If you want to see something cool, I can show you.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:23.480
Who are you and what are you doing here?

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.040
My name, don't worry about my name.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.320
And I'm here to show you secrets.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.540
Come.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:42.200
Would you come if this terrible Henry Kissinger, like, surprised you and was like, I have secrets.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.080
Got some surprises for you.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.280
I'll clean your gun.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:49.320
My name is not important.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.520
Come look at the surprise.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.640
He says one more time.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.400
Who are you and what are you doing here?

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.360
And if I don't like the answer, I'm going to shoot you.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.280
I start backing.

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.360
How far into the laboratory am I?

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.800
How far in did you come when he told you to come in?

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.080
I'm going to say not very.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.920
I love it when Luke asks those questions.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:11.640
Super far.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:20.920
I start backing out and I just kind of like wave, like beckon him towards me.

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.920
This is the way.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:27.560
And then I sprint out of the laboratory as to not be shot.

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.560
I'm going to give you a chance.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:36.600
I'm going to give you a chance then to dodge and get some cover between you and the gunfire

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.720
that's coming your way.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:41.480
Yeah, they'll just push us down the stairs and then this episode will be over.

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.080
I got a 16 on a 25.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.000
Okay, so that's a success.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.640
So you are getting out of the way.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.360
He is going to get one chance to shoot you.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:58.920
But on the other hand, yeah, I mean, he is close enough that it's point blank range.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:05.320
But because you've dodged, it's just going to be a straight roll and he's not really

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.280
a gunman.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.120
So I do fancy your odds here.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.120
That's why I didn't recognize the pistol cleaners.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.760
On the other hand, 25 is a success, even with the basic skill.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:27.560
So that is one point of damage, minimum damage.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.160
Yeah, I mean, clearly that dodge did help.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.440
You've dived out of the way.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.520
The bullet just wings you.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:40.040
It clips your left arm just as you're diving around the side of the metal door and there

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.160
is searing pain.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:46.040
But on the other hand, yeah, it doesn't seem to have hit anything vital.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:52.200
You can hear the sound of this man cluttering through the debris that you left in the lab

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.760
and chasing towards the door after you.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.280
Can we see this happening if we're hiding behind the door?

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:03.960
You can certainly see in the light that's coming out of the doorway that, yeah, Rothstein

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.040
darts out, dives out of the way, there's gunfire, and then he staggers.

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:12.840
Nathaniel, if he comes through that fucking door, let's just clothesline the bastard.

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.000
Yeah, yeah, that, yeah, yeah.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.840
And so, yeah, we're like preparing a move.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:20.120
I don't know how that works, but if he comes through the door, we would...

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.720
Yeah, we just want to juke our arms out and surprise him.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.120
So you're running towards the door.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:30.360
I pictured us just on the other side of the door at the start, but maybe not.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.840
Yeah, I thought you were over by the car, but...

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.920
Remember, we are the hench line.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:35.720
We accompanied him.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.080
We were walking up with him.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.200
Oh shit, that's right.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.440
You probably were on either side of the door outside.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.560
Yeah, we hid back when he was like, yeah, I'm alone.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.640
Well, let's see then how well the two of you are hiding.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:55.480
So whichever one of you has got the worst stealth roll, make a stealth roll just to

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.800
see whether you're going to get the jump on him.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.920
I've got 20.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.200
Is that the default?

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:00.840
Yeah.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.560
Yeah.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.520
Yeah, I've got the same.

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.480
So which one of you wants to roll for this?

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.760
Hit it up, Thomas.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:10.120
Which one of you makes a yelp when the gunshot goes off?

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:11.900
Right.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.160
38.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:16.680
Okay.

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.200
On a 20.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:23.880
I mean, it's not catastrophic, but on the other hand, yeah, to get close enough to do

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:28.040
this, you're there within the light that's coming out of the doorway.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:36.280
And yeah, as you're getting into position, he is going to get a chance to react to this.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:43.000
And the bad news is because he's got a prepared gun, he is almost certainly going to act

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.120
before either of you.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.680
So were the two of you both lunging into clothesline him or was just one person doing

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:51.080
it?

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.440
I pictured us both.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.080
Yeah.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:53.580
Okay.

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:58.520
So it's going to be a question of whichever one of you he considers to be the bigger threat.

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.520
And I think Thomas Dolan is the larger of the two men.

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.720
So yeah, I'm pretty certain he's going to shoot you.

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:08.520
This is going to be point blank range, so we'll get a bonus die.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.240
Oh, that's good for him.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:18.280
I just love it when people succeed on their rolls, regardless.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:23.320
Zach, the correct word is irregardless.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.000
It's fucking 8 AM.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.800
How did you get Andy's frozen custard this early in the morning?

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:36.920
I bought it yesterday, put it in the freezer, and I ate it before I got on mic.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.480
Breakfast of champions.

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.560
I had ice cream for breakfast yesterday.

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.720
Jesus Christ, guys.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:49.160
I had a brownie caramel pecan concrete.

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.560
You guys look great.

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:56.360
I ordered it small, but they said, well, there's a lot of ingredients in there, so we put it

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.000
in a medium.

01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:59.400
Hey, thank you.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.840
That's the care Andy's takes.

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.520
All right, shoot me, Scott.

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:13.080
So yeah, even with the bonus die at point blank range, the shot goes wild.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:18.680
He is clearly not expecting two of you to jump out at him, even though you've been pretty

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.040
obvious about it.

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:27.320
The shot just goes clanging into the metal door beside you and ricochets back into the

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:27.640
lab.

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:34.680
And he's standing there with the gun now, just pointing around wildly.

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:38.040
Now, are the two of you just trying to deck him at this stage then?

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:42.760
Yeah, Thomas Dolan says, should have got that pistol cleaned.

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:50.280
Then he takes a big 1930s action swing.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:50.600
Pow!

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.840
Give me a fighting brawl roll.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.960
He is going to try to fight back by pistol whipping you.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.960
Oh, that's a better myth.

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.040
So what did you get on your fighting brawl roll?

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.640
Because I got an extreme success.

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:09.640
I rolled a zero four.

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.920
Oh, no.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.440
13.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.360
Very good, but not good enough.

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:19.960
If you have enough points to buy that down to an extreme success, I really recommend

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.760
doing so because extreme successes do maximum damage.

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.640
Do I spend luck points on that?

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.520
Yes, yes, if you have enough.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.560
I don't think Thomas Dolan does.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.280
I think he lost.

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:33.560
I don't think you have any.

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.360
Yeah, I think I lost all my luck.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.680
Because I think he may be about to kill you here.

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:47.880
Because with maximum damage on this, he does have a damage bonus.

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.520
So this is going to be 10 points of damage coming your way.

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.720
Holy shit.

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.400
Yeah, so I'm at two hit points.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.920
Okay, can you give me a constitution roll to see whether you can stay standing?

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:05.560
So basically, as you come in to try to deck him, he ducks underneath, brings his gun up,

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.800
just backhands you across the face.

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:12.520
And there is this almighty crunching noise as he breaks your nose and blood goes flying.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.120
No, I rolled a 91.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.120
Lights out.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:21.400
Yeah, Thomas just goes down with a thump lying on the ground.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.960
K.O. Finish him.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.320
What was Dr. Coombes doing?

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:34.440
Now that he's seen Thomas go down, he's freaked out.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.400
No, no, no, no, no.

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:38.920
Fucking fight him, you son of a bitch.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.920
Yeah, you were attacking him too.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.960
And now he's taking all his time killing me.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.200
So you've got to fight up a shot.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:47.000
Go for it.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.120
He's open, baby.

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.400
He just took a shot.

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.520
Fucking chomp that.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:55.160
Okay, the guys want me to hit him with my 25% chance.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:00.200
Because you are ganging up on him at this stage, there are two of you attacking him.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.640
You do get a bonus die on this.

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.020
Perfect.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:05.720
I'm going for a swing.

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:10.680
I pass.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:11.400
It's a 22.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.880
Okay, doctor.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.320
So, yeah, give me a damage roll.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.920
You're not using your weapon at this stage.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.040
So it's just going to be a d3 plus any damage bonus you've got.

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.360
It's a three.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:26.860
Okay.

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:27.900
Total.

01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:34.700
So, yeah, you managed to hit him a fairly solid blow in the jaw.

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:39.420
And you split the bottom of his lip.

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:42.780
There's a bit of blood running out and he staggers back for a moment.

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:45.820
And he looks really pissed off about this.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:49.100
He's now going to try to shoot you.

01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:50.560
What's...

01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:58.620
When I heard the initial gunshot go off and I saw the two get ready for the hang line,

01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:06.620
I think Frederick Mellon the foist began his waddle, his quick waddle,

01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:10.700
right toward the door, getting ready to join in on the action.

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:15.340
Yeah, and then I'm going to try to disarm this man.

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:18.540
Okay, because again, he does have a gun readied.

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.660
He is going to act first, I think.

01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:24.700
Yeah, he is because that's plus 50 on his decks.

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:28.860
And unless anyone's got a decks of higher than 115, he's going first.

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:30.540
Ah, 110.

01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:38.300
So I think because Dr. Coombs just punched him, he is going to shoot Dr. Coombs.

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:42.380
Let's see how this goes for Dr. Coombs.

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:45.820
Okay.

01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:46.620
Oh, hang on.

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:47.260
It's point blank.

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:48.300
He gets a bonus die.

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.460
Oh, no, no, that's...

01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.260
So both my rolls were 84s.

01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.060
So that's good.

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.340
So yeah, obviously you've discombobulated him a bit.

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.060
He's staggering back and he's firing wild.

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:11.100
The bullet just goes between you and Frederick and you hear it smack into the car behind you.

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.020
And the little girl is dead.

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:14.540
Different car.

01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:19.500
This guy is backing into the lab again, halting the gun.

01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:26.620
One thing you can see as well, actually, yeah, because Dr. Coombs got a solid blow on his face,

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.700
his cachif is coming loose.

01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:36.780
As he steps back into the light that's coming out of the laboratory, it comes down and you

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:41.020
can see that his face, there's something wrong with his face.

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:47.900
You can see his mouth there, but the problem is all the other mouths, all these little

01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:53.180
mouths with teeth that have just opened up all over his face and seem to be screaming

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.100
in pain from the blow.

01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:56.860
Oh, my God.

01:35:56.860 --> 01:36:01.740
I would like everyone who's conscious and not running away, so that's Dr. Coombs and

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:04.780
Frederick, to make sand rolls.

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:09.180
72 on a 63.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:09.680
OK.

01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:10.480
Fail.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.180
I fail a 29 on a 20.

01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:19.500
OK, so you don't lose much sand for this.

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.260
I mean, you see much worse things today.

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.420
Frederick only loses two points.

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:28.300
Dr. Coombs loses three points.

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:34.460
But Dr. Coombs, on the other hand, was already indefinitely insane, I think.

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:38.780
So this pushes him over into another bout of madness anyway.

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:39.420
Oh, OK.

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:42.940
I think at this stage it's just going to be pure self-preservation.

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:45.260
I mean, there's gunfire going off.

01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:48.940
You're not someone who is used to combat.

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.420
You've seen Thomas go down.

01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:54.780
You've nearly been shot to yourself.

01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:59.180
I think you're just running away blindly into the darkness.

01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:00.780
I'd agree.

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:03.180
That sounds like what Coombs would do.

01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.980
Yeah, I'm sure you won't get into any trouble out there.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:08.000
No.

01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:13.260
So that now leaves Frederick on his own dealing with the gunman.

01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:17.740
Good luck, Freddie.

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.780
Was I just like running?

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:22.940
Well, it's up to you.

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:26.300
Yeah, I mean, if you want to double back and help Fred, by all means, you can.

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:26.940
Yeah, I think...

01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:30.540
Well, I'm unconscious, guys, so it's up to you.

01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:34.220
I'm flinging myself into the woods, so...

01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:42.300
Yeah, so as I'm running away and get clipped in the arm, I'm like, oh,

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:50.780
I feel like I'm down to three hit points and I start running away.

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:58.220
But then when I hear the other gunshots and stuff go off, I turn around and I see between

01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:05.100
Nathaniel and Thomas what is going down and I look to see what Frederick Mellon is doing.

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.020
And he's going for the disarm.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:16.940
So you're following this man with the many mouths into the lab as he's backing off

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.780
and you're going to try to get the gun off him?

01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:20.460
I'm going to try to sneak it away from him.

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:25.020
I'm a very stealthy man and I've been known to steal things off of people a lot by misdirection.

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:32.940
So I'm going to try to flick a coin in the air and then while he's looking at my hand

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:36.140
that's up in the air, just grab the gun out of his hand, maybe.

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:42.300
Okay, then what I'll allow then is for you to use sleight of hand

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.300
instead of fighting brawl for the maneuver.

01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:47.420
Crazy that I have 10% more in that.

01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:53.980
On the other hand, he is still going to try to pistol whip the fuck out of you.

01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:56.220
Dude, I rolled a fucking 10.

01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:00.380
Oh, that's an extreme success.

01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:05.420
That's good because he's rolled a 73 on his fighting brawl.

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:06.860
So that is a complete failure.

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:11.660
So yeah, you have his gun now.

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:19.740
He's trying his hardest just to ignore the very obvious distraction that you're doing.

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:23.260
But there's just something so compelling about the way you flick that coin.

01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:28.620
That he's just bringing the gun back to smack you in the face with it

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:32.460
and he's just looking up at the coin and then he's looking down at his empty hand

01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:38.860
and just muttering, oh fuck, not again, to himself.

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:43.100
Every time.

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:44.220
Decades of practice.

01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:50.540
And with that, I think on the extreme success, by the time he realizes what's going on,

01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:51.980
I'm backed out the door.

01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:55.820
Gun still pointed at him and hollering back to my comrades.

01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:57.420
I got the gun.

01:39:58.540 --> 01:39:59.580
He's got my coin.

01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:06.300
Yeah, he's hesitantly putting his hands up and saying,

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:11.260
look buddy, don't shoot, you know, I'm sure we can talk this out, right?

01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:12.780
Are all the mouth saying that?

01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:13.500
Just the one mouth.

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.420
The other ones are just opening, closing all over his face, but it's just the one that's talking.

01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.460
And he's saying, you want money?

01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:21.260
I can get you money.

01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:23.100
I can get you all the money you want.

01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:23.980
I don't want money.

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:28.060
I want answers and money too.

01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:31.340
Oh, right.

01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:36.940
I forgot about my chief concern in life, which is also stealing money from rich fucks like you.

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:37.500
Yes.

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:42.060
I also want money, but mostly right now I would like answers.

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.220
Do you look at my skin?

01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:45.580
Look at my face.

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:49.260
I see that your face is equally fucked up in a different measure,

01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:52.860
but if you can see my skin, you can see what I've seen.

01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:54.220
I want it to be different.

01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:57.180
I want to be fine again.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:59.260
Oh, yeah.

01:40:59.260 --> 01:40:59.980
What do you got?

01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:03.660
You got some of the entities inside you now?

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:07.100
Yeah, I don't know what you do about that.

01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:11.820
I mean, those aren't like species 17.

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:14.860
I mean, those things, when they go inside you,

01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:18.060
we can just fish them out and yeah, that's good.

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:20.220
But what do you got inside of you?

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:25.500
No, we've seen those before and yeah.

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:30.620
Look, between you and me, buddy, I was coming in here to clean this place out,

01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:36.700
take what I could and just abandon it because last night these things got out.

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:41.420
Everything got out and this place is ruined now.

01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:45.740
You know, things like what's crawling around inside you, they're everywhere now.

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:47.420
It's too dangerous here now.

01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:49.500
You'd have to be an idiot to hang around here.

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.220
Any ideas if your life depended on it?

01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:54.720
Shit.

01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:06.380
I mean, I guess they're not from the same dimension as the rest of us.

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.060
I don't know.

01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:13.580
You might be able to do something with the Hawke's device and I don't know,

01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:17.420
just face certain types of matter.

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.660
It's not something I've ever tried doing.

01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:23.020
Keep talking.

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:29.020
I know Hawke speculated about stuff like that, but I mean, he's gone.

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:32.700
Look, this story is currently open, OK?

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:35.740
But you're Sedgwick, right?

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:37.580
Yeah.

01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:39.580
You're the closer.

01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:44.540
I need you to close my story and give me back.

01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:46.620
Me too.

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:48.460
Kira Sedgwick is the closer.

01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:50.780
Every Tuesday night.

01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:56.140
Wow, that was, I was so wondering where that was going.

01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:03.820
I mean, it's lost on me, I'm afraid, but I'm not appreciatively.

01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:07.980
It might as well be lost on me.

01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.940
No one listening will get that reference.

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:16.540
Someone's mom will get that reference.

01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:27.260
Yeah, I mean, we can try something, but, you know, this place is half trashed now.

01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:29.500
I don't know that we're even going to get it working.

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.060
I mean, some idiot pulled the tank over.

01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:33.820
There's water everywhere.

01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:37.500
I'm sure it shorted out half the electrical circuits in here.

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.740
I don't know if we'd even get this working again.

01:43:39.740 --> 01:43:45.020
Yes, the house is strange and things break.

01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:48.220
That's not my shoulder talking.

01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:50.540
That's the man behind me.

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.500
Yeah, I step out from behind, Frederick.

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.020
I'm back that you shot me.

01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:56.460
Fuck you.

01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:03.420
While you're having this conversation, let's just deal with Dr. Coons.

01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:12.300
So Dr. Coons is running through the undergrowth, running through the darkness.

01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:16.780
There's thorns and branches whipping past you, cutting your skin.

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:22.940
You can hear things moving in the darkness all around you.

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:27.740
You can feel the wet traces of things that you're brushing against.

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:31.020
And you don't know where you're going now.

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:33.180
You're just running blindly in a panic.

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:36.460
So I think what I'd like is a luck roll.

01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:38.800
Okay.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:40.400
Nope.

01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:42.300
I've got zero of it.

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.820
You crashed the four-wheeler into a tree.

01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:49.840
Okay.

01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:54.540
So yeah, in all the undergrowth that you've been running through,

01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:58.700
all of a sudden, your feet go out from under you.

01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:02.060
And you realize that you've run into,

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:07.980
fallen into the remains of what was probably an ornamental pond out here,

01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:12.460
and just gone splash into this filthy stagnant water.

01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:18.140
I mean, the good news is that this suddenly brings you out of the panic you're in.

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:22.380
There's just this cold, this almost freezing splash of water in the face

01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:27.900
just shocks you back to some kind of semi-coherent state of mind.

01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:32.540
The bad news is that you're not sure that you're alone in here.

01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:40.860
There is something big that you can't see just moving.

01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:43.420
You can hear the water moving around you.

01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:50.380
You can feel the currents of water from something a large moving in the darkness with you.

01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:52.540
Can my feet touch the ground here?

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:53.740
Is it that shallow?

01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:57.580
Yeah, it's not like a little ornamental pond.

01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:05.420
I mean, this is one that they've obviously dug in the garden because it looks pretty.

01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:09.580
But let's put this again down to a luck roll.

01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:14.060
Are you somewhere in this pond that is shallow enough for you to stand up?

01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:15.440
Nope.

01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:16.560
Okay.

01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:19.020
I got the zero.

01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:23.260
Oh, oh dear.

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.620
Yes, of course you've got zero.

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:31.820
Well, your feet, they try to scrape for purchase.

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:36.140
And as you drop down, your head dips down below the surface.

01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:41.500
You can feel the bottom, the muddy bottom of it down there, but it's just too far.

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:45.420
If you stand at the bottom, the water is just inches above your head.

01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:48.380
Coombes is still in, even though he's kind of snapped out of it,

01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:49.980
he's still in self-preservation mode.

01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.180
And so he's just going to try and swim to the nearest bank.

01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.780
Try to get out of the water.

01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:55.820
Maybe a little frenzied.

01:46:55.820 --> 01:47:01.980
Then I think, yeah, you have one chance then to escape this presence in the pond

01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:04.060
before it takes a lively interest in you.

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:06.220
And that will be a swim role.

01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:12.220
I fail a 30 on a 10.

01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:15.180
You don't get many opportunities these days to swim.

01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:18.460
So you're probably a bit out of practice and you're splashing around in the water

01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:19.740
and you're fully dressed as well.

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:24.860
They're pulling you down and just in the darkness, you don't have your bearings

01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:26.380
and you're splashing around in the cold.

01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:28.860
There's just the shock of being in this cold water.

01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:34.700
But yeah, somehow, I mean, you splash around and you just get to the muddy edge of the pond.

01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.020
But it is muddy, it's slippery.

01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:41.980
You put your hand on it and you haven't managed to get close enough

01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:47.740
for you to really get a grip on it before something starts wrapping itself around your neck.

01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:55.580
It reaches up around your body, reaches up around your neck and it feels soft at first.

01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:01.820
But then there are all these sharp bits that start digging in.

01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:12.140
So I think let's give you one chance to break away from this

01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:16.940
and put it down to an opposed strength roll between you and this creature

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:20.780
before it dines on you.

01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:24.540
This opportunity comes once in a life.

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.660
I'm imagining this is like an evil cashmere scarf.

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:33.900
I pass a 38 on a 50.

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:37.500
Okay, yeah, I got an 18 on the 60.

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:40.540
So that's a hard success versus your ordinary one.

01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:41.500
Yep.

01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:47.980
Looking at this in cinematic terms, we just sort of see this last glimpse of Dr. Coombes

01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:51.340
as he reaches for the banks, his fingers digging into the mud.

01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:57.420
And then suddenly there is this violent motion and he disappears below the surface.

01:48:57.980 --> 01:49:00.300
There is a brief disturbance.

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:06.700
There's bubbles that come up and a little froth of something that's not water.

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:10.780
But then the water goes very still again and stays that way.

01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:14.300
So, meanwhile, with the rest of you.

01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:20.300
Oh my God, dude.

01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:21.740
Yes.

01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:23.660
Rip.

01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:28.140
So, yeah.

01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:29.340
Thomas, can you play Taps?

01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:36.140
Is that what you do when people die?

01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:42.380
That's what they do at the end of the day at the army party.

01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:44.540
Well, that's every day, baby.

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:50.380
Back at the lab, you have Sedgwick at gunpoint.

01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:52.860
You were discussing what to do.

01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:56.380
Rosslyn had made his presence known.

01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:00.700
Dolan at this stage, I think, is beginning to come around.

01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:04.940
I mean, you've been half awake for a few moments, but you're beginning to get your senses back.

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:08.540
That your head hurts like a motherfucker.

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:13.820
But your thoughts are beginning to come back together into something coherent.

01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:15.900
Ow!

01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.580
Fucking role playing, dude.

01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:21.180
That's Thomas Dolan's main overwhelming thought.

01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:23.900
Yeah, I mean, this is serious.

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:30.140
I mean, whatever he's done to you, I mean, as you're feeling the wound and it's not just a cut,

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:35.420
but you're certain that there's bits of your skull moving under your fingers that aren't

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:37.180
supposed to move.

01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:41.180
But on the bright side, you do know a doctor.

01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:43.980
As long as you can get to him and you should be fine.

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:48.940
We are so lucky.

01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.180
We're so lucky we brought Nathan Coombes along.

01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:53.020
He's just as good as a hospital.

01:50:53.340 --> 01:51:00.700
I look down at him in Carl's head, he thinks he looks bad.

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:01.820
I'm a doctor.

01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:06.700
Trust me, I'm a physicist.

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:16.620
OK, yeah, give me a first aid roll to see whether you can at least keep a skull in one piece.

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:20.300
Yeah, I'm not that kind of doctor.

01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:26.700
Yeah, I think this is...

01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:28.460
69 on a 40.

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.020
Oh, that's a criticism.

01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:29.740
Wait, what?

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:31.340
Are we doing that?

01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:31.980
Oh, yeah.

01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:33.420
Did he fucking roll a 69?

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:34.380
Success, then.

01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:40.700
You are that kind of doctor, baby.

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:42.140
I am that kind of doctor.

01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.380
You're that kind of doctor.

01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:47.180
So you're 69ing Thomas Dolan back to health, then?

01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:50.300
Yes.

01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:56.620
Yeah, he's reinflating.

01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:58.940
He bends over and reinflates me from the other end.

01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:03.820
OK, yeah, yeah.

01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:06.060
Going with your house rule, then.

01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:06.780
Yeah, we need to...

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:08.860
This house does not rule.

01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:15.660
Well, you can rip up a bit of clothing and just create a bandage to at least

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:18.620
stop his head getting any worse.

01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:22.220
I mean, he is going to need proper medical attention at some stage.

01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:27.260
But at least you can get him to the stage where he can move around without it being

01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:28.060
life threatening.

01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:33.420
I'll pull my lighter out and cauterize his wound and then wrap it up with my sleeve.

01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:43.420
I'll pick a lighter can cauterize wounds, but you definitely set my hair on fire.

01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:48.300
It smells glorious.

01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:49.340
No, it's all right.

01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:50.540
It doesn't set your hair on fire.

01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:52.620
There's too much blood in your hair for it to catch.

01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:54.860
Just kind of singes it.

01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:05.420
And you do get one hit point back as well for the first aid.

01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:05.820
Four.

01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:08.940
No, three.

01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:11.500
I'm at three, baby.

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:12.860
Heck yeah, me too.

01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:16.780
Now, meanwhile, Freddy has got Sedgwick at gunpoint.

01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:19.820
You've been talking to him about the situation.

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:27.020
Look, OK, if you give me a hand getting all this stuff working again, I don't know.

01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:32.460
I mean, with all the damage Brink did here, I don't know whether we're going to get it

01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:33.260
working again.

01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:36.300
But if we can, I don't know.

01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:40.380
I mean, maybe we can get these parasites out of you.

01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:48.460
But there's a good chance that it's all going to go horribly wrong.

01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:51.660
And you're just going to get lost there.

01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:53.900
You willing to take that risk?

01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:55.040
Yeah.

01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:56.940
Did you go to university?

01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:57.440
Yeah.

01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:00.380
Let's give it the old college try.

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:01.420
Carl, get in here.

01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.860
I got a psychic back here.

01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:07.020
He says I helped build all this.

01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:09.660
I was Hawks' lab assistant.

01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:11.420
Well, now you got two extra hands.

01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:12.940
You asked for a hand with it.

01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:14.540
I've got a gun pointed at you.

01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:16.220
That's all I'm doing this whole time.

01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.100
What is the plan?

01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:22.460
You are helping this gentleman fix me.

01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:23.420
I need fixed, too.

01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:28.380
Look, and I hold up my arm and it's crawling around.

01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:31.500
He says, yeah, I've seen those before.

01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:34.700
They'll suck the life out of you within a day or two.

01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:37.660
Well, good thing that we're not taking any breaks.

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:44.540
Look, OK, if you can help me fix the damage here, work around any short circuits,

01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:48.060
you know, rewire anything that needs to be rewired.

01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:55.740
We can try, but look, I understand how to make this thing work.

01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:57.980
I understand the basics of it.

01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:02.220
I don't know if I can adapt it to do what you're talking about.

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:06.620
I mean, do it or die.

01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:12.860
OK, well, does anyone know anything about wiring?

01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:13.980
We both do.

01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:16.940
Yes, I've been I've turned the portal on before.

01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:27.260
So, yes, I know about, you know, I read about 25 percent of an electrical repair handbook

01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:29.820
one time, but I internalized all of that.

01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:37.340
I would say I have exactly 25 percent of a master's skill in electrical repair.

01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:45.420
Well, I think then one of you can take the lead in this rewiring job, and I guess it's

01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:46.620
probably going to be Dr.

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:49.740
Rothstein unless you want to play on hard mode.

01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:57.260
So then let's have an electrical repair roll off Dr.

01:55:57.260 --> 01:56:00.460
Rothstein just to see whether you can repair the electrics.

01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:04.060
OK, I got it pretty good.

01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:05.340
Damn it.

01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:07.820
92 on a 60.

01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:09.260
God damn it.

01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:16.380
Yeah, the problem with it is that, yeah, I mean, when he pulled this tank over and emptied

01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:20.300
all this water across here, that it has fried a lot of the circuits.

01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:26.300
And now that it's been here for a while, it's seeped in, you might be able to take some

01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:26.940
shortcuts.

01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:30.140
You might be able to just bypass entire sections of it.

01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:33.020
But, you know, this is an unfamiliar device.

01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.580
You don't know what effects that might have.

01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:38.780
You could push the roll if you want and try doing that.

01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:40.220
I'm going to push the roll.

01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:46.620
I find two exposed wires and look at them and push them together.

01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:51.420
And, uh, 90.

01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:53.420
What, really?

01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:57.340
OK.

01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:10.220
OK, so let's have it play out like this, that you don't realize how spectacularly you

01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:15.100
fucked this all up until Sedgwick switches the machine back on.

01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:19.100
Sedgwick, don't talk like that.

01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:22.220
I have the utmost confidence in this man right here.

01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:22.620
Dr.

01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:26.700
Rothstein's the smartest, most capable doctor.

01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:28.540
I mean, he can see the future.

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:29.660
He's a psychic.

01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:31.580
So I don't want to hear any of this.

01:57:31.580 --> 01:57:32.860
Oh, can he do it?

01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.060
Can he do it?

01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:35.340
Obviously, he got it right.

01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:40.700
I mean, Sedgwick's really impressed when he hears Rothstein saying, what, you're Dr.

01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:41.980
Rothstein of the Miskatonic.

01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:43.500
I've read your papers.

01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:44.700
I'm sorry.

01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:46.140
You should have said who you were.

01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:51.020
Oh, well, you know, I, I, uh,

01:57:51.020 --> 01:58:01.020
I, you know, I know my name carries a lot of weight, but I try not to throw it around.

01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:04.540
You know, I want people to like me for me.

01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:12.700
Well, all right.

01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:16.060
I mean, obviously, yes, I mean, I'll take your word for it.

01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:21.340
If you think this is all going to work now, then yeah, let's power it up.

01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:26.940
Well, as you know, I'm a fucking genius, so there's nothing can go wrong here.

01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:28.620
Good.

01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:29.420
Good, good, good.

01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:31.580
Oh, I feel better about this already then.

01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:37.900
All right, gentlemen, stay outside the circle for safety, but we should be all right to

01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:38.940
turn it on now.

01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:40.220
I give a big thumbs up.

01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:45.820
And with that, Sedgwick throws the knife lever.

01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:48.220
And it all sparks into life.

01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:54.060
Unfortunately, one of the things that you seem to have shorted or at least worked

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:56.860
around is this containment ring.

01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:00.460
Yes.

01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:07.260
You see this rip in reality form within the ring and spread out to the extent of the

01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:08.780
ring as it did before.

01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:11.820
But this time it doesn't stop.

01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:16.140
And more than that, it is accelerating.

01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:21.980
I mean, even before you have a chance to turn and start running and leaving the lab, it

01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:23.340
is just spreading out.

01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:30.300
Sedgwick is screaming in terror as he just sees the world around him changing and being

01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:33.660
consumed by these alien dimensions crashing in.

01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:41.100
You can see the ground around you changing into something that's not quite a marsh, but

01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:44.220
maybe a marsh is the closest thing that your brain can make of it.

01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:46.540
And there are things in it.

01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:48.380
There are things all over the place.

01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:53.100
You look around for the door, for the laboratory and the walls, but they're not anywhere

01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:53.340
now.

01:59:53.340 --> 01:59:58.220
There's just this marsh that's spreading out and these strange clouds and these things

01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:01.180
moving through the air and moving through the liquid around you.

02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:08.860
And there are the large things, the large things that you're one of which you saw coming

02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:10.940
before and you managed to switch the machine off.

02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:18.060
But now you realize that's just one of a herd and they have you surrounded.

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:24.540
Sedgwick is looking around in panic, trying to switch the device off, but the device isn't

02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:25.340
there anymore.

02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:26.940
The switch isn't there anymore.

02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:29.260
There is nothing to turn off.

02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:38.860
And just with a look of absolute defeat, he just collapses down into the muck and starts

02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:39.340
crying.

02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:41.340
What do the rest of you do?

02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:43.500
I want to start running out of the room.

02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:45.900
There isn't a room anymore.

02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:47.820
What room?

02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:51.900
Yeah.

02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:54.300
How do you want to go out?

02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:56.700
That's pretty much it.

02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:57.980
Yeah.

02:00:58.700 --> 02:01:02.220
I turn to Freddy and how many bullets are left?

02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:03.900
I got two.

02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:06.140
I hear that and I grab the gun and say,

02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:09.180
nobody puts Carl in a portal.

02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:10.460
And I shoot myself.

02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:17.340
Rock, paper, scissors, Thomas Dolan for the last bullet.

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:18.300
Yeah.

02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:22.700
I was definitely going to say we let Carl die, but he took that away from us.

02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:26.060
So he was never a good person.

02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:28.940
Three, two, one.

02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:29.740
Shoot.

02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:30.220
Okay.

02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:31.180
This is a paper.

02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:32.460
You win.

02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:33.420
Yep.

02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:34.620
Oh, I threw paper.

02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:35.500
He threw rock.

02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:42.060
And, uh, Frederick Millen the first takes the gun in his hands and holds it up to the

02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:45.820
skull of Thomas Dolan and is like, you're welcome and fires.

02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:56.220
The last thing that comes across Thomas Dolan's face is just a look of pure gratitude and

02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:56.620
relief.

02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:00.060
He was a good man.

02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:11.180
And with that, the herd closes in and when they feed upon you, it isn't like, it isn't

02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:15.740
like they just tear you apart and, and digest you or anything like that.

02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:21.340
There's, there's a part of you that is now forever within them, just they're still

02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:21.900
conscious.

02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:29.900
And you can see, you get this realization that, you know, when

02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:34.140
hawks broke free, that it wasn't just hawks that came back.

02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:39.980
It was one of these things as well that had basically assumed the identity of hawks or

02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:44.060
assumed his memories the way that they're now assuming yours.

02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:46.540
And, and of course, Edgwick's.

02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:48.940
And who knows?

02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:54.460
I mean, maybe, maybe if someone ever repairs the device and fires it up again, you can

02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:55.980
find a house of your own one day.

02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:03.340
Oh my God.

02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:09.420
That was his house would be hungry, but my house would be full of regret.

02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:13.740
I should have killed myself.

02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:15.020
Should have killed myself.

02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:18.460
You threw paper, you dumb idiot.

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:20.300
Of course you should have killed yourself.

02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:27.580
Dude, what the fuck?

02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:29.420
That was dope.

02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:31.340
Hell yeah.

02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:35.900
Oh, thank you.

02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:36.620
I'm glad you like it.

02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:37.180
Thank you, Scott.

02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:38.700
Thank you so much.

02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:41.100
That was incredible.

02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:41.900
Holy shit.

02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:44.540
Jesus Christ.

02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.940
I really thought we were going to get out of there, Scott-free.

02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:58.540
I don't think I've ever seen an entire party wiped out by a failed push attempt on electrical

02:03:58.540 --> 02:03:59.580
repair before.

02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:10.220
That's so good.

02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:11.340
Oh my God.

02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:21.260
That was, I can't, I can't, I can't say enough how much fun that was and how, how horrible

02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:21.740
that was.

02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:25.740
Good, as I said, I'm really glad you liked it.

02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:27.900
I had an absolute blast running it for you.

02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:29.180
It was a blast to play it.

02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:30.460
Super fun.

02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:40.380
Now, I mean, I could tell you all my favorite parts, but I am very curious about the behind

02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:41.980
the scenes on this scenario.

02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:48.620
I guess I could just fucking read it, but can you give us a rundown of what the fuck

02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:49.260
was going on?

02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:51.020
I'm very curious about two things.

02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:57.420
One, the faceless man, part of it, me thinks that, you know, having a kerchief covering

02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:02.540
all the mouths might, might be a faceless being, but the puppets.

02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:04.460
The puppet is what I was wondering about too.

02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:05.420
Yeah, okay.

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:09.740
The puppet was that skinned monkey thing you found floating in the tank.

02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:10.540
Fucking shit.

02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:10.860
Okay.

02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:13.580
I wondered if it might be that, but I didn't know its purpose still.

02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:15.180
Did they bring it into the camp?

02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:16.460
Camp with them for some reason?

02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:20.460
So it's one of these creatures that they pulled out from the other dimension.

02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:26.940
And what the way it works is when they come into the camp, they wear earplugs of wax and

02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:30.700
they have this thing that they, one of them just carries on his arm.

02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:37.500
And when they want to basically knock people out, they just stick a pin in it and make

02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:38.220
it scream.

02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:43.740
And it's scream just sort of drives people temporarily into madness and unconsciousness.

02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:44.380
Nice.

02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:47.820
Oh, that's so dope.

02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:49.100
How many of them are there?

02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:49.820
Them.

02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:50.620
Capital T.

02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:51.500
There were four.

02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:57.900
So I mean, there's a whole other strand if you go into the town and start trying to dig

02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:01.580
around there and get some information about what might have happened.

02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:03.660
That basically-

02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:04.460
Why would we do that?

02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:09.260
It depends which characters you have, but yes.

02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:14.540
But yeah, I mean, it doesn't happen very often, but it's definitely an option.

02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:20.620
There are these four guys, I mean three initially, so it's Sedgwick who started it all off.

02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:26.620
So when Aston Hawks disappeared, Sedgwick took over possession of the device, the Hawks

02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:27.100
device.

02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:33.020
And he realized that some of these creatures they were pulling back, this species 17,

02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:37.980
would basically siphon, in Call of Cthulhu terms, luck off people.

02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:42.940
So it would siphon some power and certainly luck and allow you to transfer it from one

02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:43.740
person to another.

02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:51.340
So basically, he and a few friends were using this in a predatory manner going into initially

02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:55.340
targeting people they just didn't like, business rivals or people who were snooping into their

02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:56.540
affairs and stuff like that.

02:06:57.580 --> 02:07:03.660
This was why so many people in the camp, their lives had basically collapsed because Sedgwick

02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:06.940
and his friends had basically been sucking all the luck out of their lives.

02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:07.440
Damn.

02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:14.160
They just carried on doing that and, you know, using the luck to play the stock market and

02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:17.040
make themselves wealthy even during the Great Depression.

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:22.880
And so basically, yeah, I mean, every one of the camp is basically their cattle.

02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:30.240
The previous night, they'd taken these two kids back to, you know, they'd taken Billy

02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:36.480
and Esther back to the Hawks mansion to try to siphon some luck out of them.

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:41.840
And that was the point at which they'd lost containment on the ring, which had already

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:43.120
been playing up a bit.

02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:47.200
And basically, Hawks got out and possessed the house and other things happened.

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:51.600
And they ran away and left the kids in prison downstairs and just thought, fuck this for

02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:56.960
a game of soldiers, ran off and were making plans basically to leave town and abandon

02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.400
all this before it got any worse.

02:07:59.040 --> 02:07:59.600
That's great.

02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:06.160
How widespread is the radius of the breach?

02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:11.120
It had been breaching for a while, which is why some of the things have been creeping

02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:13.040
out and infesting the house and so on.

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:20.720
But the big breach that let Hawks out was just the previous day and it was just big

02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:22.080
enough to reach the house.

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:24.960
What about when we did it?

02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:29.760
Yeah, I was like, you don't have to tell us if Esther's okay or not.

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:30.560
We can leave that.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.320
I think, yeah, let's leave that as a question mark.

02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:39.040
But I don't fancy your odds.

02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:46.160
Is there in your mind a success scenario once we've been infected by the new species?

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:52.480
Yeah, if someone does have the wherewithal to start making modifications to the Hawks

02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:58.480
device, you can do what Sedgwick suggested and basically use it to sort of phase extraterrestrial

02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:00.960
matter out of your own body and remove the parasites that way.

02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:05.360
Yeah, there may be other methods that I haven't thought of.

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:08.640
I'm always open to creative solutions, but that's the one that occurred to me.

02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:15.200
It was just really unfortunate that that result in a failed push-draw.

02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:19.600
Because otherwise it might have saved you all, but instead, no.

02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:21.920
That would have been boring.

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.920
Yeah, it's so much better when it turns out this way.

02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:27.760
It's a much cleaner finish.

02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:36.880
I guess technically another way to get rid of the wombs, just get eaten by the house

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:38.560
and then you don't have to worry about it.

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.880
So what was your reasoning on the house?

02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:49.920
So basically, the way that these parasites have been coming out and infesting people

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:54.160
and so on, he basically did the same thing but as this monstrous entity.

02:09:54.880 --> 02:10:00.800
He'd been fused with one of these giant things that you saw lumbering around and that

02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:02.000
basically did the same thing.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.520
It became a parasitic infection in the house and fused with it.

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.400
That's so cool.

02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:14.880
So it could be like any inanimate object could be fused with a person?

02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:16.240
Or animate ones, yeah.

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:18.320
Yeah, shit dude.

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:20.080
Oh, okay.

02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:28.000
So the marsh essentially that was once the garden where Thomas Dolan found that guy,

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.080
that was from the breach the night before?

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:37.280
Yeah, so the guy that you found in the garden was basically a drifter who'd come into the

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:43.200
house, was basically looking for something to loot and had been attacked by the parasites

02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:43.760
in the garden.

02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.840
They basically just drained him.

02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:51.280
So that was like a some foreshadowing of what was going to happen to you if you didn't

02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:52.880
manage to get the parasites out?

02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:56.000
Yeah, and it was well done.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.680
And while over the past, I mean, you mentioned earlier, we had three weeks in between knowing

02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:06.080
that we had parasites under our skin and dealing with today.

02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:14.320
And I just kept thinking about that guy the whole time and being like, I think we're

02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:14.820
fucked.

02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:21.680
Was the the creature in the pond then was also from that first breach, right?

02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:22.800
Yeah, yeah.

02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:27.520
Yeah, I mean, I mean, a lot of the smaller things had kind of crawled out there.

02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:32.880
But yeah, the big breach offered a chance for some larger nasties to get out.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.200
If you got to, if you could go on a date with one of our characters, which one?

02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:44.560
Asking the real questions.

02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:46.720
I'm a very generous lover.

02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:47.520
I'll take you all.

02:11:53.520 --> 02:12:00.640
Oh, man, nothing said after what I'm saying now will be on the episodes because we just

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:04.800
finished the recorded episodes of this collaboration.

02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:06.320
On a high note.

02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:15.440
If you were going to take our characters to your favorite date spot in New Bradwell or

02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:17.040
Milton Keynes, where would we go?

02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:18.720
Oh, gosh.

02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:21.440
Remember, this is a party of five.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:22.500
Yeah.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:33.280
If you wanted some excitement, we have an indoor skydiving place in Milton Keynes.

02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:34.320
There we go.

02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:34.880
Hell yeah.

02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:38.240
Nothing gets my blood to the edge like...

02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:45.280
Okay, so bachelor number one, if I was a salad, what kind of dressing would you put on me?

02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:48.000
That's a bit personal, isn't it?

02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:55.120
Oh my God.

02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:58.320
I would say ranch because it's not legal and I'm a bad boy.

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:09.200
Scott, thank you so much for running this game.

02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:10.160
This was so much fun.

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:11.680
Oh, my absolute pleasure.

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:12.800
Yeah, thank you very much.

02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:16.400
I don't think it's too forward to say that we're going to miss you.

02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:16.720
I know.

02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:20.480
Well, I mean, if you ever want to do something like this again, I'm definitely up for it.

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.720
Oh, I mean, your words and eyes, we'll see you soon.

02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:25.840
We'll see you tomorrow morning.

02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:30.880
But for real, that was fucking awesome.

02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.760
Actually, oh, I'm really glad you enjoyed it.

02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:39.520
Life surreal in retrospect, a dream.

02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:46.400
Easy times feel less than serene.

02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:53.760
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings.

02:13:53.760 --> 02:14:13.760
So we long for days gone past us, grief and strife, but that's real life.
