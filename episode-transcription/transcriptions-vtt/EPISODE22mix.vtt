00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Hello my students, it's your professor Wolf the Dog and I'm here to teach you all about

00:06.320 --> 00:14.720
what's synthesizing here on 694.2 PTBP, Contentions only form of education.

00:14.720 --> 00:22.440
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from AtKCruise36 on Twitter who tagged at PretendingPod, an

00:22.440 --> 00:25.440
A plus thing to do my students.

00:26.440 --> 00:32.120
The people of contention are fed up with our incompetent gun-crazy police force.

00:32.120 --> 00:38.440
We the committee to unite the nearby townsfolk refuse to let good, hard-working folks be

00:38.440 --> 00:43.780
terrorized by the likes of a petty more firing wildly into the sky.

00:43.780 --> 00:48.860
The good lord knows we've suffered enough and the overflow in the offering plate shows

00:48.860 --> 00:50.360
this to be true.

00:50.400 --> 00:56.200
Head on down to the first church of contention to salve your soul and enjoy some casserole

00:56.200 --> 00:59.360
prepared by our lady's auxiliary.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.880
Coffee is always hot and so, so black y'all.

01:03.880 --> 01:08.100
Speaking of the first church of contention, go ahead and send thoughts and prayers to

01:08.100 --> 01:09.880
Pastor Adam Cain.

01:09.880 --> 01:13.000
We all know he's going through hell today.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.060
However, Professor Wolf is here to talk facts with y'all.

01:17.060 --> 01:19.560
It's time for the news my babies.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.920
Earlier this evening, the officers cleaned themselves up after fighting a large robot

01:24.920 --> 01:27.520
man with feelings, perhaps.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.120
Is it a robot if it has feelings?

01:30.120 --> 01:33.280
What are the rules here, I don't know.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.480
Keith Wigner found a single piece of music called The Rise of the End in the bench of

01:38.480 --> 01:40.280
the stringless piano.

01:40.280 --> 01:45.020
If that's true and I'm sober, that's high strangeness.

01:45.140 --> 01:51.520
Clark Bishop found, in the flipped over coffee table, blueprints for calm, comfy campground.

01:51.520 --> 01:57.980
A suspiciously planned out set of seven buildings, six encircling a large one in the center that

01:57.980 --> 02:00.020
sits on Lake Combe.

02:00.020 --> 02:05.020
A similar design was found drawn on a piece of paper in the pocket of one of those two

02:05.020 --> 02:10.380
corpses they found in the pit under the trap door that Bishop fell into.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.860
Then in James the Millworker's house, the officers remembered that he died in Chief

02:14.860 --> 02:19.900
Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head, face down and a plate of foot meat.

02:19.900 --> 02:24.300
They also remember the contents of the present that she received from an unknown source the

02:24.300 --> 02:25.900
night she took off.

02:25.900 --> 02:32.180
A red rose, a white hot hat, and a black silk bow tie.

02:32.180 --> 02:37.360
All of which were present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by

02:37.360 --> 02:40.720
statue respectively.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.800
After undressing the bottom half of the still standing robot man, the gang finds a logo

02:45.800 --> 02:48.680
on the smooth pelvic area.

02:48.680 --> 02:52.440
It is an M made out of four double helices.

02:52.440 --> 02:57.020
They voted and decided to store the legs in Keith's cruiser's trunk.

02:57.020 --> 03:02.000
Is it just me or is life getting stranger and stranger around here?

03:03.000 --> 03:08.400
An educator of the masses, Wolf, had another scary dream.

03:08.400 --> 03:15.360
Today on December 4th, during a nap, I was eating a glass of water and began bleeding

03:15.360 --> 03:16.840
all over the floor.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.640
I looked down and my dog Wolf was lapping up the blood.

03:20.640 --> 03:25.820
So then he looks up at me and he has a fish in his mouth and it's flopping around.

03:25.820 --> 03:31.760
The blood from my mouth pours all over my wolf and then my dog's face is the face of

03:31.760 --> 03:38.480
that fish and in the fish's mouth is my face.

03:38.480 --> 03:45.080
Now class, find a partner for this next assignment or work in a group or fly solo.

03:45.080 --> 03:50.200
It's your life and it also cuts you with no back bone.

04:01.760 --> 04:11.880
Alright, maybe, maybe we should just get a good night's sleep and check out the mill

04:11.880 --> 04:12.880
in the morning.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.240
Because nobody's going to be at the mill right now.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.480
Yeah, it'd be a good time for snooping but not a great time for investing.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.080
I think it's a better time for snoozing than snooping.

04:21.080 --> 04:22.680
That's the second smartest thing you've ever said.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.320
I could get a few winks in, that's for sure.

04:25.320 --> 04:30.440
Okay, hey John, do you want to just crash at my place because I think, I mean it's closer

04:30.440 --> 04:32.400
than going all the way out to your house.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.880
Keith, man, you know that's nice but hotel rooms just depress me and I'm really looking

04:35.880 --> 04:40.040
forward to getting back to my home, just how I like it, you know.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.440
Maybe we should all stay, maybe we should all stay at Clark's house so that we're together

04:44.440 --> 04:46.720
just in case something dangerous happens.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.720
I got plenty of beds.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.720
Yeah, he does, he has plenty of beds.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.880
I know we're just not a giant robot but are you a little, maybe you should go sleep with

04:51.880 --> 04:56.120
Clark buddy, that's fine, there's no shame in a grown man being afraid after a robot

04:56.120 --> 04:57.120
encounter.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.640
No, I'm not afraid, I'm just thinking that we should probably all stick together at this

04:59.640 --> 05:00.640
point.

05:00.640 --> 05:01.640
You know, some weird shit's going on.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.640
No man, I like-

05:02.640 --> 05:06.880
What if the ooze, what if the, what's the closest waterway to you, you know?

05:06.880 --> 05:10.640
Well there's actually, there's a beautiful little creek that runs right through my property.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.640
Okay, well-

05:11.640 --> 05:14.160
You guys can come, do you want to come stay out there, Keith?

05:14.160 --> 05:15.480
No, not really.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.480
Okay.

05:16.480 --> 05:21.880
Oh actually, yeah, I forgot, I kind of have, well I'm going to call up this girl later

05:21.880 --> 05:22.880
so.

05:22.880 --> 05:23.880
Okay, well-

05:23.880 --> 05:25.880
I'm pretty excited to show her my-

05:26.040 --> 05:27.040
Also-

05:27.040 --> 05:28.040
Zeke's a Hazard DVDs.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.040
You guys have your-

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
And Smokey and the Bandit.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.760
You guys have your cars at the police station?

05:31.760 --> 05:32.760
Well-

05:32.760 --> 05:34.120
I don't think we have cars in, I think-

05:34.120 --> 05:38.440
Yeah, there's some cruisers but we need to get replacement cruisers.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.560
The cruisers are still destroyed, right?

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
That is correct.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.560
Yeah, I've got my-

05:42.560 --> 05:43.720
You've got a truck out at your property-

05:43.720 --> 05:44.720
Yeah, for sure.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.720
That we talked about.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.720
Oh wait, and then do you have a-

05:46.720 --> 05:48.400
I don't think I do.

05:48.400 --> 05:54.600
So you know, guys, I think it'd just be easiest for us to all stay at Clark's house tonight

05:54.600 --> 05:56.440
since we only have one car.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.800
You get pretty easily-

05:57.800 --> 06:02.200
Yeah, I mean, the station's even easier to get to and we can just get new cars, buddy.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.920
You have an impound lot so you can just take cars that have been impounded.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.800
Okay, well, I guess I'll take you to the impound lot.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.880
Hey Clark, man, can I talk to you for a second?

06:12.880 --> 06:18.960
You know, I think Vigna's afraid of something and maybe just invite him over for a little

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
sleepover or something.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.280
He doesn't seem like he wants to-

06:21.280 --> 06:23.560
He seems spooked, you're right, you're right.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.440
I'll put a word in his ear for sure, let him know he's welcome.

06:26.440 --> 06:27.440
Yeah.

06:27.440 --> 06:31.320
Oh, hey, so you sure you don't want to have a sleepover over at Clark's?

06:31.320 --> 06:32.600
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.880
Keith, you're more than welcome, though, to hang out for a little while, you know?

06:36.880 --> 06:41.000
Well, I mean, I just, you know, I don't-

06:41.000 --> 06:45.040
Buddy, this is cute, but I'm going back to my house.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.040
You know what?

06:46.040 --> 06:47.040
I'll take you up on that.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.040
You got a spare bed?

06:48.040 --> 06:51.040
Yeah, I got a spare bed, Keith.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.040
Okay.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.520
You like Salisbury Steak?

06:53.520 --> 06:55.520
It will probably be safer for you tonight if you're with Clark.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.920
Do you have Game Show Network?

06:56.920 --> 07:00.120
As a matter of fact, I watch Wheel of Fortune every night.

07:00.120 --> 07:05.120
Dude, I'm down to watch whatever's on Game Show Network, whether it be Match Game, Cash

07:05.120 --> 07:07.440
Cab, Wheel of Fortune, whatever's going on.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.440
I like that Cash Cab.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.600
We're going to watch Wheel of Fortune, but I gotta warn you, I get a puzzle sometimes

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
a time.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.960
Hey, well, let's see if I can't bestie on at least one round.

07:15.960 --> 07:16.960
Ooh, good luck.

07:16.960 --> 07:23.080
Okay, so I drive the three of us to the impound lot.

07:23.080 --> 07:28.520
What kind of car do you get?

07:28.520 --> 07:29.520
That is the question.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.520
Yeah.

07:30.520 --> 07:37.400
John Lee Pettymore is in the mood for the classics tonight, so I'm going to take a dope,

07:37.400 --> 07:41.760
I don't know, cars, a cool 70s car.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.680
How about like a Stingray Corvette, dude?

07:44.680 --> 07:46.020
Do we have one of those?

07:46.020 --> 07:48.500
Probably not impounded.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.380
A 91.

07:50.380 --> 07:53.300
There's a pretty sweet 91 Toyota Corolla.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.300
Is it all modded?

07:54.300 --> 07:55.300
No.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.300
No.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.300
Okay.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.300
No.

07:58.300 --> 07:59.300
When I said sweet, I was lying.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.300
What about like a...

08:00.300 --> 08:03.220
There's a cool lime green GEO over there.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.220
No, I'm good.

08:04.220 --> 08:05.820
I'll take the Corolla, I guess.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.620
I'm going to take a 1990 Lincoln Town Car.

08:08.620 --> 08:09.620
Nice.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.620
Whoa.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.460
I'm going to just stay in my cruiser.

08:12.460 --> 08:13.620
My stepdad had one of those.

08:13.620 --> 08:14.620
Really?

08:14.620 --> 08:15.620
I think that year and everything.

08:16.220 --> 08:17.220
He had one.

08:17.220 --> 08:18.220
I remember feeling like it felt like a boat inside.

08:18.220 --> 08:19.220
It was so wide.

08:19.220 --> 08:20.220
It super is, yeah.

08:20.220 --> 08:21.220
Okay.

08:21.220 --> 08:23.940
And here are the keys for those.

08:23.940 --> 08:30.460
And yeah, as soon as we get the cruisers back in working order, I'll make sure that you're

08:30.460 --> 08:31.460
in them.

08:31.460 --> 08:39.100
But for now, maybe let's not let the town know that you're cruising around in cars from

08:39.100 --> 08:40.900
the impound lot, probably.

08:40.900 --> 08:41.900
Oh, yeah.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.140
I mean, definitely not a great idea.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.860
I mean, don't like, you know...

08:45.860 --> 08:47.340
Hey, Drew, I'll see you around, buddy.

08:47.340 --> 08:49.260
And I drift out of the parking lot.

08:49.260 --> 08:50.260
Okay.

08:50.260 --> 08:54.860
Hey, Clark, I'll just follow you back home.

08:54.860 --> 08:55.860
Follow me back over there?

08:55.860 --> 08:56.860
Yeah, of course.

08:56.860 --> 08:57.860
How old is it?

08:57.860 --> 08:58.860
Nine.

08:58.860 --> 08:59.860
Nine thirty, maybe now.

08:59.860 --> 09:00.860
Sure.

09:00.860 --> 09:01.860
Are there any late night food spots open?

09:01.860 --> 09:02.860
Yeah.

09:02.860 --> 09:03.860
I mean, you can always get a burger at Burgatory.

09:03.860 --> 09:04.860
And Daily Fuzz is still open.

09:04.860 --> 09:08.060
Well, I mean, you offered me Sal's Berry Steak.

09:08.060 --> 09:09.060
That sounds...

09:09.060 --> 09:11.540
I tell you what, I've been looking forward to my chicken nugget dinner.

09:11.540 --> 09:12.540
So...

09:12.540 --> 09:13.540
Okay.

09:13.940 --> 09:14.940
Bring me a burger, bring it over.

09:14.940 --> 09:15.940
That's fine.

09:15.940 --> 09:19.940
Well, I mean, really what I'd like to do is have a bishop night.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.760
Do you have an extra for me?

09:21.760 --> 09:22.760
I got you.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.360
I got a Sal's Berry Steak I've been holding back.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.360
You can have that one.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.360
Okay.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.520
I'll just follow you home, then.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.780
Who wants to go first?

09:30.780 --> 09:31.780
You guys?

09:31.780 --> 09:32.780
Whatever you want.

09:32.780 --> 09:33.780
If you want to go first.

09:33.780 --> 09:34.780
I think maybe...

09:34.780 --> 09:36.780
Yeah, we'll have you guys here first.

09:43.540 --> 09:50.540
I pull up into my driveway where you coming straight behind me?

09:50.540 --> 09:52.540
Yeah, I was falling right behind you.

09:52.540 --> 09:56.140
So I wait for him to get out of his car and I go up the steps, unlock my door and...

09:56.140 --> 09:58.500
You got a driveway that's two cars wide, right?

09:58.500 --> 09:59.980
I picture it one car wide.

09:59.980 --> 10:00.980
Okay.

10:00.980 --> 10:01.980
So I park behind you then.

10:01.980 --> 10:02.980
Yep.

10:02.980 --> 10:06.260
And I go up and unlock the door and I just kind of leave it open, but just walk straight

10:06.260 --> 10:09.160
in and head toward the kitchen.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.340
I get out of my cruiser.

10:11.340 --> 10:15.620
I go to my trunk, I pop it open.

10:15.620 --> 10:23.140
I see the legs of the robot in there and I forcefully pull up the false bottom and I

10:23.140 --> 10:30.780
grab a bag of chips and a couple of Slim Jims and I drop it down, close my trunk and I walk

10:30.780 --> 10:36.300
in and I walk in the open door, close it behind me and I look at Clark, I go, I brought a

10:36.300 --> 10:37.300
couple of snacks.

10:37.300 --> 10:41.540
I know we got a couple of meals going, but you know, I figured for maybe, maybe we could

10:41.540 --> 10:48.220
watch a couple episodes and I put that on his coffee table and that'd be a good snack.

10:48.220 --> 10:52.700
I go to my freezer and I pull out the chicken nuggets and I pull out the Salisbury steak

10:52.700 --> 10:55.900
and Clark has always ever done one frozen dinner at a time.

10:55.900 --> 11:00.760
So he's kind of baffled right now and he thinks about it for a while and then he puts both

11:00.760 --> 11:06.700
of them into the microwave and just doubles the time.

11:06.700 --> 11:11.520
I sit down, uh, Clark, could you describe, well, not Clark, but uh, could, could you

11:11.520 --> 11:14.740
describe Clark's like a furniture situation?

11:14.740 --> 11:20.660
Yeah, there's a couch that is along the window next to the door and there's a recliner right

11:20.660 --> 11:24.880
across from the TV and everything is kind of dated.

11:24.880 --> 11:29.340
So if I, if I sat on the couch, it would be in view of the television, view of the television,

11:29.340 --> 11:30.620
but perpendicular to it.

11:30.620 --> 11:33.060
So it's a little off kilter.

11:33.100 --> 11:38.340
So, uh, I sit down on the side of the couch, closest, you just make yourself at home over

11:38.340 --> 11:39.340
there Keith.

11:39.340 --> 11:42.260
Mi casa, su casa, as the Spanish say.

11:42.260 --> 11:48.300
I sit down on the side of the couch that's closest to like the, the, the, the best view

11:48.300 --> 11:52.780
of the television cause I know that I'm in your house, you're cooking me food.

11:52.780 --> 11:58.220
I did bring snacks over, but I don't, I don't feel like I should sit in your recliner.

11:58.220 --> 12:03.140
So I sit down on that side of the couch, but I also do scoot the couch up a little

12:03.140 --> 12:04.140
closer to TV.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.980
I walk in and kind of pause.

12:06.980 --> 12:09.940
Uh, did you move it?

12:09.940 --> 12:11.940
Did you move the couch there?

12:11.940 --> 12:17.900
Yeah, I just, you know, I figured if we're watching TV, I might as well, is that, I,

12:17.900 --> 12:23.340
and I, I immediately, I move it back, scratching up the floor again as I move it back.

12:23.340 --> 12:24.340
Clark winces.

12:24.340 --> 12:25.340
I'm sorry, man.

12:25.660 --> 12:28.500
So I get up and I, um, no, it's, it's, it's fine.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.180
You're just Clark, just sit down.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.180
Just sit down.

12:31.180 --> 12:32.620
No, I got to keep an eye on these.

12:32.620 --> 12:33.620
You know what?

12:33.620 --> 12:34.620
I'm the guest here.

12:34.620 --> 12:35.820
I'll, I'll keep an eye on the food.

12:35.820 --> 12:40.100
You just sit down in your recliner, pop, pop the legs up, sit down.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.100
Don't worry about it.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.100
I, you know what?

12:42.100 --> 12:43.100
I'm the guest.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.180
I'm, I'm here to take care of you.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.180
Clark uneasily sits down in the recliner.

12:47.180 --> 12:53.340
I sit down on the, the, uh, the arm of the recliner and I'm like, you know, I'll just,

12:53.340 --> 12:56.300
as soon as that microwave goes off, I'll, I'll get our stuff.

12:56.300 --> 13:04.820
And I, I put my arm around Clark and I, I'm like, you know, turn on that game show network.

13:04.820 --> 13:07.300
You know, this is a nice little bonding.

13:07.300 --> 13:12.620
Clark leans forward real hard to get out of the arm and grabs the remote.

13:12.620 --> 13:18.260
And I, I kinda, I pull my arm up and understanding how uncomfortable he is, I'm like, is this

13:18.260 --> 13:19.260
good?

13:19.260 --> 13:27.980
Now, how is the couch placed within the room?

13:27.980 --> 13:30.780
Uh, I do want to emphasize that the house is immaculate.

13:30.780 --> 13:33.900
Like I keep it pretty Spartan and clean.

13:33.900 --> 13:39.260
I flip on the game show network and uh, I instantly kind of do the slack jot in front

13:39.260 --> 13:44.020
of the TV face for, Oh, Hey, um, I kind of start to pop up.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.860
No, I, I almost smells like plastic burning.

13:46.860 --> 13:52.700
I almost forcefully like put my hand on Clark's chest and push him down into his comfy chair.

13:52.700 --> 13:53.700
I kiss Keith.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.700
I'll get it.

13:54.700 --> 14:11.020
The microwave goes off, I get up and I, I go, I don't really, okay, um, ding.

14:11.020 --> 14:16.840
I get up off the arm chair of the lazy boy and I go to the microwave and I open it up

14:16.840 --> 14:24.680
and um, I see two microwave dinners stacked on top of each other and the plastic on the

14:24.680 --> 14:28.800
top part is just melted into my Salisbury steak.

14:28.800 --> 14:34.540
So I pull them out and like the chicken nuggets are cooked well and like I peel the plastic

14:34.540 --> 14:37.440
top off of that and I'm like, Oh, these look good.

14:37.440 --> 14:42.240
So I grabbed the chicken nugget, I swish it around in the mashed potato part of that and

14:42.240 --> 14:43.240
I pop it in my mouth.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.240
I'm like, yeah, that's pretty good.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.760
It burns the fuck out of your mouth.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.760
Yeah.

14:46.760 --> 14:52.720
So did you pass your constitution check?

14:52.720 --> 14:53.720
I did actually.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.720
Yeah.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.720
All right.

14:55.720 --> 14:56.720
You can, you can deal with it.

14:56.720 --> 15:00.880
So I, and then I get the Salisbury steak, the plastic is melted onto the Salisbury steak.

15:00.880 --> 15:06.700
I try to peel the plastic off, but like I, it takes me like eight different peeling off

15:06.700 --> 15:07.700
the edges to get in.

15:07.700 --> 15:11.320
There's still a plastic on there, but I'm like, yeah, what, I mean, I'm a guest in this

15:11.320 --> 15:12.320
house.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.320
Fuck it.

15:13.320 --> 15:21.640
So, um, yeah, so I bring, um, both TV dinners in there and I sit back down on the arm of

15:21.640 --> 15:25.600
of Clark's chair and I'm like, okay, let's watch.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.440
Uh, what is this like a, like jeopardy or something?

15:28.440 --> 15:32.360
I only have one TV dinner tray stand that I use.

15:32.360 --> 15:36.360
So I go over and grab that and I kind of start setting it up in front of me and I look up

15:36.360 --> 15:41.400
at Keith sitting on the arm of my chair and I'm, Hey, you know, you can, you can use this.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.360
Go, go take that over to that couch over there.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.960
No dude, that's okay.

15:44.960 --> 15:45.960
You can.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.760
I stand up and start setting up the tray in front of the couch.

15:48.760 --> 15:49.760
You can use it.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.600
And I put it back in front of him.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.960
Just lay, lay down and, and don't worry about it.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.360
I'm just going to sit right here.

15:57.360 --> 16:01.840
I I'm real, I'm, I'm starting to get a little weirded out that he's wanting to hover around

16:01.840 --> 16:02.840
me.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.040
So this is uncomfortable.

16:04.040 --> 16:10.640
And I looked down at my chicken nugget tray and Hey, he, these usually have eight nuggets

16:10.640 --> 16:14.880
in them, but this one only has, Oh yeah, that's, I was gonna, and I, I like

16:14.880 --> 16:21.320
use my plastic fork to cut a little piece of my Salisbury steak out and I put it on

16:21.320 --> 16:27.120
his chicken nugget tray, but it's the one piece of Salisbury steak that has like the

16:27.120 --> 16:31.000
plastic still melted on top of it.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
You know what?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.520
I will take that tray and I take the tray.

16:33.520 --> 16:39.520
I go sit down on the edge of the couch and I'm like, okay, let's uh, let's just play

16:39.520 --> 16:44.360
wheel fortune or how are, you know, that goes right buddy.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.680
I uh, those chicken nuggets are cooked very well by the way.

16:47.680 --> 16:53.400
I, I, I, uh, I kind of fumble with the, uh, the plastic on the Salisbury steak and I popped

16:53.400 --> 16:56.280
that into my mouth first and I'm like, I do like that.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.280
I do really like that.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.280
Salisbury steak.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.280
It's a good one.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.280
I gave you just so you know.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.280
Yeah.

17:01.280 --> 17:09.440
I mean, and I, um, I, uh, take, I take like a little bite of it and like, it's okay.

17:09.440 --> 17:16.520
I, for the sake of time, I finished my entire meal real quick and I like without a word

17:16.520 --> 17:21.560
stand up and start walking back to the bedrooms and I go into like a linen closet and I get

17:21.560 --> 17:26.800
out like a pillow and some sheets and I go into the spare bedroom that has a bed in it

17:26.800 --> 17:30.160
but is bare and I get the sheets all on it.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.400
Hey, uh, Keith, uh, I got your bed ready.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.400
Dude.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.560
This show is kind of like hangman real quick.

17:35.560 --> 17:44.240
I need you both to roll an intelligence check against each other.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.800
I got a 39 on a 55.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.280
I got a 73 on a 50.

17:50.280 --> 17:56.440
Clark wipes the floor with Keith while playing along to wheel of fortune.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.440
Nice.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.440
Anyway, that was happening.

17:58.440 --> 18:03.200
Oh, I mean, I tell you what Keith, I watch this about every night, so don't feel bad.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.760
You came up against a master.

18:04.760 --> 18:05.760
Yeah.

18:05.760 --> 18:06.760
Okay.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.320
I think I might go home honestly, but oh, you don't want to.

18:09.320 --> 18:14.760
I got the bed ready and if you're feeling, if you're feeling comfortable on your own

18:14.760 --> 18:20.840
tonight, I respect that you should, you know, I think I forgot why I came over here initially.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.040
It wasn't to, it was to hang out with you, Clark.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.720
That's that I'll, I'll stay here.

18:25.720 --> 18:30.080
It wasn't for any other reason other than I just wanted to hang out with you.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.080
Yeah.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.080
Of course.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.080
I had a great time.

18:33.080 --> 18:36.920
He knows deep inside that Keith was just real scared tonight about all the things we'd seen

18:36.920 --> 18:40.640
today and he knows that he's, this is his way of reaching out for comfort and this is

18:40.640 --> 18:41.640
time of need.

18:41.640 --> 18:46.060
Um, I go to sleep in the bed that Clark has made for me.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.960
I wait until Clark goes to sleep.

18:48.960 --> 18:49.960
Yeah.

18:49.960 --> 18:53.360
I go ahead and go to bed like right, like after that conversation, I'm like, I want

18:53.360 --> 18:55.040
to, I want to pass out.

18:55.040 --> 19:00.180
I call my landlord at the hotel and I say, Hey, is there an open room that I can stay

19:00.180 --> 19:02.540
in besides my own tonight?

19:02.540 --> 19:06.540
Cause I've got somebody that might be after me in the morning.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.580
There's definitely an open room.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.860
So I, um, I clean up our TV dinners.

19:10.860 --> 19:12.940
I move the couch back.

19:12.940 --> 19:16.500
I quietly leave Bishop's house.

19:16.500 --> 19:31.180
Keith, when you may get back to hotel motel, you are getting out of your police cruiser

19:31.180 --> 19:35.660
when a young girl approaches you.

19:35.660 --> 19:39.800
She seems to be a high schooler and you recognize her.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.100
This is your niece.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.020
It's Ferguson's daughter.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.020
What's her name?

19:44.020 --> 19:46.260
Oh, my niece is Francis beans.

19:46.260 --> 19:47.260
Okay.

19:47.260 --> 19:57.660
So Francis Francis, she walks up to you and she puts a finger over her mouth and hands

19:57.660 --> 19:58.980
you a note.

19:58.980 --> 19:59.980
Yeah.

19:59.980 --> 20:04.860
If you want to read that aloud, no one hates my dad more than you.

20:04.860 --> 20:07.860
So I'm coming to you first with this opportunity.

20:07.860 --> 20:13.420
I know you have no love for your parents, especially after they left everything to Fergie,

20:13.420 --> 20:16.360
but I recently found out their deaths for no accident.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.460
He killed them when he needed the money.

20:18.460 --> 20:21.360
I found his will all of his money.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.860
Some of which I think you deserve goes to me upon his death.

20:25.860 --> 20:31.860
I will give you $1 million to kill my dad, please.

20:31.860 --> 20:33.200
We deserve it.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.300
He deserves it.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.200
Follow me in your car, but don't make it obvious.

20:38.200 --> 20:43.400
And she holds a lighter underneath the note and she lights it.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.400
She kind of motions.

20:44.400 --> 20:48.580
I throw the note off to the side as it's burning.

20:48.580 --> 20:56.680
And she goes over and hops in her Chrysler Sebring and kind of motions for you to follow

20:56.680 --> 20:57.680
her.

20:57.680 --> 20:58.680
I look around.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.440
Can I do a search for anyone around us?

21:01.440 --> 21:02.440
Sure.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.440
Yeah.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.440
Six.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.500
You see that no one is out and about right now.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.500
No one's watching.

21:09.500 --> 21:13.860
I reluctantly get in the passenger side of her car.

21:13.860 --> 21:21.700
When you get into her car, she looks at you and she rolls her eyes and she's like, um,

21:21.700 --> 21:23.840
maybe get in your own car.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.440
Maybe follow me in your car.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.860
Like it said on the fucking note, maybe.

21:28.860 --> 21:33.340
No, take me to where you're going to go.

21:33.340 --> 21:34.340
Okay.

21:34.460 --> 21:39.380
And she drives up and hops on the highway and heads toward the city.

21:49.380 --> 21:54.060
John Lee Pettymore, as you were driving north through contention on the way to your home,

21:54.060 --> 21:58.340
you go over the bridge that travels over Coles Creek.

21:58.340 --> 22:04.440
Looking out the window of your borrowed and pounded vehicle, you see animals of all size

22:04.440 --> 22:10.940
and type filling the waters below, but you notice there are fewer and fewer animals the

22:10.940 --> 22:13.960
farther north you drive.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.780
After passing the highway and leaving the city limits of contention, you turn down a

22:17.780 --> 22:25.180
long gravel road that eventually leads to the isolated home of officer Pettymore.

22:25.180 --> 22:26.940
What do you do upon arrival?

22:26.980 --> 22:28.740
I'm going to give Drew a call real quick.

22:28.740 --> 22:31.020
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

22:31.020 --> 22:31.520
Hey.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.820
Hey Drew, is everything set for tonight?

22:33.820 --> 22:34.820
Everything's ready to go.

22:34.820 --> 22:35.820
When do you want me to come out?

22:35.820 --> 22:37.500
Uh, what time did you tell them to meet?

22:37.500 --> 22:38.500
2 a.m.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.500
2 a.m.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.500
All right.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.500
Why don't you get here around midnight?

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
Okay, perfect.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.500
All right.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.500
I'll see you then.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.500
All right.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.500
Okay.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.500
I'm excited buddy.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.500
Me too.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.500
We're going to be rich.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.500
Hopefully.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.500
Okay.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
Okay.

22:52.660 --> 22:57.860
Like John Lee Pettymore gives himself a moment to, uh, to imagine that just like, what if,

22:57.860 --> 22:58.860
what if it does all go well?

22:58.860 --> 23:04.340
What if I do get that money and he, he sits in the, the Toyota Corolla for about five

23:04.340 --> 23:08.820
minutes just like letting himself feel that and kind of trying to de-stress a little bit.

23:08.820 --> 23:15.360
He's going to try to get a little nap before, before, uh, everything goes down.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.620
So yeah, he's just excited to get back to his home.

23:18.620 --> 23:19.620
Absolutely.

23:19.620 --> 23:25.780
As you walk into your house, however, your entire home has been flipped over.

23:25.780 --> 23:30.620
It looks like someone broke in and rifled through all of your shit.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.080
What the hell?

23:32.080 --> 23:33.300
What the fucking hell?

23:33.300 --> 23:38.220
As you're going through room by room, trying to piece together what's happening with your

23:38.220 --> 23:44.660
gun out, you notice that you're, uh, Smokey and the Bandit DVDs and all the memorabilia

23:44.660 --> 23:46.020
has been knocked over.

23:46.020 --> 23:47.700
Some of it's been stepped on.

23:47.780 --> 23:49.780
Smokey's!

23:49.780 --> 23:52.780
I would do such a thing.

23:52.780 --> 23:54.780
God damn it.

23:54.780 --> 24:00.260
First this whole fucking town goes to shit and then somebody steps on my Smokey DVDs

24:00.260 --> 24:05.300
and now it's fucking, what a goddamn horrible day.

24:05.300 --> 24:16.980
And as you are looking about, you see, there is a Burgatory Rewards card for Keith Vigna

24:16.980 --> 24:17.980
on the floor.

24:17.980 --> 24:20.180
I'm, I'm gonna kill him.

24:20.180 --> 24:23.980
I'm gonna fucking kill that son of a bitch.

24:23.980 --> 24:32.860
That idiot, incompetent, coke-addled, motherfucking ransacker, I'm going to kill him.

24:32.860 --> 24:35.780
You say to an empty, turned-over home.

24:35.780 --> 24:36.780
Ah!

24:36.780 --> 24:39.980
I fire my gun several times into the ceiling.

24:39.980 --> 24:46.820
Dust and, like, the popcorn from the ceiling starts coming down around you.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.660
You had popcorn in your ceiling, right?

24:49.660 --> 24:51.300
Yeah, I keep several.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.660
It's cheaper than insulation.

24:52.660 --> 24:54.140
You just go to the stadium.

24:54.140 --> 25:00.140
So the sprint car racing, they just used to give me big ol' bags of the popcorn.

25:00.140 --> 25:03.620
If you keep it in plastic, it doesn't go bad.

25:03.620 --> 25:07.700
And that is, yeah, the squirrels had chewed through all my old shit, so.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.500
They definitely won't chew through the popcorn.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.500
Well not in plastic.

25:10.500 --> 25:14.180
They can't smell it.

25:14.180 --> 25:17.940
It does, I mean, now that it's raining down on me here, it does look like the squirrel,

25:17.940 --> 25:22.940
yeah, like, it's mostly just kernels, so, I think that, yeah, I think they got into

25:22.940 --> 25:23.940
it.

25:23.940 --> 25:24.940
Yeah.

25:24.940 --> 25:29.500
He lets his frustration out, shooting, shooting his gun into the roof, and then he just collapses

25:29.500 --> 25:31.140
onto the couch, dejected.

25:31.140 --> 25:35.780
Would you run and try to make sure that the cocaine is still where you put it?

25:35.780 --> 25:37.500
Would you be worried about that?

25:37.500 --> 25:38.500
No.

25:38.500 --> 25:42.940
Well, it was dark, but it would have taken, like, excavation to get it, yeah, and I don't

25:42.940 --> 25:44.940
think I saw any signs of that.

25:44.940 --> 25:47.460
How are you prepping for the deal that's going down?

25:47.460 --> 25:48.580
I don't think he would sleep now.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.660
I think he's too angry to sleep.

25:50.660 --> 25:57.580
John Lee Pennymore just needs to stay focused, and he is unspeakably angry at Keith, but

25:57.580 --> 26:01.920
he's going to rechannel that anger into just energy for tonight.

26:01.920 --> 26:08.340
What he's going to do right now is smoke a big ol' bowl and put on smoking the bandit

26:08.340 --> 26:13.580
and just de-stress for a minute and just fucking try to forget it all for a minute.

26:13.580 --> 26:16.540
I'm going to be a rich man in two hours.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.260
I just got to fucking, er, four hours.

26:19.260 --> 26:21.300
Drew gets here in two hours.

26:21.300 --> 26:33.780
I just got to calm down, watch Smokey, and then tomorrow I'm going to kill Keith Igna.

26:33.780 --> 26:38.020
Then the credits roll on Smokey and the bandit extended cut.

26:38.020 --> 26:39.020
The doorbell rings.

26:39.020 --> 26:40.660
Gun draw, and I go to the door.

26:40.660 --> 26:41.660
Yeah, it's Drew.

26:41.660 --> 26:42.660
I peek through.

26:42.660 --> 26:43.660
Hey, hey, buddy.

26:43.660 --> 26:44.660
Hey!

26:44.660 --> 26:45.660
Come on in.

26:45.660 --> 26:46.660
Okay, cool.

26:46.660 --> 26:52.460
And he is holding a pistol, and he is holding it, like, by the top.

26:52.460 --> 26:56.060
Hey, Drew, you ever shot one of those before?

26:56.060 --> 26:57.060
Nope.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.060
Okay, we got a couple hours.

26:58.060 --> 27:00.300
I'm going to give you a quick rundown on all this.

27:00.300 --> 27:02.260
See, here's the safety.

27:02.260 --> 27:03.260
You got that off.

27:03.260 --> 27:04.260
Yep.

27:04.260 --> 27:05.260
Yeah, you want to put that on.

27:05.260 --> 27:06.260
Oh, okay.

27:06.260 --> 27:07.260
Let's go.

27:07.260 --> 27:08.260
I got a shooting tree.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.260
Let's go back and shoot the shooting tree for a minute.

27:09.260 --> 27:12.700
You guys go back and shoot the shooting tree for a minute, and he's not, you know, he's

27:12.700 --> 27:13.700
not good.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.580
I at least want to teach him how to, like, hold it.

27:15.580 --> 27:17.580
Yeah, you don't think he's going to shoot you.

27:17.580 --> 27:18.580
No.

27:18.580 --> 27:23.620
Unless things get really bad, I want you to just keep that safety on, but I do feel like

27:23.620 --> 27:26.900
we've taught you how to hold this and look more intimidating to the mafia.

27:26.900 --> 27:27.900
I couldn't agree more.

27:27.900 --> 27:30.020
I look very intimidating.

27:30.020 --> 27:33.460
She says with four inches of gums just hanging out.

27:33.460 --> 27:35.740
Man, Emmett made the right call.

27:35.740 --> 27:36.740
Emmett's so cool.

27:36.740 --> 27:37.740
What'd you say?

27:37.740 --> 27:38.740
Nothing, buddy.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.740
Okay, cool.

27:39.740 --> 27:43.340
You're, hey, you can get a billion gum surgeries with all the money we're going to have.

27:43.340 --> 27:46.340
I didn't even consider, oh my goodness.

27:46.340 --> 27:48.180
Think about that, buddy.

27:48.180 --> 27:49.980
John, what's sex like?

27:49.980 --> 27:51.540
That's not bad.

27:51.540 --> 27:52.540
Okay.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.540
Maybe one day.

27:53.540 --> 27:55.540
How old are you, dude?

27:55.540 --> 27:56.540
I'm 57.

27:56.540 --> 27:57.540
No.

27:57.540 --> 27:58.980
He's in his early 30s.

27:58.980 --> 28:04.060
God, you must moisturize.

28:04.060 --> 28:05.300
We're getting you laid.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.300
We're going to get you laid tonight.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.300
Okay.

28:07.300 --> 28:08.300
Probably not tonight.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.300
I'm very tired.

28:09.300 --> 28:12.420
I should not be making a cocaine deal at two in the morning.

28:12.420 --> 28:17.500
I'm extremely wounded and this town is beset by unnatural horrors.

28:17.500 --> 28:20.940
So maybe we'll have to wait until next week, but we'll get you laid, buddy.

28:20.940 --> 28:21.940
Okay.

28:21.940 --> 28:22.940
Oh my goodness.

28:22.940 --> 28:23.940
Okay, cool.

28:23.940 --> 28:25.940
Is there a strip club in town?

28:25.940 --> 28:31.020
No, there's just a, there's an auto mechanic called sassy reds.

28:31.020 --> 28:32.020
Okay.

28:32.020 --> 28:35.240
It's a pink Cadillac.

28:35.240 --> 28:39.980
It's coming up on, that's so much better.

28:39.980 --> 28:42.460
So it's coming up on 2 AM.

28:42.460 --> 28:46.340
I'm going to go ahead and have you lose two willpower for me.

28:46.340 --> 28:47.340
Okay.

28:47.340 --> 28:48.340
I'm down to eight.

28:48.340 --> 28:50.540
And then what do you want to do last minute?

28:50.540 --> 28:52.060
Get ready.

28:52.060 --> 28:55.020
You think they could probably be rolling up whenever.

28:55.020 --> 28:58.220
So drew, I've, I've made some arrangements here.

28:58.220 --> 29:02.300
I'm just going to check to make sure that's all on place.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.180
Just out to the woods.

29:04.180 --> 29:10.980
I just kind of make a bird call and a similar, but slightly different bird returns.

29:10.980 --> 29:11.980
The call.

29:11.980 --> 29:15.300
I love the great Northern collar.

29:15.300 --> 29:16.300
It's my favorite bird.

29:16.300 --> 29:17.300
Drew.

29:17.300 --> 29:18.300
How about you?

29:18.300 --> 29:19.300
Oh, I've never heard of that one.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.620
I'm a fan of pigeons.

29:20.620 --> 29:21.620
Okay.

29:21.620 --> 29:24.060
Those sure are birds.

29:24.100 --> 29:26.020
Uh, I'm going to do a little bump too.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.020
Okay, cool.

29:27.020 --> 29:31.940
Go ahead and roll a D six, four, four willpower back, full.

29:31.940 --> 29:32.940
Yeah.

29:32.940 --> 29:33.940
12.

29:33.940 --> 29:38.100
It feels to you like right before lunch, I'm ready to start my day.

29:38.100 --> 29:46.420
That's a joke, but that's also just true to John and Thomas.

29:46.420 --> 29:52.460
Well, we've established that John goes to work at like 7 AM.

29:52.500 --> 30:00.100
Okay, so you hear a car turn down your road, you've got a long driveway and you see the

30:00.100 --> 30:09.660
lights and it is a large white 15 passenger van that is pulling a white trailer behind

30:09.660 --> 30:17.420
it and as it pulls up to your homestead, you would see painted on the van as well as the

30:17.420 --> 30:22.540
trailer in large block letters, it says Jesus Christ ministries.

30:22.540 --> 30:23.540
Oh shit.

30:23.540 --> 30:29.740
As you're looking at it, it looks like the 15 passenger van is filled with children.

30:29.740 --> 30:33.540
Hey, uh, uh, Drew, what the fuck are all the kids doing in the van?

30:33.540 --> 30:35.340
I have absolutely no idea.

30:35.340 --> 30:37.580
Um, who are we meeting exactly?

30:37.580 --> 30:38.580
His name is the Duke.

30:38.580 --> 30:39.580
He's with the mafia?

30:39.580 --> 30:40.580
I don't-

30:40.580 --> 30:41.580
How do you know the Duke?

30:41.580 --> 30:42.580
I-I-

30:42.580 --> 30:44.500
God, we should have covered some of this before.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.500
Probably.

30:45.580 --> 30:52.140
As you guys are having that conversation, the van passenger door opens up and the most

30:52.140 --> 30:56.620
handsome man you've ever seen gets out of the van.

30:56.620 --> 31:02.980
He has perfect hair, perfect teeth, a perfect jawline and he is wearing the fuck out of

31:02.980 --> 31:11.180
a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel and he begins walking

31:11.180 --> 31:16.140
up to the two of you on the porch and he just stands there.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.740
He's the Duke?

31:17.740 --> 31:19.260
Yes I am.

31:19.260 --> 31:20.740
Are you Drew?

31:20.740 --> 31:21.740
Drew's here.

31:21.740 --> 31:30.300
Uh, yes, I'm Drew and I believe you've got some cocaine for me, is that correct?

31:30.300 --> 31:32.940
I believe you have some money for us?

31:32.940 --> 31:35.380
Uh, that is certainly correct.

31:35.380 --> 31:38.740
Alright, well we'll point your boys where to dig in.

31:38.820 --> 31:42.980
We got the cocaine on the property here, store it away, uh, why don't you show us the money?

31:42.980 --> 31:46.580
You give half of it to us, we'll show you the first hole, give us the other half, we'll

31:46.580 --> 31:48.100
show you the second hole.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.300
Seems like a deal.

31:49.300 --> 31:54.860
He is going to turn around and walk back into the van.

31:54.860 --> 32:02.540
He kind of leans in, you hear him say something, and then he comes back out with a briefcase

32:02.540 --> 32:04.260
handcuffed to his wrist.

32:04.300 --> 32:14.460
I've got half, which is five billion dollars US currency, in this briefcase.

32:14.460 --> 32:20.420
And you see a bunch of children run out, they're all carrying shovels, and they stay pretty

32:20.420 --> 32:24.500
far away, they're like on the other side of the van, they all kind of line up, like staring

32:24.500 --> 32:28.900
at you, all holding the shovels in the exact same way in front of them.

32:28.900 --> 32:32.540
And he says, where do you want me to dig?

32:32.540 --> 32:36.860
Drew, go take a look at that briefcase, make sure everything's alright.

32:36.860 --> 32:37.860
Okay.

32:37.860 --> 32:43.300
And he pops over there, looks into the briefcase, he cracks it open, closes it right back up,

32:43.300 --> 32:48.980
Drew walks back, I don't know, it seems like a whole shitload of money in there, John.

32:48.980 --> 32:53.300
Alright buddy, hold onto your britches, you're not Keith.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.300
Keith, his britches too big.

32:55.300 --> 32:56.460
Yeah, I think they're too big.

32:56.460 --> 32:57.460
Too big.

32:57.460 --> 32:58.460
Yeah, so they fall off.

32:58.460 --> 32:59.460
Fucking first.

32:59.860 --> 33:05.020
Anyway, alright, just hold onto your britches buddy, we're not through this yet.

33:05.020 --> 33:11.300
Alright Duke, you see that maple tree over there?

33:11.300 --> 33:12.540
Get to digging.

33:12.540 --> 33:20.900
And he points, and the children in a beautiful single file line, all with the same movements

33:20.900 --> 33:25.500
run over, and all at the exact same time begin digging.

33:25.540 --> 33:29.900
Mr. Duke, while you got your children there digging, can I ask you a couple questions?

33:29.900 --> 33:30.900
Go for it.

33:30.900 --> 33:34.380
Uh, why you got children out here digging for cocaine at two in the morning?

33:34.380 --> 33:35.980
I didn't have anybody else.

33:35.980 --> 33:36.980
How'd you get them?

33:36.980 --> 33:40.180
Um, well, I made those children.

33:40.180 --> 33:41.180
They're yours?

33:41.180 --> 33:42.180
Yep.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.180
Same mom?

33:43.180 --> 33:45.580
Uh, yeah, yeah, you can say that.

33:45.580 --> 33:52.420
And he walks back over, and these kids are digging so fucking fast, dirt is just like

33:52.420 --> 33:58.660
flying everywhere, and they get down and, I'm assuming this is where the cocaine is,

33:58.660 --> 33:59.660
is that correct?

33:59.660 --> 34:01.700
Okay, so about half of it.

34:01.700 --> 34:09.380
And they start piling the cocaine into the trailer that is being pulled behind the van.

34:09.380 --> 34:16.900
And the Duke walks over and unlatches the handcuff from the other end and hands you

34:16.900 --> 34:17.900
the briefcase.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.660
There's five million dollars in it.

34:20.660 --> 34:21.660
Alright.

34:21.900 --> 34:25.900
That's, wow, that's a lot of money.

34:25.900 --> 34:29.820
Duke, uh, Duke, Duke, show us the other case.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.340
You're a stickler.

34:31.340 --> 34:36.940
And he walks back to the van and hooks another case onto his wrist and walks back over to

34:36.940 --> 34:38.860
you and gives you a peek.

34:38.860 --> 34:39.860
Looks the same.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.460
Alright, just round back behind that woodpile.

34:42.460 --> 34:43.740
Your boy should see the hole.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.580
Well, alright.

34:45.580 --> 34:52.380
And he sends the children over to behind the woodpile, and they begin digging just as furiously

34:52.380 --> 34:53.820
as they did the first time.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.500
Drew, can I speak to you for a minute?

34:55.500 --> 34:56.500
Yeah.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.940
You don't know nothing about, what kind of crime is this Duke involved in?

34:58.940 --> 35:00.700
I think he's a drug dealer.

35:00.700 --> 35:04.340
Alright, yeah, that's fair.

35:04.340 --> 35:05.340
That's fair.

35:05.340 --> 35:07.340
Uh, how dangerous do you think he is?

35:07.340 --> 35:09.340
I mean, he just brought children.

35:09.340 --> 35:14.540
I haven't told you this, but we've got about a dozen petty moor cousins watching us from

35:14.540 --> 35:15.540
the trees right now.

35:15.540 --> 35:16.540
What?

35:16.540 --> 35:17.540
Yeah, man.

35:17.540 --> 35:18.540
Overwatch.

35:18.540 --> 35:19.540
Like...

35:19.540 --> 35:20.540
I thought it was just me and you.

35:20.540 --> 35:21.540
That takes so much stress off my shoulders.

35:21.540 --> 35:23.100
I should have probably told you, yeah.

35:23.100 --> 35:24.100
Oh my goodness.

35:24.100 --> 35:28.260
But I don't see a fucking, I don't see any goons or muscle, just all these children.

35:28.260 --> 35:31.900
And, you know, I don't want to take candy from a baby, but it seems like we could just

35:31.900 --> 35:35.900
take the ten million dollars and all the cocaine.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.380
What kind of retribution would that bring down upon us?

35:38.380 --> 35:40.940
You want to fuck with a drug dealer from the city?

35:40.940 --> 35:41.940
Maybe.

35:41.940 --> 35:46.100
I'm just saying, it seems like the opportunity has presented itself.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.500
But then we'd just have to sell the cocaine again.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.500
This was really stressful.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.060
I've been pooping all day.

35:51.060 --> 35:57.140
Yeah, but imagine how easy you would poop from now on if you had ten million dollars.

35:57.140 --> 36:02.660
I honestly don't see that much of a difference between five and ten million dollars, but...

36:02.660 --> 36:04.860
It's twice, there's twice a difference.

36:04.860 --> 36:08.500
Yeah, math was never my strong suit, but I just think...

36:08.500 --> 36:11.300
I don't know, it's just a thought I had.

36:11.340 --> 36:13.620
Maybe he's got somebody watching us, I don't know, but...

36:13.620 --> 36:14.620
John?

36:14.620 --> 36:15.620
Fuck, yeah?

36:15.620 --> 36:17.780
I'm down with whatever you want to do.

36:17.780 --> 36:19.260
Just give me a signal, okay?

36:19.260 --> 36:20.540
Yell bubblegum tree.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.060
What's that mean?

36:22.060 --> 36:23.060
Just kidding.

36:23.060 --> 36:28.980
Oh my god, I got so scared for a moment, and he like hits you on the chest with his hand

36:28.980 --> 36:29.980
and he's like...

36:29.980 --> 36:33.860
Oh man, you're so silly, I like doing this with you.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.940
Me too Drew, you're a fun guy.

36:35.940 --> 36:41.540
And the children are now taking the second pile of cocaine and loading it up into the

36:41.540 --> 36:44.100
trailer behind this van.

36:44.100 --> 36:52.500
And when they are finished, the Duke walks toward you and undoes the lock on the handcuffs

36:52.500 --> 36:56.340
to the briefcase and hands you the briefcase.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.780
Well this is just fucking great.

36:59.780 --> 37:03.860
I love it when a deal goes off without a hitch.

37:03.860 --> 37:04.860
Me too.

37:04.860 --> 37:07.820
This went off far smoother than I expected it to.

37:07.820 --> 37:11.100
I do have a couple questions though.

37:11.100 --> 37:15.180
And I understand I might have to grease your palms to get you to talk, but you just gave

37:15.180 --> 37:16.180
me a shitload of money.

37:16.180 --> 37:20.780
It seems like I'm in a position to give a little bit back and I slip them like a grand.

37:20.780 --> 37:21.780
What is this for?

37:21.780 --> 37:23.520
That's a down payment for some information.

37:23.520 --> 37:29.500
I wouldn't give me any money until you have the information you think this money is worth.

37:29.500 --> 37:34.460
I think the information I'm looking for might be worth a little bit more than a grand.

37:34.460 --> 37:38.140
You ask the question, I'll name the price, and we can figure it out.

37:38.140 --> 37:42.220
What do you know about Marvin Glass?

37:42.220 --> 37:47.340
Well, I don't fucking like him.

37:47.340 --> 37:51.900
I would consider him my competition, I suppose.

37:51.900 --> 37:59.660
Although he is also a customer, I guess it's a bit of a mixed bag, my relationship with

37:59.660 --> 38:00.660
Marvin Glass.

38:00.660 --> 38:04.020
A personal customer, or he buys in bulk from you?

38:04.020 --> 38:06.740
That'll be one thousand dollars.

38:06.740 --> 38:07.740
Done.

38:07.740 --> 38:09.180
He buys in bulk.

38:09.180 --> 38:11.300
Do you know anything about his boys?

38:11.300 --> 38:12.300
Like his uh...

38:12.300 --> 38:13.300
His two sons.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.300
Oh, I don't know.

38:14.300 --> 38:20.820
He has them, I don't know, he has them run muscle for them sometimes, he has them shake

38:20.820 --> 38:21.820
people down.

38:21.820 --> 38:22.820
I don't fucking know.

38:22.820 --> 38:26.700
Neither one of them have ever been much of a threat to me.

38:26.700 --> 38:30.140
What are y'all hearing in the city about what's been going down under contention?

38:30.140 --> 38:31.500
Anything making the news up there?

38:31.500 --> 38:38.460
Well, I have heard, uh, you know, it's a bit on the news that the contingent police department

38:38.460 --> 38:43.780
is uh, doing a pretty fucking terrible job, and they're probably gonna get eroded real

38:43.780 --> 38:44.780
soon.

38:44.780 --> 38:49.500
So, you know, I don't know, seems like a bunch of death and murder, it's gotten a lot of

38:49.500 --> 38:52.500
the fuzz off my back, I'll tell you that much.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.940
The city fuzz is focusing their attention down here?

38:54.940 --> 39:00.180
Well, I don't know, things have been pretty smooth for me recently, I'm not sure what

39:00.180 --> 39:01.180
that's all about.

39:01.180 --> 39:03.940
Hey, Mr. Duke, is there any significance to the rose you wear?

39:03.940 --> 39:08.220
I like the way it smells.

39:08.220 --> 39:11.060
I can't smell, I don't have the sense to smell, it's a joke.

39:11.060 --> 39:12.060
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

39:12.060 --> 39:13.860
I look fresh as fuck, don't you think?

39:13.860 --> 39:16.940
You're pretty fly, I mean, it's a good thing you had all those kids to do that digging

39:16.940 --> 39:17.940
with that white suit.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.100
I absolutely agree.

39:19.100 --> 39:20.500
These are all your kids?

39:20.500 --> 39:25.300
And he turns around, Drew, it's good doing business with you, I think we're done here.

39:25.300 --> 39:29.740
And he opens up the passenger door of the van.

39:29.740 --> 39:36.580
And the children all load in with military precision before the Duke gives a quick bow,

39:36.580 --> 39:41.900
hops into the white van with Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side, and begins

39:41.900 --> 39:48.620
the wide turn necessary to head back down John's long gravel driveway.

39:48.620 --> 39:54.700
The van drives away into darkness, and Drew looks at you with wide eyes.

39:54.700 --> 39:55.700
Drew?

39:55.700 --> 39:56.700
Yeah?

39:57.700 --> 39:59.700
We're fucking millionaires, buddy.

39:59.700 --> 40:02.700
Oh my god, we're fucking millionaires.

40:02.700 --> 40:05.700
Oh my god.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.700
This is incredible.

40:07.700 --> 40:10.700
We just gotta get out of this town alive first.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.700
Should we leave tomorrow?

40:12.700 --> 40:14.700
I hadn't, I hadn't thought about it.

40:14.700 --> 40:18.700
Drew, you wouldn't, would you leave the boys at a time like this?

40:18.700 --> 40:21.700
Cause fuck it, man, now that you said it, I think I might.

40:21.700 --> 40:32.700
Well, I definitely don't need the paycheck anymore, and honestly, you know, our relationship

40:32.700 --> 40:37.700
has gotten stronger over the past couple days through all this.

40:37.700 --> 40:42.700
You know, I like Clark, Keith can certainly kiss my piss.

40:42.700 --> 40:43.700
Kiss my piss?

40:43.700 --> 40:45.700
Kiss my piss.

40:45.700 --> 40:52.700
He hands you, he hands you the firearm that he brought, and he's like, I honestly feel

40:52.700 --> 40:54.700
really weird holding this.

40:54.700 --> 40:58.700
Hey buddy though, listen, you're a cocaine millionaire now.

40:58.700 --> 40:59.700
Hold onto it.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.700
You might need it for protection.

41:01.700 --> 41:02.700
Okay.

41:02.700 --> 41:05.700
And he takes it back, and he's holding it correctly this time.

41:05.700 --> 41:08.700
He actually checks and makes sure the safety is on.

41:08.700 --> 41:12.700
John doesn't say anything, but like he wells up with pride just a little bit.

41:12.700 --> 41:17.700
Jimmy whistles and calls the Pettymore cousins out of the woods.

41:17.700 --> 41:18.700
Awesome.

41:18.700 --> 41:21.700
I'm trying to remember your cousin's name that saw the oil.

41:21.700 --> 41:22.700
Oh yeah.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.700
I don't think I've invited him.

41:24.700 --> 41:25.700
Jimmy.

41:25.700 --> 41:26.700
Not him.

41:26.700 --> 41:27.700
Not the shrooms guy?

41:27.700 --> 41:28.700
No.

41:28.700 --> 41:29.700
These are younger cousins.

41:29.700 --> 41:30.700
Fair enough.

41:30.700 --> 41:32.700
Like the youngest one is probably like 15.

41:32.700 --> 41:33.700
Okay, yeah.

41:33.700 --> 41:34.700
Oldest?

41:34.700 --> 41:35.700
40.

41:35.700 --> 41:36.700
Nice.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.700
Okay, so they all come out of the woods.

41:38.700 --> 41:40.700
Do you want to describe that?

41:40.700 --> 41:41.700
Yeah.

41:41.700 --> 41:48.260
So about eight very clearly Pettymores just step out from behind some trees in a circle

41:48.260 --> 41:55.120
around everywhere, and the youngest is 15, the oldest is 40, but they all are unmistakably

41:55.120 --> 41:56.500
of John's family.

41:56.500 --> 42:00.700
Like the blood is strong and perhaps intertwined.

42:00.700 --> 42:02.820
Oh yeah.

42:02.820 --> 42:03.820
And yeah, John-

42:03.820 --> 42:05.700
Nothing stronger than incest blood.

42:05.700 --> 42:06.700
Nope.

42:06.700 --> 42:11.380
John gives them each 10 grand out of his suitcase and says, good work boys.

42:11.380 --> 42:13.020
I'll see you all at the reunion.

42:13.020 --> 42:14.020
They all like-

42:14.020 --> 42:17.340
Oh yeah, and I toss them a 24 pack of keystone light.

42:17.340 --> 42:18.980
Hell yeah.

42:18.980 --> 42:24.100
They all like do a jump in the air and like high five each other.

42:24.100 --> 42:25.100
Yeah.

42:25.100 --> 42:28.700
We all take our pistols out and fire them into the air.

42:28.700 --> 42:29.700
Fuck yes.

42:29.700 --> 42:30.700
Freeze frame.

42:30.700 --> 42:30.700


42:41.700 --> 42:46.540
Clark, after you go to bed, you are having a little trouble sleeping.

42:46.540 --> 42:50.860
This is the first time someone's slept in your house in a long time.

42:50.860 --> 42:59.060
And you actually hear Keith open his door, walk out and you hear him open the front door

42:59.060 --> 43:03.540
and then you hear him leave and you hear a car start up and then you hear the car back

43:03.540 --> 43:04.540
out of the driveway.

43:04.540 --> 43:07.220
I want to get up and go to the front door and lock it.

43:07.220 --> 43:08.220
You do so?

43:08.220 --> 43:09.220
And I'm going to go back to bed.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.220
Okay, cool.

43:10.260 --> 43:18.500
So as you go back to your bed, looking out the window, you see Coles Creek which runs

43:18.500 --> 43:25.140
alongside your house and it flows down south from the lake at Centennial Park up north.

43:25.140 --> 43:31.700
You see the whole thing is packed with animals and a fair few people have been out and about

43:31.700 --> 43:33.460
looking for their pets.

43:33.460 --> 43:35.480
There's maybe one or two people out there now.

43:35.480 --> 43:43.520
But then you see another human and this one is in the creek hobbling down the frigid waterway

43:43.520 --> 43:45.040
in your direction.

43:45.040 --> 43:50.200
It's running, but it seems to be fighting through a limp and when he reaches the point

43:50.200 --> 43:56.360
in the creek closest to your house, he leaps from the water and begins screaming and waving

43:56.360 --> 44:00.000
his arms all while looking in your specific direction.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.120
I need you to roll Sanity for me.

44:02.120 --> 44:08.360
I pass 23 on a 29.

44:08.360 --> 44:09.360
Okay, cool.

44:09.360 --> 44:15.320
You're going to lose one Sanity and I don't know how you're going to rationalize this.

44:15.320 --> 44:22.320
Your brain is like having a hard time processing this, but this man making his way toward your

44:22.320 --> 44:24.920
house is you.

44:24.920 --> 44:27.400
Oh shit.

44:27.400 --> 44:32.320
All of a sudden you feel a warm pinch on the back of your neck and your vision tunnels

44:32.320 --> 44:34.560
to a close.

44:34.560 --> 44:41.360
You come to as a black bag is being snatched off your head.

44:41.360 --> 44:45.920
You feel hung over and your chest feels weird and tight.

44:45.920 --> 44:52.780
It smells damp and earthy and there's a haze around the torch above you shedding partial

44:52.780 --> 44:57.580
light from the middle of this small stonewalled room.

44:57.580 --> 45:04.420
You are sitting in a chair across a stone table from a man with grey hair under a white

45:04.420 --> 45:09.260
hard hat in a charcoal suit with a bolo tie.

45:09.260 --> 45:14.980
He looks relaxed as he tosses the black bag onto the table and begins to speak.

45:14.980 --> 45:21.220
Okay, so after Richard III's coronation, he was visited by a seer from Leichster who

45:21.220 --> 45:23.960
called himself the overseer.

45:23.960 --> 45:30.360
The seer claimed that the now king was to hold some very important knowledge but would

45:30.360 --> 45:33.500
need to have the restraint to not abuse this power.

45:33.500 --> 45:37.860
See, Richard was given this knowledge, but he couldn't handle it.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.740
He lost his mind and killed his two nephews.

45:40.740 --> 45:47.580
The overseer, disappointed, eventually passed the same knowledge down to a Henry Tudor so

45:47.580 --> 45:51.140
he could whoop Richard at Bosworth.

45:51.140 --> 45:57.020
Henry VII held this power and eventually passed it down to a reliable and trusted confidant,

45:57.020 --> 45:59.860
thankfully not his piece of shit son.

45:59.860 --> 46:05.460
This knowledge was passed down repeatedly, abused and respected, respected and abused

46:05.460 --> 46:09.800
until it made its way over the Atlantic to the colonies.

46:09.800 --> 46:17.280
Eventually landing with a high order of masons, a select few held this information for generations.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.960
But a grand purpose was never found.

46:19.960 --> 46:22.020
Until Paul Simon.

46:22.020 --> 46:23.960
The politician, not the singer.

46:23.960 --> 46:28.840
Soon after being elected to the Senate, he was walking near his home when he came across

46:28.840 --> 46:32.200
the first known xenonimatode.

46:32.200 --> 46:37.720
He sought out Robert Byrd, the Senate minority leader at the time to share his newfound understanding

46:37.720 --> 46:39.120
of the world.

46:39.120 --> 46:43.800
Thankfully for the world, Byrd was among those carrying the knowledge of the overseer from

46:43.800 --> 46:46.000
centuries before.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.360
Together they formed a small circle of men to hold the weight of this realization.

46:52.360 --> 46:58.260
Now today, we carry on their tradition by keeping the darkness out of this world.

46:58.260 --> 47:03.320
We are the opaque rampart delaying the destruction of life as we know it.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.120
Welcome to the circle of knowledge.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.140
Now you have questions, I'm sure.

47:08.140 --> 47:12.360
And I know this sounds hypocritical after that lengthy oration, but as my high school

47:12.360 --> 47:16.840
English teacher would always say, show, don't tell.

47:16.840 --> 47:22.120
And he immediately reaches under the table, and as he stands, he holds up an unspeakable

47:22.120 --> 47:26.240
worm-like abomination with one hand away from his body.

47:26.240 --> 47:32.560
The thing is two feet long and tube-like, covered in a squeamish black partially translucent

47:32.560 --> 47:33.620
membrane.

47:33.620 --> 47:40.720
Its body is segmented, and toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through

47:40.760 --> 47:43.160
its thin looking exterior.

47:43.160 --> 47:46.760
It has no identifiable eyes or nose.

47:46.760 --> 47:53.560
Its cavernous circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked

47:53.560 --> 48:00.560
teeth and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black.

48:10.720 --> 48:35.720
How am I the only one trying to fool over How can you have enough drowning out of the
