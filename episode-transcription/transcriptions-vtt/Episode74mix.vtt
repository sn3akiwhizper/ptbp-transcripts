00:00.000 --> 00:07.540
Hey all you cool dogs and puppas, it's your best friend Oh Wharf the dog, and I am here

00:07.540 --> 00:14.940
to receive all the belly rubs live on 694.2 PTBP.

00:14.940 --> 00:21.700
If you rub my tummy, make sure you wear some kind of gloves that you can dispose of, because

00:21.700 --> 00:29.500
otherwise you will obtain a scent on you that you will never get rid of, and a stickiness

00:29.500 --> 00:30.500
and ooze.

00:30.500 --> 00:35.900
I've been told I have a superglue-like secretion.

00:35.900 --> 00:41.280
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Mike Fardy, who tweeted about the show and tagged

00:41.280 --> 00:49.400
that pretending pod they write, to Wolf the dog, from Mike Fardy and the Wonders and Blunders

00:49.400 --> 00:51.060
podcast.

00:51.060 --> 00:56.060
Dearest Wolf the dog, I can't hold back my feelings any longer.

00:56.060 --> 01:04.860
Your gravely tones, your otherworldly fluting echoes, your got-dang thickness, may the light

01:04.860 --> 01:10.820
of the blood moon guide you to me like I'm a dumpster full of night meat.

01:10.820 --> 01:17.420
Much love from Wonders and Blunders, a fellow horror comedy actual play podcast, and good

01:17.420 --> 01:20.100
luck to those contention boys.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.780
End transmission.

01:21.780 --> 01:28.860
Well, thanks Mike Fardy and the Wonders and Blunders podcast, but I am spoken for at the

01:28.860 --> 01:29.860
moment.

01:29.860 --> 01:35.980
There's a trash can named Teresa that I spend a lot of my time with these days.

01:35.980 --> 01:42.100
She never asks for nothing, yet provides endless bounty for me and my loins.

01:42.100 --> 01:48.820
But if me and Teresa ever break things off, which we never will, I will definitely keep

01:48.820 --> 01:51.180
you in mind.

01:51.180 --> 01:53.900
Maybe, but probably not.

01:53.900 --> 01:58.020
There's a long list of suitors out there for little old Wolfie.

01:58.020 --> 02:02.580
Remember, if you want to holla at your old wolf, use the screen you're already staring

02:02.580 --> 02:07.300
at half the day and put something nasty out in the world with a tag for your dirtiest

02:07.300 --> 02:14.740
dog at pretending pod, or write a review on Apple podcasts and tag us in the proof.

02:14.740 --> 02:20.340
That's the goodest, and speaking of having nice things, you can find more tasty content

02:20.340 --> 02:27.500
to devour in these less than delicious times over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.820
And one more thing.

02:28.820 --> 02:35.100
If you've listened this far, you very likely know about the subreddit and discord communities,

02:35.100 --> 02:40.300
but I just want to say from the bottom of my stinky, greasy heart, it's a joy to watch

02:40.300 --> 02:47.540
these internet nooks and crannies blossom into havens of silly and supportive solidarity.

02:47.540 --> 02:56.700
Now time to get serious, because this episode is so, so very serious, seriously.

02:56.700 --> 03:02.540
Now listen here you, I can't speak too loudly about this, but I heard this episode is not

03:02.540 --> 03:04.140
very serious.

03:04.140 --> 03:09.260
Seems like the producer was worried about becoming accustomed to remote playing before

03:09.260 --> 03:13.140
jumping back into the main story.

03:13.140 --> 03:19.100
Now remember to sit in those questions on the subreddit named episode 74, which it will

03:19.100 --> 03:24.080
clearly not be, as this right here is episode 74.

03:24.080 --> 03:28.060
Now let's get serious, my dear sweet innocent pups.

03:28.060 --> 03:33.660
By the time you hear the intro to this song for the second time ever, you will know the

03:33.660 --> 03:37.300
fate of the golden retriever called Bean.

03:37.300 --> 03:46.100
It's kudzu with no backbow.

04:07.300 --> 04:23.220
Howdy folks, I just wanted to drop in real quick to say we recorded this episode to give

04:23.220 --> 04:29.540
us more time to field questions for next week's plot talk, and also to give me more time to

04:29.540 --> 04:32.260
prep for this upcoming story arc.

04:32.260 --> 04:36.420
Now on top of that, I figured it wouldn't hurt to get some more practice in with this

04:36.420 --> 04:42.060
whole remote recording thing before we jump back into the nitty gritty good stuff, especially

04:42.060 --> 04:45.300
with the mishap last week with Thomas' gain controls.

04:45.300 --> 04:48.760
Well don't worry, we fucked it up again.

04:48.760 --> 04:54.440
This time Luke and Thomas had their audio sent crisp and clear to the zoom call, however

04:54.440 --> 04:59.460
they accidentally recorded their tracks with their laptop microphones instead.

04:59.460 --> 05:05.660
I have edited this session, and I believe it is quite listenable and even, dare I say,

05:05.660 --> 05:11.980
enjoyable, but it is not up to our standards for audio quality, and so we are using this

05:11.980 --> 05:18.580
as a learning opportunity, and we are adding another clearly overlooked but important task

05:18.580 --> 05:22.060
to our pre-recording checklists.

05:22.060 --> 05:27.820
Thank you, each of you, for listening and supporting this show, it means so, so much

05:27.820 --> 05:28.820
to me.

05:29.100 --> 05:32.460
Boy howdy, we'll get it next week I bet.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.380
Everybody clap on four and eight.

05:34.380 --> 05:41.520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, wonderful.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.820
Thank you all so much for coming here today.

05:43.820 --> 05:44.820
You're welcome.

05:44.820 --> 05:49.700
I miss our finest of eves, here on Pretending to be People.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.460
How's everybody doing out there?

05:52.460 --> 05:55.100
Doing about as good as you can hope, you know?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.620
I'm doing alright.

05:56.740 --> 06:02.580
Luke said he was hitting negative six, so he probably needs to turn his gain down.

06:02.580 --> 06:03.580
Uh, hold on.

06:03.580 --> 06:04.580
Tattle.

06:04.580 --> 06:07.980
If I'm talking normal, I'm hitting like around 18 to 12.

06:07.980 --> 06:11.980
That's where I was last, well yeah, that's where I am now I guess.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.220
Where's your gain turned to?

06:13.220 --> 06:19.100
Hey, if the gain was an island, what time is your gain turned to?

06:19.100 --> 06:20.100
About one o'clock.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.660
If your gain was an island, which was the face of the clock.

06:22.660 --> 06:24.140
I think you're probably good, man.

06:24.140 --> 06:27.260
If you have a sundial.

06:27.260 --> 06:30.460
If you have a sundial.

06:30.460 --> 06:34.780
Now if you have a sundial, brother.

06:34.780 --> 06:36.580
This is my character, by the way.

06:36.580 --> 06:37.580
Oh good.

06:37.580 --> 06:43.080
You might not be able to tell time on a foggy day.

06:43.080 --> 06:47.580
So let's get right into this, because it's already nighttime.

06:47.580 --> 06:51.220
The sun has been down for a minute at this point.

06:51.220 --> 06:55.180
The premise that I sent you all.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.620
I think we got it this time.

06:57.620 --> 06:58.620
I hope so.

06:58.620 --> 06:59.620
Maybe.

06:59.620 --> 07:04.620
I'll go ahead and hit record now.

07:04.620 --> 07:05.620
Is this recording?

07:05.620 --> 07:06.620
Speed.

07:06.620 --> 07:07.620
Fuck.

07:07.620 --> 07:15.380
Um, the premise that I sent you all for tonight's recording session is as follows.

07:15.380 --> 07:19.620
You all choose an animal you'd like to be.

07:19.620 --> 07:23.860
Bean was a revered member of the Contention Critter Coalition.

07:23.860 --> 07:29.020
The leader, a wise squirrel, is calling out to those who have survived by joining the

07:29.020 --> 07:33.140
newly founded Contention Creek Critter Coalition.

07:33.140 --> 07:38.100
They need the most highly trained, well-balanced strike team ever assembled to go on a near

07:38.100 --> 07:45.980
suicide mission to save Bean, the most thoughtful and caring creature in the whole coalition.

07:45.980 --> 07:53.260
And to pull off this rescue, you'll have to avoid the black goo and some humans too.

07:53.260 --> 07:55.980
First thoughts when you read that.

07:55.980 --> 07:56.980
And don't be mean.

07:56.980 --> 07:57.980
Ooh, boy!

07:57.980 --> 08:01.580
No, Zach, but what's the real scenario we're doing?

08:01.580 --> 08:03.420
Yeah, be serious.

08:03.420 --> 08:07.260
Oh, there's like dead kids or something?

08:07.260 --> 08:08.260
Good.

08:08.260 --> 08:09.260
That's bad.

08:09.260 --> 08:12.340
Oh, their bodies are filled with maggots and shit?

08:12.340 --> 08:14.340
No, no, I do want to-

08:14.340 --> 08:15.340
No, actual shit.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.700
I do want to say everybody's body is filled with actual shit.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.620
That's where shit comes from.

08:20.620 --> 08:26.020
Have you read the famous book, Everybody Shits?

08:26.020 --> 08:27.260
Near suicide mission.

08:27.260 --> 08:32.140
It better be a near suicide mission because like we talked about on the Q&A episode, if

08:32.140 --> 08:37.860
any of these animals die, we will hold you personally responsible.

08:37.860 --> 08:41.460
If my character dies, I will destroy the podcast.

08:41.460 --> 08:42.800
Yeah, I quit.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.660
I quit if any of these animals die.

08:44.980 --> 08:49.620
On your character sheet, under equipment, does it say plot armor?

08:49.620 --> 08:50.620
Yes.

08:50.620 --> 08:51.620
Yeah.

08:51.620 --> 08:52.940
You told us all that.

08:52.940 --> 08:56.500
It says I'm a cute animal and it would fucking suck.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.340
It would be bad podcast.

08:58.340 --> 09:02.980
It would be bad radio if you killed a bunch of animals.

09:02.980 --> 09:03.980
You can do anything to-

09:03.980 --> 09:08.940
I'm going to report you to PETA right now.

09:08.940 --> 09:10.940
What if you do, though, die?

09:10.940 --> 09:12.940
Let's just try not to die.

09:13.940 --> 09:20.780
I think as soon as you start thinking about how you're going to describe an animal dying

09:20.780 --> 09:28.420
violently, you'll realize that you shouldn't be doing that on air and you will-

09:28.420 --> 09:30.300
Well, we'll see.

09:30.300 --> 09:34.700
We will see how my opinions of children versus animals-

09:34.700 --> 09:35.700
Oh my gosh.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.420
Okay, I'm changing my character.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.420
It's a cat named Ramona.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.340
If I were crazy, then would you still-

09:46.340 --> 09:47.340
That's my kryptonite.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.740
I didn't want to keep singing.

09:53.740 --> 09:54.740
Thank you.

09:54.740 --> 09:59.740
All right, I'm going to hit record now.

09:59.740 --> 10:03.420
Went ahead and backspaced on this recording.

10:03.420 --> 10:11.620
It is a brisk December 5th here in contention, made all the more bleak by the necessity

10:11.620 --> 10:13.220
of the water.

10:13.220 --> 10:19.540
Numbed by the frigid waters or the cutting winds, this brutally arctic reality was far

10:19.540 --> 10:22.140
greater than the alternative.

10:22.140 --> 10:27.260
The contention critter coalition has made their home here in Coles Creek, the survivors

10:27.260 --> 10:31.340
rebranding themselves as the contention critter- fuck.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.300
The contention creek critter coalition.

10:34.300 --> 10:40.660
Now are these animals who spell adorably wrong with Ks because then the first name is fucked

10:41.220 --> 10:42.740
No, they're Cs.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.180
It's always Cs, Thomas.

10:44.180 --> 10:47.300
When there's three Cs in a row, it's Cs.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.580
All my Cs are hard, dude.

10:50.580 --> 10:57.860
They rebranded themselves as the contention creek critter coalition for accuracy and additional

10:57.860 --> 10:59.380
alliteration.

10:59.380 --> 11:03.860
The contention creek critter coalition has gathered to hear an announcement from its

11:03.860 --> 11:11.860
esteemed leader and wisest member, the old grey squirrel called Stallone.

11:13.860 --> 11:16.900
We are in an unprecedented time.

11:16.900 --> 11:20.180
Look around, look at what's left of us.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.340
Tired, empty, shivering, the enemy.

11:24.340 --> 11:32.100
And they point to both banks of Coles Creek where masses of writhing black ooze sloppily

11:32.180 --> 11:38.660
spill back and forth, attempting to nip at any animals near to the shore, but consistently

11:38.660 --> 11:42.100
careful enough to avoid falling into the water.

11:42.100 --> 11:50.580
The enemy is unknown, but its effect has a lasting effect on the memory.

11:50.580 --> 11:56.420
Few here have survived without witnessing at least one close companion consumed by this

11:56.420 --> 11:58.100
unspeakable foe.

11:58.100 --> 12:06.180
But I hold high hopeful hearsay, our admirable, admirable and astonishingly astute ally, the

12:06.180 --> 12:12.980
golden retriever called Bean is still alive, though he is trapped.

12:13.620 --> 12:17.940
His person has continued to leave him locked in isolation.

12:17.940 --> 12:21.940
The wish should be clear to everyone now that water is life.

12:22.900 --> 12:27.380
Who among you are brave enough to take on this task?

12:27.940 --> 12:34.820
To liberate Bean from his prison of a pin at Hotel Motel.

12:35.540 --> 12:42.180
I volunteer and you see an old dog named Rusty.

12:42.820 --> 12:49.620
He's not as fast or strong as he used to be, but he's still a big, good boy.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.660
And I think he's probably been something of like a community organizer in these trying

12:54.660 --> 12:55.380
times.

12:55.380 --> 12:57.140
I will go find Beans.

12:57.140 --> 12:58.420
Who is with me?

12:58.420 --> 13:01.220
Well, if he's in, then I'm gonna be in.

13:01.220 --> 13:06.900
And a woodpecker comes and lands on him and raises a wing up.

13:08.740 --> 13:11.620
What do people know about this woodpecker?

13:11.620 --> 13:18.180
Wilson the woodpecker, just a friendly guy about the coalition, almost like a like a

13:18.180 --> 13:26.580
pigeon because he can carry messages between the creators of the coalition and he can understand

13:26.580 --> 13:29.220
humans so he can feed them info.

13:29.220 --> 13:34.820
So right off the bat, Stallone is like, Rusty and Wilson.

13:34.820 --> 13:36.740
Yes, yes, of course.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.500
Two of our finest.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.020
And who else?

13:40.020 --> 13:43.860
Who is willing to join these two brave souls?

13:45.140 --> 13:45.700
Did you say Beans?

13:46.820 --> 13:48.020
It's Bean that we're going after?

13:48.660 --> 13:51.140
I'm in, I'm in.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.580
I know Beans.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.660
He's an old friend of mine.

13:55.460 --> 13:55.940
Oh boy.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.260
That characterization was great, but we were getting a lot of...

14:04.580 --> 14:06.820
So what do we know about this character?

14:06.820 --> 14:08.660
What do the other animals know?

14:08.660 --> 14:09.940
And what is this name?

14:10.980 --> 14:14.820
This is Tyler, and he's a black lab.

14:15.380 --> 14:20.660
And he recently escaped his master, and he's on the run.

14:21.700 --> 14:26.020
I don't want to interrupt our flow, but Joe, you're breaking up like crazy.

14:26.580 --> 14:27.460
At least for me.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.140
I don't know what to do about that.

14:29.140 --> 14:31.540
Yeah, as long as it's not recording that way.

14:31.540 --> 14:34.100
Okay, so that's our second dog.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.780
Thomas, what kind of dog were you?

14:35.780 --> 14:36.980
I didn't catch that.

14:36.980 --> 14:38.020
Rusty is a mutt.

14:38.100 --> 14:42.740
He's based off a dog I used to live with.

14:42.740 --> 14:47.860
One of my roommate's dogs that she had fostered and then adopted.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.780
He was a sweet, big old boy named Dracula.

14:54.420 --> 14:55.700
Excellent name for a dog.

14:56.260 --> 15:02.580
And he was just a big gray, maybe like a shepherd lab mix.

15:02.580 --> 15:03.460
A big gray.

15:03.460 --> 15:05.700
A very old boy, a very sweet boy.

15:06.340 --> 15:09.060
Inky bones, but a lot of heart.

15:11.140 --> 15:12.980
My achy, breaky heart.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.300
Tyler's a black lab, is that what you said?

15:15.300 --> 15:16.500
Yep, that is correct.

15:17.860 --> 15:19.700
And who is Tyler's owner?

15:21.540 --> 15:22.180
I'll just say it.

15:22.180 --> 15:25.060
It's Kerry pages from like our second episode.

15:25.060 --> 15:26.900
Clark was tasked with finding this dog.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.540
We thought it was fitting that Joe would play said dog.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.660
And Justin, a coward or are you taking this for spot?

15:36.660 --> 15:40.180
I'm taking this for a spot out of the shadows.

15:40.180 --> 15:41.620
Yeah, I'm just like, no, I'm not playing.

15:41.620 --> 15:42.900
I'm just going to hang out with you guys.

15:44.100 --> 15:44.820
I'm just watching.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.580
Kind of undermine Zach.

15:47.220 --> 15:51.940
I just go back to Justin every 15 minutes to describe how cold the water is.

15:53.060 --> 15:56.260
Yeah, he is an animal, but he just stays behind.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.380
Yeah, I'm playing a character.

15:57.380 --> 15:58.820
He's comfortable.

15:59.380 --> 16:00.180
He's hanging out.

16:00.660 --> 16:08.260
Uh, no, out of, out of the shadows steps, uh, a very small, but proud creature.

16:08.980 --> 16:10.180
It's a little chipmunk.

16:11.300 --> 16:15.060
Hey, I think y'all are going to need some leadership for this today.

16:15.620 --> 16:16.820
I'm chip Montgomery.

16:16.820 --> 16:17.620
Y'all know me.

16:18.260 --> 16:19.460
Y'all know me really well.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.100
Should have been president, but that's okay.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.020
Some peoples ain't meant for leadership.

16:24.660 --> 16:29.860
You may have gotten the majority vote, but I won in the electoral college.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.060
Yeah, we know.

16:31.060 --> 16:33.620
We know it's bullshit, but I'm here.

16:33.620 --> 16:38.180
Cause y'all seem like you could use an old hand besides old rusty here.

16:38.180 --> 16:39.220
My days are numbered.

16:39.220 --> 16:42.340
Anyway, I don't think chipmunks are long for this world.

16:42.340 --> 16:47.700
I did assume rusty might take some sort of leadership role, but he could also be more

16:47.700 --> 16:52.900
of a spiritual, uh, counsel, uh, chip.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.140
Montgomery has obviously seen some shit.

16:55.700 --> 16:56.740
He's quite fat.

16:56.740 --> 17:04.340
Now his, uh, chipmunk for his grade over time, quite elderly, but still spry and full

17:04.340 --> 17:04.980
of sass.

17:05.780 --> 17:07.540
You're just rusty, but a chipmunk.

17:08.980 --> 17:09.380
Maybe.

17:13.140 --> 17:19.860
And as the four of you joined together, um, you try to figure out what differentiates

17:19.860 --> 17:27.540
chip from rusty as looming in the background is this ooze that just kind of like follows

17:27.540 --> 17:33.060
you, like mirrors your movements as, as you've grouped together up front near this, uh, this

17:33.060 --> 17:34.580
elderly gray squirrel.

17:35.220 --> 17:42.580
And he says to you, the first thing that you must do in front of everyone is figure out

17:42.580 --> 17:44.260
how to get out of this Creek.

17:44.260 --> 17:50.180
The black goo is everywhere and he watches, he watches our movements and he wants us.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.100
Does the black goo have a smell?

17:52.100 --> 17:56.180
Like what a dog who's, okay.

17:56.180 --> 17:58.660
Well, I think we, we gotta get water on it, right?

17:58.660 --> 17:59.780
How would animals do that?

18:00.820 --> 18:02.420
Let's talk like we're animals.

18:02.420 --> 18:04.020
You could get wet and shake it all.

18:04.980 --> 18:05.380
Yeah.

18:05.380 --> 18:12.660
Rusty, uh, rusty rolls around in the Creek, uh, and then stands right by the bed and gives

18:12.660 --> 18:17.460
it a big old dog shake and just flashes water everywhere.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.860
And does the, does the goo flee from the water?

18:19.860 --> 18:20.660
Oh, absolutely.

18:20.660 --> 18:21.140
It does.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.900
Then Tyler's going to follow suit.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.180
That looks like it works.

18:24.180 --> 18:29.140
Chip Montgomery gets a little tiny like cap off of like a little nut and fills it with

18:29.140 --> 18:35.460
water and tries to like fireman bucket on top of chip.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.940
What I think you should do is hop on.

18:37.940 --> 18:42.260
I think you shouldn't tell me what I'm supposed to be doing or not doing brother.

18:43.300 --> 18:48.100
I, um, or at the end, I'm just, I'm just a spiritual counsel.

18:48.100 --> 18:53.860
So this is just some sage advice, but, uh, perhaps you should hop on my back.

18:53.860 --> 19:01.220
And because, because I'm, I'm pretty old and weak, perhaps if Tyler, who is spry and I

19:01.220 --> 19:02.900
believe very good at jumping.

19:02.900 --> 19:03.060
Yeah.

19:03.060 --> 19:03.300
Yeah.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.180
Come on, come on, get on the back.

19:04.180 --> 19:04.660
Get on my back.

19:04.660 --> 19:05.460
Come on, get on my back.

19:05.460 --> 19:07.060
You can use my collar as a, as a brains.

19:07.060 --> 19:07.460
Come on.

19:07.460 --> 19:08.740
No, no, here's, here's what's up.

19:09.460 --> 19:12.980
You shake, you shake and clear a path.

19:12.980 --> 19:17.140
So these old bones can take me and me and chip.

19:17.140 --> 19:17.780
Oh, okay.

19:17.780 --> 19:18.180
Sure.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.500
And then you leap over the goo.

19:20.500 --> 19:20.980
You got it.

19:20.980 --> 19:21.860
And I do it.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.300
I like take off.

19:23.300 --> 19:28.020
I got my, I got my mission and I'm, I'm soaking down, wiggling out some water.

19:28.020 --> 19:32.660
And if I can get to a point, is there a path out of this goo or is it, does it cover the

19:32.660 --> 19:33.060
land?

19:33.060 --> 19:36.020
I mean, is there, is there a space that this, oh yeah.

19:36.020 --> 19:41.700
So it's just, it is formed lines near the land just far enough, like a far apart from

19:41.700 --> 19:42.340
each other.

19:42.340 --> 19:47.460
Like the lines, like at the, like, if you're like heading to the paint in basketball, you

19:47.460 --> 19:48.580
got those lines.

19:48.580 --> 19:49.860
Did that make any sense?

19:49.860 --> 19:51.140
Am I making any sense?

19:52.100 --> 19:56.420
So like six feet in between chunks of black goo and then past that.

19:56.420 --> 19:57.700
Yeah, no, it's free land.

19:57.700 --> 20:04.020
They are clearly, they want to consume, but they cannot get into the water.

20:04.020 --> 20:04.580
Gotcha.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.140
But an athletic dog could definitely clear the gap.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.740
Oh, Tyler?

20:11.060 --> 20:13.380
Are we talking about Tyler right now?

20:13.380 --> 20:17.940
Also, Luke's just a bird, so he kind of put the screws to your whole game, Zach.

20:19.060 --> 20:20.420
I fly over.

20:20.420 --> 20:20.920
Yeah.

20:22.260 --> 20:27.220
I actually had this idea in my mind when I was coming up with this, that the birds would

20:27.220 --> 20:33.460
be like in a different group, like in a different gang that's not affected, like the privileged.

20:33.540 --> 20:37.460
They still could be, but like Willie's just cool enough that he transcends clicks.

20:37.460 --> 20:43.780
Yeah, I think Willie should let me ride on him because the imagery is very cool.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.020
What is the Wilson, the woodpecker doing?

20:52.020 --> 20:56.260
I fly over the goo and I'm like, okay, I'll be waiting over here for you guys.

20:56.260 --> 20:57.220
Tyler's running.

20:57.220 --> 21:01.620
If he can, if he can clear the path with one swoop, he would just run out there, shaggy,

21:01.620 --> 21:04.980
shaggy dog it, and then there'd be a little path there that they can follow.

21:04.980 --> 21:07.940
Otherwise he's running back and forth, getting more water on his body,

21:07.940 --> 21:10.740
clearing a little bit more, coming back, clearing a little bit more.

21:10.740 --> 21:15.940
Let's see if you need to be saved while you're being the hero by having you roll here.

21:15.940 --> 21:22.900
So basically in order to fully get out of this mess, you're going to have to roll either

21:22.900 --> 21:27.060
one of your special skills or dexterity, probably.

21:27.060 --> 21:28.900
I've got a special skill of jumping.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.180
He's a really good jumper.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.380
He can leap over fences.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.380
That's how he got out of his last yard.

21:33.380 --> 21:33.620
Yeah.

21:33.620 --> 21:39.860
So real quick explanation for how we're doing mechanics for this little one shot here.

21:39.860 --> 21:46.660
We're using the six stats from Delta Green, which are somebody else, please.

21:46.660 --> 21:52.500
There's strength, constitution, power, intelligence, dexterity, and charisma.

21:52.500 --> 21:58.100
And I gave them the points of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.

21:58.100 --> 21:58.420
Yep.

21:58.420 --> 22:00.980
For those six, they got to put those wherever they wanted.

22:00.980 --> 22:07.700
And then I said you guys could have two special abilities that would both be at 75%.

22:08.820 --> 22:12.500
And I guess we'll figure out what those are as we play the game.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.460
One of Joe's for Tyler is jumping.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.620
So go ahead and roll, baby.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.620
I pass a 40 on a 75.

22:23.620 --> 22:26.180
40 on a 75 success.

22:26.180 --> 22:32.260
So as you fully pushed through this barricade of black goo,

22:32.260 --> 22:36.020
you can get rusty and chip up and through.

22:36.020 --> 22:41.540
Like if this was red Rover, you know, you would have came all over past.

22:42.660 --> 22:43.060
Jesus.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.260
That's how that game is played.

22:49.540 --> 22:51.060
And you broke the barricade.

22:51.060 --> 22:52.740
You were red rocket.

22:56.740 --> 22:59.700
Red rocket, red rocket.

22:59.700 --> 23:00.580
I'm coming on.

23:02.820 --> 23:04.260
And no one can stop me.

23:05.860 --> 23:06.820
Oh boy.

23:06.820 --> 23:07.780
We're in the Creek now.

23:10.180 --> 23:14.260
And bounding over you've hit the main, uh, the main roadway

23:14.260 --> 23:16.660
and contention that leads from the highway down.

23:16.660 --> 23:21.860
You might not know this, uh, depending on how, uh, well-versed you guys are,

23:21.860 --> 23:24.660
but you do know where hotel motel is.

23:24.660 --> 23:28.820
As you have hung out with being a fair few times in the parking lot,

23:28.820 --> 23:33.060
where he hosts, uh, anyone and everyone who just wants to come and chill

23:33.060 --> 23:34.580
and have like a great time.

23:34.580 --> 23:40.580
As long as his person remembers to leave the door unlocked for him.

23:40.580 --> 23:45.460
So as you guys are crossing, I need, uh, let's see, how about I roll?

23:45.460 --> 23:51.140
Um, I'm going to roll a D4 to see, uh, which one of you this affects.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.660
And hopefully it's not Thomas.

23:55.380 --> 23:56.660
Uh, let's see.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.820
We'll do one is Luke.

23:58.820 --> 23:59.700
Two is Justin.

23:59.700 --> 24:00.100
I'm here.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.140
I'm just grabbing my guys.

24:02.180 --> 24:03.860
Three is Thomas.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.940
And four is Joe.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.300
And this D4 says.

24:09.940 --> 24:14.500
One Wilson, the woodpecker.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.500
It's not a good thing as the four of you.

24:19.140 --> 24:20.020
As the four of you.

24:20.020 --> 24:22.820
I was deciding which one of your characters is really racist.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.980
I would never make that kind of choice for you.

24:28.980 --> 24:29.620
First off.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.420
I would let you dig your own grip.

24:32.980 --> 24:33.620
It's ironic.

24:33.620 --> 24:36.500
And then promptly knock you straight off the podcast.

24:36.500 --> 24:42.340
Luke, uh, you've got, uh, as Wilson, the woodpecker.

24:42.340 --> 24:46.180
Are you flying or are you, uh, how, what is your mode of transport here?

24:46.180 --> 24:48.020
Uh, am I in the group with them?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.380
Like we're all together now?

24:49.380 --> 24:55.300
Yeah, you've made it past the goo and the, uh, as you guys, as you guys rush through

24:55.300 --> 25:03.140
this line and make it through with the intense, uh, bouts of jumping and dexterity and just

25:03.140 --> 25:08.900
really a lot of, um, a lot of flair as you guys jump through this area.

25:08.900 --> 25:14.580
It's almost like, uh, like a horse, uh, jumping through a hoop made of fire is

25:14.580 --> 25:20.020
essentially what everyone else sees who is in the CCCC who's in this Creek.

25:20.020 --> 25:24.740
And they all start cheering and chanting with lots of hurrahs and yippees.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.580
And I knew they could do it.

25:26.580 --> 25:29.140
Um, from the animals in the.

25:29.700 --> 25:32.820
Essentially crowd at this point, watching you guys work your magic.

25:32.820 --> 25:35.860
Rusty waxes down while they're doing that.

25:35.860 --> 25:39.780
I'm on the other side of the goo and I'm eating a worm that I found on the ground.

25:39.780 --> 25:45.380
Does the goo have sentience enough that it is chasing after us now that we've broken

25:45.380 --> 25:47.860
its ranks or does it just chill by the Creek?

25:47.860 --> 25:52.340
Still the goo is sticking behind, which you would know as because there's just, there's

25:52.340 --> 25:53.620
more food there, right?

25:53.620 --> 25:58.660
Even though the water is in between them and they can't get it there, they see, it sees

25:58.660 --> 26:02.420
more that it can consume and therefore is distracted.

26:02.420 --> 26:07.380
And the four of you make your way to the main drag of contention.

26:07.380 --> 26:13.380
And you know that just on the other side of this drag is hotel motel, where the dopest

26:13.380 --> 26:16.020
of dopes Bean resides.

26:17.140 --> 26:23.060
As you approach this business highway, Wilson, are you in the air or are you on the ground?

26:23.060 --> 26:28.820
In the air, but I'm like, uh, like on the ground critters level, like just like a foot

26:28.820 --> 26:30.420
above, foot above the ground.

26:30.420 --> 26:37.140
Up above you see, no, it, it can't be it's, I mean it is a possum, but it's not just

26:37.140 --> 26:37.940
any possum.

26:37.940 --> 26:41.620
It looks like it's, it's your friend.

26:41.620 --> 26:42.740
It's common.

26:42.740 --> 26:45.060
And he is laying on his back.

26:45.860 --> 26:51.460
This adorable, adorable little possum that Wilson has known for years and years, just

26:51.460 --> 26:53.300
right there on the side of the road.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.580
I land and go over to him and like pick him.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.820
I'm like, you do this all the time.

26:58.820 --> 26:59.460
Come on, man.

26:59.460 --> 27:02.260
Hey, what the fuck are you doing there, buddy?

27:02.260 --> 27:07.540
You can't just come into me with your beak all like sharp and whatnots on me.

27:07.540 --> 27:09.460
Why are you playing dead over here?

27:09.460 --> 27:14.500
Well, you see, there was some of the mess coming through the area and heading on down

27:14.500 --> 27:16.580
to y'all in the water.

27:16.580 --> 27:22.740
And it don't find me nothing to be consuming for when I be laying on the backside.

27:22.740 --> 27:25.300
Rusty sees a possum and starts barking.

27:25.300 --> 27:31.380
Hey, why are you just barking when you could say words at me, friend?

27:31.380 --> 27:33.620
Tyler starts barking because Rusty's barking.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.060
Guys, this is, this is my friend Common.

27:39.060 --> 27:41.300
He, uh, what are you doing here?

27:41.300 --> 27:48.020
Well, I was making my way down to the water to hang out with you guys.

27:48.020 --> 27:53.700
Cause I heard that you joined away from the birds, people who don't like me much no more

27:53.700 --> 27:55.300
no way anyhow.

27:55.300 --> 28:01.780
Well, we're on our way to, we're on our way to get bean, but, uh, you can go down to the

28:01.780 --> 28:03.220
water if you want.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.100
Yep, I do.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.060
That was my plan.

28:05.060 --> 28:06.260
And now I'm leaving.

28:06.260 --> 28:08.420
Thanks for saying hi to all of you.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.260
Thanks for barking at me and Chip.

28:11.620 --> 28:12.980
I know what you did.

28:12.980 --> 28:13.620
Wait a minute.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.980
I don't think it's safe for him to be going down there alone.

28:17.540 --> 28:21.460
You think a possum can clear whatever amount of slime is down there?

28:21.460 --> 28:29.700
You think that looking out for my safety is worth repayment for what you did to my brother?

28:29.700 --> 28:30.580
Chip, what'd you do to his brother?

28:30.580 --> 28:31.300
What'd you do to his brother?

28:31.300 --> 28:32.180
What'd you do to his brother?

28:33.060 --> 28:37.300
I never liked no possum no how, and that's all I'll leave it at.

28:37.940 --> 28:39.860
Well, first of all, possum is delicious.

28:40.580 --> 28:43.380
Okay, now I'm really bailing on out of here.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.500
Wilson, it's good to see you.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.740
Weird crew you're running with these days.

28:48.900 --> 28:54.180
Well, I heard Bean was in trouble, so I came down.

28:54.820 --> 29:00.180
The birds are not too concerned with it, so I'm trying this group out to go get them.

29:00.180 --> 29:01.940
You're a good man, Willie.

29:01.940 --> 29:05.300
Could never trust no possum to be brave when it mattered none.

29:06.980 --> 29:09.140
Ouch, that hurt my feelings.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.060
I better go now before you seem to cry.

29:15.060 --> 29:20.660
Back at Critter College, we called him O-Pussy.

29:24.820 --> 29:28.260
He's a better man now that he's not in college anymore.

29:29.460 --> 29:30.980
Well, see you later.

29:32.180 --> 29:36.260
Bye, this has been a good encounter that definitely helped everyone a lot.

29:36.260 --> 29:39.860
And as you guys pass over the road, you make it to the other side.

29:41.300 --> 29:43.140
Did Colin have something to offer us?

29:45.060 --> 29:48.420
Besides his next dope track?

29:50.340 --> 29:51.300
No relation.

29:53.540 --> 29:55.620
Was that my role on me?

29:55.620 --> 29:56.180
That was it?

29:57.780 --> 30:01.300
I mean, anything could have happened, but that's what happened.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.780
So you guys make it over to the other side.

30:05.780 --> 30:07.140
I'll go back and kill him if you want me to.

30:10.260 --> 30:12.740
Rusty, yeah, I was like, I'd really love to eat that possum.

30:15.220 --> 30:18.260
He's my friend, don't need him until he's actually dead.

30:19.140 --> 30:29.620
In the distance, you see Hotel Motel with its dimly kind of lit sign, and the parking lot

30:29.620 --> 30:39.380
is not full at all, and the exterior doors of this place hold as much residue as a sink

30:39.380 --> 30:43.860
that is owned by a 19-year-old boy, or girl for that matter.

30:43.860 --> 30:46.900
19-year-olds just don't clean their sinks very often.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.020
Basically, they're grody.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.980
It's grody doors all over the external of this place.

30:52.020 --> 30:58.020
And this is Hotel Motel, where you know that Bean is in one of these motel rooms.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.060
We've met Bean before?

30:59.060 --> 31:03.620
Oh yeah, he's the dopest golden retriever this side of the Mississippi, baby.

31:03.620 --> 31:07.620
All rest he can't see so well no more, but he can still hear,

31:07.620 --> 31:10.740
and he can still smell like a son of a bitch, literally.

31:11.300 --> 31:17.220
So he's gonna try to sniff out Bean.

31:17.220 --> 31:21.460
Go ahead and roll for me, Rusty.

31:21.460 --> 31:22.100
83.

31:22.740 --> 31:23.460
There's too much.

31:24.660 --> 31:25.380
He's confused.

31:27.060 --> 31:32.660
He's like, I almost smell him, but there's too much in the air.

31:32.660 --> 31:34.740
I can't get a bean on what room he's in.

31:34.740 --> 31:38.180
You can't get a bean on him whatsoever,

31:38.180 --> 31:45.140
but you do hear a bit of a warble in the air that's singing along the winds,

31:45.140 --> 31:45.620
and it's like...

31:50.100 --> 31:52.260
Does it sound like Bean to us?

31:52.260 --> 31:56.260
It does not sound like Bean, but it does sound like a dog.

31:58.340 --> 32:01.140
Yeah, so besides smelling, the other thing Rusty can do is hear,

32:01.140 --> 32:03.060
so he'd like to focus in on that sound.

32:04.740 --> 32:07.540
13.

32:08.740 --> 32:12.260
You hear, through this distinct warble in the air,

32:12.260 --> 32:15.300
a rich, clear voice come through that says,

32:15.860 --> 32:17.700
Hello there to all.

32:18.980 --> 32:27.060
My name is Murphy, and I would like someone to let me out of this room.

32:29.460 --> 32:32.900
Zach, do not put my fucking dog in a locked hotel room.

32:34.740 --> 32:42.500
I do love the cameo, but if you even fictitiously harm him.

32:43.780 --> 32:44.340
Oopsie.

32:47.140 --> 32:48.500
By the way, I'm dead.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.020
I'm the ghost of your dog.

32:56.740 --> 33:02.660
I sure would like a friend in these troubling times.

33:02.660 --> 33:03.540
Fuck you.

33:04.420 --> 33:05.860
Fellers, you know what that means.

33:06.580 --> 33:12.420
Contention Creek Critter, coalition don't leave no dog or aminal behind.

33:13.940 --> 33:14.580
Namaste.

33:15.140 --> 33:16.020
Namaste, brother.

33:18.660 --> 33:23.300
And you guys see that to the right, there is a little office

33:23.300 --> 33:28.740
where there's a front door with an open sign that is well lit.

33:29.380 --> 33:30.260
Well lit.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.180
And a different door.

33:32.180 --> 33:40.420
There is a man who is pushing a cart with cleaning supplies and fresh towels on it.

33:40.980 --> 33:42.420
Don't make me a janitor.

33:44.580 --> 33:45.300
Wait, what?

33:46.500 --> 33:48.260
If Murphy's there, I assume I'm there.

33:49.300 --> 33:50.340
Oh sure, why not?

33:50.340 --> 33:51.060
It's Thomas.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.260
Thomas is a janitor.

33:54.180 --> 33:55.300
No, you're a maid.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.660
You've got fresh towels, baby.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.940
I'm gonna go ahead and fly into that office, see if I can't find

34:00.820 --> 34:03.940
ol' Keith's name on that list, see where Bean is.

34:03.940 --> 34:09.460
And I fly towards the office thinking that the window is just open space.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.220
What do you mean see his name?

34:16.820 --> 34:18.260
I don't know what you mean.

34:18.260 --> 34:19.380
What do you mean, what do you mean?

34:20.180 --> 34:21.380
What are you talking about here?

34:21.940 --> 34:23.860
You can only hear names.

34:23.860 --> 34:24.900
Oh, I can read.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.180
I went to college.

34:27.540 --> 34:29.140
What is reading?

34:30.580 --> 34:33.460
It's like human symbols that mean words.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.780
You are not making one lick of sense.

34:35.780 --> 34:38.020
Yeah, I don't follow none right here.

34:38.020 --> 34:38.820
I'll trust you again.

34:38.820 --> 34:40.500
Rusty and Ship roll sanity?

34:41.940 --> 34:42.660
No, I'm just kidding.

34:45.140 --> 34:47.460
But yeah, I fly through the window.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.220
Doonk!

34:49.220 --> 34:50.900
But there's some sort of force field.

34:52.420 --> 34:53.780
What's a force field, brother?

34:54.500 --> 35:02.180
The last thought running through your mind before you were stopped out of absolutely nowhere was,

35:02.180 --> 35:04.100
holy shit, that's a big cat.

35:06.100 --> 35:08.580
Am I knocked out or am I able to fly away?

35:09.300 --> 35:11.860
So go ahead and mark one on your...

35:12.500 --> 35:16.340
So we're doing a three check box system for damage here.

35:16.980 --> 35:21.220
And if you take a bit of damage, that's minor damage.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.580
That's the first box.

35:22.580 --> 35:25.140
And if you take some more damage, that's going to be major damage.

35:25.140 --> 35:26.580
That's the second box.

35:26.580 --> 35:30.900
And then if you take damage a third time, you're going to have severe damage,

35:31.700 --> 35:36.100
which is going to require a constitution rule to stay conscious.

35:36.100 --> 35:41.300
Otherwise, you're going to have to have one of your teammates help you

35:41.300 --> 35:44.580
in order to come back and rejoin the squad.

35:45.220 --> 35:51.220
This mechanic that I straight up took one for one from Sam running us through that really fun

35:51.220 --> 35:54.980
one shot right before all this quarantine broke out.

35:54.980 --> 35:56.900
Rusty sees this happen.

35:57.620 --> 35:59.940
The damn fool bird don't know about glass.

36:00.820 --> 36:03.380
I've seen it happen many times in my...

36:04.260 --> 36:10.660
He tries to multiply how many summers he's been by seven, but he can't because he's a dog.

36:14.740 --> 36:20.340
So he just says, in my many summers, I've seen quite a few birds slam against the window.

36:20.340 --> 36:25.540
They don't know it's only good for sticking your nose up against and linking.

36:25.540 --> 36:28.660
So I'm on the ground, very disoriented.

36:28.660 --> 36:30.020
What the fuck just happened?

36:30.020 --> 36:33.940
Rusty, in an attempt to revive you, sticks his nose up against you and licks you.

36:33.940 --> 36:34.580
Hell yeah.

36:34.580 --> 36:36.180
Describe it deeper.

36:36.180 --> 36:41.860
Oh, he tries to put his ruffle feathers back in place.

36:41.860 --> 36:42.500
He's just like...

36:44.100 --> 36:46.900
Yeah, it's a very ginger, like, hey, are you all right?

36:46.900 --> 36:49.780
Chip gets on the ground and starts shaking him violently.

36:51.060 --> 36:54.420
Little tiny fat chipmunk is like, wake your damn ass up, bro.

36:55.780 --> 36:56.820
We got work to do.

36:57.380 --> 37:02.180
I get up and I stretch my wings out and flap them off to get any of the spit off.

37:02.180 --> 37:07.300
And then I fly up and perch on the little thing next to the window and peck it.

37:07.940 --> 37:14.820
And you wake up the giant cat that you saw that was sitting on top of the desk

37:14.820 --> 37:16.340
right before you ran in this window.

37:16.340 --> 37:18.260
As you peck, it kind of slowly...

37:22.020 --> 37:24.420
Hello there, everybody.

37:25.460 --> 37:30.100
My name's RoPo and welcome to Hotel Moto.

37:30.660 --> 37:33.380
You know, I know you spend more time with her, but that's not RoPo's voice.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.060
That's very funny, Tom.

37:39.060 --> 37:46.100
I love my sister, Ramona.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.060
Could you get Taylor in here to do it right, please?

37:49.620 --> 37:50.020
Taylor!

37:53.380 --> 37:55.300
Thomas wants to hear your RoPo voice.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.300
Taylor gets on like...

38:03.700 --> 38:05.140
It has to be better than mine.

38:05.620 --> 38:10.580
Hi, guys, it's RoPo.

38:13.220 --> 38:18.260
I came to tell you that I just took the biggest shot and it was so fun.

38:23.940 --> 38:25.780
RoPo seems weirdly high energy.

38:26.740 --> 38:26.980
Yeah.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.340
Have you ever seen my ass?

38:30.340 --> 38:42.180
That's what RoPo says all the time, though.

38:42.180 --> 38:42.660
She's right.

38:43.460 --> 38:46.900
Every time she walks up to you and she like rubs against you and meows, she's like,

38:46.900 --> 38:48.100
have you seen my ass?

38:48.100 --> 38:49.060
Have you seen my ass?

38:50.260 --> 38:53.780
I can't find it because my belly's in the way.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.580
Boys, I will be back in two shakes.

38:56.580 --> 38:58.820
This is what we call...

38:58.820 --> 38:59.860
Is it a pee break?

39:00.580 --> 39:01.380
Pee break.

39:01.380 --> 39:02.900
Everyone leave your recording going.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.740
I'm gonna go break as well.

39:04.740 --> 39:07.060
Question is, which voice do I come back with?

39:14.900 --> 39:15.620
Are you sober?

39:16.980 --> 39:17.940
I'm not smoking.

39:17.940 --> 39:18.900
Oh, yeah.

39:18.900 --> 39:20.340
And I'm out of edibles right now.

39:20.900 --> 39:21.540
But I will...

39:22.100 --> 39:24.660
I'm also intermittent fasting and...

39:25.940 --> 39:27.140
I didn't know you were religious.

39:28.020 --> 39:31.780
Yeah, I am really, really deeply religious.

39:31.780 --> 39:41.380
And I don't think it's cool to personify animals because they don't have souls.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.020
They're not going to heaven.

39:44.020 --> 39:44.980
Oh, God.

39:44.980 --> 39:47.460
That's for people who love Jesus.

39:49.300 --> 39:50.900
A dog can't love Jesus.

39:50.900 --> 39:59.620
So THC gets stored in your fat cells for a long ass time.

39:59.620 --> 40:01.860
Are you saying and you're not fat anymore?

40:01.860 --> 40:04.340
No, I'm still fat.

40:04.340 --> 40:11.700
But when I intermittent fast, I definitely feel like I've taken a mild edible during

40:11.700 --> 40:15.860
the course of the day, which is cool because my body is getting high on its own supply.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.780
You got that slow release.

40:20.660 --> 40:23.140
And then the only food he's eating is more edibles.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.540
It's not the edibles.

40:30.900 --> 40:31.620
It's my fat.

40:31.620 --> 40:35.700
So which voice do you guys want me to do for RoPo?

40:35.700 --> 40:36.420
Your Santa voice?

40:36.420 --> 40:38.260
Whatever you feel comfortable with.

40:38.260 --> 40:42.100
I like thinking of RoPo as a weird, big, jolly cat like that.

40:42.100 --> 40:42.580
Yeah.

40:42.580 --> 40:44.020
Santa Claus it is.

40:44.020 --> 40:44.340
All right.

40:44.900 --> 40:49.700
Welcome to Ho Ho Ho Ho Hotel Motel.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.180
Tyler starts growling at the cat.

40:52.180 --> 40:52.740
Yeah.

40:52.740 --> 40:56.180
Rusty sees the cat and is startled and goes woof.

40:56.180 --> 40:56.820
Hi.

40:56.820 --> 41:01.700
RoPo's hair doesn't stand up even a little bit.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.900
Are you guys trying to intimidate her?

41:04.900 --> 41:06.260
Rusty, no, no, no.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.380
It's just a reaction.

41:07.380 --> 41:11.780
Rusty tilts his head to the side and then when he sees the cat is no threat, his tail

41:11.780 --> 41:12.340
starts wagging.

41:12.420 --> 41:17.700
Tyler starts doing like the growl starts to turn into a yip kinda and then like pause

41:17.700 --> 41:21.220
down, backs up a little, pause forward, backs up a little.

41:21.220 --> 41:23.380
Just trying to gaze what this cat's doing.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.660
Hello, my friends.

41:24.660 --> 41:26.260
Rusty, what you call this stuff?

41:26.260 --> 41:27.860
This force field, what you call it?

41:28.820 --> 41:30.900
Oh, it's a window.

41:30.900 --> 41:33.940
Hey, RoPo, can you turn this window off?

41:38.420 --> 41:39.860
That's a picture of me.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.620
I would never want to get rid of it.

41:43.140 --> 41:47.300
Would Chip know RoPo as a veteran of the 4C?

41:48.020 --> 41:51.380
Chip, it's been a long time, hasn't it?

41:51.380 --> 41:55.220
It's good to see you're doing well in these trying times, RoPo.

41:55.220 --> 41:58.420
Looks like you haven't been hard up for food none lately.

41:58.420 --> 42:02.740
Well, I see you are living lavishly as well, my good sir.

42:02.740 --> 42:06.100
I miss our nights together every now and then.

42:06.100 --> 42:08.500
Chip slaps his belly a few times.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.540
He's like, yeah, brother.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.420
That's the Chip I knew.

42:15.060 --> 42:16.100
Hey, Cat.

42:16.100 --> 42:18.260
Cat, don't you know there's a goo out there?

42:18.260 --> 42:21.060
Don't you know it can get into buildings and such?

42:21.060 --> 42:21.860
A what?

42:21.860 --> 42:22.580
There's a goo.

42:22.580 --> 42:24.420
There's a black goo that wants to eat everybody,

42:24.420 --> 42:26.180
so all the critters are meeting down at the creek.

42:26.180 --> 42:28.740
I've not seen this black goo.

42:29.780 --> 42:31.140
Well, keep an eye out for it.

42:31.140 --> 42:36.580
RoPo, we need your help to find someone or maybe a couple someones.

42:36.580 --> 42:41.540
You know any animals that would be trapped or something in these parts?

42:41.540 --> 42:43.300
Are you talking about the dogs?

42:43.300 --> 42:44.900
Yeah, Murphy and Bean.

42:44.900 --> 42:45.380
Bean.

42:45.380 --> 42:46.260
Oh, you almost...

42:46.260 --> 42:47.700
Oh, you do know their names.

42:48.820 --> 42:49.620
Yes, of course.

42:50.340 --> 42:58.660
Well, I'm not much for the symbols, but I believe you'll find where they are on those charts over there.

42:58.660 --> 43:00.660
I want to look at the charts.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.140
Can you...

43:01.140 --> 43:02.100
Did you go to college?

43:02.740 --> 43:02.980
Yes.

43:04.580 --> 43:05.380
Can you enroll?

43:06.020 --> 43:07.380
Critter Community College.

43:07.940 --> 43:08.180
Yeah.

43:09.700 --> 43:10.500
He's got a critter.

43:10.500 --> 43:11.780
What is your skill for that?

43:13.940 --> 43:15.220
Intelligence.

43:15.220 --> 43:15.540
I thought...

43:15.540 --> 43:16.420
Don't you have...

43:16.420 --> 43:18.420
You said understand human, which I think means...

43:18.420 --> 43:22.500
I could have sworn you had a special skill that meant you could understand, like...

43:22.500 --> 43:23.140
Yeah, I can...

43:23.140 --> 43:23.540
I have...

43:23.540 --> 43:26.100
It's called a little birdie told me.

43:27.860 --> 43:28.180
What?

43:31.220 --> 43:33.780
When I told you that you could have special skills,

43:33.780 --> 43:40.180
you wrote down somewhere that your special skill was a little birdie told me.

43:40.660 --> 43:44.980
Yeah, which means I can understand humans and read.

43:45.940 --> 43:47.060
I see it needs...

43:47.060 --> 43:48.500
I think it has to be one or the other.

43:50.420 --> 43:52.500
It's I understand human stuff.

43:57.620 --> 43:59.780
Willie's like, have you guys watched The Wire?

44:03.380 --> 44:05.540
Dude, I love human stuff.

44:05.540 --> 44:06.260
Season two?

44:06.260 --> 44:06.980
Are you kidding me?

44:08.500 --> 44:10.260
Don't bother with season five.

44:10.260 --> 44:12.740
This is now dictating that it's...

44:12.740 --> 44:15.220
That you can read and understand stuff.

44:15.220 --> 44:15.540
Okay.

44:16.500 --> 44:18.340
So go ahead and roll those dice, baby.

44:19.860 --> 44:24.420
But if people try to talk to you, boy, you ain't gonna know what they're saying?

44:24.420 --> 44:25.060
60.

44:25.700 --> 44:26.980
Oh, congratulations.

44:26.980 --> 44:31.380
So it very clearly says, hey, Luke, do you know what room Keith Vigna is?

44:31.380 --> 44:33.300
If we said it, it was probably seven.

44:33.860 --> 44:34.980
I think it was.

44:34.980 --> 44:39.300
And then we've got Murphy is on the first floor in room three.

44:39.380 --> 44:41.780
We got to go to room seven and three.

44:42.340 --> 44:43.940
Do you guys know what that means?

44:43.940 --> 44:44.340
No.

44:44.340 --> 44:45.860
What the hell are you talking about?

44:45.860 --> 44:51.780
RoPo, can you help guide us here to whereabouts we're supposed to search for our friends?

44:51.780 --> 44:53.060
Not even a little bit.

44:53.060 --> 44:56.180
I believe it's the woodpecker that knows the symbols.

44:58.420 --> 45:01.860
I don't know what your quest is or give a fuck about you.

45:03.620 --> 45:04.820
Any more, Chip?

45:06.340 --> 45:07.540
I dream of you.

45:07.540 --> 45:08.660
This is a really tight...

45:08.660 --> 45:10.180
This is a really tight game, guys.

45:11.940 --> 45:14.740
I can read the symbols on the doors here.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.780
This one's seven right here.

45:17.780 --> 45:19.860
And I fly over to room seven.

45:19.860 --> 45:21.540
Yeah, it's up on the second floor.

45:21.540 --> 45:23.620
And you guys go to the stairs.

45:23.620 --> 45:27.300
I go to three first then, since it's on the first floor, probably.

45:27.300 --> 45:29.300
Is this the one that Bien is in?

45:29.300 --> 45:30.660
Is this where Bien is?

45:30.660 --> 45:33.940
This one right here is Murphy's, but it's closest.

45:33.940 --> 45:40.100
Don't you think we should get beans?

45:40.100 --> 45:41.220
He's our mission.

45:41.220 --> 45:42.820
He might be able to help us get this other guy.

45:43.460 --> 45:45.780
I think we should get beans.

45:45.780 --> 45:47.700
What about the other way around?

45:47.700 --> 45:49.300
Maybe Murphy can help us.

45:49.300 --> 45:51.700
Yeah, and this first dog's on the first floor.

45:51.700 --> 45:54.100
Tyler, I'm gonna need you to pull yourself together.

45:54.100 --> 45:56.980
These old bones don't get upstairs too well.

45:56.980 --> 45:58.580
Tyler starts chasing his tail.

45:59.140 --> 46:00.180
He has stopped listening.

46:00.420 --> 46:07.460
Can Chip Montgomery pick a little tiny pebble up and throw it at Tyler?

46:09.140 --> 46:10.660
Don't throw rocks at dogs.

46:10.660 --> 46:14.420
Like really, I'm talking, it's a chipmunk size pebble.

46:14.420 --> 46:18.580
Wait, like a pebble for a chipmunk or a pebble that's the size of a chipmunk?

46:18.580 --> 46:22.180
No, the pebble for a chipmunk.

46:22.180 --> 46:24.020
Because if that's true, Chip is so strong.

46:24.020 --> 46:25.460
Chip only has 20 strength.

46:25.460 --> 46:28.820
He can barely, he can't lift his own body weight up.

46:29.620 --> 46:32.900
Okay, so as this weird squabble is happening,

46:32.900 --> 46:38.820
where the cartoon's rocks and chips are changing size rapidly back and forth,

46:38.820 --> 46:44.980
I need you guys to roll if you have some sort of like perception ability,

46:44.980 --> 46:48.420
special ability that is, or intelligence.

46:48.420 --> 46:49.860
Should we all roll then?

46:49.860 --> 46:52.260
Hearing and smelling counts as perception, right?

46:52.900 --> 46:54.180
It absolutely does.

46:54.180 --> 46:58.980
I failed an intelligence check.

46:58.980 --> 47:00.020
I failed mine.

47:00.020 --> 47:03.940
I passed an intelligence check of 12 on 50.

47:04.500 --> 47:09.380
Yeah, fittingly, the two dogs immediately turn and look,

47:10.020 --> 47:16.660
and you see driving by slowly is someone who is looking at you,

47:16.660 --> 47:22.020
and in the shotgun seat, there's an old person with a cane,

47:22.020 --> 47:25.460
and they're shaking the cane at all of you out the window,

47:25.460 --> 47:29.620
and they're screaming something in their weird human language,

47:30.260 --> 47:34.100
convincing the person who's on the phone to do something.

47:34.100 --> 47:38.420
Thomas thinks they're probably calling, trying to call animal control.

47:38.420 --> 47:39.940
So does Rusty.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.740
Well, Rusty just knows they're up to no good.

47:43.780 --> 47:46.740
He's like, I think we need to get a move on.

47:46.740 --> 47:47.700
Scatter, brothers.

47:48.340 --> 47:51.380
Tyler has been on the run for five days now,

47:51.380 --> 47:53.940
and he knows how to avoid humans.

47:53.940 --> 47:59.220
He's real skittish, and he's already probably running for under the stairs, maybe.

47:59.220 --> 48:06.420
Yeah, and I think maybe even, Tyler, you've seen this caned person before.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.540
He's my nemesis.

48:08.660 --> 48:09.780
Yeah, exactly.

48:11.460 --> 48:15.700
Famed Tyler nemesis, Greargin.

48:15.700 --> 48:16.660
Greargin?

48:16.660 --> 48:17.540
Fuck, guys, it's Greargin.

48:17.540 --> 48:18.820
We have to get out of here.

48:18.820 --> 48:22.020
The old contention person.

48:24.980 --> 48:27.300
The 300-year-old founder of contention.

48:29.540 --> 48:30.580
Nope, they're elsewhere.

48:30.580 --> 48:33.620
He just won't die.

48:33.620 --> 48:34.580
Wow, spoilies.

48:36.100 --> 48:37.060
What are you guys doing?

48:39.140 --> 48:41.380
How are you getting into room three or seven?

48:41.380 --> 48:45.460
Is there a window on these, like a door with a window next to it?

48:45.460 --> 48:47.140
Yeah, they all have a window next to them.

48:47.140 --> 48:50.500
I want to peck on the glass of the room three.

48:50.500 --> 48:52.660
Look who knows what glass is all of a sudden.

48:54.900 --> 48:56.660
His allies taught him.

48:56.660 --> 48:57.940
He found out the hard way.

48:57.940 --> 49:04.340
That's honestly, that's the most character development we've had on any of the shows so far.

49:07.060 --> 49:07.560
All right.

49:08.500 --> 49:14.900
Is there any kind of ventilation shafts in and out of these rooms that a small rodent

49:14.900 --> 49:16.260
could perhaps go into?

49:17.620 --> 49:19.060
Oh, hell yeah, dude.

49:19.060 --> 49:19.940
Of course there are.

49:20.660 --> 49:27.780
Luke, Wilson is tapping on the glass and the curtain slowly opens with a dark chocolate.

49:27.780 --> 49:28.980
I'm talking 92%.

49:29.860 --> 49:32.180
Beautiful old dog.

49:32.180 --> 49:32.900
Long hair.

49:33.620 --> 49:37.860
And it looks at you with these gorgeous knowing eyes.

49:38.900 --> 49:44.260
And it says, well, hello there, my good bird friend.

49:45.220 --> 49:47.700
I sure would like to get out of this room.

49:47.700 --> 49:49.300
Can you turn this window off?

49:53.940 --> 49:56.820
Zach, that's, while that's not Murphy's voice, it's close.

49:56.820 --> 49:59.300
So, oh, thanks dude.

49:59.300 --> 50:04.740
Cut to Chip is running on hind legs through an air vent.

50:06.820 --> 50:08.340
I'm really out of shape, my brother.

50:08.340 --> 50:08.900
Oh God.

50:09.940 --> 50:11.780
John McLean in it.

50:11.780 --> 50:13.140
Chip, are you wearing shoes?

50:14.820 --> 50:20.180
In my mind, I pictured him wearing like a weird, like fatigues for a little fat.

50:21.780 --> 50:22.820
He's a warfatter.

50:23.540 --> 50:25.060
He's like he's a prepper squirrel.

50:29.220 --> 50:31.940
He's got some sick Nike's on combat.

50:31.940 --> 50:34.180
No little combat boots for a chipmunk.

50:34.180 --> 50:37.540
Oh man, Justin, I don't want to criticize your role-playing decisions, but you should

50:37.540 --> 50:38.740
have been a chipmunk.

50:39.540 --> 50:43.460
Oh, like bald on top or like Tony Shalhoub.

50:43.460 --> 50:44.660
Oh, yes.

50:53.860 --> 50:54.900
All right, let's start over.

50:54.900 --> 50:55.860
I'm going to start the recording.

50:57.380 --> 51:02.820
It is a brisk December 5th here in contention, made all the more bleak by the-

51:02.820 --> 51:06.820
Hey, no shit, I would like, I would start over if you guys wanted to.

51:07.460 --> 51:07.780
No.

51:07.780 --> 51:09.620
I think we could do this a lot tighter.

51:09.620 --> 51:11.540
I loved every second of this.

51:11.540 --> 51:11.860
Okay.

51:11.860 --> 51:13.060
I think this has been really good.

51:13.060 --> 51:15.700
It hasn't been tight, but I like it loose.

51:19.220 --> 51:19.860
You heard me.

51:22.260 --> 51:23.140
Say what I said.

51:26.260 --> 51:27.220
I don't like it loose.

51:28.100 --> 51:28.580
Say it.

51:29.140 --> 51:30.340
Zach likes it loose.

51:35.540 --> 51:36.740
All right, good talk everybody.

51:36.740 --> 51:38.420
Did you see my chat to the group?

51:38.980 --> 51:39.220
Yes.

51:39.220 --> 51:39.460
Yep.

51:39.780 --> 51:43.860
Okay, what's Chippy doing?

51:43.860 --> 51:49.780
Chip is sprinting as fast as his little chubby legs can take him to try and get to Murphy.

51:49.780 --> 51:52.900
Oh yeah, you may get to the vent that's on the other side.

51:52.900 --> 51:56.260
Is there a little, can I, is there like a little pocket I can squeeze through in the

51:56.260 --> 51:56.980
ventilation?

51:59.380 --> 51:59.860
What happened?

52:00.980 --> 52:03.620
Yeah, but it's a really wide-

52:03.620 --> 52:04.980
No, no, no, listen to me.

52:05.940 --> 52:06.020
It's round.

52:06.020 --> 52:07.060
It's really wide.

52:07.060 --> 52:12.500
But it's really wide and there's some like oil that's just like dripping from it.

52:12.500 --> 52:13.300
It's very strange.

52:15.060 --> 52:16.420
Wait, what are we talking about?

52:16.420 --> 52:17.540
Are we talking about your wife?

52:19.700 --> 52:20.420
Holy shit.

52:20.420 --> 52:22.900
That is extremely rude, Justin.

52:23.540 --> 52:27.220
Yeah, why would you ever say that to me?

52:27.220 --> 52:45.220
We are not lazy enough, basically.

52:45.220 --> 52:49.060
Did Thomas just say, I'm the devil and I'll be back?

52:49.060 --> 52:50.660
Yeah, I think that's what this meant.

52:50.660 --> 52:52.260
Oh, Jesus Christ.

52:53.220 --> 52:54.580
One, two, three.

52:57.940 --> 52:59.300
All right, let's get back to it.

52:59.300 --> 53:03.860
My earphones just said my battery is low, so I don't know how much, I don't know what

53:03.860 --> 53:04.340
that means.

53:05.460 --> 53:06.340
Wait, what?

53:07.300 --> 53:08.580
I've got these wireless.

53:09.220 --> 53:09.620
Yeah.

53:09.620 --> 53:12.260
Can you plug them in while you're wearing them?

53:12.260 --> 53:15.940
The cord's like this long, but it should, it should be fine.

53:17.300 --> 53:18.420
So let's keep going.

53:19.060 --> 53:19.780
Some-

53:19.780 --> 53:20.260
Body.

53:22.260 --> 53:22.760
Morns.

53:23.620 --> 53:24.020
Yeah.

53:24.100 --> 53:31.940
On my Animal Crossing game, I made the town theme song All Star.

53:33.060 --> 53:33.940
That's really cute.

53:34.660 --> 53:41.700
Okay, so you guys are on the outside of this window and the Wilson the woodpecker just

53:41.700 --> 53:44.660
asked to turn the glass off.

53:44.660 --> 53:52.980
The two dogs are right behind the woodpecker and Chip the chipmunk is about to bust into

53:52.980 --> 53:54.900
a grate that is into this room.

53:54.900 --> 53:56.660
Chip is always about to bust.

53:59.780 --> 54:02.180
I explained that to Murphy.

54:02.180 --> 54:04.660
I'm like, hold on there, little fella.

54:05.220 --> 54:08.420
Help is coming in the form of a chipmunk.

54:08.420 --> 54:09.380
Please don't eat it.

54:10.580 --> 54:15.300
Although you might be tempted, he is on our side and he's going to help you get out of

54:15.300 --> 54:15.860
that room.

54:15.860 --> 54:18.500
I'm curious, do you guys have a plan, Chip?

54:18.500 --> 54:20.660
Do you have a plan to help him get out of the room?

54:20.660 --> 54:24.820
A real leader takes action and then thinks about it much later.

54:24.820 --> 54:30.660
I'm assuming since we're all animals at every door in this hotel is a lever, not a knob.

54:31.220 --> 54:33.060
This is a hotel motel for humans.

54:33.060 --> 54:34.740
No, it's one of those things.

54:34.740 --> 54:35.380
It's a push.

54:36.580 --> 54:38.100
So it's just got like a push bar.

54:38.660 --> 54:39.860
So none of the doors lock?

54:40.500 --> 54:41.380
No, those lock.

54:41.380 --> 54:42.980
You just have to use an Allen wrench.

54:42.980 --> 54:46.340
I'm going to shout at Murphy from the ventilation.

54:46.900 --> 54:47.400
Murphy.

54:48.180 --> 54:48.740
Yeah.

54:48.820 --> 54:49.860
Now I'm going to come on down.

54:49.860 --> 54:50.740
Don't eat me now.

54:51.300 --> 54:51.800
Okay.

54:52.900 --> 54:57.620
I just really need you to promise me that there ain't going to be no eating of old chip

54:57.620 --> 54:58.120
tonight.

54:58.740 --> 54:59.700
Roll intelligence.

55:00.340 --> 55:02.420
I would never even consider it.

55:02.420 --> 55:04.100
I pass 38 on a 40.

55:04.100 --> 55:06.420
Oh yeah, no, he would never even consider it.

55:07.300 --> 55:08.660
All right now.

55:08.660 --> 55:12.260
Well, to be fair, the real Murphy would absolutely consider it.

55:12.260 --> 55:15.300
But if you explained it to him, he would know to hold off.

55:16.020 --> 55:17.140
That's good to know.

55:19.380 --> 55:23.700
Chip will, however he got through the other ventilation, like, I don't know, is it from

55:23.700 --> 55:26.260
the ceiling I'm coming or below?

55:26.260 --> 55:26.900
Oh yeah.

55:26.900 --> 55:27.220
Yeah.

55:27.220 --> 55:27.940
From the wall.

55:27.940 --> 55:31.460
I have a climbing skill to, to get out safely.

55:31.460 --> 55:31.960
Perfect.

55:32.660 --> 55:35.780
Describe how you rappel down this hotel wall.

55:35.780 --> 55:41.780
Well, uh, chip wants to use some of his old combat moves from the old days.

55:41.780 --> 55:45.540
So I'd like to think he like does like a sick ass, like combat role.

55:45.620 --> 55:48.740
Like he like slides down the wall with one hand on the wall.

55:48.740 --> 55:53.540
So it slows him down with his little tiny, weird, creepy fingernails that rodents have.

55:53.540 --> 55:54.820
And he goes down really slow.

55:54.820 --> 55:59.060
And then as he lands, he does like a little combat role and like jumps up and he's like,

55:59.060 --> 56:00.260
Oh, I love it.

56:00.260 --> 56:02.020
Very, very flashy entrance.

56:02.020 --> 56:03.380
He's like, now is my time.

56:04.820 --> 56:10.980
Speaking of combat and Murphy, he has, uh, he has a hundred in all stats and he, instead

56:10.980 --> 56:13.380
of three health boxes, he has a billion.

56:13.380 --> 56:16.180
So, so you can't hurt him, Zach.

56:17.380 --> 56:18.900
I think you know me better than that.

56:20.980 --> 56:21.220
Yeah.

56:21.220 --> 56:21.860
I think I do.

56:22.500 --> 56:23.940
What do you think of me?

56:23.940 --> 56:26.660
I think he would hurt my dog in a role-playing game

56:32.020 --> 56:35.380
to elicit like a genuine emotional response from your players.

56:36.580 --> 56:41.620
Tyler sees chip fall into the room and he goes and bumps his face into the window.

56:41.620 --> 56:42.020
Excited.

56:45.140 --> 56:45.640
Yeah.

56:46.180 --> 56:50.660
Both the dogs seen the chipmunk forget it's their friend and like bark.

56:52.580 --> 56:57.220
When Tyler bumps into the glass, uh, I'm like, Oh, that's a pretty good idea.

56:57.220 --> 56:59.380
And I start pecking at the glass.

57:00.820 --> 57:03.860
Oh, that's your skill.

57:03.860 --> 57:07.700
I'm going to use my pecking skill to pack the glass.

57:07.700 --> 57:08.660
Can you break it open?

57:09.860 --> 57:10.360
Okay.

57:11.320 --> 57:15.960
Luke Wilson, the woodpecker is standing on that little ledge that windows have.

57:16.840 --> 57:25.880
And you begin slowly pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack,

57:25.880 --> 57:31.080
pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack,

57:31.080 --> 57:38.840
and you start seeing like shards and then sparks as you're going so slowly.

57:39.800 --> 57:45.640
So slowly through this glass, but your beak movement is so fast that these little

57:45.640 --> 57:48.360
shards sparks of glass begin flying out.

57:48.360 --> 57:54.760
And then finally you can smell the stale motel air on the other side.

57:55.400 --> 57:58.120
And then the camera zooms out really fast and there's a

57:59.480 --> 58:02.040
as a bunch of different spider web breaks on the glass.

58:02.040 --> 58:07.240
And then it into pebbles as both dogs from the outside.

58:08.200 --> 58:08.700
No.

58:09.560 --> 58:19.160
As Murphy on the inside comes bounding through the glass to the outdoors being ridden by chip.

58:20.040 --> 58:21.800
And what is chip doing on top?

58:21.800 --> 58:26.840
He's a writing it like a Khaleesi does on the dragons where he's like holding it.

58:32.360 --> 58:33.160
That's great.

58:33.160 --> 58:36.920
He's up near its neck, like holding it and trying to guide it.

58:37.240 --> 58:40.920
Rusty gives Murphy a big old lick on the face because he's a good boy.

58:40.920 --> 58:43.160
And a lick is returned.

58:43.160 --> 58:44.200
Tyler sniffs his ass.

58:45.000 --> 58:45.960
Oh, how rude of me.

58:48.200 --> 58:49.480
Rusty sniffs his ass too.

58:51.880 --> 58:53.160
What kind of vibe do I pick up?

58:55.160 --> 58:58.600
Would we know Murphy or is Murphy news to us?

58:58.600 --> 59:06.920
So Murphy is just you've heard tell that there's an old wise wizard that lives in

59:06.920 --> 59:14.520
Hotel Motel, but you've never you've never met this Murphy, but he seems to just be

59:14.520 --> 59:17.800
here passing through or for a short time.

59:17.800 --> 59:23.400
No one really passes through contention, but people do come and leave shortly thereafter.

59:23.400 --> 59:28.600
Now, Murphy, we're part of something called the Contention Creek Critter Coalition,

59:28.600 --> 59:31.400
and we're here to help all the animals we can.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.240
And in particular one that's upstairs right now.

59:34.920 --> 59:35.800
We got to get up there.

59:36.280 --> 59:40.840
Murphy, have you have you smelled the other dog around here, Bean?

59:40.840 --> 59:41.560
Oh, yes.

59:42.680 --> 59:45.000
Up in room seven.

59:46.120 --> 59:47.720
Can you could you guide us there?

59:48.280 --> 59:49.800
Well, but of course.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.920
And then you're all standing outside room seven.

59:52.920 --> 59:53.880
Let's do it again, boys.

59:53.880 --> 59:54.680
Come on.

59:54.680 --> 59:55.000
Same.

59:55.000 --> 59:55.160
Yeah.

59:55.160 --> 59:55.960
Same game plan.

59:56.520 --> 59:57.480
Go for it, Willy.

59:57.480 --> 59:58.200
Holy shit.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.120
OK, hold up.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:08.760
Cut to the glass shattering as Bean, a gorgeous golden retriever, jumps through the window

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.440
with Chip on his back.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.080
And we won.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.080
Thanks for subscribing to the Patreon.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.600
Is this a Patreon episode?

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:21.960
Oh, it's high.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.460
Well.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.760
Go do it anyway.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.960
Thanks for nothing, cucks.

Subscribe to the Patreon.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.960
Oh, boy.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.640
We got to get you back to safety, Bean.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.200
Wait, did that actually happen, though?

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.480
Oh, hell yeah.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.040
Give us a.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.000
Hey, Luke, what is Bean sound like?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:41.400
Yeah.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.600
What should I do?

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.200
Oh, he's like.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.320
Remember, you have the opportunity to describe a voice that Zach has to do.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.760
Do not waste.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.840
He sounds like Captain Peanut Butter.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.200
Mr. Peanut Butter?

01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.640
No, Captain Peanut Butter.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.640
The like Lumberjack.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.680
Mr. Peanut Butter.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.520
It's Mr. Peanut Butter's brother.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.720
Mr. Peanut Butter's brother.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.200
Gotcha.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:06.680
Yeah.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.880
BoJack Horseman, y'all.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.200
All right.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.360
Just do an excited Labrador voice then.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.480
So exactly Joe's voice.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.120
Do a different dog's voice for this dog.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.960
Does someone fart?

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.680
What was that?

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.560
Was that Luke?

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.400
What did you fart?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.200
I think it was my chair.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.200
As soon as that sound happens, Luke, you coincidentally made a face like you farted

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.160
and you knew it and you're a real squeaker.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.000
My headphones keep telling me I got low battery, so I was like.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.040
Luke, what is Bean sound like?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.880
Okay, he sounds like Woody from Toy Story.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.400
He sounds like Woody the Woodpecker.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.200
I'm Bean.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.520
There you go.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Since Bean's dad is a cop, he's like a rebellious teenager.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:09.720
Okay.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.160
Yeah, that's good.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.840
Thanks for saving me, guys.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.080
But I was fine in there alone.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.840
How long have you been in there?

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.720
How long have you been in there?

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.200
Also, keep in mind, everyone loves this guy.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.560
I thought Bean was the smartest voice.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.440
Most compassionate and caring.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.720
What's up, fuck sticks?

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.600
I'm so fucking smart.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.520
Hey, pussies, is your mom hot too?

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.440
Jesus.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.040
Do you guys want to sniff my butt?

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.920
If you'll let us.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.680
Yeah, hop on back here.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.320
Got you, dude.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.280
Ah, shit.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:53.640
Rusty.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.760
Did you guys see Rusty get a rusty eye?

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.960
Oh, shit.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:03.080
Rusty is unbelievably honored that you would gift him with that extra smell.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.040
Dude, hell yeah, man.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.480
You got my stink on you now.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.200
Do you love it?

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.560
I do.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.040
That would.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.320
Do you fucking love it?

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.360
Let's get out of here, bro.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.400
That's one of the finest ass smells I've ever smelled.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.360
Oh, hell yeah.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.120
Thanks, Luke, for doing this to me.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.360
How long have you been trapped in here?

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.080
Oh, God.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.440
This piece of shit, man.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.560
I don't even know.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:25.640
He's my bro-lo for ro-lo, but I don't even know-lo.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.960
How are you surviving in there all alone?

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.000
Honestly, just jacking it nonstop.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.440
Just little red riding head lipstick in this motherfucker.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.320
Jack links.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.680
There's a bunch of jerky in there.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.520
Oh, just rocking my jerky.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.040
I hate this character.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.080
I hate this character.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.240
Yeah, let's put him back.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.680
Let's not rescue this guy.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.180
Yeah.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.080
Hey, Luke, what does Bean sound like?

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.440
Like a little tiny girl.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.840
Thanks for saving me, guys.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.840
As you bust through, and the glass just pebbles down and cascades,

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:14.120
and you're all standing there in a line from, like, tallest in the middle,

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.880
and then, like, well-crafted shot design all the way through,

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.920
and you're all standing in a line sideways, it's beautiful,

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.280
and the glass just, like, shatters at your feet into pebbles,

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.160
and then you see, like, in the foreground,

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.560
the animal control van pulls up, and it is game time.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.280
Oh shit, the fuzz!

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.160
The fuzz is here, but we can take him?

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.920
Chip starts punching his little tiny fist into his little tiny hand over and over again.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.400
Make him surfer god instead of little girl.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.920
No time to sniff butts.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.640
We've got the man to take on.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.160
It's time to...

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.000
To roll initiative, doggy style.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.800
Yes, a hundred percent that.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:02.920
Lettuce, tomato, roll your dice on dexterity.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.200
It's a deck structure.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.000
That's my worst.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.880
I got a 47 on a 60.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.080
I failed.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.600
17 on a 20.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.080
I passed with a 38 on a 70.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:21.640
The animal control folk rolled a 66 on a 60.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.120
So you will all get to go first.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.520
So you guys can decide as a group.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:31.720
Literally, it's...

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.800
God, who should it be?

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.360
It should be a pair of doofuses.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.760
Well, I imagine it's just Ron and Hugo from...

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:41.960
Oh, that's better.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.480
Except Rip Harris.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.600
Yeah, it'll be an honor.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.480
No, they're both Sewage Joe.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.200
Who's that?

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.160
Sewage Joe?

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.120
From Parks and Rec?

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.240
Oh, yeah.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.080
Oh, the perverted guy.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:58.540
Yeah.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.200
One of them and then the surgeon on scrubs with the do-rag.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.080
Oh, the Todd.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.720
The Todd.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.080
Hell yeah, it's the Todd.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.000
And Sewage Joe.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.000
Fantastic.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.720
And both in dark blue jumpsuits.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.640
Oh yeah, I like that.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.560
And they both have taser guns.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.480
No, not guns, prods.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:25.980
Oh no.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.120
And they're just coming from Murphy.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:34.040
No, they're just coming from Murphy.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.200
Sacrifices themselves so that we may go...

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.440
I quit the podcast forever.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.000
I love you, Luke.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.800
I love you, Justin.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.600
I love you, Joe.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.840
Fuck you, Zach.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.040
It's just that it's 2020.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.040
It's gotten me all shook up.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.320
I'm gonna go hug my dog.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.000
Okay, it's game time.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.600
When they pull up, I look at the other guys.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.560
I'm like, they cut down my favorite tree just because I was pecking on it in the park.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.600
Fuck these guys.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.160
Yeah, these guys are bad news.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.280
They've been looking for me for days and I've been out running them,

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.120
but I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, guys.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:12.920
They're right there.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.080
It don't take much to get old Chip all riled up for action.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:22.040
First of all, Willie, you know, I don't know much about human bureaucracy,

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.200
but it seems like that must have been unrelated.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.560
I don't know if that's within the purview of animal control.

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.440
I'm learning a lot of new words today.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.520
Bureaucracy, window, glass.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.400
It's a big old world.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:42.040
All I know is I've got it out for these fuckers and I take off and I fly towards them

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.120
and I take a shit aiming for Todd's eye.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.320
Yes, dive bomb.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:55.720
Okay, yeah, we'll just do all of these as contested rules, I suppose.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.080
And if you hit the same person twice in a round,

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:04.440
then they'll be at a disadvantage for that second and whatever role.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.840
He's gonna try to high-five it out of the way.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:13.080
You're gonna roll Dexterity or Intelligence, whichever one is higher,

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:17.720
unless you have a special skill that would help more in a shitty situation.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.040
Oh shit, my headphones just died.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.040
Well, Luke, time to find some more headphones to put on.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.200
In the meantime, I'd be interested to see what he rolled

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:34.920
because I rolled a 49 on the Todd's ability to high-five.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.480
Probably pretty high.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.480
Okay, so I'm gonna roll Dexterity.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.040
Is that what he said?

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.000
Yeah, or Intelligence, whichever one's higher.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.880
I already told them what I rolled.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.520
I got a 51 on a 60.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.200
Nice.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:52.840
What did you get?

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.360
Dude, you got a 49, you fucking...

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.360
You barely beat the contestant.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.000
That's so good.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.360
As the Todd goes to high-five the stream of shit, it goes right...

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:10.760
It literally curves around his hand like James McAvoy shooting a bullet,

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:16.360
and it hits the Todd square in the eye, disabling him for the entire round.

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.360
Rusty barks in approval.

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.920
Did you guys see that shit?

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.880
He sure did.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.880
God.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:28.840
I don't get it.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:36.280
The rest of you can decide on an idea where you could help each other do something,

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:42.040
or basically you have the entire round yourselves before there's a reaction from Sewage Joe.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.920
Listen, y'all.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:51.000
We've got four dogs and a chipmunk, and they're just two stupid humans.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.520
I think if we work together, we can herd these fuckers.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.840
We can round them up and take care of business.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.600
Rusty, you think you could throw me on one of them son of a bitching guys?

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.120
No, I'm a dog.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.720
I don't have opposable thumbs.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:10.280
Now I'm talking like using that big old mouth of yours, wiggling me around, tossing me up on them.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.680
Then I can do some good work up close.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:17.240
I'm afraid if I get you in my mouth, the temptation to just chomp down will be too high.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.400
Tyler runs over and does it.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.120
Oh shit.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.440
He just flings you with his head real quick in one swift motion.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.800
I want to be flipped at the guy who has shit in his eyes and face,

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.800
so that he doesn't see the beat down that's coming to him.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:42.040
Yeah, so he's got disadvantage, like a lot of it.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.400
No, he's like fully disabled.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.640
Okay, I want to describe something terrible for you.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.360
Do you?

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.240
I really do.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:59.800
Do you want a mass walk out of your podcast when you fuck with these adorable animals?

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.440
Choose your words carefully, motherfucker.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.120
I always try not to say um or like, but I still do sometimes.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:08.680
It's okay.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.480
Um, like is it?

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.800
As Chip is being flung at the Todd,

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:24.360
who has his eyes covered in the fecal matter of Wilson the woodpecker.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.720
It's getting in his mouth because it's open because he's screaming about it

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.240
and it's dripping down into his mouth and it's all over his tongue.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.120
Like he just licked ice cream, but it wasn't his bird shit.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:38.680
And he's like, no, no, you hit him square in the jaw.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:44.680
And at the exact same time, you see a masked bandit

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.960
who has snuck out of its cage in the back of the animal control truck

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.400
and is hitting the Todd on the opposite side of the head in the opposite direction

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.440
at the exact same time as you're hitting his chin.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:08.600
And the two of you chip the chipmunk and Rocky the raccoon just snap the Todd's neck.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.280
As his shoulders hit the ground, so does the back of his head.

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.320
Front of his shoulders, the back of his head.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:27.960
So facing up is his back and a face that's covered in Wilson the woodpecker shit.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.080
William.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.400
It's Wilson.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.120
It's Willie.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.360
Is it Wilson?

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.200
I thought it was Willie.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.160
You didn't call me Willie.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:39.880
I have been.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.000
It fits.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:54.120
Seeing that, Rusty gets into an aggressive stance and it starts growling at Sewage Joe.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.920
And I just want to try to intimidate him.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.280
We just killed your motherfucking co-worker.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.600
Why don't you step the fuck off, idiot?

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:07.080
We'll roll power against power.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:17.960
Now I'm going to say Sewage Joe has a mental power of 30 because he's a flatter thing.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.680
Rusty is not super physically gifted.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.320
He's got a 20 decks and a 30 strength, but he has a 70 power.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.760
So unless I fuck up the roll.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:33.720
No, fuck.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.880
I rolled a 75.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.600
That's over, right?

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:37.960
I rolled a 13.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.960
There was so much opportunity.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.480
I thought that you critically failed based on your reaction.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.400
I just thought there was like, yeah, you were going to win.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:49.880
It's good.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.200
I like that amount of commitment.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.320
That's just my face, man.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.640
I like your face.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.520
Thanks, baby.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:05.080
So I want you to tell me what is going through the mind of this Sewage Joe.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.760
When he looks into the eyes of Rusty.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:16.040
So as soon as Joe sees his best friend in the world, the Todd, shit on and like that

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.240
like freaks him out.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:23.320
But then he sees his fucking neck get snapped by a chipmunk and a raccoon.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.000
And then Rusty in the lead, Bean and Murphy flanking him.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.160
Maybe Tyler's chasing his tail in the background.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:39.240
But these dogs with their hackles up are like slowly advancing on him.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.320
And you see the wolf in them.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:45.960
They're a pack of predators and they're just staring him down and growling.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.600
And he knows he needs to get the fuck out of there.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:54.440
It convinces Sewage Joe to drive you all back to the creek.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.800
Isn't it just right there?

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.720
That would take longer.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:08.840
Rusty like locks eyes with him, growls and then points his snout at all the cages like

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.340
in the back.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.960
And he intimates that he needs to free the other animals as well.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.840
Oh, yes, no, I will be just one moment.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.800
I will do that.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.840
If he takes his time out here, I will head in there and I will take care of it.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.120
And then I will be right back.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.560
You started out French.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.720
No, I have never been French.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.760
I have only been what I am, which is Rocky the raccoon.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:36.600
And I will easily take everyone and get them out of there if you just have him stand there

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.320
real quick.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.360
Yes, of course.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:44.360
And so he, this little raccoon runs into the back of the animal control van.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.400
And soon there's a parade of animals, three long.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:55.880
It's the raccoon that just went in there, a fox, a little red fox.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.800
And there is a goat.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:06.120
Fox and a goat and a raccoon, but that's too many character voices to do.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:09.160
So we're going to get you guys back onto the Creek.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:14.760
And so can I, can Wilson do something else to enact his revenge?

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.240
One bit of revenge from Wilson.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:17.560
Wait.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:17.720
Yeah.

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:18.920
Cause they cut my tree down.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.680
Oh, well, one of them's dead.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:29.080
Or yeah, you helped to kill like in terms of eye for an eye.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.480
I want to, can I land on his head?

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.040
If you go for revenge, I will kill you.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:34.280
Why?

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.640
You are one woodpecker against a grown human.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.880
I want to pick his eyeballs.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:49.800
Who just saw that woodpecker and a raccoon kill his best friend and a chipmunk.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:50.840
But I'm not sewage Joe.

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.920
You're a sewage Joe.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.640
Gloves off.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:03.320
He'll try, but Rusty sees you like staring down at him and he's like, I just wanted to

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:09.800
reiterate that animal control has nothing to do with cutting down trees in the park.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.040
I really think those were different people.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:19.320
Maybe the utility company, or perhaps even just a local, you know, tree service.

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.080
Uh, that tree might've been rotted, might've been about to fall.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.800
I just don't think this is the guy who cut down.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:31.000
Wilson, I know your hatred for humans runs deep, but you're, you're, you're, you're taking

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.040
it too far, man.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.040
We're, we got a mission to complete here.

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:43.640
We're not saying he don't deserve to die, but Wilson is blinded by rage and brushes

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.440
off the comments.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.320
Go for it, baby.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:50.600
I want to land on his head and peck his eyeballs out.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.240
He's already in the, he's in the, he's in the van.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.000
I swooped through the open window.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:02.040
It wasn't open and you smack into it and you're a killer.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.800
I only have one box check.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.040
Yes.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:05.080
Okay.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.320
Take your second damage, you motherfucker, because you definitely just flew.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.520
Wait, roll intelligence for the sake of playing.

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:15.240
21 on a 20.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.520
He knows what class is now.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.520
21 on a 20.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.040
That makes me so happy.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.080
That is so perfect.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:33.560
You slam into the glass of the animal control van and he looks out and you guys make direct

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.520
eye contact as he's driving away.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:41.000
And let me tell you something Wilson, he looks scared.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:41.480
Good job.

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:46.680
Can I at least crack his window to make his day inconvenient other than his dead friend?

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.440
Other than his partner dying and all the animals is hanging.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.040
His best friend died and he was bad at his job.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.920
The only two things that exist in this man's life.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.560
I'll take it.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.400
Oh, my window's cracked.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.720
This is a bigger inconvenience than my partner.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:04.280
What a day.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.840
But do please roll strength for cracking that window.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.120
44 on a 70.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:11.880
Critically succeeding.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:15.320
Yep.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.040
I'm content.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.480
You crack it so hard that it can't roll down.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.240
You fucking showed him, dude.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.560
Okay, let's get back to the creek, I guess.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.960
As the van speeds away, Tyler's gonna give chase for the tire for a second.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.760
And then when it gets fast enough that he can't keep up, he comes back to join the group.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:43.640
When you join the group, Rusty, Bean, and Murphy all sniff your butt in my group hills.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.080
Oh, thanks.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:46.680
Thanks, fellas.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:51.880
I'm picturing just like a made pole dance of y'all just going around the circle,

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.440
conga line butt sniffing.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:54.840
Oh, yeah.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:00.280
Rusty says to the chipmunk and the woodpecker, you guys want to get in on this?

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:01.720
No.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:07.240
Chip stands back with his arms folded, but a little wry smile goes across his face.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.440
He's like proud of his journey, doesn't he?

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:17.800
I go and perch on the goats and horns and what's up, kid?

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.480
Can this goat be for hand pressure?

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.000
Well, of course.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:36.200
Hey, well, we're attracted to that goat lady.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:41.400
I don't think it's good.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:44.200
We ought to get back to the safety of the creek.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.560
Yeah, Beans, we got you, Beans.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.720
The squirrel, he sent us and we're supposed to bring it back to the creek.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:55.240
This actually, this seemed like a really good just like last shot of y'all celebrating in

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.040
the parking lot.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.200
So I think let's just hang it out there.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.000
Freeze frame.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.840
Freeze frame, credits roll.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:06.360
All right.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.720
I think we should start recording.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.360
Yeah.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.720
Now that we've rehearsed it.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.880
That was a really good dry run.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.120
What are warmups for?

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:22.520
While the credits are rolling, it has a shot of Wilson, the woodpecker, and it says Wilson

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:27.480
found a new favorite tree and never left it because he's deathly afraid that there are

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.760
windows in the sky now.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.600
It's really sad.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.240
He's content.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.600
Are we going back to the creek or is this?

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.360
No, what's your freeze frame, Justin?

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.760
Pass for now.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:41.560
Not an option.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.080
I'll do some minor characters in between your guys's big ones.

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.400
And obviously Murphy will be the last.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.600
Murphy dies immediately.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.040
Yes, be careful, motherfucker.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.440
Oh, right off the bat, we've got the very first one.

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.640
We've got Stallone, the old gray squirrel.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:07.000
And it says Stallone carried his torch well, but not for long as he was gotten on the very

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:13.320
next run, laying down his life for others on a run to get nuts.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.000
It was Stallone, which one?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:15.480
Yep.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.760
See, that's why he was first.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:20.760
He was the squirrel that was the head of the contention Creek critter coalition.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.640
Making way for a new leader.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.160
Just a little foreshadowing.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.120
Chip Montgomery.

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:31.880
Can chip Montgomery be the leader or does his beans going to be a chipmunk?

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:35.560
He talks about how he wanted to be a leader, but people didn't believe in him.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.120
And now he, after the successful mission, he's...

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:38.840
I'm sorry.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.680
You're, you're questioning whether a chipmunk can be a leader after a squirrel.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.720
Well, squirrel is one thing.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.200
Wow.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:46.920
But a chipmunk?

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.200
Thomas, do you have a good one?

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.960
Yeah, Rusty ate chocolate and died.

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.880
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.400
God, who is the next smallest?

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.600
Oh, uh, Common.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:02.200
Common died, uh, on the side of the road, dot, dot, dot.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.360
Or did he?

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.120
You know, something of that nature.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.960
And then, uh, the dead possum picture up on the screen winks at you with a little star

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:12.280
that goes...

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.440
Oh, I'm glad Common's okay.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.120
Even though I hate him and all his family.

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:24.120
Uh, and then RoPo is still just, uh, sitting like the picture of her is sitting on the

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:29.720
desk and then it says, uh, RoPo found out what the black goo was the hard way.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:29.880
No.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:38.120
The freeze frame on Tyler is him kind of veering away from the group.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.520
And, uh, he got distracted and saw a snake in the grass and started following it.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.200
And you guys haven't heard from him since.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:47.800
I don't like that.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.960
Maybe he'll turn up at a dirty dog grooming in the city.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:58.520
There's a picture of Rocky the raccoon, uh, sniffing the butt of Rusty.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:07.560
Rocky made a, made a good friend and then had to tragically watch him die slowly from

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.840
chocolate poisoning.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.040
Did Rocky give it to him?

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:11.560
Oh my God.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.600
Shared it with him unknowing.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.000
I don't think animals know what they can't eat because then they wouldn't eat it.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.120
What is Chip's?

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:26.600
Chip would continue fighting to be the leader of the Contention Creek Critter Coalition

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:31.320
despite his age, but no one would accept him because he's an old fat asshole.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:39.960
And then there's a picture of Murphy and it says Murphy was immediately elected the new

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.280
leader of the Contention.

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.520
Thomas's eyes just lit up so big.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:53.960
The Contention Creek Critter Coalition and remains leader fighting off

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.120
the chipmunk to this day.

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:04.440
That was the end.

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.520
Did you guys like that?

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:13.080
I don't know if we did a good job.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:20.040
I know I did a good job and that's all I care about.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.920
That's the only thing in my control.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.560
I mean, we can talk more later about Thomas's job.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.440
No, it was fun.

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.400
I like you guys.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.360
Yeah, I had fun.

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.360
You're great too, man.

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.560
I'm going to start the recording now.

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:16.040
The only one trying to pull over.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:24.040
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:30.040
With nobody home.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:34.040
Nobody home.

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:38.040
Nobody home.
