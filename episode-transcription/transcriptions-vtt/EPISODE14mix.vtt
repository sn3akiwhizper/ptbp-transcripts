00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
Good morning, y'all.

00:01.600 --> 00:03.480
How are y'all doing out there?

00:03.480 --> 00:06.000
It is December 4th here in contention,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.080
and it's been a jam-packed week here,

00:08.080 --> 00:10.020
so I think it's good to remind y'all

00:10.020 --> 00:12.360
what time it is every now and then.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.760
Speaking of y'all, y'all done wrote me something

00:14.760 --> 00:17.680
to read on the air again against my will.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.520
Here is today's Howlin' with Wolf.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.360
Up.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.180
Ow!

00:23.360 --> 00:27.120
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:27.120 --> 00:27.960
Ah.

00:27.960 --> 00:28.800
Ah.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.640
Ah.

00:29.640 --> 00:30.460
Ah.

00:30.460 --> 00:31.300
Ow.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.120
Ow.

00:32.120 --> 00:32.960
Ow.

00:32.960 --> 00:54.220
Ow.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.120
Are you provides?

00:56.120 --> 00:56.940
Ha ha.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.620
Tess said that all you wolf pups out there

01:01.620 --> 01:04.620
would know what that means.

01:04.620 --> 01:07.640
To some of our Canine listeners, y'all already

01:07.640 --> 01:11.380
know the drill to all other species,

01:11.380 --> 01:14.500
I apologize for that small outburst.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.700
Thanks Tess, for making me lose my shit on air.

01:17.700 --> 01:21.940
Now for some mole shit, it's the news.

01:21.940 --> 01:24.180
Officer Bishop learned that the chief's car

01:24.180 --> 01:26.820
had been at the mill on the other side of the city

01:26.820 --> 01:29.740
since the night of December 1st.

01:29.740 --> 01:32.860
The county coroner reports that during the investigation

01:32.860 --> 01:35.360
of an active crime scene, Officer John Lee

01:35.360 --> 01:37.980
Pettymore of contention slipped and shoved

01:37.980 --> 01:40.060
a possible murder weapon into the eye

01:40.060 --> 01:42.380
socket of the deceased Maggie Cook,

01:42.380 --> 01:44.980
fumbling and digging around atrociously

01:44.980 --> 01:47.400
as the charred bones themselves began

01:47.400 --> 01:51.180
to crumble to no longer be a part of the situation.

01:51.180 --> 01:55.020
Also, anyone out there having some fucked up dreams?

01:55.020 --> 01:57.260
Shit, I know I have.

01:57.260 --> 02:00.900
Last night, I was eating cereal in my basement,

02:00.900 --> 02:04.660
but it wasn't like my basement, but it was.

02:04.660 --> 02:08.900
When I looked down, my spoon was made of wet tuna

02:08.900 --> 02:12.740
and the Count Chocula had turned into forgotten memories.

02:12.740 --> 02:17.740
Then I saw my dog, Wolf, and he had my face on his face.

02:18.740 --> 02:20.940
What the fuck is up with that shit?

02:21.860 --> 02:24.300
Well, you know what they say.

02:27.340 --> 02:30.100
Now I'm gonna need y'all to wave your hands in the air

02:30.100 --> 02:33.420
like you just don't care, because in contention,

02:33.420 --> 02:37.820
nihilism reigns supreme and the points don't matter.

02:37.820 --> 02:40.060
It's kudzu with no backbone.

02:40.060 --> 02:40.900
Ah!

02:47.740 --> 02:48.580
Ah!

02:56.580 --> 02:57.660
Hey guys, howdy.

02:57.660 --> 02:58.500
Ah.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.620
Oh, this is my new character voice.

03:00.620 --> 03:01.900
John's phone rings.

03:02.780 --> 03:06.780
Real quick, roll a constitution check for me.

03:09.980 --> 03:10.920
Pass.

03:10.920 --> 03:11.760
Pass.

03:11.760 --> 03:12.580
Fail.

03:12.580 --> 03:16.140
Okay, so John, you will get one hit point back

03:16.140 --> 03:21.140
and the other two of you will get a D4.

03:21.860 --> 03:24.080
I was gonna say two D6 would be great.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.300
I rolled a three, I get three back.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.480
Good work, Clark.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.460
That brings me almost to perfect health.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.220
One back, I still am 21 out of 25.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.780
I've got 25 out of 26 hit points.

03:36.780 --> 03:38.260
Well, you guys have insane.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.100
What are you at?

03:39.100 --> 03:42.860
I'm 18 of 20, but 20's my max.

03:42.860 --> 03:44.620
My willpower is at two.

03:47.140 --> 03:50.340
Which means I need a little help from my friend.

03:50.340 --> 03:51.740
Your willpower is at two.

03:51.740 --> 03:54.220
You guys put a lot into con.

03:54.220 --> 03:56.820
I went middle of the road, baby, 50.

03:57.940 --> 04:01.060
John, your phone rings as you're getting ready.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.740
It's Keith Vigna.

04:02.740 --> 04:03.660
I don't answer.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.940
Okay.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.320
I send John a text.

04:07.540 --> 04:11.540
Hey dude, can you bring a little bit of stimulants for me?

04:11.540 --> 04:14.740
I'm having a real off day today.

04:14.780 --> 04:17.660
I text him, I have no idea what the fuck

04:17.660 --> 04:20.280
you're talking about and I put the Shrug Guy emoji in there.

04:20.280 --> 04:23.980
I put two snowflakes and a winky face emoji.

04:23.980 --> 04:26.380
I send back all caps,

04:26.380 --> 04:29.020
I don't know what you're talking about, angry face.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.780
I send back, bring me something

04:31.780 --> 04:34.660
where I will explicitly text it to you.

04:34.660 --> 04:35.500
I don't reply.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.700
God dammit.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.140
Okay, I drive to John's house then.

04:39.140 --> 04:40.700
Oh, oh god.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.540
Damn, I'm already on the way to work.

04:43.020 --> 04:46.340
I mean, you can resolve it if you want.

04:46.340 --> 04:47.500
What's the timeline?

04:47.500 --> 04:49.220
Does he come to my house or?

04:49.220 --> 04:51.020
Keith, do you leave early enough to like?

04:51.020 --> 04:51.860
Yeah, I do.

04:51.860 --> 04:53.740
I get up and I put my clothes on

04:53.740 --> 04:56.880
and I drive out there and I'm pissed.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.060
I just woke up mad.

04:58.060 --> 05:00.860
Okay, I'm gonna have you roll luck at a negative 20

05:00.860 --> 05:03.140
to see if John is still there.

05:03.140 --> 05:03.980
He's not.

05:05.060 --> 05:07.240
I'm gonna break into his house though.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.080
It.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.680
I'm desperate.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.780
So instead of getting some five hour energy.

05:16.780 --> 05:17.620
That's not gonna.

05:17.620 --> 05:20.200
You're gonna break into your coworker's house

05:20.200 --> 05:22.200
and steal cocaine.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.720
Yeah, because that's my only option right now.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.200
He told me that that's.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.400
I did not say that cocaine was your only option.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.240
Yeah, but you said coffee wouldn't work, so I assumed.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.760
Just jump all the way to cocaine.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.240
It's literally like the most readily available option

05:39.240 --> 05:40.180
we have here.

05:40.180 --> 05:42.760
I thought this was gonna be a quick one and done.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.640
That's why you're all in the room right now.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.000
Okay, I get to his house and he's not there, I guess.

05:51.000 --> 05:51.820
Yep.

05:51.820 --> 05:52.660
Okay.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.920
Definitely break in if you wanna like

05:56.400 --> 05:58.040
really upset John later.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.560
Yeah, I mean, I'm already upset.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.200
So yeah, I'm fighting mad.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.580
So I.

06:02.580 --> 06:05.220
Because John, do you wanna describe your house?

06:05.960 --> 06:07.320
It's the first time we've seen it.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.960
Yeah, so it's a nice.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.400
Poopy trap till I get it home alone.

06:11.400 --> 06:15.280
I slip on some marbles and fall down the stairs.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.120
It's a nice little property north of town.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.600
You come down like a quarter mile

06:19.600 --> 06:21.480
of secluded gravel driveway

06:21.480 --> 06:23.840
and you come into this little clearing

06:23.840 --> 06:26.460
and there's a nice fucking, you know, older

06:26.460 --> 06:29.000
but single story smallish home.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.280
There are some, like there's a random truck

06:32.280 --> 06:35.440
and a trailer around, you know.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.320
And it really looks just peaceful and beautiful

06:40.320 --> 06:43.120
and there's like rabbits and deers jumping around and shit

06:43.120 --> 06:46.840
and you're about to, you know, disturb that harmony, so.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.560
So I pull up and I have lock picking

06:49.560 --> 06:51.400
so I'm gonna try to do that first.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.540
Is that cool?

06:53.540 --> 06:55.180
At his front door?

06:55.180 --> 06:56.020
Yes.

06:56.020 --> 06:56.840
Okay.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.840
With a minus 20, that's a pass.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.680
Okay.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.900
26 on a 30, which I have 50, so.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.120
Sounds good.

07:05.680 --> 07:10.680
And then like struggling, just like get out of your car,

07:11.000 --> 07:12.880
get up there and start work.

07:12.880 --> 07:13.720
Just sweating.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.360
Yeah, just work your way into the house.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.000
I go inside and I look around for wherever it would be.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.180
Okay, roll a search for me.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.280
It's a crit fail.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.920
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.640
John, what does he find?

07:32.640 --> 07:37.640
He knocks over all my Smokey and the Bandit DVDs.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.200
Ooh, doggy.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.560
And almost tips over like the Dukes of Hazzard DVDs

07:42.560 --> 07:44.220
right next to him.

07:44.220 --> 07:47.460
Oh wait, hold up, Smokey and the Bandit is not a TV show,

07:47.460 --> 07:48.300
it's a movie.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.160
You had a bunch of copies of it.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.560
Special edition.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.380
Yeah, so every director's cut, yeah.

07:55.380 --> 07:57.100
International releases.

07:58.820 --> 08:01.440
And anything remotely related to the Smokeyverse.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.920
Okay, well, I'm not leaving until I get what I need,

08:04.920 --> 08:08.040
so I'll just go from room to room,

08:08.040 --> 08:11.500
searching violently through everything till I find it.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.660
Okay, is that how a crit fail search role works?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.120
Yeah.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.980
You violently turn over the house of John Lee Pettymore,

08:18.980 --> 08:21.520
unable to find the cocaine that you know

08:21.520 --> 08:23.700
is on the premises somewhere.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.360
Wow, so this is what you want,

08:26.360 --> 08:28.800
just our characters to get in an actual fight.

08:28.800 --> 08:33.120
I mean, I'd be, I'm already pretty useless as a cop,

08:33.120 --> 08:36.080
I literally could not do our job today without this.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.520
So I don't find anything? Nope.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.920
I text him one more time, I'm like,

08:42.920 --> 08:45.280
dude, tell me where it is.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.980
Tell you where what is, why, what are you talking about,

08:48.980 --> 08:51.600
I've got, I brought some stuff for you,

08:51.600 --> 08:52.800
it's at the station.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.320
Oh, cool, thanks, see you there.

08:55.320 --> 09:00.320
I try to put the DVDs back a little bit,

09:01.320 --> 09:03.320
but then I just go, I give up and go to my car,

09:03.320 --> 09:04.680
drive back to the station.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.520
Okay.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.920
I didn't want to do any of that.

09:08.920 --> 09:09.920
You didn't?

09:09.920 --> 09:11.680
No, but I had to.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.200
I don't know if you know what those words mean.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.680
All right, well, the three of you arrive

09:17.680 --> 09:19.760
at the police station, rearing to go

09:19.760 --> 09:24.760
on the morning of December 4th, you arrive at 9 a.m.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.340
I sit at my desk and just put my head down.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.360
Okay, you know that the FBI will be here in an hour

09:32.360 --> 09:36.900
to meet with you, and as you are milling about the office,

09:36.900 --> 09:39.480
as the day is beginning, you hear a news story

09:39.480 --> 09:43.600
come over Drew's speakers at his desk,

09:43.600 --> 09:45.640
and you hear the news story say,

09:45.640 --> 09:49.280
10 people have died in a brutal fire at the city hospital.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.640
46 more are in critical condition.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.640
The fire started early this morning,

09:53.640 --> 09:55.780
and the building has just now been cleared

09:55.780 --> 09:57.880
after hours of fighting back the fire

09:57.880 --> 10:01.900
and sweeping the premises for survivors after the evacuation.

10:01.900 --> 10:05.040
We do not have any word yet on how the fire started,

10:05.040 --> 10:06.520
but we will deliver updates

10:06.520 --> 10:08.640
as they roll in here to the studio.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.840
Hold your loved ones close today

10:10.840 --> 10:12.520
as we send thoughts and prayers

10:12.520 --> 10:14.640
to those who lost friends and family.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.340
Stick around for our next segment,

10:16.340 --> 10:18.900
experts say we're all showering too much.

10:18.900 --> 10:21.560
With your morning update, I'm Yolanda Squat Pump.

10:21.560 --> 10:26.560
And immediately following, Drew turns it down

10:26.840 --> 10:30.120
to let you guys know that two children

10:30.120 --> 10:32.840
were reported missing late last night

10:32.840 --> 10:34.360
from a home in the suburbs.

10:34.360 --> 10:37.480
Their names are Aiden and Alice Little.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.760
Repeat those names, Drew.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.680
Aiden and Alice Little.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.620
Okay, we'll get right on that.

10:43.620 --> 10:46.020
Okay, good, their parents are very worried.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.640
I can only imagine.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.740
I can only imagine.

10:49.740 --> 10:50.920
Wait, where was that fire at?

10:50.920 --> 10:51.940
I missed the first part.

10:51.940 --> 10:52.960
The hospital.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.800
Oh yeah.

10:53.800 --> 10:54.620
The city hospital.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.340
All right, what do you guys wanna do around the office?

10:56.340 --> 10:57.180
I don't know.

10:57.180 --> 10:59.040
I bet we have a lot of paperwork to do.

11:00.020 --> 11:00.860
I bet you do.

11:00.860 --> 11:01.700
Is there anything that you want to-

11:01.700 --> 11:03.420
Good thing the chief's not here.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.780
Is there anything you wanna take care of?

11:06.780 --> 11:08.060
Oh, the chief's dead.

11:08.060 --> 11:08.900
We should-

11:08.900 --> 11:09.720
Yeah.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.460
I didn't even, it's a new face.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.460
Good thing the chief's not here.

11:16.460 --> 11:18.140
Ugh, rip.

11:18.140 --> 11:18.980
Hey, John.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.940
Good thing the chief's not here.

11:20.940 --> 11:22.180
John.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.020
Yeah, Vigna.

11:23.020 --> 11:27.080
Dude, can I, did you bring me any medicine?

11:27.080 --> 11:29.020
Yeah, hey, you're smart enough to know

11:29.020 --> 11:32.300
not to be texting about that shit on the open lines.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.300
I just-

11:33.300 --> 11:35.300
All right, I have some for you,

11:35.300 --> 11:37.420
and I dangle a little baggy,

11:37.420 --> 11:40.480
but I'm gonna need you to clean out

11:40.480 --> 11:41.860
the cat man's cage first,

11:41.860 --> 11:46.680
because he left a number of human-sized dudes in the corner,

11:46.680 --> 11:48.140
and I'm not touching that.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.140
Okay.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.980
I'll get right on it.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.500
Do you want a little bump first to help on these?

11:56.500 --> 11:57.580
Okay.

11:57.580 --> 11:58.700
I take a bump.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.140
Roll a D6 for me.

12:01.380 --> 12:02.200
Three.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.100
All right, it is 9 a.m. currently,

12:04.100 --> 12:04.940
and you are gonna-

12:04.940 --> 12:07.300
So for the next 45 minutes, he'll have three.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.440
For three hours, is that right?

12:10.440 --> 12:14.100
For three hours, you will not be at a negative 20%.

12:14.100 --> 12:14.940
Hell yeah.

12:14.940 --> 12:16.860
Have the makers of this game ever done cocaine?

12:17.740 --> 12:18.660
Yeah.

12:18.660 --> 12:20.700
Yeah, you just roll a D6.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.060
That's how it works.

12:22.060 --> 12:23.580
Dictates the hype.

12:23.580 --> 12:27.800
I happily go clean the shit out of the cell.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.380
You missed a spot.

12:31.380 --> 12:32.220
Is that true?

12:34.100 --> 12:37.380
Dr. Jacobs says as you clean the cell

12:37.380 --> 12:39.260
that she shares with her-

12:39.260 --> 12:43.340
Hey, what charges are we holding her on again?

12:43.340 --> 12:44.860
How long can we keep her here?

12:44.860 --> 12:46.180
We looked it up at the time.

12:46.340 --> 12:48.980
I think 24 hours, maybe 48.

12:48.980 --> 12:52.820
It's because we wanted to investigate her.

12:52.820 --> 12:53.660
Yeah, exactly.

12:53.660 --> 12:55.340
And you know what, everything's in disarray.

12:55.340 --> 12:56.740
Our chief is dead.

12:56.740 --> 12:57.580
Oh, you know-

12:57.580 --> 12:58.420
Our chief is dead.

12:58.420 --> 12:59.240
And-

12:59.240 --> 13:00.080
We got the FBI coming.

13:00.080 --> 13:00.920
Is that what you're getting at

13:00.920 --> 13:02.760
when they shouldn't have a Catboy in there?

13:02.760 --> 13:04.780
No, if anything, I think that helps us.

13:04.780 --> 13:08.180
That anything that can confuse and distract the FBI.

13:08.180 --> 13:10.580
I'm just thinking further on down the road

13:10.580 --> 13:14.500
when she brings a civil rights lawsuit against us.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.340
Sure.

13:15.340 --> 13:17.060
We'll call some imprisonment or whatever.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.840
I think we're still within our rights for today.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.500
Oh, that's what we'll tell the FBI.

13:22.860 --> 13:24.520
Cool.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.180
Before you ask, we're well within our rights today.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.900
I cleaned the spot that I messed up

13:29.900 --> 13:33.000
and I said, I would even eat off this floor,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.120
but I'm not hungry.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.220
Thanks for the input, Keith.

13:37.220 --> 13:38.460
And then I come back up to John,

13:38.460 --> 13:39.980
I'm like, can I please have that?

13:39.980 --> 13:41.340
Yeah, I give him the baggie.

13:41.340 --> 13:44.100
I stick it in my pocket and then I'm ready

13:44.100 --> 13:45.180
to talk to these feds.

13:46.140 --> 13:49.380
Fellas, we should maybe talk about our story here.

13:49.380 --> 13:52.100
Do we want to tell them everything?

13:52.100 --> 13:52.940
Tell them nothing?

13:52.940 --> 13:57.060
No, I was thinking they're getting here in what, an hour?

13:57.060 --> 13:59.340
I'll just roll out, I'll go get some,

13:59.340 --> 14:01.300
you guys want me to pick you up some breakfast or something?

14:01.300 --> 14:02.140
Have you guys eaten yet?

14:02.140 --> 14:03.000
Oh yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.440
I go grab some food for us,

14:05.440 --> 14:08.040
get back like right as they're getting here

14:08.040 --> 14:11.540
and then act like, hey, I got our breakfast.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.540
Also, anybody recognize this?

14:13.540 --> 14:14.540
I don't know where it came from.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.100
I found it in the trunk of my car.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.060
That's the plan.

14:17.060 --> 14:17.880
I like it.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.060
And then I'll somehow remember that it's from John's house.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.620
So when they were talking to me last night,

14:22.620 --> 14:24.320
they seem to know a lot about a lot of stuff.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.100
So if they start asking us about stuff,

14:26.100 --> 14:27.620
are we gonna lie to them or?

14:27.620 --> 14:28.540
I'm playing dumb.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.120
I don't think we should let them know more than,

14:32.120 --> 14:34.420
we're already giving them the one thing they wanted.

14:34.420 --> 14:35.780
But what if they can help us?

14:35.780 --> 14:38.180
Well, let's see how they, let's see how they,

14:38.180 --> 14:39.020
let's read them.

14:39.020 --> 14:39.860
Exactly.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.300
Is that a skill?

14:41.300 --> 14:42.540
Humant.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.140
I got 80 humant, so.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.800
And now I'm not at a negative 20.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.100
So hell yeah.

14:48.100 --> 14:51.260
Keith Vigna is fully aware of how much people despise him.

14:51.260 --> 14:52.100
Yeah.

14:55.540 --> 14:57.560
Also, John.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.740
Yeah.

14:58.740 --> 15:02.900
Later tonight, we'll have to have a personal talk.

15:02.900 --> 15:03.740
What about?

15:03.740 --> 15:07.740
In which I profusely apologize for what I did this morning.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.540
Don't, we'll talk about it after the FBI.

15:09.540 --> 15:10.420
I don't wanna worry you.

15:10.420 --> 15:13.700
You don't have to apologize that much for those texts, man.

15:13.740 --> 15:14.580
Okay, yeah.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.420
Well, that makes me feel better.

15:15.420 --> 15:16.580
I just wanted to.

15:16.580 --> 15:17.420
Yeah, it's.

15:17.420 --> 15:18.240
Yeah.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.080
Okay, well.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.140
Just try to maintain, you know,

15:20.140 --> 15:21.940
discipline when texting about drugs.

15:21.940 --> 15:23.940
Like, absolutely heard from now on.

15:23.940 --> 15:24.980
Yeah.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.920
What do you guys want for breakfast?

15:26.920 --> 15:29.660
I want a supersonic breakfast burrito.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.220
Okay.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.020
Don't we, what's the local,

15:33.020 --> 15:34.380
did we make a breakfast place?

15:34.380 --> 15:35.420
Beans on Beans.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.340
Yeah, let's go to Beans on Beans.

15:37.340 --> 15:38.900
Because it's Bean Street, right?

15:38.900 --> 15:39.900
Mm-hmm.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.860
Yeah, I'm gonna head over to Beans on Beans.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.800
Let me get that Big Bean special.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.060
The Big Bean special?

15:46.060 --> 15:47.940
You want the Big Bean Sonic burrito

15:47.940 --> 15:50.260
that they import from the City Sonic?

15:50.260 --> 15:52.740
I mean, Sonic's right around the corner.

15:52.740 --> 15:53.940
If you could just stop at Sonic.

15:53.940 --> 15:54.780
I'll swing by there.

15:54.780 --> 15:55.600
That'd be great.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.820
That'll kill me some time.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.820
So you want the Big Bean breakfast?

15:58.820 --> 15:59.660
Yeah.

15:59.660 --> 16:00.980
Do you want, what kinda,

16:00.980 --> 16:02.240
you want black or pinto?

16:04.160 --> 16:05.000
Black eyed.

16:05.000 --> 16:05.820
Black eyed?

16:05.820 --> 16:06.660
Yeah.

16:06.660 --> 16:07.500
Okay, extra bacon?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.320
Extra bacon.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.160
I know you.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.900
One piece soggy and one piece crispy.

16:10.900 --> 16:11.740
Okay, I can do that.

16:11.740 --> 16:12.580
Just tell them it's Clark's.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.400
Order them now.

16:13.400 --> 16:17.460
Oh, the Beans, Bishop's Beans breakfast.

16:17.460 --> 16:18.300
That's it.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.120
Gotcha.

16:19.120 --> 16:19.960
Bishop's Beans breakfast.

16:19.960 --> 16:20.920
They told me they were gonna add it

16:20.920 --> 16:22.180
to the menu at some point.

16:22.180 --> 16:23.020
I think it might be.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.580
I haven't been there in a minute, so I'll check it out.

16:24.580 --> 16:25.420
Okay, cool.

16:25.420 --> 16:26.980
Clark, frankly, I find it disgusting,

16:26.980 --> 16:30.340
and I'm not in a habit to comment on a man's breakfast,

16:30.340 --> 16:33.220
but I find it disgusting that you let them

16:33.220 --> 16:36.060
dangle one strip of bacon in the bean water

16:36.060 --> 16:37.060
and leave the other strip.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.020
Have you tried it?

16:39.000 --> 16:39.840
No.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.900
It's so good, buddy.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.740
Haven't tried it.

16:41.740 --> 16:42.740
All right, fuck it.

16:42.740 --> 16:43.980
Screw it, make it two.

16:43.980 --> 16:45.420
Two, okay, well.

16:45.420 --> 16:46.840
I'll try it.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.260
I'll be back in about,

16:49.260 --> 16:51.060
let me know when they get here,

16:51.060 --> 16:51.940
and then I'll be back then.

16:51.940 --> 16:53.580
Just, they're getting here in an hour.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.100
When you see their car pull in.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.720
Heard, okay.

16:56.720 --> 17:01.100
Keith, how do you feel about the street name Beans,

17:01.100 --> 17:02.700
Beans on Beans?

17:02.700 --> 17:05.460
I really try not to think about it too much.

17:05.460 --> 17:06.900
You don't associate the two?

17:06.900 --> 17:09.140
I do, but it makes me kinda sick of my stomach

17:09.140 --> 17:09.960
the more I think about it,

17:09.960 --> 17:11.680
so I don't wanna think about it.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.520
Fair enough.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.340
Why?

17:15.400 --> 17:19.860
Keith's actual last name is Beans.

17:19.860 --> 17:24.380
I forgot all about that, Beans.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.320
I changed my name to avoid embarrassment

17:28.320 --> 17:30.520
when I came back to town.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.200
No offense to anyone named Vigna,

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
but kinda picked a dumb name.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.960
I mean, Beans is a dumb name, but.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.000
I think we're gonna.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.200
Has that come out in character?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.340
Well, I think you did mention something about.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.840
Did you tell it to us, or just the?

17:41.840 --> 17:42.680
I can't remember.

17:42.680 --> 17:43.520
Yeah, it might have been out of character.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.000
It was his dog.

17:45.000 --> 17:45.840
His dog's name is Beans.

17:45.840 --> 17:46.920
His dog's name is Bean.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.300
Yeah.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.300
That's weird if you're trying to escape it.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.320
Yep.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.640
I like to think that the dog has been around.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.260
Before I was Keith Vigna.

17:57.360 --> 18:02.360
Okay, so I go to my namesake street and breakfast joint.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.200
It's technically your ancestor's namesake.

18:06.200 --> 18:10.440
Okay, and the two of you are hanging around the office

18:10.440 --> 18:12.020
waiting for the FBI.

18:12.020 --> 18:15.400
Yeah, I actually, I need to talk to Drew for a minute.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.240
Okay.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.480
Hey, Drew, can I talk to you for a minute?

18:26.480 --> 18:27.840
Yeah, sure.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.440
Hey, so what time did Clark come by the station last night?

18:31.440 --> 18:33.680
It was like 1 a.m.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.840
That is about when we were meeting

18:38.840 --> 18:41.400
with the people next door, right?

18:41.400 --> 18:42.320
Yes.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.320
Well, see, that's pretty strange, Drew,

18:44.320 --> 18:47.120
because I was with Clark at 1 a.m.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.760
Did you notice anything, besides the limp,

18:48.760 --> 18:50.120
did you notice anything funny about him?

18:50.120 --> 18:52.840
I mean, he looks kind of messed up,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.800
like he'd been through some shit.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.320
His uniform and everything seemed right.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.120
Well, he wasn't wearing his uniform.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.280
He had just come in earlier to change

19:02.400 --> 19:03.800
into civilian clothes.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.600
I guess he changed again into some other civilian clothes,

19:06.600 --> 19:09.200
but yeah, no, he looked kind of messed up,

19:09.200 --> 19:11.640
but he was wearing normal clothes.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.840
And he warned you not to go to the Chief's house,

19:13.840 --> 19:16.220
and this was before or after you were contacted

19:16.220 --> 19:17.240
by the reporter?

19:18.320 --> 19:20.000
This was before.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.160
Jesus.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.100
Okay, all right.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.500
So from now on?

19:26.500 --> 19:27.340
Yeah.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.000
If you see one of us without any of the other of us,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.240
that makes any sense?

19:32.240 --> 19:33.520
Sure.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.480
If I see any of you individually.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.320
Yeah.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.480
Just keep an eye out, because maybe it's not us.

19:39.480 --> 19:42.640
What, what do you mean?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.220
I don't rightly know,

19:44.220 --> 19:46.980
but you know how we got that cat man in there?

19:46.980 --> 19:47.820
Yeah.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.660
Because he got Freaky Fried Ed with his cat?

19:49.660 --> 19:53.400
Yeah, you guys keep saying that, but what do you mean?

19:53.400 --> 19:54.560
What?

19:54.560 --> 19:56.820
I mean, I get it that he wants to be a cat,

19:56.820 --> 19:58.880
and he thinks he's a cat and stuff, but like-

19:58.920 --> 20:01.400
Oh, shit, have we not put you in on this loop?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.340
Maybe this is a bigger conversation.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.000
Honestly, I'd like, yeah.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.360
Once Clark gets out of the bathroom,

20:07.360 --> 20:08.560
I think he should know about this too,

20:08.560 --> 20:10.640
but I just wanted to go over it real quick.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.400
Oh, yeah, well, while we're here,

20:14.280 --> 20:16.880
you guys moved all the cocaine?

20:16.880 --> 20:17.720
Oh, yeah.

20:17.720 --> 20:18.980
Oh, shit, did we not tell?

20:18.980 --> 20:21.760
Also, the FBI is gonna be here in about 20 minutes.

20:21.760 --> 20:22.720
What?

20:22.720 --> 20:24.640
Yeah, so we had to get the coke out of here.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.240
Okay, yeah, good thinking.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.440
It's all on my property.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.360
Oh, that's amazing.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.440
That's even better than it being here.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.660
Yeah, oh, yeah, it's buried in a secure vault.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.440
Perfect.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.280
Okay.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.920
Hey, that cake is safe, buddy.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.920
Oh, yeah, it autocorrect messed up this morning.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.880
Oh, I thought you were just being discreet, unlike Vigna.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.700
What?

20:47.700 --> 20:49.320
Oh, Vigna was texting me for some coke

20:49.320 --> 20:51.200
because he knew it was at my house.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.060
He's very tired and an idiot.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.000
He is certainly that.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.880
But hey, you know what, from now on,

20:58.160 --> 21:00.920
why don't you call it cake or just anything besides coke

21:00.920 --> 21:01.760
if we're texting?

21:01.760 --> 21:02.600
I really like that.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.880
We'll call it cake.

21:03.880 --> 21:07.080
You know, I don't know how well that's gonna stand up

21:07.080 --> 21:08.280
in a court of law, you know,

21:08.280 --> 21:09.600
if they were viewing those texts.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.100
Like, I think that's kind of one-to-one,

21:11.100 --> 21:13.000
so we might wanna circle back and think of some.

21:13.000 --> 21:13.920
But for right now...

21:13.920 --> 21:16.600
If we're talking about kilograms of cake.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.240
Yeah, that's gonna tip him off.

21:19.920 --> 21:20.760
Man, this is a lot.

21:20.760 --> 21:23.700
Honestly, I am in this.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.700
I'm like, let's make some money,

21:25.740 --> 21:28.460
but goddamn, this is a lot on top of all this

21:28.460 --> 21:32.200
goo monster nonsense and the chief dyin'

21:32.200 --> 21:35.840
and all the other things we haven't followed up on.

21:35.840 --> 21:36.840
I'm gonna miss her.

21:38.220 --> 21:39.800
Yeah.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.860
Yeah, me too, buddy.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.900
Clark comes back from the bathroom

21:50.900 --> 21:55.060
and Drew and John Lee Pettymore are at Drew's desk talking.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.500
Hey, Clark, could you come here a minute?

21:57.500 --> 21:58.820
Yeah, what's up?

21:58.820 --> 22:01.320
Hey, so I got a text from Drew this morning.

22:02.600 --> 22:06.740
It seems while you and I were at the donut shop,

22:06.740 --> 22:10.940
another you was at the station talking to Drew here.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.520
What do you mean another me?

22:13.520 --> 22:14.980
You heard that right.

22:14.980 --> 22:16.300
Another you.

22:18.220 --> 22:20.920
Like, somebody who said they were me?

22:20.920 --> 22:24.380
No, so I saw you...

22:25.380 --> 22:29.940
You came to the station last night at 1 a.m.

22:29.940 --> 22:34.300
and you told me not to go to the chief's house.

22:34.300 --> 22:36.120
And you were limpin'.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.880
I'm really sorry that I went.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.820
Now, I wish I would've listened to you,

22:43.820 --> 22:46.060
but was that not you?

22:46.060 --> 22:48.140
I mean, you must've been confused.

22:48.140 --> 22:51.600
It was somebody that, it looked like me, maybe.

22:53.020 --> 22:54.100
He said he was you.

22:55.100 --> 22:58.380
Well, Drew, I was up at the donut the whole last night.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.420
That was one o'clock, wasn't it, wasn't it, John?

23:00.420 --> 23:01.260
Oh, yeah. We were there.

23:01.260 --> 23:03.620
I was with, that's why I brought you in.

23:03.620 --> 23:04.780
That's why I'm telling him, Drew,

23:04.780 --> 23:06.260
because I was with the man.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.580
So you must be mistaken.

23:07.580 --> 23:08.500
It wasn't me.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.980
Drew rolls a sanity test.

23:10.980 --> 23:11.820
All right.

23:11.820 --> 23:13.660
Nah, I don't...

23:13.660 --> 23:14.500
Should we roll it?

23:14.500 --> 23:15.860
Yeah, what's Drew's sanity?

23:15.860 --> 23:16.820
He crit fails.

23:16.820 --> 23:19.300
He's dead. Drew explodes.

23:19.300 --> 23:21.380
Drew has a 100 power.

23:21.380 --> 23:22.580
No.

23:22.580 --> 23:23.900
I can see it.

23:24.540 --> 23:25.700
It's like Kenneth from 30 Rock.

23:25.700 --> 23:26.780
Yeah, exactly.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.220
He rolls an i8.

23:28.220 --> 23:29.060
Wow.

23:29.060 --> 23:30.100
So he's sane as hell.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.420
My boy's sane as hell.

23:31.420 --> 23:32.260
Don't be telling him

23:32.260 --> 23:33.940
that he's not seeing what he sees.

23:33.940 --> 23:34.780
Clark.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.100
Yeah, for the sake of the argument,

23:36.100 --> 23:37.420
what else do I say?

23:37.420 --> 23:39.500
You just came in, you were limping,

23:39.500 --> 23:42.020
you were acting really weird, and you...

23:42.020 --> 23:42.860
Acting weird how?

23:42.860 --> 23:44.020
Was I mumbling?

23:44.020 --> 23:45.140
Was I falling over?

23:45.140 --> 23:47.940
You were kinda talking to yourself as you came in,

23:47.940 --> 23:50.220
and you were wearing different clothes

23:50.220 --> 23:53.460
than you were when you left with your CVs on,

23:53.460 --> 23:56.380
and you were wearing normal clothes,

23:56.380 --> 23:57.940
but you came in, you were limping,

23:57.940 --> 23:59.340
you looked really haggard,

23:59.340 --> 24:01.780
and you'd been through some stuff,

24:01.780 --> 24:05.660
and you exasperatedly told me

24:05.660 --> 24:08.020
not to go to the chief's house,

24:08.020 --> 24:10.140
and I asked you why,

24:10.140 --> 24:12.260
and then you were mumbling something,

24:12.260 --> 24:15.300
and you walked away, and you just left.

24:15.300 --> 24:18.780
And I was busy here, so I didn't worry about it.

24:18.780 --> 24:21.020
I figured I wouldn't go to the chief's house.

24:21.100 --> 24:23.620
I didn't understand why you didn't want me to go there,

24:23.620 --> 24:28.500
but later when Mr. Dorsey came by,

24:28.500 --> 24:32.180
when Harold stopped by and he wanted to go there,

24:32.180 --> 24:34.460
he wasn't gonna take no for an answer,

24:34.460 --> 24:35.620
and so I...

24:38.260 --> 24:40.100
I went with him, I wanted to let him,

24:40.100 --> 24:42.580
I didn't wanna just give him the chief's keys,

24:42.580 --> 24:43.900
but he wasn't gonna leave,

24:43.900 --> 24:45.740
and I was just trying to be nice.

24:45.740 --> 24:46.660
Drew, you did good.

24:46.660 --> 24:48.620
You did good there, don't worry about that.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.180
Did you, I walked out the door,

24:51.180 --> 24:53.740
but did you see if I got in a car and left, or?

24:53.740 --> 24:55.060
I just stayed inside.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.220
How about we check the tapes?

24:56.220 --> 24:58.400
Can I see myself walking in, maybe?

24:59.300 --> 25:01.620
That's a great idea. That's a great idea.

25:01.620 --> 25:03.100
Forgot we had the...

25:04.340 --> 25:08.460
Okay, so you guys go over to the security tapes,

25:08.460 --> 25:10.860
and as you are watching them,

25:10.860 --> 25:14.220
you see a figure limping,

25:14.220 --> 25:19.220
wearing a hoodie and jeans,

25:19.260 --> 25:22.380
limping their way into the police station

25:22.380 --> 25:24.220
just from around the corner on foot,

25:24.220 --> 25:27.460
then not even a minute later,

25:27.460 --> 25:31.300
the same figure leaves around the same corner on foot.

25:31.300 --> 25:34.380
We've probably got cameras inside the station, right?

25:34.380 --> 25:36.660
Real world, probably, a police station would.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.940
They would have cameras inside, yeah, sure.

25:38.940 --> 25:40.840
Yeah, you got cameras inside.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.700
Let's check that tape next.

25:42.700 --> 25:46.340
Okay, so then you would see Clark Bishop

25:46.340 --> 25:50.300
walk in to limp into the police station,

25:50.300 --> 25:52.920
wearing the same clothes you saw the figure wearing outside,

25:52.920 --> 25:54.860
say something to Drew,

25:54.860 --> 25:56.580
Drew doesn't get up from his desk,

25:56.580 --> 25:58.580
and then Clark leaves.

25:58.580 --> 26:01.200
If you could both roll me a sanity check.

26:03.180 --> 26:04.220
Fail.

26:04.220 --> 26:06.840
I crit pass with an 11.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.900
Okay, that is not you.

26:08.900 --> 26:09.980
No way.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.140
Not a chance that that's you.

26:12.580 --> 26:13.420
Fail.

26:13.420 --> 26:15.060
Would a crit pass?

26:15.060 --> 26:15.900
I don't know.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.860
Shouldn't he be like, that's me and I know it.

26:18.860 --> 26:20.280
That's me and I know it.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.240
That's an interesting perspective.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.500
From my point of view,

26:23.500 --> 26:25.920
the reason that I said there's no way that's used

26:25.920 --> 26:28.080
normally when we do sanity loss,

26:28.080 --> 26:30.340
the losing of a sanity.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.820
Is from seeing the unnatural.

26:31.820 --> 26:33.020
Yeah, so.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.660
If I saw this and didn't lose sanity,

26:34.660 --> 26:36.140
it probably didn't seem unnatural to me.

26:36.140 --> 26:37.980
Exactly, yeah, if you lose no sanity,

26:37.980 --> 26:41.760
you would deny its existence as being unnatural,

26:42.280 --> 26:44.240
whereas you are wholly convinced

26:44.240 --> 26:47.340
that that is Clark Bishop and you lose a D4 of sanity.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.660
What do you think about, I mean.

26:48.660 --> 26:49.920
That's in line with how we've been playing.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.040
There was that guy who called me

26:51.040 --> 26:54.100
and told me that the body was older on the inside

26:54.100 --> 26:55.180
than it was on the outside,

26:55.180 --> 26:57.440
and I crit passed a sanity check on that,

26:57.440 --> 27:00.240
and so I just chalked it up to bad test results.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.600
Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.280
It just seems like it's a little,

27:04.280 --> 27:08.680
you wanna maintain your sanity for game reasons, right?

27:08.680 --> 27:09.560
And then.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.520
You wanna push the plot forward.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.480
And understand more by passing rules,

27:15.480 --> 27:19.140
but I actually like the discord between the two,

27:19.140 --> 27:24.060
where not losing the sanity is good mechanically,

27:24.060 --> 27:26.960
but not understanding the truth

27:26.960 --> 27:30.720
is also technically good for your character,

27:30.720 --> 27:34.920
even though we all know that learning more

27:34.920 --> 27:38.200
about the unnatural causes the game to move forward.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.040
Does that make sense?

27:39.040 --> 27:40.440
But learning more about the unnatural

27:40.440 --> 27:43.160
causes you to lose sanity, yeah.

27:44.040 --> 27:44.880
One.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.120
All right, so you only lose one?

27:46.120 --> 27:48.640
You could also say, I know it's not me

27:48.640 --> 27:51.440
in a more literal sense that I'm like so,

27:51.440 --> 27:53.880
there's some tell that I'm so sure

27:53.880 --> 27:56.320
that that's an imposter or something like that.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.680
What do you think that would be?

27:57.680 --> 28:00.720
I don't mumble, but I do mumble a lot.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.480
You don't have a limp?

28:02.480 --> 28:03.880
Yeah, right.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.000
You don't own a hoodie?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.920
Obviously it's not me, because I ain't limping.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.720
Well, I think you're arguing past each other.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.840
I'm not suggesting it is you, Clark,

28:11.840 --> 28:15.320
but that's someone with your face.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.720
Can I tell from the tape maybe what gave me my limp?

28:17.720 --> 28:19.080
Are the pants ripped or any blood,

28:19.080 --> 28:20.760
anything on them or anything?

28:20.760 --> 28:21.600
Nope.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.940
Maybe this is asking too much,

28:22.940 --> 28:26.760
but given that this has been three or four days

28:26.760 --> 28:31.600
of game time and this has been four months of game play,

28:31.600 --> 28:35.020
have we in the past week encountered anybody limping

28:36.020 --> 28:37.360
or heard about anybody?

28:37.360 --> 28:38.200
Just Keith.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.240
What the fuck?

28:42.240 --> 28:43.080
Yeah.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.680
John and Clark slowly look at each other,

28:47.680 --> 28:50.780
realization passing between their eyes.

28:50.780 --> 28:51.620
It's fucking Keith.

28:51.620 --> 28:52.460
It's Keith.

28:52.460 --> 28:53.280
He's a shapeshifter.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.960
I'm a face taker.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.400
Drew is looking at you.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.860
Guys, I'm really scared.

29:00.860 --> 29:03.960
I tell Drew, I put a hand on his shoulder

29:03.960 --> 29:07.280
and I say, Drew, all I can tell you is that that wasn't me,

29:07.280 --> 29:08.460
but maybe from here on out,

29:08.460 --> 29:11.520
if you are talking to one of us, you might text us also.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.440
I told him the same thing.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.620
Yeah, that way we can be sure.

29:15.620 --> 29:18.320
That way we'll know where you are?

29:18.320 --> 29:20.960
Yeah, if it's not me, I'll text you back.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.960
I'm not at the station, for example,

29:22.960 --> 29:25.760
and then you should grab that person in front of you

29:25.760 --> 29:26.720
and hold them.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.560
Okay.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.480
Unless somehow the imposter gets a hold

29:30.480 --> 29:34.280
of one of our cell phones and knows about this arrangement

29:34.280 --> 29:36.860
and then orchestrates a double switch.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.000
That's unlikely.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.960
Yeah, what if they get your cell phone?

29:40.960 --> 29:42.880
No, it's the best plan we have,

29:42.880 --> 29:45.440
but I'm just saying, be aware for anybody who comes up

29:45.440 --> 29:47.000
asking to look at your phone or anything.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.760
We can make a covert.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.240
What if we handcuffed our phones to our hands?

29:52.120 --> 29:53.320
No, that's stupid.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.800
Drew, every time I see you,

29:54.800 --> 29:56.940
I'm gonna say bubblegum tree.

29:56.940 --> 29:58.840
Okay, yeah, I love that.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.900
And I'm gonna say lollipop bush.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.740
Okay, and I'm gonna say bubblegum bush.

30:05.620 --> 30:07.700
Well, see, you should have your own thing.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.400
You just kind of took our things.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.420
Yeah, but I took the two that made it alliteration.

30:12.420 --> 30:13.260
I like it.

30:13.260 --> 30:14.800
Okay, hey, yeah, you do you, buddy.

30:14.800 --> 30:15.640
What was it again?

30:15.640 --> 30:16.860
Bubblegum bush.

30:17.900 --> 30:18.720
I'm not gonna remember that.

30:18.720 --> 30:23.380
And yours is lollipop bush and his is bubble tree.

30:23.380 --> 30:24.200
Bubblegum tree?

30:24.200 --> 30:25.300
We got it, we nailed it.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.140
We definitely have this.

30:26.140 --> 30:27.940
What if we all just say bubblegum tree?

30:27.940 --> 30:29.300
Oh, that would make more sense.

30:29.300 --> 30:30.140
Okay.

30:30.140 --> 30:31.140
We all have the same word.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.540
That sounds good.

30:32.540 --> 30:35.180
Flash, thunder.

30:35.180 --> 30:37.040
That's from D-Day.

30:37.040 --> 30:37.880
Bubblegum tree.

30:37.880 --> 30:38.980
Okay, so it's you.

30:38.980 --> 30:40.020
Yeah, bubblegum tree.

30:40.020 --> 30:41.060
Okay, so it's you.

30:41.060 --> 30:42.300
Yeah, you got it.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.120
Nailed it, buddy.

30:43.120 --> 30:43.960
Bubblegum tree.

30:43.960 --> 30:44.800
Hey, Drew.

30:44.800 --> 30:45.620
Hey, Drew.

30:45.620 --> 30:46.460
All right, cool, hey.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.700
Okay, well.

30:49.700 --> 30:52.100
Hey, do you mind texting the entirety

30:52.100 --> 30:53.600
of that conversation to Clark?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.240
Could you do that for us, buddy?

30:57.240 --> 30:58.660
I mean, Keith, I'm sorry.

30:58.660 --> 30:59.980
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

30:59.980 --> 31:00.900
I'll let him know.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.180
It's probably about time for us

31:03.180 --> 31:04.380
to get him back here, right?

31:04.380 --> 31:06.360
It's 11, 15, or what time is it?

31:06.360 --> 31:07.200
It's like?

31:07.200 --> 31:08.020
9, 15.

31:08.020 --> 31:08.860
Did you mean Keith?

31:08.860 --> 31:09.700
Yes.

31:09.700 --> 31:10.520
Okay.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.540
I thought you were saying Drew texts Clark

31:11.540 --> 31:13.220
because we don't know if this Clark is the Clark.

31:13.220 --> 31:15.060
I was also confused by that.

31:16.500 --> 31:20.160
Oh, fuck, what if we just gave the password

31:20.160 --> 31:21.060
to the fake Clark?

31:22.380 --> 31:25.160
You're just gonna have to think that, I guess.

31:26.020 --> 31:27.660
My eyes narrow and I just.

31:27.660 --> 31:30.440
Hey, Drew, is there, can you think at any time

31:30.840 --> 31:32.280
that maybe one of us came in here

31:32.280 --> 31:33.200
and said something to you

31:33.200 --> 31:35.280
and then never talked about it ever again?

31:37.120 --> 31:38.560
Could this have happened before?

31:38.560 --> 31:42.260
I mean, Clark, that happens literally all the time.

31:42.260 --> 31:43.800
You guys talk about a lot of stuff

31:43.800 --> 31:46.420
that you never follow up on again.

31:46.420 --> 31:47.260
Fuck off, Drew.

31:47.260 --> 31:49.640
There's only so many hours in a day, Drew.

31:49.640 --> 31:50.480
God damn it.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.840
Drew, I didn't ask your professional opinion

31:51.840 --> 31:53.960
on our prowess in the copping world.

31:53.960 --> 31:54.800
Did you get at the fucking,

31:54.800 --> 31:57.720
God damn it, yeah, what are you, Detective Drew now?

31:57.720 --> 31:59.560
You think you could do our job?

31:59.800 --> 32:01.480
I hand Drew my gun and my badge

32:01.480 --> 32:04.640
and I'm like, be me, motherfucker.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.320
Walk a mile in these boots.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.800
He gets a very serious look on his face

32:08.800 --> 32:11.240
and he reaches out slowly for your gun.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.200
I slapped his hand away.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.780
God damn it, Drew.

32:14.780 --> 32:16.760
Oh, okay, it was a joke.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.800
I text both guys in a group message,

32:19.800 --> 32:21.920
hey, it's cheaper to get this with an egg.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.520
How do you want your egg cooked?

32:26.200 --> 32:27.700
I text back, scrambled.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.580
I didn't see the, I don't respond to the group text.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.160
Okay.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.180
I met beans on beans.

32:34.180 --> 32:37.300
I ordered all three of the same thing with scrambled eggs

32:37.300 --> 32:39.880
and I'm on my way back.

32:39.880 --> 32:44.880
Oh, Joe is asking, did Clark recognize the clothing

32:44.880 --> 32:46.060
that the other Clark was wearing?

32:46.060 --> 32:47.540
Is it stuff that I knew that I owned?

32:47.540 --> 32:50.420
It is not stuff that you own.

32:50.420 --> 32:51.240
Okay, cool.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.600
And that is one of the reasons

32:53.600 --> 32:55.540
you found it hard to believe that that was you.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.900
So I pull up to the police station

32:57.900 --> 32:59.700
and I wait to see the FBI.

32:59.700 --> 33:04.700
There is a large black SUV that pulls up next to you.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.660
The windows are completely blacked out

33:07.660 --> 33:10.720
and Agent Kennedy and Agent McKinley

33:10.720 --> 33:15.720
make their way out of the shotgun and backseat of the SUV.

33:16.420 --> 33:17.820
So they got a driver.

33:17.820 --> 33:21.940
Or it's a self-driving Tesla FBI van.

33:21.940 --> 33:23.400
Okay, I wait for them to go inside

33:23.400 --> 33:25.520
and then I wait like 30 seconds

33:25.520 --> 33:28.580
and I go around to the back of my trunk,

33:28.580 --> 33:32.240
get that bag out and bring in my three bags of beans

33:32.240 --> 33:34.820
and the black Nike bag.

33:34.820 --> 33:35.820
Okay, sounds good.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.100
Three, two.

33:48.040 --> 33:48.880
Okay, so.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.280
You didn't say one.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.640
Son of a bitch.

33:51.640 --> 33:56.000
So Clark and Drew and John are all standing around

33:56.000 --> 33:58.700
Drew's desk right at the entrance of the police department

33:58.700 --> 34:02.200
when Agent Kennedy and Agent McKinley walk in.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.300
Clark, you are the only one out of the three of you

34:04.300 --> 34:05.900
who has seen these two before.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.040
So I'll describe them again.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.640
Agent Kennedy is a short, young woman

34:09.640 --> 34:13.080
and Agent McKinley is a tall, old, gruff man.

34:13.080 --> 34:17.880
She has a bit of a spark in her step, glint in her eye

34:17.880 --> 34:21.140
and he has very slow steps

34:21.580 --> 34:22.740
and very dead eyes.

34:22.740 --> 34:26.280
And they walk into the police department.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.000
Agent Kennedy says,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.860
well, hello there, Agent Kennedy FBI.

34:31.860 --> 34:32.820
Good to see you both.

34:32.820 --> 34:33.740
Hi, how are you?

34:33.740 --> 34:37.240
And immediately upon looking at you guys,

34:37.240 --> 34:42.220
Agent McKinley scans you and freaks out.

34:42.220 --> 34:45.280
This is the tall, old, gruff man.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.740
And his eyes get enormous

34:48.740 --> 34:50.900
and he looks at Agent Kennedy

34:51.500 --> 34:52.320
and he goes,

34:52.320 --> 34:56.900
and then he sprints out.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.580
He turns and he dips.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.540
He runs straight out of the police department.

35:00.540 --> 35:03.220
So Keith Vigna, you will actually see

35:03.220 --> 35:05.500
as you're walking in with this stuff,

35:05.500 --> 35:07.620
Agent McKinley running out,

35:07.620 --> 35:12.620
going and gets back into the SUV

35:13.420 --> 35:14.740
and slams the door shut.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.920
When you say he scans us,

35:17.920 --> 35:20.620
or would it take that he's some kind of robot?

35:21.200 --> 35:22.040
No, I don't think so.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.060
I just use that word.

35:23.900 --> 35:24.740
So he's for sure a siren.

35:24.740 --> 35:25.580
He's a robot.

35:25.580 --> 35:27.020
He's a robot, 100%.

35:27.020 --> 35:28.520
Cool, cool, robot.

35:28.520 --> 35:32.060
It's an octo, octo, octo, octo?

35:32.060 --> 35:32.900
Ocular.

35:32.900 --> 35:33.720
Ocular.

35:33.720 --> 35:34.560
Ocular pat down.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.400
Ocular pat down.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.240
I'm gonna get the word out sooner when it helps.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.780
That was incredible.

35:38.780 --> 35:41.420
Some kind of obstacle pat up.

35:41.420 --> 35:44.980
Optic, but octo, octo, octo.

35:44.980 --> 35:46.820
Optical.

35:46.820 --> 35:50.140
So Agent Kennedy immediately starts apologizing

35:50.140 --> 35:52.020
and she's like, oh yeah, no, oof,

35:52.020 --> 35:53.900
I am so sorry about that.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.880
I mean, he is just off his,

35:55.880 --> 35:58.460
our last mission went very poorly

35:58.460 --> 36:01.500
and he's just all over the place these days.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.460
So did you?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.280
Never mind him.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.020
Where the hell are you from, lady?

36:06.020 --> 36:08.920
Oh, I'm from Minnesota.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.540
Minnesota, Ireland?

36:10.540 --> 36:12.020
No, just Minnesota.

36:12.020 --> 36:15.900
It's in the United States of America.

36:15.900 --> 36:20.380
So you're from the Netherlands.

36:20.380 --> 36:21.700
Is that what I'm getting?

36:21.700 --> 36:23.100
No, it's in the US.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.020
I am from up north.

36:25.020 --> 36:26.240
This is how we sound up there.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.560
I guess you haven't been.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.500
I guess not.

36:30.500 --> 36:34.200
So I walk in and I'm like, what's that dude's deal?

36:34.200 --> 36:37.220
Oh, he's just had a real rough go of it the past few days.

36:38.420 --> 36:40.180
Hey guys, I got your breakfast.

36:40.180 --> 36:41.020
Oh, thank you.

36:41.020 --> 36:44.140
I toss each of them the bag of breakfast.

36:44.140 --> 36:46.980
Ms. Kennedy, this here's a, this is a officer.

36:46.980 --> 36:48.300
Agent Kennedy.

36:48.300 --> 36:49.900
Agent Kennedy, sorry about that.

36:49.900 --> 36:50.720
Agent Kennedy.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.580
This here's Keith Vigna.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.700
He's an officer here with us.

36:53.700 --> 36:57.160
Agent like Mr. Anderson.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.580
I watched that movie the other day.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.820
Keith, Keith, no, it's a, this is a,

37:00.820 --> 37:02.100
This is a real live FBI agent.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.180
It's a real agent.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.860
Oh, you're real, you're real.

37:04.860 --> 37:06.140
Yeah, she's not from The Matrix.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.100
She's from.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.220
Oh, oh yeah, you told me that she's gonna,

37:10.220 --> 37:11.620
I forgot to get you breakfast.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.500
Do you want some of mine?

37:13.780 --> 37:15.180
No, I am good on the breakfast.

37:15.180 --> 37:17.580
You don't like black eyed peas and bacon?

37:17.580 --> 37:19.540
One soggy, one crispy.

37:19.540 --> 37:20.380
That sounds.

37:20.380 --> 37:21.220
Some scrambled eggs.

37:21.220 --> 37:23.900
That just sounds deeply unappealing on all levels.

37:23.900 --> 37:25.060
That's what I'm saying, lady.

37:25.060 --> 37:25.880
Have you tried it though?

37:25.880 --> 37:26.720
No one's.

37:26.720 --> 37:27.560
No?

37:27.560 --> 37:28.380
No one's tried it, Clark.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.220
It's good.

37:29.220 --> 37:30.860
Hey guys, also, I can't remember if one,

37:30.860 --> 37:33.420
like if you guys, if this belonged to either of you guys,

37:33.420 --> 37:34.940
I found it in the trunk of my car.

37:34.940 --> 37:37.140
I was cleaning all the shit out of my trunk and.

37:37.140 --> 37:39.580
Here, let me take a look at that there, Keith.

37:39.580 --> 37:42.460
Well heck, this is a, this is a black Nike bag.

37:42.460 --> 37:43.660
Isn't that what you were looking for?

37:43.660 --> 37:47.180
I comically slap like hands on both cheeks

37:47.180 --> 37:51.340
and I'm like, oh my God, what a coincidence.

37:51.340 --> 37:52.700
What do you mean?

37:52.700 --> 37:54.140
She is elated.

37:54.140 --> 37:57.380
She is like clapping her hands together very quickly

37:57.380 --> 37:59.220
and jumping up and down and.

37:59.220 --> 38:01.300
We fooled her guys, we fooled her.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.660
And she's like, oh my goodness,

38:03.660 --> 38:05.840
I've been looking just all over for this.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.780
Oh my, you have no idea.

38:07.780 --> 38:10.520
I got bad news for you, Agent Kennedy.

38:10.520 --> 38:11.360
It's empty.

38:13.180 --> 38:14.180
Perfect.

38:14.180 --> 38:17.340
And she will reach her arm out to grab it.

38:21.660 --> 38:24.140
Hold on, hold on, just for the listeners.

38:27.020 --> 38:31.660
Luke was nodding his head very intensely up and down

38:31.660 --> 38:34.820
and Thomas was vehemently shaking his head no.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.460
I hesitantly, go ahead and hand it to her.

38:39.460 --> 38:41.020
Hold on, I put my hand out.

38:41.060 --> 38:43.820
Hey now, what did you, what's this bag worth to you?

38:43.820 --> 38:44.940
I go ahead and start pulling it back.

38:44.940 --> 38:49.380
She stops clapping, stops jumping up and down

38:49.380 --> 38:52.680
and gets a very serious look in her eye.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.740
I don't think you'll want to be doing that.

38:56.740 --> 38:57.940
That's all I need.

38:57.940 --> 39:00.860
We just want a little information is all

39:00.860 --> 39:02.220
we're really aiming for here.

39:02.220 --> 39:05.620
A little quid pro quo between quid pro quo

39:05.620 --> 39:08.000
between fellow officers of the law.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.500
Okay, if you're looking for information,

39:10.500 --> 39:12.060
how about this?

39:12.060 --> 39:17.060
Let me use that bag and then I will give you information.

39:17.060 --> 39:18.300
What are you going to do with that bag?

39:18.300 --> 39:20.000
I just need to put something in it.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.900
All right, this might sound like a strange question,

39:24.020 --> 39:27.100
but it gets to the heart of what we're after here.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.260
Do you want to put something strange in it?

39:32.180 --> 39:33.060
Oh, sorry.

39:33.060 --> 39:34.340
I'm pretty hungry.

39:34.340 --> 39:36.400
I'm just going to go ahead and,

39:36.400 --> 39:38.100
go ahead and start eating on this.

39:38.100 --> 39:43.100
I sit down at my desk and start eating my beans

39:46.060 --> 39:47.580
while I watch this unfold.

39:47.580 --> 39:50.660
I suppose yes, officer petty more.

39:50.660 --> 39:53.540
It would be something quite strange.

39:53.540 --> 39:55.060
What sort of strange.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.560
She reaches into her back pocket and pulls out

39:58.560 --> 40:03.560
a small lock box that is two inches by two inches

40:04.460 --> 40:06.980
and it has a combination lock on it.

40:06.980 --> 40:09.860
And she starts messing with the numbers.

40:09.860 --> 40:14.020
Now I'm not going to open this until I can drop

40:14.020 --> 40:16.300
what's in here directly into that bag.

40:16.300 --> 40:19.940
All right, can you open it up for me officer Bishop?

40:19.940 --> 40:23.420
Sure, I go and I reach out and I hold it open underneath.

40:23.420 --> 40:26.900
She clicks the numbers into position

40:26.900 --> 40:30.740
and then holds this lock box right above the bag.

40:31.620 --> 40:36.620
And then she opens it and there inside is

40:37.260 --> 40:42.260
a small metal sphere about an inch in diameter

40:43.340 --> 40:45.540
and she immediately just tilts it

40:45.540 --> 40:50.420
and it drops right into the black Nike bag.

40:50.420 --> 40:54.140
And she closes up her packet and puts it in her back pocket

40:54.140 --> 40:57.500
and breathes the deepest sigh of relief

40:57.500 --> 41:00.320
you've seen someone breathe in some time.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.660
With the bag still being held open by me,

41:04.660 --> 41:06.500
I pull up to where I can see into it.

41:06.900 --> 41:08.180
Do I see the ball at the bottom of the bag?

41:08.180 --> 41:09.020
No.

41:09.020 --> 41:09.940
That's a heck of a trick lady.

41:09.940 --> 41:10.780
Thank you.

41:10.780 --> 41:14.460
Now I appreciate you finding that for us

41:14.460 --> 41:16.220
but I'm going to have to take it

41:16.220 --> 41:18.860
and we're going to leave you to it here.

41:18.860 --> 41:23.680
Real quick, that little ball, what was that?

41:25.920 --> 41:30.920
That was why Agent McKinley is so unintelligible these days.

41:31.280 --> 41:34.600
That little ball caused us so much trouble.

41:34.600 --> 41:37.680
Huh, I'm good to finally be rid of it.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.800
What kind of trouble did it cause you?

41:39.800 --> 41:43.280
Officer Bishop, we can't really get into that.

41:43.280 --> 41:47.280
You see, we have you a bit over the barrel here

41:47.280 --> 41:51.320
with all the goings on and I happen to hear

41:51.320 --> 41:54.080
that your chief's home blew up last night.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.760
Now, we're not sure what kind of a situation

41:56.760 --> 41:58.760
that that puts you in here but I'm not sure

41:58.760 --> 42:01.000
of a situation that that puts you in here

42:01.000 --> 42:05.920
but with all the strange happenings here in contention,

42:05.920 --> 42:08.160
I would think that you have far more important things

42:08.160 --> 42:09.280
to be worrying about.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.440
I think actually, you're right

42:11.440 --> 42:16.100
and we're in agreement there but where we might not see

42:16.100 --> 42:18.380
eye to eye is that I'm not so sure

42:18.380 --> 42:20.300
this ain't both of our problems.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.320
Eye with a mouth full of beans, I've.

42:23.320 --> 42:27.160
What, what was that, Keith?

42:28.040 --> 42:29.520
Get over here, I gotta ask you something.

42:29.520 --> 42:31.740
Oh, all right, I'll hook over.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
Should I tell her about that silver ball that we found?

42:38.400 --> 42:40.600
I was just gonna see if we could keep the bag

42:40.600 --> 42:41.480
in case we need it.

42:41.480 --> 42:44.480
Yeah, okay, I was gonna say something

42:44.480 --> 42:46.640
but I thought you guys might get mad if I did

42:46.640 --> 42:47.840
so I'm not going to.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.440
That was a good instinct.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.600
I was more than the bag.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.920
I was gonna see if we could keep this FBI agent

42:54.920 --> 42:57.080
in case we need it, you know what I mean?

42:57.840 --> 42:59.840
Get her to help us out.

42:59.840 --> 43:02.520
She seems to know about strange shit.

43:02.520 --> 43:05.480
What are y'all talking about over there?

43:05.480 --> 43:07.720
You're the next part of my plan.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.280
Holler, just keep your voice down.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.600
You're not needed yet.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.040
Just shut up in there.

43:12.040 --> 43:15.520
Stop your husband from pissing so much if you wanna.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.360
It's her cat.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.780
That's, it's like we said, it's confusing

43:20.780 --> 43:22.200
as to what that is.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.200
That's her husband's body, pissing like a cat

43:24.200 --> 43:26.140
all over our goddamn prison walls.

43:26.140 --> 43:29.540
But if it was her husband, it wouldn't be him pissing.

43:29.540 --> 43:30.980
He wouldn't piss in there.

43:30.980 --> 43:33.580
The cat is what pissed in the cell.

43:33.580 --> 43:34.940
I got you, I understand.

43:34.940 --> 43:35.780
I know what you meant.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.500
I was just making sure we remembered what happened.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.180
Yeah, yeah.

43:39.180 --> 43:40.020
It's thorny.

43:41.220 --> 43:42.700
Signing blame in this scenario.

43:42.700 --> 43:46.500
Hey, anyway, Agent, are you staying in contention

43:46.500 --> 43:47.340
for a while?

43:47.340 --> 43:50.340
We could show you around the night life.

43:50.340 --> 43:52.020
What she just told us is that she's not.

43:52.020 --> 43:52.860
So we gotta work through it.

43:52.860 --> 43:54.860
Oh, see, I was too busy thinking about

43:54.860 --> 43:55.700
balls and beans. You got a mouth?

43:56.260 --> 43:57.600
You got a mouth full of beans.

43:59.300 --> 44:01.340
Just balls and beans.

44:01.340 --> 44:03.140
It's all it ever is with you, Keith.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.860
Why don't we, we should call you beans.

44:06.860 --> 44:08.100
No, we shouldn't.

44:08.100 --> 44:09.940
Keith beans is what we should call you.

44:09.940 --> 44:10.780
No, don't call me that.

44:10.780 --> 44:11.620
He does love him so much.

44:11.620 --> 44:12.440
Don't call me that.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.020
You love beans so much, we're gonna call you

44:14.020 --> 44:15.940
Keith beans. Let's talk about something else.

44:15.940 --> 44:16.940
Okay, beans.

44:18.280 --> 44:22.700
Hey, Agent, FBI person.

44:22.700 --> 44:23.540
My Lord.

44:24.100 --> 44:24.940
My Lord.

44:28.020 --> 44:29.060
Yeah, hey, you.

44:29.060 --> 44:32.680
Yeah, come over, take a look at our cell real quick.

44:32.680 --> 44:35.660
She begins walking over where you are.

44:35.660 --> 44:39.020
So I was imagining Keith's desk is way back

44:39.020 --> 44:39.860
in the bullpen.

44:39.860 --> 44:41.440
You guys definitely stuck him in the back

44:41.440 --> 44:42.660
of the department.

44:42.660 --> 44:46.300
And so he is the closest one back to the cells.

44:46.300 --> 44:49.420
So she begins walking across the station

44:49.420 --> 44:51.120
and makes it to where you guys are

44:51.120 --> 44:53.380
and peeks her head in and looks at the cells.

44:54.080 --> 44:56.020
Hey, you see that man pissing in the corner like a cat?

44:56.020 --> 45:01.020
She looks over and she sees the body of Doug Jacobs

45:01.740 --> 45:06.580
on all fours, but with one paw just like up on the wall

45:06.580 --> 45:11.580
of the cell and he is pissing kind of back behind him

45:13.500 --> 45:18.500
and then he starts to kick up his feet onto the like nothing

45:19.020 --> 45:23.740
to cover the urine that is on the cell floor.

45:23.740 --> 45:25.500
Hey, hey, Dr. Jacobs.

45:25.500 --> 45:26.380
Yes?

45:26.380 --> 45:29.660
Could you tell our guest here exactly what happened

45:29.660 --> 45:31.220
to your husband?

45:31.220 --> 45:33.940
My husband believes he is a cat.

45:33.940 --> 45:35.940
What the fuck, lady?

45:35.940 --> 45:39.020
All right, no, your husband was turned into a cat by radio.

45:39.020 --> 45:44.020
Ma'am, these men keep telling me these crazy stories

45:44.420 --> 45:47.660
and they've locked me up in here with no proof

45:47.700 --> 45:48.940
that I belong.

45:48.940 --> 45:51.940
They did not read me my Miranda rights properly

45:51.940 --> 45:53.300
when I was arrested.

45:54.820 --> 45:58.200
Yeah, you got no proof of that and we did, by the way.

45:59.420 --> 46:02.100
I'm almost positive we always do that.

46:02.100 --> 46:04.060
We do that every time.

46:04.060 --> 46:06.700
So just don't stop your hearsay.

46:06.700 --> 46:09.860
Are you a federal agent of the law?

46:09.860 --> 46:13.660
And Agent Kennedy is just kind of staring

46:13.660 --> 46:15.220
at this whole situation.

46:15.220 --> 46:16.540
She looks at you guys.

46:17.740 --> 46:19.980
All right, she's being uncooperative.

46:19.980 --> 46:21.660
Obviously anybody would be pissed off

46:21.660 --> 46:24.100
about being stuck in a jail cell with their cat husband

46:24.100 --> 46:26.860
for however long we've kept her in there.

46:26.860 --> 46:31.860
But hey, that is a cat man and a radio did it to him.

46:32.580 --> 46:34.500
A weird radio and there's a weird gun

46:34.500 --> 46:36.120
and there's a weird camera

46:36.120 --> 46:39.220
and there's all this oil all over the place

46:39.220 --> 46:42.800
and this shit is frankly scaring the hell out of me

46:42.800 --> 46:45.740
and I don't know what's going on and I need you to help.

46:45.740 --> 46:48.880
I'm standing next to John and hearing him say it all,

46:48.880 --> 46:50.900
like that is kind of a relief for me

46:50.900 --> 46:53.520
and I'm kind of like nodding earnestly.

46:53.520 --> 46:57.620
And that is a fucking cat man and what do we do?

46:57.620 --> 47:00.420
Agent Kennedy looks at you all

47:00.420 --> 47:05.420
with a deep knowing sadness in her eyes

47:07.680 --> 47:09.000
and she says,

47:09.920 --> 47:14.920
Well, I guess that means that

47:16.740 --> 47:18.260
you guys are in.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.020
I'll be right back.

47:23.920 --> 47:28.920
And she walks out the door of the police station

47:30.520 --> 47:35.040
and walking back in is Agent Kennedy

47:35.040 --> 47:40.040
along with a young bald fit man with sunken intense eyes

47:41.820 --> 47:44.680
wearing a black t-shirt and jeans

47:44.680 --> 47:48.700
and you would all recognize him as Billy Harrison,

47:48.700 --> 47:50.680
the man that was tied up in the back

47:50.680 --> 47:53.300
of Charles Donovan's car.

47:53.300 --> 47:56.560
Oh shit, Keith, it's that guy who made a fool of you.

47:56.560 --> 47:58.480
I don't think I rush him,

47:58.480 --> 48:00.940
but I am like hand toward the gun.

48:00.940 --> 48:02.220
That's a wanted fugitive.

48:02.220 --> 48:03.060
Yeah, same.

48:03.060 --> 48:04.680
Hey, hey, you stop right there.

48:04.680 --> 48:09.680
So as he walks in, he is carrying Keith's uniform

48:10.640 --> 48:14.920
pressed and folded in a pile in one of his hands

48:14.920 --> 48:18.980
with Keith's service revolver sitting on top of it.

48:18.980 --> 48:21.400
I look down at my uniform that I have on

48:21.400 --> 48:23.240
and there's black beans just spilled,

48:23.240 --> 48:25.560
or black eyed peas just spilled all over it

48:25.560 --> 48:27.840
and I'm like, okay, I could use that.

48:28.760 --> 48:31.720
I get up and I stink eye him and I walk up

48:31.720 --> 48:34.120
and I grab my clothes out of his hand

48:34.120 --> 48:37.420
and I am red faced with embarrassment and anger

48:37.420 --> 48:39.480
and I walk back to my desk.

48:41.060 --> 48:46.060
As you walk away from him, he says to you,

48:46.820 --> 48:49.420
I sure hope that you're feeling better.

48:49.420 --> 48:51.420
Yeah, I mean, no thanks to you.

48:51.420 --> 48:52.260
I did everything.

48:52.260 --> 48:53.700
What the hell was that?

48:53.700 --> 48:58.700
I did everything that you asked me to do, Officer Vigna.

49:00.100 --> 49:02.260
Keith, what the hell did you ask him to do?

49:04.740 --> 49:06.900
I just didn't ask him to attack me.

49:07.740 --> 49:08.740
That's what he did.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.900
John and Clark's heads are turning back and forth

49:12.900 --> 49:14.260
between each person.

49:14.260 --> 49:15.340
Yeah.

49:15.340 --> 49:17.620
This man looks incredulous

49:17.620 --> 49:21.580
and he looks over at Agent Kennedy.

49:21.580 --> 49:25.780
He's like, I don't know what you're talking about,

49:25.780 --> 49:29.820
Officer Vigna, if you wanna keep what happened

49:29.820 --> 49:32.880
between you and I private, that's one thing,

49:32.880 --> 49:34.980
but don't go spreading rumors about me.

49:35.980 --> 49:38.500
Keith, Keith, what happened in that hospital?

49:38.500 --> 49:40.740
I told you what happened already.

49:40.740 --> 49:41.980
He told us.

49:41.980 --> 49:44.180
Hey, he may look as dumb as he is,

49:44.180 --> 49:46.640
but he's our friend, kinda, so.

49:46.640 --> 49:50.420
Well, your friend made me at gunpoint

49:50.420 --> 49:52.540
change into his clothes

49:52.540 --> 49:55.800
and then handcuff him to a hospital bed

49:55.800 --> 49:58.040
and then prance around the room

49:59.180 --> 50:01.740
yelling about some Keith beans

50:01.740 --> 50:05.260
and he wanted me to smack him in the face repeatedly,

50:05.260 --> 50:07.340
but very lightly.

50:07.340 --> 50:12.020
It was deeply uncomfortable for me and I.

50:12.020 --> 50:13.500
Stop, just stop right there.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.620
I don't know what the hell you're talking about or how.

50:15.620 --> 50:18.700
No, no, that all scans.

50:18.700 --> 50:22.500
If it's some Dom sub thing that you're into, that's fine,

50:22.500 --> 50:26.460
but I didn't like being dragged into it personally.

50:26.460 --> 50:27.300
Yeah, Keith, you gotta keep that.

50:27.300 --> 50:28.940
I don't know who the hell you think you are, but.

50:28.940 --> 50:29.780
Hey, buddy, that is,

50:29.780 --> 50:31.740
you gotta keep that person alive personally,

50:31.740 --> 50:33.100
you know, not on the job.

50:33.100 --> 50:34.060
I just. Let you free.

50:34.060 --> 50:34.900
Hey, you know.

50:34.900 --> 50:37.460
I just go sit down and eat the rest of my beans,

50:37.460 --> 50:38.780
fuming, angry.

50:38.780 --> 50:40.340
That's why we call them beans.

50:41.620 --> 50:46.620
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

50:48.620 --> 50:50.860
Hey, okay, so who the hell are you people?

50:50.860 --> 50:51.900
What's going on here?

50:51.900 --> 50:53.960
Yeah, what'd you mean by we're in?

50:53.960 --> 50:54.800
I knew it.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.540
You're a goddamn X-man.

50:56.540 --> 50:59.540
Agent Kennedy looks at Billy Harrison and says,

51:00.540 --> 51:03.580
they've seen a lot of shit,

51:03.580 --> 51:07.540
so I say we just let him keep the bag,

51:07.540 --> 51:09.180
give him the number and bail.

51:09.180 --> 51:10.300
You wanna get home, right?

51:10.300 --> 51:12.820
And he's like, I need to get home.

51:12.820 --> 51:14.420
Does she noticeably lose that accent?

51:14.420 --> 51:16.180
Oh yeah, it's gone.

51:16.180 --> 51:17.540
Okay.

51:17.540 --> 51:20.060
I pull my gun out and point it at Billy Harrison and say,

51:20.060 --> 51:22.260
if you leave right now without telling us what's happened,

51:22.260 --> 51:23.300
I will kill you.

51:23.300 --> 51:25.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:25.540 --> 51:28.100
Keith, Keith, Keith, that conversation we had about guns.

51:28.100 --> 51:29.040
I don't care right now.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.640
He is, I don't know who this guy is, but I don't like him.

51:31.640 --> 51:32.480
Hey, hey, Keith.

51:32.480 --> 51:33.960
All right, keep your gun on him,

51:33.960 --> 51:35.540
but also come over here for a second.

51:35.540 --> 51:37.840
I stand exactly where I am, I'm fighting Matt,

51:37.840 --> 51:38.960
I'm furious, looking right at him.

51:38.960 --> 51:40.120
I'm gonna come over there.

51:40.120 --> 51:41.560
I'm gonna whisper here, okay?

51:41.560 --> 51:42.400
Okay.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.640
All right, hey, guess what?

51:43.640 --> 51:46.680
Like I won't tell Clark, but it is what he's saying, Drew.

51:46.680 --> 51:47.520
No.

51:47.520 --> 51:48.340
Are you sure?

51:48.340 --> 51:49.180
I swear to God.

51:49.180 --> 51:50.020
Are you sure, buddy?

51:50.020 --> 51:50.860
That's why I wanna shoot him.

51:50.860 --> 51:51.680
I wanna shoot him right now.

51:51.680 --> 51:54.040
Okay, well think about if maybe you haven't done

51:54.040 --> 51:55.760
anything today that somebody wouldn't get

51:55.760 --> 51:57.160
shooting Matt at you for,

51:57.160 --> 52:00.440
and if anybody needs to die, you know what I mean?

52:00.440 --> 52:02.520
While you guys are having this conversation,

52:02.520 --> 52:04.600
he speaks up and he says,

52:04.600 --> 52:09.600
and I would like my gun and my ID back, please.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.520
We do, I think we have those, right?

52:11.520 --> 52:12.620
Yeah, go ahead and go.

52:12.620 --> 52:13.460
Pick it out and evidence.

52:13.460 --> 52:14.880
Go get it out of the evidence bags, yeah.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.600
Don't give him his gun back again.

52:17.880 --> 52:21.200
So when you, Clark, when you walk back into the room,

52:21.200 --> 52:25.740
Keith has his gun trained on Billy Harrison,

52:25.740 --> 52:30.740
and John is whispering sweet nothings into Keith's ear,

52:30.820 --> 52:33.460
and Billy is just standing there looking at you

52:33.460 --> 52:34.820
as is Agent Kennedy.

52:34.820 --> 52:38.300
I'm gonna kinda edge my way if I can in front of that gun.

52:38.300 --> 52:43.140
I do the, I put my hand way over and aim it over him.

52:43.140 --> 52:47.900
I'm doing exaggerated fake yawn, and put my hand up.

52:47.900 --> 52:50.040
You can't, don't leave here without,

52:50.040 --> 52:51.220
I don't know who you are,

52:51.220 --> 52:53.900
how you know what you know about me or us,

52:53.900 --> 52:56.820
but just tell us something before you go.

52:56.820 --> 53:00.660
I take, I'm taking the badge and I have his gun, right?

53:00.660 --> 53:02.540
You have, yeah, his ID and his gun.

53:02.540 --> 53:03.380
I'm gonna just.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.180
Well, wait, Clark, before you give him that gun,

53:06.180 --> 53:07.460
let's have a little pow wow.

53:07.460 --> 53:09.740
No, I still, I go walk up to him,

53:09.740 --> 53:12.520
and I have the clip out of the gun,

53:12.520 --> 53:16.220
and I hand him the ID and just the clip,

53:16.220 --> 53:18.260
and I'm holding onto the gun, and I'm saying,

53:18.260 --> 53:19.500
I'm not gonna let him shoot you,

53:19.500 --> 53:22.860
but the sentiment does ring true.

53:22.860 --> 53:24.860
We wanna know what's going on around here.

53:26.060 --> 53:31.060
Okay, well, what is going on around here?

53:31.580 --> 53:34.580
She kicks in and she's like, you're fucked.

53:36.260 --> 53:38.660
Each and every one of you are completely fucked.

53:39.700 --> 53:42.240
Guys, the world does not work in the way

53:42.240 --> 53:45.540
that we all grew up knowing it to be,

53:45.540 --> 53:50.540
and you are now charged with understanding that.

53:51.140 --> 53:55.860
That understanding of the world will cause your life

53:55.860 --> 53:57.980
to crumble before your eyes,

53:57.980 --> 54:02.260
but the thing that keeps us going is that daily,

54:02.260 --> 54:05.520
we are saving the human race

54:05.520 --> 54:08.200
from getting wiped out of existence.

54:09.340 --> 54:13.180
We're going to give you the same information newcomers get,

54:13.180 --> 54:17.260
which is a phone number, and he reaches in his pocket,

54:17.260 --> 54:20.340
and he pulls out a card, and it's got a phone number on it,

54:20.980 --> 54:23.220
and she says, now you give them a call

54:23.220 --> 54:26.220
if things get completely out of hand,

54:26.220 --> 54:28.900
or they will call in 48 hours if you don't.

54:28.900 --> 54:33.900
I hate to do it like this, but this is your problem now.

54:33.980 --> 54:35.940
I'm gonna leave this bag here with you.

54:35.940 --> 54:40.260
Anything you put in it disappears.

54:41.980 --> 54:44.860
This bag, we do not know what it does

54:44.860 --> 54:47.720
or what it is capable of outside of that,

54:47.720 --> 54:51.120
but we do know that it seems to make things

54:51.120 --> 54:55.940
that we need to not be on this world anymore.

54:55.940 --> 54:57.740
It makes them gone.

54:57.740 --> 55:00.600
Very few have heard of it, even fewer believe it,

55:00.600 --> 55:03.840
but we've all seen today, all of us for the first time,

55:03.840 --> 55:07.800
that Agent Victor's Nike bag is legit.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.460
I'm going to leave it with you all,

55:09.460 --> 55:11.400
and you can drop it at a secure location

55:11.400 --> 55:14.300
when the job is done, and he says,

55:14.300 --> 55:16.880
and I'd like my gun back, please.

55:18.200 --> 55:20.080
I turn and look back at Keith.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.480
The whole time she was talking,

55:21.480 --> 55:25.440
I was just slowly lowering my gun and jaw dropping.

55:25.440 --> 55:28.220
I'm kind of slowly realizing what's been going on

55:28.220 --> 55:29.800
the past few days and putting it together,

55:29.800 --> 55:33.720
and gun is holstered, and I'm kind of just staring off.

55:33.720 --> 55:36.840
I turn back and go ahead and hand him his gun.

55:36.840 --> 55:39.160
Good luck, and they walk out.

55:42.160 --> 55:44.120
Guys, we're fucking X-Files now.

55:44.120 --> 55:49.120
["How Am I the Only One Trying to Pull Over"]

56:00.400 --> 56:05.400
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

56:08.040 --> 56:13.040
How can you have enough drowning out

56:14.320 --> 56:18.920
of the noise?

56:18.920 --> 56:23.000
There's no one more home.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.600
No one more home.

56:27.600 --> 56:31.000
No one more home.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.080
Fly, fly, to the stream.
