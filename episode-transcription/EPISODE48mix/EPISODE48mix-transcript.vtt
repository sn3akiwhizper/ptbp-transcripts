00:00.000 --> 00:06.520
What's up my babies, it's your grease daddy Wolf the Dog, and I'm here absorbing all

00:06.520 --> 00:11.220
the oil from all the deep fryers here in contention.

00:11.220 --> 00:17.200
The grease used here in the past is much better than the grease used in the present and the

00:17.200 --> 00:18.280
future.

00:18.280 --> 00:26.620
So light a match and watch me explode baby, it's 694.2 PTBP and I'm here to ignite

00:26.620 --> 00:31.900
your passion for local news and other happenings from the past.

00:31.900 --> 00:36.620
Speaking of happenings, we got ourselves a new Howlin' with Wolf.

00:36.620 --> 00:41.780
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from At Crafty Under Dash Creep, who tagged at

00:41.780 --> 00:44.500
Pretending Pod in an Instagram post.

00:44.500 --> 00:48.940
They write, I would love to howl at my love bug Alec.

00:48.940 --> 00:53.860
Thanks for turning me on to the best podcast and being the best partner ever.

00:54.100 --> 00:59.620
Well crafty creep, I don't got much intimidating to say to you and your loved one.

00:59.620 --> 01:04.860
It brings some joy to my small grease filled heart to hear about y'all.

01:04.860 --> 01:08.380
I wish someone would howl at me in a loving manner.

01:08.380 --> 01:13.300
Maybe one day, maybe someday, maybe someday.

01:13.300 --> 01:18.080

And y'all know I need that extra five bucks a month.

01:56.660 --> 01:59.880
You might not know, but Wolf has kids to feed.

01:59.880 --> 02:05.100
How else am I going to fatten them up before I feast upon them?

02:05.100 --> 02:09.700
The news is meant to be a time to remind our listeners of the past.

02:09.700 --> 02:14.740
So you might not have to send your minds on such a difficult journey when remembering

02:14.740 --> 02:17.640
all the nonsense that has gone on so far.

02:17.680 --> 02:23.600
Now, if I pick and pull what I remember from my time in current day contention, it might

02:23.600 --> 02:28.720
spoil some of the sweet niblets that are being served up in this story.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.360
This fresh, fresh story.

02:31.360 --> 02:37.160
We may be in the past, but I've seen the future and I know the best possible present

02:37.160 --> 02:43.000
is Moondance by Blue False Indigo.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.940
She runs, she runs, she runs, ooh.

02:54.420 --> 03:02.720
The sun, the sun, the sun is leaving soon.

03:02.720 --> 03:20.920
She knows, she knows, she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance

03:20.920 --> 03:26.920
beneath the shadow of the moon.

03:26.920 --> 03:36.760
So Joe, I'm going to game four of the, uh, was it NLDS?

03:36.760 --> 03:39.560
Uh, yeah, uh, shit.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.560
Is it DS and NCS?

03:40.560 --> 03:42.040
Yeah, I think it is.

03:42.040 --> 03:46.260
Uh, going to game four, uh, which is in St. Louis.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.260
Fuck yeah, dude.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.260
Holy shit.

03:48.260 --> 03:49.920
Yeah, I'm super, super stoked.

03:49.920 --> 03:56.240
My dad is turning 60 on that day and so my brother and I are taking him to that game

03:56.560 --> 03:57.560
for his birthday.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.560
Lucky.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.560
Yeah, it's going to be dope.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.560
That's super dope.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.800
Somebody I know was doing one of the Atlanta games.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.080
Oh, I'd love to go back to Atlanta.

04:05.080 --> 04:12.120
I've only been once and it was when I was like 17, 18 years old and I was there with

04:12.120 --> 04:20.900
my brother and my dad and a bunch of church people for a Christian conference and we,

04:20.900 --> 04:29.440
this was at the end of my tenure in the church and during the candlelight vigil, the silent

04:29.440 --> 04:35.140
candlelight thing, my brother and I skipped out on it to get extremely drunk at the hotel.

04:35.140 --> 04:36.140
Like you do.

04:36.140 --> 04:40.820
We, uh, there was a college basketball game on and we bought a really cheap bottle of

04:40.820 --> 04:48.140
bourbon and we played a game where we each chose a team and then every time the team

04:48.140 --> 04:50.740
scored, you had to do a shot.

04:50.740 --> 04:51.740
A score?

04:51.740 --> 04:52.740
Yeah.

04:52.740 --> 04:53.740
What?

04:53.740 --> 04:54.740
I was 17.

04:54.740 --> 05:01.300
He was 21 and we were children in monsters and we got so drunk.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.380
That was the night he died of alcohol poisoning.

05:03.380 --> 05:04.380
Oh yeah.

05:04.380 --> 05:05.380
Yeah.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.380
Rip.

05:06.380 --> 05:10.820
Um, we're taking his corpse to game four.

05:10.820 --> 05:11.820
Pretty cool.

05:11.820 --> 05:13.220
My ghost brother to buy us tickets.

05:13.220 --> 05:18.140
Uh, so we, we get really drunk and then we change into our swimming trunks.

05:18.140 --> 05:23.060
You got into like four shots in and then it was like, oh, nevermind.

05:23.060 --> 05:24.060
Uh, yeah.

05:24.060 --> 05:29.100
We even made a thing where it was like, and on turnovers and dunks you take two shots

05:29.100 --> 05:34.260
cause we're idiots and thankfully I don't drink like that anymore, but we're very drunk

05:34.260 --> 05:39.740
in our swimsuits in downtown Atlanta and the pool was closed.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.460
So we went to the weight room and maxed out on bench.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.460
This is standard stuff.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.460
Yeah.

05:45.460 --> 05:49.420
And then we went outside for me to go smoke a cigarette right after doing that because

05:49.420 --> 05:57.100
again, I was a monster and uh, and so we're outside and this dude comes up to us and he's

05:57.100 --> 06:00.580
like, Hey, Hey, you guys have any money?

06:00.580 --> 06:02.700
And we were like, no, no, not at all.

06:02.700 --> 06:08.780
But uh, and like we pull out this bourbon from our bag, we brought it with us outside

06:08.820 --> 06:10.740
and we're like, you want to get drunk with us?

06:10.740 --> 06:12.300
His name was Orestes.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.300
Orestes.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.780
Yeah, he's, he's, he was so funny.

06:16.780 --> 06:20.660
And then we, uh, we talked with him for a long time before we decided we'd walk around

06:20.660 --> 06:26.340
downtown, but we walked directly into the candlelight vigil that was happening from.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.340
Oh my God.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.340
The thing you were supposed to be at.

06:28.340 --> 06:31.340
The thing we were supposed to be at.

06:31.340 --> 06:32.980
That's great.

06:32.980 --> 06:37.980
Just drunkenly in our swimsuits, just like drunkenly wandering through this crowd of

06:38.940 --> 06:43.460
and hoping desperately not to run into our dad who's hopefully not listening to this

06:43.460 --> 06:44.460
podcast.

06:44.460 --> 06:45.460
All right.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.460
Ken Krinklehoff.

06:49.460 --> 06:50.460
That's me.

06:50.460 --> 06:51.460
How do you spell Krinklehoff, Joe?

06:51.460 --> 06:52.460
Oh boy.

06:52.460 --> 06:57.460
It's a C R I N K L E H O F F.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.460
Cool.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.460
That works for me.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.460
Yeah.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.460
The professor's name is, he, he spells it a little different.

07:02.460 --> 07:03.460
P H.

07:03.460 --> 07:04.460
Sure.

07:04.940 --> 07:09.140
You are heading to the woods in your mom's minivan.

07:09.140 --> 07:14.820
She's driving you there because Ken, I just don't understand why you have to, why you

07:14.820 --> 07:19.660
have to continue to do this, this yearly trip out into the woods.

07:19.660 --> 07:24.380
Ken is in the front seat with his feet up on the dashboard and he's, he's very bored

07:24.380 --> 07:31.620
looking out the window, maybe fiddling with a finger, mom, I mean, it's just hanging out

07:31.620 --> 07:32.620
with some friends.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.100
That's, that's all it is.

07:34.740 --> 07:35.740
That's all it's ever been.

07:35.740 --> 07:36.740
It's just hanging out.

07:36.740 --> 07:37.740
Don't you think you're too old for this?

07:37.740 --> 07:40.340
Going out and looking for ghosts or whatever the heck it is you all do?

07:40.340 --> 07:44.140
To be honest with you, mom, kinda, I'm, I'm, there's a chance this is the last time you're

07:44.140 --> 07:45.140
driving me.

07:45.140 --> 07:46.140
That's all I'm saying.

07:46.140 --> 07:51.260
Well, I'm certainly not going to let you drive to one of these little excursions.

07:51.260 --> 07:53.220
Mom, Ash has a car.

07:53.220 --> 07:54.340
I can, I can ride with him.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.020
It'd be easier for all of us.

07:56.020 --> 08:02.340
Well, you know, I do like Ash, but I just, I just don't trust that Pettymore boy.

08:02.380 --> 08:05.220
Well, maybe you just haven't gotten to know him.

08:05.220 --> 08:09.900
I think I've known him over the many years that he's been coming over to our house and

08:09.900 --> 08:13.340
just causing all sorts of wreck and havoc all over the place.

08:13.340 --> 08:16.900
I mean, it's just, it's just not who you're going to be.

08:16.900 --> 08:17.900
All right.

08:17.900 --> 08:18.900
Yeah, you're right.

08:18.900 --> 08:19.900
You're right.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.180
You were born for more than this.

08:21.180 --> 08:23.060
That's, that's true.

08:23.060 --> 08:25.540
I, I'm not, I'm not like them these days.

08:25.540 --> 08:27.180
That's, that's, yeah.

08:27.180 --> 08:32.940
She reluctantly turns onto the little gravel road that says, has got a sign next to it

08:32.940 --> 08:35.780
that says the contention woods.

08:35.780 --> 08:41.420
And as she pulls onto the gravel, she's going to roll a drive check.

08:41.420 --> 08:44.100
Nice.

08:44.100 --> 08:52.260
And as she pulls onto the gravel, a little baby Fox jumps right out into the road.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.260
It's trying to sprint.

08:53.340 --> 08:58.540
It seems like its leg might be broken and it tries to cross the road in front of you.

08:58.540 --> 09:00.980
And her reaction time is Nada.

09:00.980 --> 09:01.980
She doesn't even see it.

09:01.980 --> 09:02.980
Mom, mom, mom, mom.

09:02.980 --> 09:04.520
And she just crushes.

09:04.520 --> 09:13.700
You feel this, mom, you just hit that wildlife ain't, ain't for nothing but game and sorrow.

09:13.700 --> 09:14.700
That's cold shit.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.980
Mom, you're going to have to learn one day that the world is cold shit.

09:17.980 --> 09:20.060
I don't like you using that word.

09:20.060 --> 09:24.740
And you guys pull into the parking lot, it's a gravel parking lot, and there are a few

09:24.740 --> 09:25.740
cars there.

09:25.740 --> 09:32.720
You do see two cars that one of which has a boot on it and the other has a piece of

09:32.720 --> 09:36.100
paper taped up to the driver's side window.

09:36.100 --> 09:42.820
You also see the 91 Firebird that Ash drives and then near the little shack, the little

09:42.820 --> 09:46.740
Rangers shack right at the trailhead entrance.

09:46.740 --> 09:51.940
Right next to that is an old Ford Bronco with a lift kit on it.

09:51.940 --> 09:52.940
Sure.

09:52.940 --> 09:53.940
Does it have signage?

09:53.940 --> 09:54.940
No, it's unmarked.

09:54.940 --> 09:55.940
Gotcha.

09:55.940 --> 09:56.940
But the plates are state level.

09:56.940 --> 09:57.940
Gotcha.

09:57.940 --> 10:03.200
Immediately your mom is like, well, at least, you know, there's some sort of authority presence

10:03.200 --> 10:04.200
here.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.200
They'll be watching over y'all.

10:05.200 --> 10:11.700
Are you scared of stuff that could happen to me or are you scared of me doing stuff?

10:11.700 --> 10:12.700
Both.

10:12.700 --> 10:13.700
You don't have to worry, mom.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.620
Didn't you read that op-ed in the newspaper?

10:15.620 --> 10:20.820
The Contention Chronicle says that we've got multiple people that are out here in the woods

10:20.820 --> 10:21.820
they're missing.

10:21.820 --> 10:22.820
You know?

10:22.820 --> 10:28.340
So I just don't, I know that, you know, Officer Cox is working hard trying to keep everything

10:28.340 --> 10:29.340
in line.

10:29.340 --> 10:34.500
I trust our town's authority figures, just as everyone should, can.

10:34.500 --> 10:40.500
You should trust your authority figures, currently me, but I do trust you.

10:40.500 --> 10:44.780
It's just, I don't trust the influence that these boys are having on you.

10:44.780 --> 10:49.740
Mom, you know me, you know, you know what you and dad have instilled in me.

10:49.740 --> 10:53.260
There's no way that anything's going to happen tonight that you wouldn't be proud of.

10:53.260 --> 10:58.860
Chris is a great man and I just want you, Ken, to grow up and be even better than he

10:58.860 --> 10:59.860
is.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.580
I mean, he is the number one used car salesman in contention.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.500
He tells me all the time, I know.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.540
If he wouldn't have snapped his knee, you know, he would have gone pro, but that's what

11:08.540 --> 11:11.580
we're hoping for you, not the snap knee part, the going pro part, all right?

11:11.580 --> 11:12.580
I know, I know.

11:12.580 --> 11:14.220
You're going to lift this family up out of here.

11:14.220 --> 11:19.420
Look, mom, we're going to roast some marshmallows, tell some ghost stories, and sleep in tents.

11:19.420 --> 11:20.420
I did bring marshmallows.

11:20.420 --> 11:21.420
Thanks, mom.

11:21.420 --> 11:22.420
I love you.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.420
I love you too.

11:23.420 --> 11:26.240
She goes in for a kiss.

11:26.240 --> 11:31.780
Just a little baby peck on the cheek for her little 14 year old boy, for her little baby

11:31.780 --> 11:32.780
boy.

11:32.780 --> 11:35.980
I go around the back of the car and I pull out those marshmallows.

11:35.980 --> 11:36.980
Can I pull out a tent?

11:36.980 --> 11:37.980
Yeah.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.420
I got my tent and a sleeping bag.

11:39.420 --> 11:40.420
I got my rucksack.

11:40.420 --> 11:41.420
I'm prepared.

11:41.420 --> 11:42.420
I've done this a few years in a row now.

11:42.420 --> 11:43.420
Exactly.

11:43.420 --> 11:44.420
I know what I need.

11:44.420 --> 11:49.100
So you get everything about the car and she's like, I'm going to park right here and I'm

11:49.100 --> 11:52.500
not going to leave until I see you go up in there, all right?

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
Okay.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
That's fine.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
That's fine.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.500
I love you.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.500
I love you.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.900
I'm going to take whatever route I need to take that I can walk past that car that had

12:00.900 --> 12:01.900
a note on its window.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.100
I just want to read what that note says as I go.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.100
Yeah, for sure.

12:05.220 --> 12:10.300
So it's just a notice that says if this car is still here on a certain date, like maybe

12:10.300 --> 12:12.900
a week or two from now, that it'll get booted.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.900
Gotcha.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.660
So I walk down the trailhead and every little while I check back and see if she's still

12:17.660 --> 12:23.700
there and every time she is, I wave again, kind of exasperatedly each time.

12:23.700 --> 12:28.720
And you make it up to the little shack, the little ranger's shack, and you hear a voice

12:28.720 --> 12:30.660
come from inside of it.

12:30.660 --> 12:32.980
Oh, hello there, weary traveler.

12:32.980 --> 12:33.980
Hey.

12:33.980 --> 12:34.980
Oh, hey.

12:35.060 --> 12:36.060
Turtle me.

12:36.060 --> 12:37.060
Hey there.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.060
All right.

12:38.060 --> 12:41.700
I know Jeb's not here, but my name is Woodrow.

12:41.700 --> 12:48.500
It says right here, and he points to his badge, and he's like, but you can call me Buzz, as

12:48.500 --> 12:49.860
that is my nickname.

12:49.860 --> 12:50.860
Hey.

12:50.860 --> 12:51.860
Hey, Buzz.

12:51.860 --> 12:52.860
How are you tonight?

12:52.860 --> 12:55.100
I'm doing quite well.

12:55.100 --> 13:00.820
Just here to take a little inventory of those folks heading on into the woods this evening.

13:00.860 --> 13:05.700
So if you wouldn't mind, step right up, and he grabs this Polaroid camera off the desk

13:05.700 --> 13:08.420
in front of him, and he holds it up to you, and he snaps a picture.

13:08.420 --> 13:09.420
Oh, hey.

13:09.420 --> 13:10.420
Oh, hey there.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.420
Okay.

13:11.420 --> 13:12.420
Fine.

13:12.420 --> 13:13.420
What is your name, young sir?

13:13.420 --> 13:14.420
I'm Ken.

13:14.420 --> 13:15.420
I'm Ken Krinklehoff.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.420
Oh.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.420
I hold out a hand for a handshake.

13:17.420 --> 13:20.380
Yeah, and he goes out and he grabs it, and he is like extremely frail.

13:20.380 --> 13:24.980
You see that he actually has a cane at his side, and his hands are like shaking as he

13:24.980 --> 13:26.860
goes out to shake your hand.

13:26.860 --> 13:27.860
Good to meet you, Buzz.

13:27.860 --> 13:30.100
I'm glad to know that somebody's out here keeping an eye on everything.

13:30.100 --> 13:35.020
I know somebody's got to with all these people missing in these woods, you know?

13:35.020 --> 13:40.640
And he kind of points back at this board, this bulletin board behind him, and you see

13:40.640 --> 13:46.140
that there are approximately 20 pictures up on the board, and there are all these Polaroids

13:46.140 --> 13:50.540
that have been taken in this exact spot with a piece of paper behind them.

13:50.540 --> 13:55.080
And when he asked you your name, he wrote down Ken Krinklehoff on this sheet that looks

13:55.080 --> 13:56.080
similar to those.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.420
And he's like, I got a couple more questions for you.

13:58.460 --> 14:00.980
What are you up to tonight in these here woods?

14:00.980 --> 14:02.940
Oh, me and some friends.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.460
We're going to be camping out here.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.020
We've done it many years in a row.

14:06.020 --> 14:09.060
Oh, you look to be about the same age as these boys.

14:09.060 --> 14:13.820
And he points back, and you see there's pictures of Ash and of Jeremy.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.300
Yeah, that's them.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.980
I'm actually heading in there to meet them now.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.420
Okay.

14:19.420 --> 14:22.380
Bring anything with you that's not traditional camping gear?

14:22.380 --> 14:23.380
Nope.

14:23.380 --> 14:28.620
My sleeping bag here, and the tent, and, you know, the essentials.

14:28.620 --> 14:29.620
Hmm.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.620
Yep.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.620
All right, man.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.620
One final question.

14:32.620 --> 14:40.020
If you were to get startled and have to escape in any situation, maybe go run and hide somewhere,

14:40.020 --> 14:43.940
where might it be that we could find you if we're out looking for you?

14:43.940 --> 14:47.860
Hopefully that doesn't come to this, but where might we find you?

14:47.860 --> 14:49.860
I'd definitely run back out here to the parking lot.

14:49.860 --> 14:51.260
Yeah, that's a smart answer.

14:51.260 --> 14:55.180
Your other friend said the caves over on the northwest.

14:55.180 --> 14:57.340
Is it part of the woods, seemingly?

14:57.340 --> 14:58.620
All right, well.

14:58.620 --> 15:02.540
And you look behind him, and you see there are a couple of clipboards, and like a fire

15:02.540 --> 15:12.460
extinguisher, and an ax, and a machete, and a flashlight, and that's about it in here.

15:12.460 --> 15:16.520
Hey, Buzz, those missing people I've been hearing about that, have you guys got any

15:16.520 --> 15:18.020
leads on that?

15:18.020 --> 15:20.460
That's kind of weird that it's all happening all of a sudden.

15:20.460 --> 15:25.020
It is very, very strange, and he points up to the picture of Jeb, who you might know

15:25.020 --> 15:30.580
is the normal ranger who's out here, and he's like, they brought me down from the state

15:30.580 --> 15:37.260
to try to clear all this up and keep these woods safe, and I'm a decorated veteran of

15:37.260 --> 15:42.500
the ranger service, and I am here to make sure everything gets taken care of, sweeping

15:42.500 --> 15:44.820
up the issues and whatnots.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.900
But no leads?

15:46.900 --> 15:48.300
Is that where them people going?

15:48.300 --> 15:50.940
I have absolutely no idea.

15:50.940 --> 15:51.940
Do you know?

15:51.940 --> 15:52.940
I don't.

15:52.940 --> 15:54.460
All right, Ken.

15:54.460 --> 15:55.460
You checked around?

15:55.460 --> 15:56.460
For what?

15:56.460 --> 15:57.460
Missing people.

15:57.460 --> 15:58.460
Who?

15:58.460 --> 15:59.460
The people that have been missing.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.460
Have you looked for them?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.460
Yeah.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.460
What'd you say?

16:02.460 --> 16:03.460
Nothing.

16:03.460 --> 16:04.460
It's okay, Buzz.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.100
And as he's saying that, he's like rubbing his hands together.

16:06.100 --> 16:09.140
He's like, all right, well, take care, I guess.

16:09.140 --> 16:10.140
Thanks.

16:10.140 --> 16:11.140
Thanks, Buzz.

16:11.140 --> 16:12.140
Hope we don't need to see you again.

16:12.140 --> 16:13.140
Well, on the way out, hopefully.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.060
That would be a good time to see you again.

16:15.060 --> 16:16.060
That's true.

16:16.060 --> 16:17.060
Thanks.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.060
See you in the morning.

16:18.820 --> 16:19.820
Bye.

16:19.820 --> 16:21.980
Bye, Ken.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.260
Is he watching me as I go?

16:23.260 --> 16:24.260
Yeah.

16:24.260 --> 16:26.140
And your mom from the minivan waves and-

16:26.140 --> 16:27.580
I give another wave.

16:27.580 --> 16:31.900
You wave, Buzz waves, we all wave.

16:31.900 --> 16:37.380
For Ken's mom, Krista Krinkelhoff.

16:37.380 --> 16:37.980
Oh, Krista.

16:48.060 --> 16:57.500
And who likes that?

16:57.500 --> 16:58.500
What's up, guys?

16:58.500 --> 16:59.500
Hello.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.500
Hi.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.500
Hello.

17:01.500 --> 17:05.340
For our listeners, you're hearing three voices that are not Thomas, Joe, and Luke.

17:05.340 --> 17:11.100
And that is because I am a dumb, dumb idiot boy, and I decided to do something I've wanted

17:11.100 --> 17:19.740
to do for a long time, which is run two different groups inside the same sandbox and see what

17:19.740 --> 17:20.740
happens.

17:20.740 --> 17:26.740
So first off, we have a brand new voice on the podcast, and that is our good friend,

17:26.740 --> 17:27.740
Lindsay.

17:27.740 --> 17:28.740
Hello.

17:28.740 --> 17:29.740
My name is Lindsay.

17:29.740 --> 17:30.740
What?

17:30.740 --> 17:31.740
Whoa.

17:31.740 --> 17:32.740
Welcome.

17:32.740 --> 17:35.660
Welcome to the podcast.

17:35.660 --> 17:38.260
I'm so sorry.

17:38.260 --> 17:39.260
For yourself?

17:39.260 --> 17:40.260
As for the way I've acted.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.260
I'm sorry for the sins.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.260
Yes.

17:42.260 --> 17:49.700
You're going to need to do three Bloody Marys and four shots of gin.

17:49.700 --> 17:54.660
So Lindsay, right off the bat, do you have any RPG experience?

17:54.660 --> 17:55.660
Yeah.

17:55.660 --> 17:56.660
Well, yes.

17:56.660 --> 17:59.180
I am on a D&D campaign currently.

17:59.180 --> 18:00.180
My first one.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.180
Nice.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.460
And are you enjoying it thus far?

18:02.460 --> 18:03.460
Yes.

18:03.460 --> 18:04.460
And it's your first time role playing?

18:04.460 --> 18:05.460
Sort of.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.900
I was in Thespians growing up.

18:08.900 --> 18:09.900
That's sort of the same thing.

18:09.900 --> 18:10.900
The Thespian Society?

18:10.900 --> 18:11.900
The Thespians.

18:11.900 --> 18:12.900
Yeah.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.220
I was in The Thespian Society too.

18:14.220 --> 18:18.260
I don't know if our listeners would believe that or a bunch of drama nerds.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.260
Yeah.

18:19.260 --> 18:20.260
Shocker.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.700
Lindsay, what's something fascinating about you?

18:22.700 --> 18:23.700
About me in real life?

18:23.700 --> 18:24.700
Yeah.

18:24.700 --> 18:25.700
Okay.

18:25.700 --> 18:26.700
This is the one I always use.

18:26.700 --> 18:32.420
My great uncle by blood is Phil Jackson, the ex-coach of the Lakers in the bowl school.

18:32.420 --> 18:33.420
What?

18:33.420 --> 18:34.420
Yeah.

18:34.420 --> 18:35.420
I don't talk to him.

18:35.420 --> 18:36.420
I don't know him.

18:36.420 --> 18:37.420
Sure.

18:37.940 --> 18:38.940
Yeah.

18:38.940 --> 18:39.940
My brother used to write him letters and stuff.

18:39.940 --> 18:40.940
Oh my God.

18:40.940 --> 18:41.940
Did he get a response?

18:41.940 --> 18:42.940
Yeah.

18:42.940 --> 18:43.940
He actually got some free tickets.

18:43.940 --> 18:44.940
Wow.

18:44.940 --> 18:45.940
I can't wait to know that.

18:45.940 --> 18:46.940
Can we offer that to our listeners?

18:46.940 --> 18:47.940
Absolutely.

18:47.940 --> 18:48.940
What's his address?

18:48.940 --> 18:49.940
Oh my God.

18:49.940 --> 18:53.820
Let's get that phone number, Asaac.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.820
She's like the zen master.

18:55.820 --> 18:56.820
I know.

18:56.820 --> 18:57.820
He wears a crystal around his neck.

18:57.820 --> 18:58.820
Oh my God.

18:58.820 --> 18:59.820
Yep.

18:59.820 --> 19:00.820
Oh my God.

19:00.820 --> 19:01.820
And so does Lindsay for the listeners at home.

19:01.820 --> 19:02.820
Oh yes.

19:02.820 --> 19:03.820
Every day.

19:03.820 --> 19:05.300
What is the crystal that you have around your neck right now?

19:05.300 --> 19:11.060
The crystal that I have around my neck right now is this very special invisible, which

19:11.060 --> 19:14.260
makes it more special, magic crystal.

19:14.260 --> 19:17.240
And I'm not going to tell you what it does, so you're just going to have to watch out.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.820
If you tell us what it does, will it not work anymore?

19:19.820 --> 19:20.820
Truly.

19:20.820 --> 19:21.820
Yes.

19:21.820 --> 19:25.180
I'm more of a fan of Bonam Veeve, but that's just me.

19:25.180 --> 19:26.180
Ali.

19:26.180 --> 19:29.140
Ali Jepsen is also- That's a joke.

19:29.140 --> 19:30.740
My husband makes jokes.

19:30.740 --> 19:31.920
Oh, Taylor.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.340
Thank you for pointing out my jokes.

19:33.380 --> 19:37.380
I really hope that you do that throughout your entire tenure on this podcast.

19:37.380 --> 19:40.380
Can I just say joke every time you say a joke?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.380
Yeah.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.380
As long as you say it exactly like that.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.380
Joke.

19:43.380 --> 19:44.380
That was already different.

19:44.380 --> 19:48.380
Ali, I don't appreciate you and I wish you would leave.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.380
Oh.

19:49.380 --> 19:50.380
Got it.

19:50.380 --> 19:51.380
Speaking of Ali.

19:51.380 --> 19:52.380
Ali Jepsen.

19:52.380 --> 19:53.380
Oh, can we say your last name?

19:53.380 --> 19:54.380
Did I dox you?

19:54.380 --> 19:55.380
No, you're fine.

19:55.380 --> 19:56.380
All right.

19:56.380 --> 19:57.380
Ali, welcome back.

19:57.380 --> 19:58.380
Thank you for playing Brett.

19:58.380 --> 19:59.380
Ah, yes.

19:59.380 --> 20:00.380
Of course.

20:00.380 --> 20:01.380
On the podcast for our listeners.

20:01.380 --> 20:02.380
Long live Brett.

20:02.420 --> 20:03.420
Long live Brett.

20:03.420 --> 20:04.420
Did Brett die?

20:04.420 --> 20:05.420
Brett died.

20:05.420 --> 20:06.420
But he's a robot, you know?

20:06.420 --> 20:07.420
Long die Brett.

20:07.420 --> 20:08.420
Robots come back.

20:08.420 --> 20:11.420
Spoilers for the podcast.

20:11.420 --> 20:16.300
Please, if this is your first episode, go back and listen to our back catalog.

20:16.300 --> 20:20.660
You might just be here to listen to Ali and Taylor and Lindsay and that's fine, but the

20:20.660 --> 20:25.220
story will be better if you- If you chose to start 50 something episodes

20:25.220 --> 20:26.220
in.

20:26.220 --> 20:27.220
True.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.220
47.

20:28.220 --> 20:29.220
You made a mistake.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.220
This is Lindsay speaking and I have to say, I have listened to every single episode.

20:31.220 --> 20:32.220
They're going to ignore our voices.

20:33.060 --> 20:34.060
Cool.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.060
Well, all right.

20:35.060 --> 20:37.340
Um, I- No, every single- Sorry.

20:37.340 --> 20:38.340
This is Zach.

20:38.340 --> 20:40.860
Every single time that you speak, you should joke.

20:40.860 --> 20:42.980
Taylor said that was Taylor.

20:42.980 --> 20:43.980
She said that.

20:43.980 --> 20:44.980
Joke.

20:44.980 --> 20:47.660
No one takes my jokes.

20:47.660 --> 20:48.660
Hey, real quick.

20:48.660 --> 20:49.880
Ali, what's your favorite joke?

20:49.880 --> 20:52.220
My favorite joke?

20:52.220 --> 20:54.220
What's the favorite joke that I've said?

20:54.220 --> 20:56.800
Of all the jokes I've said.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.740
When I was in fourth grade, I had no friends and I thought this joke will help me.

21:00.740 --> 21:05.700
It was from my joke book and it said, what did the needle say to the thread?

21:05.700 --> 21:06.700
I don't know.

21:06.700 --> 21:07.700
What did the needle say to the thread?

21:07.700 --> 21:10.300
The needle said, need a little help there?

21:10.300 --> 21:11.300
Ooh.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.300
And?

21:12.300 --> 21:13.300
And I still didn't have friends.

21:13.300 --> 21:14.300
Because friends of myself.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.300
To this day.

21:15.300 --> 21:16.300
To this day.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.620
I don't know who any of these people are.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.060
Well, thank you for being here.

21:21.060 --> 21:25.100
I'm excited to have you both on and you are both part of-

21:25.100 --> 21:26.100
Basement cast.

21:26.100 --> 21:27.100
Yeah, a comedy group.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.100
A comedy show.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.100
Me too.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.100
Can I be on it?

21:31.100 --> 21:33.100
No, Taylor, you're not in the group.

21:33.100 --> 21:36.380
We told you, you can only be in the one show.

21:36.380 --> 21:38.580
And then never come back because you talked about anal beads.

21:38.580 --> 21:43.420
I sort of thought that on the podcast was the appropriate time for me to ask to be on

21:43.420 --> 21:46.900
the show because you can't say no to my jokes.

21:46.900 --> 21:47.900
Joke.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.340
Taylor, you're basically a vet on the podcast.

21:53.340 --> 21:54.340
Thank you.

21:54.340 --> 21:57.860
Is that an appropriate time to say thank you?

21:57.860 --> 21:58.860
Thank you.

21:58.860 --> 21:59.860
Thank you.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.620
It's a husband and it's a PDM.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.620
PDM.

22:04.620 --> 22:05.620
DM.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.620
What?

22:06.620 --> 22:07.620
The DM.

22:07.620 --> 22:08.620
What's PDM?

22:08.620 --> 22:09.620
The Game Master DM.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.620
Yeah, welcome.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.620
The Dungeon Master.

22:11.620 --> 22:15.980
And if you had one extra hour of free time a day, how would you use it?

22:15.980 --> 22:17.500
I would pet my cats.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.700
Which one more than the other one?

22:19.700 --> 22:22.220
You're not supposed to say which cat you like more than the other.

22:22.220 --> 22:23.220
I like Ramona and Northern Ropo.

22:23.220 --> 22:24.220
They can understand.

22:24.220 --> 22:25.220
I know you feel that way.

22:25.220 --> 22:29.220
Which makes me want to choose Ropo because she's lonely.

22:29.580 --> 22:32.860
But I also kind of really like Ramona.

22:32.860 --> 22:33.860
It's hard to say.

22:33.860 --> 22:37.100
They're both such dynamic personalities.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.100
They're so different from each other.

22:39.100 --> 22:41.700
And that's enough cat talk for the podcast.

22:41.700 --> 22:42.700
Thanks for listening this far.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.700
I'm just trying to get on the percast.

22:44.700 --> 22:45.700
Oh my god.

22:45.700 --> 22:48.700
Why didn't you say joke after that?

22:48.700 --> 22:52.700
It's not a joke, it's the percast.

22:52.700 --> 22:53.700
It's a podcast.

22:53.700 --> 22:58.460
All right, we don't talk about other podcasts on this podcast.

22:58.700 --> 22:59.700
That is disgusting.

22:59.700 --> 23:03.700
And I'm going to tell Luke that you did that into his mic.

23:03.700 --> 23:07.700
Okay, Taylor told me that whatever his name is farts into this mic.

23:07.700 --> 23:10.700
Thomas did fart directly into that microphone.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.700
And I didn't change the screen for it.

23:13.700 --> 23:15.700
Oh, she's right up in it.

23:15.700 --> 23:16.700
Wow.

23:16.700 --> 23:17.700
I don't smell anything.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.700
That was an appropriate time to inhale into the microphone.

23:20.700 --> 23:24.700
But like I just said, if we could not do that during the recording session, that would be

23:24.700 --> 23:25.700
phenomenal.

23:25.700 --> 23:26.700
Inhale?

23:26.700 --> 23:27.700
You are disgusting.

23:27.940 --> 23:28.940
No inhaling.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.940
On this show, otherwise I have to edit out.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.940
Hold your breath and then talk.

23:32.940 --> 23:34.940
Yeah, like a swimmer.

23:34.940 --> 23:38.940
Can you hear this?

23:38.940 --> 23:43.940
Microphone etiquette is so easy to learn, so hard to master.

23:43.940 --> 23:49.940
Why did you say it like that?

23:49.940 --> 23:51.940
Ellie, stop laughing.

23:51.940 --> 23:52.940
This is not a time for comedy.

23:52.940 --> 23:54.940
You are being very inappropriate.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.940
Let's talk about the characters you guys have made.

23:57.180 --> 24:02.180
So like I said, we're going to be running two side by side stories, but it's only going

24:02.180 --> 24:03.180
to start that way.

24:03.180 --> 24:07.180
And these characters all go to the same high school, which is the Silas Cole K through

24:07.180 --> 24:09.180
12 in contention.

24:09.180 --> 24:14.180
A lot of different kids at this school and still not that many children there.

24:14.180 --> 24:16.180
And some of them have gone missing recently.

24:16.180 --> 24:18.180
We'll get into more of that later.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.180
Allie, tell us about your character.

24:20.180 --> 24:22.180
Judy Kringlehoff is my character.

24:22.180 --> 24:24.180
She's great.

24:24.420 --> 24:27.420
Judy goes to Silas Cole.

24:27.420 --> 24:29.420
She's a senior.

24:29.420 --> 24:31.420
She's a total outcast.

24:31.420 --> 24:38.420
She is still wearing the same clothes she bought for freshman year, which are too ill-fitting.

24:38.420 --> 24:41.420
They're like all tight and short, but in the wrong ways.

24:41.420 --> 24:45.420
Does she have like one of those Kringle shirts that when you buy it, it looks like it could

24:45.420 --> 24:46.420
fit a doll and then it expands?

24:46.420 --> 24:47.420
Yes.

24:47.420 --> 24:51.420
Oh, she for sure has those, but they're like uncomfortably tight on her where you're like

24:51.660 --> 24:53.660
This is not one size fits all.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.660
She never says the right thing.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.660
She's very anxious.

24:58.660 --> 25:01.660
She's always nervous about stuff.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.660
She just wants to be popular.

25:03.660 --> 25:08.660
She wants to be popular and she wants to be in a relationship with the coolest gal at

25:08.660 --> 25:11.660
school, but the odds are not in her favor.

25:11.660 --> 25:16.660
And you have parents who have already been mentioned on this podcast because your younger

25:16.660 --> 25:20.660
brother is Ken Kringlehoff, who's being played by Joe.

25:20.900 --> 25:21.900
Ken.

25:21.900 --> 25:25.900
Ken is what I was never able to be.

25:25.900 --> 25:31.900
Ken's the star child and I'm not a disappointment to my parents, but they're not super proud

25:31.900 --> 25:38.900
of where I am, which is like 17th row in band.

25:38.900 --> 25:43.900
So I'm just like, they give me a tuba, but they're like, don't put your mouth on it.

25:43.900 --> 25:46.900
Like just sit there with the tuba and pet it.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.900
And that's what you'll do.

25:48.900 --> 25:49.900
And that's what I do.

25:50.140 --> 25:55.140
So Ken's like, you know, he's a, uh, he's a star athlete star athlete.

25:55.140 --> 25:57.140
Like you said earlier, he's the star child.

25:57.140 --> 26:02.140
So Alistair Huxley, Alistair Crowley, who's Alistair Huxley?

26:02.140 --> 26:10.140
He wrote Brave New World and Alistair Crowley tried to bring about the star child.

26:10.140 --> 26:11.140
Sorry, no big deal.

26:11.140 --> 26:14.140
Just the spawn of Satan and not Ken Kringlehoff.

26:14.140 --> 26:19.140
You were speaking of having a little crush on the coolest girl in school.

26:19.380 --> 26:21.380
I have a crush on the coolest girl in school.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.380
Well, she's not the coolest, but she's like the rebel of school.

26:24.380 --> 26:28.380
And I'm so attracted to that, but she's kind of a bully to me.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.380
And who is this monster that you're speaking of?

26:30.380 --> 26:34.380
Her name is Liz.

26:34.380 --> 26:37.380
Say your own name, Lindsay.

26:37.380 --> 26:39.380
It's really hard to remember.

26:39.380 --> 26:40.380
My name is Liz.

26:40.380 --> 26:46.380
She only calls her Elizabeth cause she thinks it's more romantic, but that drives Liz crazy.

26:46.620 --> 26:49.620
Liz goes by Liz and that's fucking it.

26:49.620 --> 26:54.620
But Judy calls her Elizabeth because she thinks it's sexy and maybe one day Liz will realize.

26:54.620 --> 26:56.620
That she's been in Elizabeth all this time.

26:56.620 --> 26:59.620
That she's been in Elizabeth all this time and she's meant to be with Judy.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.620
Judy and Elizabeth, man.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.620
Juzabeth.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.620
I ship that herd.

27:05.620 --> 27:07.620
You ship it?

27:07.620 --> 27:08.620
It's a teen term, guys.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.620
All right, Liz, let's hear it.

27:10.620 --> 27:11.620
What you got?

27:11.860 --> 27:16.860
So Liz, you've already heard is like the rebel of school slash coolest in school.

27:16.860 --> 27:18.860
But I mean, not really.

27:18.860 --> 27:21.860
I'm not popular or I try not to be.

27:21.860 --> 27:22.860
I don't know.

27:22.860 --> 27:24.860
Picture like Rizzo.

27:24.860 --> 27:25.860
Is that her name?

27:25.860 --> 27:27.860
From Greece?

27:27.860 --> 27:29.860
Yeah, I thought you were mispronouncing Lizzo.

27:29.860 --> 27:30.860
No, no, no.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.860
That's what he said earlier.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.860
That's why I second guessed it.

27:34.860 --> 27:35.860
Rizzo from Greece, yeah?

27:35.860 --> 27:36.860
Yes.

27:36.860 --> 27:37.860
Yes.

27:37.860 --> 27:38.860
The original Lizzo.

27:38.860 --> 27:39.860
No, definitely not.

27:39.860 --> 27:40.860
I'm sorry.

27:41.100 --> 27:42.100
I take it back.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.100
Lizzo doesn't deserve that.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.100
No.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.100
But yeah, picture me.

27:45.100 --> 27:46.100
Picture me.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.100
I'm Sandra Dee.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.100
Oh.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.100
Get out of this room.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.100
Don't picture that.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.100
Look at me.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.100
It's actually, fuck.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.100
God damn it.

27:53.100 --> 27:54.100
Greece knowledge.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.100
Shit.

27:56.100 --> 28:01.100
In high school, Zach played Danny DeVito.

28:01.100 --> 28:02.100
I did.

28:02.100 --> 28:03.100
I played Danny DeVito.

28:03.100 --> 28:04.100
Danny DeVito in Greece.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.100
Oh my God, Zach.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.100
As a sophomore in high school.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.100
That's real.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.100
That's real.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.100
He did that.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.100
I didn't know him back then.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.340
It's okay, because I didn't know him.

28:12.340 --> 28:15.340
That's our bedroom floor play.

28:15.340 --> 28:17.340
Jesus Christ.

28:17.340 --> 28:19.340
We didn't need to know.

28:19.340 --> 28:21.340
Look at me.

28:21.340 --> 28:23.340
I'm just here.

28:23.340 --> 28:26.340
I just love her voice so much.

28:26.340 --> 28:28.340
All right.

28:28.340 --> 28:33.340
Lindsay, let's talk more about Lizz and less about my high school musical career.

28:33.340 --> 28:35.340
Lizz Lonklin.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.340
Okay, yeah.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.340
So you're picturing Rizzo.

28:38.340 --> 28:39.340
I'm picturing Rizzo.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.580
I'm picturing Lizzo with an R.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.580
The little rat from Muppets.

28:43.580 --> 28:44.580
Oh, no.

28:44.580 --> 28:45.580
Like a lamb, not the rat.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.580
Like a lamb, not the rat.

28:47.580 --> 28:48.580
Oh, shoot.

28:48.580 --> 28:49.580
No.

28:49.580 --> 28:50.580
That's not it.

28:50.580 --> 28:51.580
That's not the right one.

28:51.580 --> 28:56.580
So leather jacket, cigarette, Doc Martens, and bitch.

28:56.580 --> 28:59.580
She's wearing a bitch.

28:59.580 --> 29:01.580
She's wearing a bitch.

29:01.580 --> 29:03.580
She also is a bitch.

29:03.580 --> 29:07.580
Well, I'll try to find a way to love Lizz in our own way.

29:07.820 --> 29:09.820
I'm sure by the end you will love Lizz.

29:09.820 --> 29:10.820
I love Lizz.

29:10.820 --> 29:11.820
Right?

29:11.820 --> 29:12.820
Right.

29:12.820 --> 29:13.820
You already love Lizz.

29:13.820 --> 29:14.820
I love her so much.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.820
Try to make a likable character that way when I kill it, it'll be better.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.820
It'll be likable in some way.

29:19.820 --> 29:20.820
All right.

29:20.820 --> 29:21.820
Perfect.

29:21.820 --> 29:23.820
Taylor, you're also here.

29:23.820 --> 29:29.820
My name is Sharon Berryman, but I prefer to go by Shadow, and if anyone in this room doesn't

29:29.820 --> 29:32.820
call me Shadow, I'm going to fucking lose my mind.

29:32.820 --> 29:33.820
Oh, shit.

29:33.820 --> 29:34.820
Just kidding.

29:34.820 --> 29:35.820
Okay, Sharon.

29:36.060 --> 29:39.060
My dad is listening to this, and I didn't say the F word.

29:39.060 --> 29:41.060
I have never said it in my entire life.

29:41.060 --> 29:42.060
I don't even know what it is.

29:42.060 --> 29:43.060
Farts?

29:43.060 --> 29:44.060
Farts.

29:44.060 --> 29:46.060
I'm going to fart and lose my mind.

29:46.060 --> 29:53.060
Okay, so Sharon Berryman used to be a cheerleader, like used to be popular, very bendy, come

29:53.060 --> 30:01.060
from money, and then a particular event happened in my life that led me in a different direction,

30:01.300 --> 30:05.300
and now I'm obsessed with death in all forms.

30:05.300 --> 30:08.300
Wait, what are the different forms of death, please?

30:08.300 --> 30:09.300
Well, like-

30:09.300 --> 30:10.300
And first, how many are there?

30:10.300 --> 30:12.300
New death, mid-death, old death.

30:12.300 --> 30:13.300
Great.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.300
Your classic deaths.

30:14.300 --> 30:20.300
You know, like I hang out in cemeteries to get my old death.

30:20.300 --> 30:21.300
I-

30:21.300 --> 30:23.300
Past death.

30:23.300 --> 30:24.300
Yeah.

30:24.300 --> 30:30.300
I also, I like to spend time in funeral homes and attend funerals for like-

30:30.540 --> 30:31.540
Current death.

30:31.540 --> 30:32.540
My mid-death, yeah.

30:32.540 --> 30:33.540
Oh, mid-death, right.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.540
Yeah, but then I go to hospitals for like that new, new.

30:36.540 --> 30:37.540
Oh, shit.

30:37.540 --> 30:38.540
Jesus.

30:38.540 --> 30:39.540
Oh my God.

30:39.540 --> 30:43.540
You're like 16 years old.

30:43.540 --> 30:44.540
17.

30:44.540 --> 30:47.540
The nurses at the contention clinic all know Shadow.

30:47.540 --> 30:50.540
They're like, will someone get Shadow out of here again?

30:50.540 --> 30:51.540
Shadow, get out.

30:51.540 --> 30:52.540
How'd she get in here?

30:52.540 --> 30:56.540
I used to be a candy striper, but then they kept finding me in the-

30:56.540 --> 30:59.540
She's leering at the close to deads again.

30:59.780 --> 31:00.780
Yeah.

31:00.780 --> 31:02.780
She's like, but don't you want to die?

31:02.780 --> 31:05.780
Well, the whole thing is like, I really want to speak to the other side.

31:05.780 --> 31:11.780
So I sort of, it's like prudent for me to be there for all processes of death.

31:11.780 --> 31:12.780
Yeah.

31:12.780 --> 31:14.780
That absolutely makes sense.

31:14.780 --> 31:20.780
So we are going to kick off actually role playing in three, let's get the music.

31:21.020 --> 31:27.020
Later Zach, put in the music right now.

31:41.020 --> 31:48.020
So the story starts inside the public library of contention, a place that we have seen before.

31:48.260 --> 31:53.260
It is a rarely used building because as one might suspect,

31:53.260 --> 31:58.260
the population of contention owns all their books.

31:58.260 --> 32:02.260
That one was just for me.

32:02.260 --> 32:07.260
Standing behind the entry desk, there are two individuals.

32:07.260 --> 32:14.260
One is either an extremely young or an extremely old man with a sweater vest and sleeve tattoos

32:14.260 --> 32:17.260
on both arms, I believe.

32:17.500 --> 32:23.500
The other one's a young man who is wearing a sweater with another sweater wrapped around

32:23.500 --> 32:25.500
over his shoulders.

32:25.500 --> 32:31.500
And on top of that one, he has a second sweater that is wrapped around his waist as well.

32:31.500 --> 32:36.500
And he is wearing gold rings on all of his fingers.

32:36.500 --> 32:41.500
And the young man in all the sweaters looks up at the three of you as you walk into the

32:41.500 --> 32:45.500
contention public library and he says, oh, hello.

32:45.740 --> 32:50.740
Thank you so much for coming to the contention public library, whatever it is that we could

32:50.740 --> 32:52.740
do for you today on a day such as this.

32:52.740 --> 32:56.740
Is there anything in particular that you might be here of any interest?

32:56.740 --> 33:01.740
Is there many lands within these pages that we can, I don't know if you know me.

33:01.740 --> 33:07.740
My name is Steven pages, cousin of the esteemed Carrie pages, valedictorian of Silas Cole.

33:07.740 --> 33:09.740
Yeah, I don't care about any of that.

33:09.740 --> 33:14.740
I just want you to point us in the direction of the occult books.

33:14.980 --> 33:16.980
Your gentleman's ears perk up.

33:16.980 --> 33:21.980
Oh, my sweet little patty cakes, please follow me and I'll lead you there.

33:21.980 --> 33:25.980
I do wish you would tell me what it is you're looking for.

33:25.980 --> 33:29.980
Shadow, he's like really scaring me right now.

33:29.980 --> 33:34.980
Could you just go back, take us to what we want to look at without him coming with us?

33:34.980 --> 33:40.980
Look, sir, we just want you to point us in the direction of the occult books and that

33:40.980 --> 33:41.980
would be just fine.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.980
Oh, yes, of course.

33:43.980 --> 33:48.980
I'm so sorry for intruding on your girly time.

33:48.980 --> 33:52.980
Can you just explain what kind of book it is we're looking for?

33:52.980 --> 33:56.980
Yeah, we're looking for any kind of book that has to do with voodoo.

33:56.980 --> 33:58.980
Oh, voodoo you say?

33:58.980 --> 33:59.980
Yes, of course.

33:59.980 --> 34:05.980
I have at least one book that is about voodoo and it is right in the occult section and

34:05.980 --> 34:11.980
Steven pages begins walking you to the back of the library and there is a small room in

34:11.980 --> 34:18.580
the back with a curtain over it and there's a sign that is hanging off of one nail and

34:18.580 --> 34:27.540
it says occult but the OC in front has been like crossed out and inside you find a bookshelf

34:27.540 --> 34:35.280
with six shelves and each shelf has one book on it and there is a shelf marked voodoo on

34:35.280 --> 34:43.980
which there is a single book and it is entitled voodoo.

34:43.980 --> 34:46.380
Do you want to voodoo?

34:46.380 --> 34:48.480
I do want to voodoo.

34:48.480 --> 34:52.280
If you want to voodoo, this would be the place to do voodoo.

34:52.280 --> 34:53.880
I would like to voodoo.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.280
Okay, perfect.

34:55.280 --> 34:58.680
This is exactly the book that I was hoping would be here.

34:58.680 --> 35:04.480
Okay, if we just flip to page 419, we're gonna find exactly how to get rid of your

35:04.480 --> 35:05.480
dude.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.080
We're not looking to get rid of a dude.

35:08.080 --> 35:12.480
I want to torture Britney.

35:12.480 --> 35:14.480
She slept with my boyfriend.

35:14.480 --> 35:18.480
Oh my god, that's like so mean of Britney to do.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.480
Right?

35:19.480 --> 35:22.480
He was so lucky to have you.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.480
You're beautiful.

35:23.480 --> 35:24.480
You're like so beautiful.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.480
He was so lucky to have you and you're so beautiful and pretty.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.480
And also smart.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.480
He was so lucky.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.480
Okay, go swallow a dime, Judy.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.480
Calm down.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.480
Okay, let's just check this out and go back to your house list.

35:37.480 --> 35:42.880
Sounds like a plan, but real quick, looking at page 419, you see there are a few ingredients

35:42.880 --> 35:46.080
necessary to performing this ritual.

35:46.080 --> 35:51.080
There's also a bit of fine print at the bottom of each page that states this book voodoo

35:51.080 --> 35:57.280
is merely a collection of rituals put together by a woman named Lulu Fufu Voodoo and is in

35:57.280 --> 36:02.080
no way associated with any religious ideologies or practices with a similar name.

36:02.080 --> 36:08.080
Also, page 419 notes this ritual must be performed surrounded by trees.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.680
Okay guys, that sounds like pretty scary.

36:10.680 --> 36:11.680
We should just shut up.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.080
And it needs to be done at night.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.080
There's a woods right by my house that would be perfect.

36:17.080 --> 36:20.880
I go there in the middle of the night naked all the time.

36:20.880 --> 36:21.880
That sounds perfect.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.080
Okay, but like we have to be there in the dark because...

36:25.080 --> 36:26.080
Judy!

36:27.080 --> 36:28.880
Judy, don't worry.

36:28.880 --> 36:32.880
We'll hold hands and bask in the moonlight the entire time.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.880
It'll be beautiful.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.880
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, but in the dark...

36:37.880 --> 36:38.880
Judy!

36:38.880 --> 36:40.880
My god!

36:40.880 --> 36:46.480
So real quick, let's make up a list of ingredients for performing this spell.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.780
I will start.

36:47.780 --> 36:54.880
You need the left pinky toe of a dead squirrel.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.680
Oh, okay.

36:56.680 --> 37:01.480
Allie, what is the second thing that you might need for this voodoo spell?

37:01.480 --> 37:07.680
This spell says that we need dirt scraped from the earth after it's been stepped on

37:07.680 --> 37:10.680
by a calf that's menstruating.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.680
How the fuck are we gonna find that?

37:15.680 --> 37:23.680
Third thing is the blood from a former cheerleader gone goth that goes to...

37:24.480 --> 37:25.480
Silas Cole K through 12.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.480
Yep, Silas Cole K through 12.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.480
I think I know where I can get that.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.480
It says that in the book.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.480
Yep.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.480
Called voodoo.

37:32.480 --> 37:33.480
Yep, voodoo do you.

37:33.480 --> 37:34.480
Do you voodoo.

37:34.480 --> 37:35.480
Do you voodoo.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.480
Do you voodoo.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.480
Do you voodoo.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.480
To do voodoo.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.480
Lindsay, what is the fourth thing?

37:40.480 --> 37:41.480
Okay, final?

37:41.480 --> 37:42.480
The fourth and final?

37:42.480 --> 37:43.480
Fourth and final thing.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.480
The fourth and final thing.

37:44.480 --> 37:49.480
I'm gonna say, because I have to pee so bad right now.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.480
Urine?

37:51.280 --> 37:54.280
Which we all know is also bird poop.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.280
What?

37:55.280 --> 37:57.280
Wait, we all know that?

37:57.280 --> 37:58.280
We all know that?

37:58.280 --> 37:59.280
When a bird pees, it also poops.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.280
Is that why it's so runny?

38:00.280 --> 38:01.280
It's mixed.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.280
Yes.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.280
Oh my god.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.280
Actually, that's what mine does too.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.280
What, your bird?

38:06.280 --> 38:07.280
Yeah, it's mixed.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.280
Oh, hell.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.280
And if you're a bird, I'm a bird.

38:13.280 --> 38:18.680
Smash cut to you guys slamming the book closed and then realizing that nobody has a library

38:18.680 --> 38:19.680
card.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.880
Dear, dear, dear, what will you do?

38:22.880 --> 38:25.180
Look, we need this book.

38:25.180 --> 38:26.180
We need it now.

38:26.180 --> 38:33.040
Oh, my dear, sweet little baby, there is a process and there is a three day processing

38:33.040 --> 38:34.040
fee.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.040
Fuck this.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.040
How do libraries work?

38:37.040 --> 38:42.880
Okay, I don't know if this will help, but my parents' names are Chris and Krista Krinklehoff.

38:42.880 --> 38:43.880
Oh, your parents?

38:43.880 --> 38:44.880
Oh my goodness.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.100
Are the Krinklehoff's?

38:47.100 --> 38:51.580
We play bridge with them every Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.

38:51.580 --> 38:52.580
That's right.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.580
Me and my old friend, Gerald Fingersen, and your parents-

38:55.580 --> 38:58.460
Thank you for saying my name right, my dear boy.

38:58.460 --> 38:59.780
We'll just put it on their account.

38:59.780 --> 39:01.660
Thank you so much.

39:01.660 --> 39:05.100
Would you like a poppy seed muffin for your walk home?

39:05.100 --> 39:07.100
I'm allergic to poppies and peas.

39:07.100 --> 39:10.700
Oh my god, me too, twinsies.

39:10.700 --> 39:13.780
Smash cut to you guys leaving the library with the book.

39:13.780 --> 39:18.160
Smash cut to you guys on the side of the road, all bent over a dead squirrel, cutting

39:18.160 --> 39:21.960
off the pinky toe of the roadkill.

39:21.960 --> 39:28.860
Smash cut to you guys all in a field where there is a cow that is bleeding out of its

39:28.860 --> 39:35.820
lady butt, and then you guys scoop the dirt into a bucket or something.

39:35.820 --> 39:40.880
Smash cut to you guys just standing in a parking lot, looking up, and there's a bunch of birds

39:40.880 --> 39:41.880
in the sky.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.480
They're all just waiting.

39:44.480 --> 39:52.120
Bird shits on the ground, and you guys collect the not shit, not piss, but both.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.120
Both.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.120
The mixture of both.

39:54.120 --> 39:59.520
And then you guys get a cocktail strainer and strain out the piss, because it says urine.

39:59.520 --> 40:05.800
Smash cut to you guys all standing outside of one of your cars, and you're talking about

40:05.800 --> 40:08.160
how to get the blood part.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.320
Liz, do you have that squirrel toe?

40:11.760 --> 40:17.640
Yeah, I do, but my question is, how the hell are we gonna get this goth cheerleader blood?

40:17.640 --> 40:21.520
I just had this idea, and my idea is that it's me.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.520
What?

40:22.520 --> 40:23.520
Yeah.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.520
Does you not know that I used to be a cheerleader?

40:25.520 --> 40:26.520
Gross.

40:26.520 --> 40:29.600
I can do seven back bends in a row.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.680
And then Shadow does seven back bends in a row.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.680
Whatever the fuck that is.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.680
And also, do you do them in a row?

40:35.680 --> 40:40.600
No, back bend and then back handspring to another back bend, but they're slow.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.080
It's a gymnastics thing.

40:42.080 --> 40:46.240
Okay, so do you wanna get your blood out now, or do you wanna let it out later?

40:46.240 --> 40:51.800
No, I wanna let it out now if Liz will just give me the frickin' squirrel toe.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.320
Why do I need to give you the squirrel toe for you to let out the blood?

40:54.320 --> 40:55.320
It's easy, Liz.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.320
It's easy.

40:56.320 --> 41:01.400
You just take the nail of the squirrel toe and I scratch it on my finger and blood comes

41:01.400 --> 41:02.400
out.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.880
Well, where are you gonna put the blood?

41:03.880 --> 41:07.080
Into my hand.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.080
And then put it-

41:09.080 --> 41:10.080
Really gross.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.080
Judy.

41:11.080 --> 41:12.080
Judy.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.080
I'm really sorry, Elizabeth.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.080
Please.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.080
I'm sorry.

41:15.080 --> 41:19.360
I've done just this kind of ritual before and it always goes fine, okay?

41:19.360 --> 41:22.000
You're gonna just hold the blood until we get into the deep woods?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.280
Well, I just figured that maybe you would be okay.

41:24.280 --> 41:27.040
I do have a vial of- Well, then what the hell?

41:27.040 --> 41:29.000
Well, it's already- Get the vial.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.040
It's already holding someone else's blood, but I guess I can pour that out.

41:33.040 --> 41:40.400
Um, I hate to be, like, a bitch right now, but, like, who's blood is in it?

41:40.400 --> 41:41.720
I don't want to talk about it.

41:41.720 --> 41:45.080
It's my ex.

41:45.080 --> 41:50.760
It was just a mutual agreement to not date anymore and then I just got a little bit of

41:50.760 --> 41:51.760
his blood after.

41:51.760 --> 41:52.760
Yeah, I don't care even.

41:52.760 --> 41:57.720
If Elizabeth doesn't care, I don't care either.

41:57.720 --> 42:01.960
Okay, let's just gather all of our things up.

42:01.960 --> 42:04.160
We'll go have a sleepover at my house.

42:04.160 --> 42:08.260
My parents are, like, totally chill and they don't care about anything, even me.

42:08.260 --> 42:13.600
They don't, like, even care if I love, live, or die, and then we can go into the forest

42:13.600 --> 42:14.600
tonight.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.680
They don't care if you love, live, or die.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.680
Love was part of it.

42:18.680 --> 42:20.240
But they really want you to laugh.

42:20.240 --> 42:30.760
All right, so let us, Tomato, go back in time to, like, two days ago when I believe it was

42:30.760 --> 42:40.760
Shadow who told Liz that her boyfriend, Derek, was seen cheating on her with Brittany.

42:40.760 --> 42:42.680
Let's cut back to that scene.

42:42.680 --> 42:46.360
The bell rings and you guys are all standing outside of one of your lockers.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.360
Hey, Liz.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.360
What?

42:48.360 --> 42:49.360
How are you doing today?

42:49.360 --> 42:50.360
Sorry, I'm just trying to be nice.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.360
I'm just trying to start a nice conversation with you.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.720
Could you just, like, not be a bitch for one second?

42:55.720 --> 42:56.720
Could you just, like, get to the point?

42:56.720 --> 42:57.720
Yeah, that's a really good point.

42:57.880 --> 43:01.480
Hey, if you guys are friends, you shouldn't talk to each other like that.

43:01.480 --> 43:02.760
Who the hell are you?

43:02.760 --> 43:05.840
I forgot my name, but I was in the last episode.

43:05.840 --> 43:10.720
Well, we're not friends yet.

43:10.720 --> 43:14.160
It's just a budding friendship that's gonna happen, probably.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.040
Oh, then this seems like a nice start.

43:17.040 --> 43:23.020
Anyway, Liz, I just wanted to check in on you because you know your boyfriend's been

43:23.020 --> 43:24.320
cheating on you.

43:24.320 --> 43:25.320
What?

43:25.320 --> 43:26.960
Oh, you didn't know?

43:26.960 --> 43:28.440
With fucking who?

43:28.440 --> 43:30.280
I don't know, some girl named, like, Britney.

43:30.280 --> 43:38.000
I think she goes to, like, Spinkbonk High, which is, like, 15 miles down the road.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Fucking Spinkbonk?

43:39.000 --> 43:44.440
I know, it's, like, most of them are total trash, but, like, I think she's kind of cute.

43:44.440 --> 43:47.120
I don't want to, like, put salt in the wound, but...

43:47.120 --> 43:52.240
Listen, Elizabeth, there's no way that that girl is cuter than you.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.240
There's literally no way.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.880
I mean, there's a way, but...

43:54.880 --> 43:57.000
No, like, she couldn't be cuter than you.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.120
What a- what a be-on.

43:59.120 --> 44:05.600
Anyway, I just thought you should know that, like, Derek is not available, like, emotionally

44:05.600 --> 44:09.760
anymore and I just, like, really want to be there for you right now.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.120
Elizabeth, like, what can we do for you?

44:12.120 --> 44:17.000
Can we, like, touch you or help you in any way?

44:17.000 --> 44:22.080
Can we touch you?

44:22.080 --> 44:24.080
What's your love language?

44:24.480 --> 44:25.480
Excuse me, what's your name?

44:25.480 --> 44:27.480
Can we buy you any gifts?

44:27.480 --> 44:32.480
Do you want to be, like, quality time?

44:32.480 --> 44:35.480
Excuse me, who the hell are you?

44:35.480 --> 44:37.480
Um, my name's Judy.

44:37.480 --> 44:44.480
Um, I sit behind you in English lint, and I sit behind you and I smell your perfume

44:44.480 --> 44:48.480
a lot, even though I think it's not really perfume, I think it's just the cigarettes

44:48.480 --> 44:51.480
that you chew up after you smoke them.

44:51.880 --> 44:54.880
Get your shit together, Judy.

44:54.880 --> 45:00.880
Is that the same type of cigarette you've been hoarding in your purse and ziplock bags?

45:00.880 --> 45:03.880
I don't even know what you're talking about.

45:03.880 --> 45:06.880
I collect trash off the side of the road because I'm a good person.

45:06.880 --> 45:09.880
It's not just the trash.

45:09.880 --> 45:10.880
You make a person?

45:10.880 --> 45:11.880
Because I'm a good person.

45:11.880 --> 45:14.880
What, you make a person out of the cigarette butts?

45:14.880 --> 45:15.880
That's really cool.

45:15.880 --> 45:16.880
That's, like, art, man.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.880
No, I said I'm a good person.

45:19.280 --> 45:20.280
Are you gay Arnold style?

45:20.280 --> 45:21.280
Like, in your closet?

45:21.280 --> 45:24.280
I don't, I'm not allowed to watch Arnold.

45:24.280 --> 45:27.280
It's not Arnold.

45:27.280 --> 45:33.280
Anyway, Liz, I'm really sorry that this has happened to you, so, like...

45:33.280 --> 45:36.280
Yeah, whatever, I'm already over it, but here's the deal.

45:36.280 --> 45:38.280
I'm gonna need your help.

45:38.280 --> 45:40.280
I mean, I'm kind of busy on...

45:40.280 --> 45:43.280
No, no, no, we can, no, we can help her, Shadow.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.280
You can totally reschedule that.

45:44.280 --> 45:45.280
Yeah, you can help me.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.280
You have time.

45:46.280 --> 45:47.280
I know your schedule.

45:47.280 --> 45:48.280
I have orchestra rehearsal.

45:48.680 --> 45:49.680
Shadow, Shadow, listen, we can help her.

45:49.680 --> 45:50.680
I'll help you.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.680
I'll do your orchestra for you.

45:52.680 --> 45:56.680
Okay, only if it's something I'm actually interested in will I help you.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.680
So, like, what is it you even want to do?

45:58.680 --> 46:03.180
Smash cut to you guys in the car on the way to the woods that night after you've spent

46:03.180 --> 46:08.760
some time at Shadow's house and Shadow is, like, holding up the vial, like, flicking

46:08.760 --> 46:14.280
it and it's got her blood already inside of it and you guys have all of the ingredients

46:14.280 --> 46:18.080
necessary to do voodoo and who is driving?

46:18.080 --> 46:20.280
And three, two, one point at the person who's driving.

46:20.280 --> 46:21.280
Three, two, one.

46:21.280 --> 46:25.280
That is two points at Shadow, one point at Judy.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.280
So, Shadow is driving.

46:27.280 --> 46:28.280
Shadow, what kind of car do you have?

46:28.280 --> 46:29.280
Oh, I have...

46:29.280 --> 46:35.280
So, my parents have a ton of money, so I have a Lamborghini.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.280
Shit.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.280
Weird.

46:38.280 --> 46:39.280
Super weird.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.280
It's what I always chose in the...

46:41.280 --> 46:42.280
Weird flex, but all right.

46:42.280 --> 46:45.280
It's what I always chose in the game Mash for my car.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.280
Mash.

46:46.280 --> 46:47.280
Mash.

46:47.280 --> 46:51.280
Me and my brother always had a VW Beetle on there.

46:51.280 --> 46:52.280
We were very into beetles.

46:52.280 --> 46:53.280
Yeah, is that going to happen?

46:53.280 --> 46:55.280
I just had this conversation over the weekend.

46:55.280 --> 47:00.280
Lamborghini 2017, even though it was 2013 when this all went down.

47:00.280 --> 47:01.280
Nope, not even close.

47:01.280 --> 47:02.280
Yeah, times don't matter.

47:02.280 --> 47:03.280
Nope.

47:03.280 --> 47:04.280
Oh, it's the 90s.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.280
Times don't matter.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.280
Oh, it's the 90s.

47:08.280 --> 47:15.280
It is a 2017 Lamborghini, and you guys are flying down the road to the contention woods.

47:15.280 --> 47:20.280
When you turn right onto the gravel road that takes you into the parking lot of the contention

47:20.280 --> 47:23.280
woods, I need you to roll a drive check for me.

47:23.280 --> 47:25.280
I have a 4D drive.

47:25.280 --> 47:26.280
All right.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.280
Excuse me.

47:27.280 --> 47:28.280
I'm so sorry.

47:28.280 --> 47:29.280
I'm sorry.

47:29.280 --> 47:30.280
I'm sorry.

47:30.280 --> 47:31.280
I'm sorry.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.280
I'm sorry.

47:32.280 --> 47:33.280
I'm sorry.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.280
And I got a 4.

47:34.280 --> 47:39.280
There is a possum that walks directly in front of you, and you dodge.

47:39.280 --> 47:41.280
No, I don't want to, because-

47:41.280 --> 47:43.280
You drive however best you see fit.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.280
There's a possum staring you directly in the eyes.

47:46.280 --> 47:51.280
You can see that there is fear in its ears.

47:51.280 --> 47:53.280
Confront your death, little possum.

47:53.280 --> 47:55.280
Today's your day to go.

47:55.280 --> 47:59.280
And then I go straight for it.

47:59.280 --> 48:05.280
It looks, and then it turns, and it sits on its back legs and just freezes right in the

48:05.280 --> 48:09.280
headlights, and your front bumper just crushes its face.

48:09.280 --> 48:15.280
I immediately pull over to go examine.

48:15.280 --> 48:19.280
Feel free to chip in with your thoughts on what I'm doing at any time.

48:19.280 --> 48:22.280
Judy's really freaking out, if that's any.

48:22.280 --> 48:25.280
You guys, come look.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.280
He's super, super dead.

48:27.280 --> 48:34.280
He's definitely in a better, or different, or maybe non-existent place, but I'm so happy for him.

48:34.280 --> 48:38.280
I'm smoking a cigarette, and I'm like, ugh, shut up.

48:38.280 --> 48:44.280
No, but really, what do you think the last thoughts this possum had before he died?

48:44.280 --> 48:47.280
Oh.

48:47.280 --> 48:50.280
Shadow.

48:50.280 --> 48:52.280
I have a question.

48:52.280 --> 48:53.280
Do possi-

48:53.280 --> 48:54.280
What is that?

48:54.280 --> 48:56.280
Do they could happen when they die?

48:56.280 --> 49:03.280
I'm not actually sure I prescribe to any particular religion that has a heaven and hell, but if

49:03.280 --> 49:08.280
that's what you want to tell yourself, Judy, then that's fine.

49:08.280 --> 49:19.280
Okay, this possum was maybe named Stacy, and he went to heaven.

49:19.280 --> 49:22.280
Okay, Judy, should we bury Stacy?

49:22.280 --> 49:25.280
Yeah, can we bury Stacy?

49:25.280 --> 49:27.280
Okay, does anyone ... Oh, wait, it's my car.

49:27.280 --> 49:32.280
Let me go grab my cemetery shovel, and we'll scrape him off the pavement.

49:32.280 --> 49:34.280
My God.

49:34.280 --> 49:38.280
I love role-playing.

49:38.280 --> 49:42.280
Okay, so you guys bury Stacey?

49:42.280 --> 49:43.280
Stacy.

49:43.280 --> 49:44.280
Davey.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.280
Davey Stacey?

49:45.280 --> 49:49.280
During the eulogy, I call him Davey.

49:49.280 --> 49:50.280
Just to piss Judy off.

49:50.280 --> 49:53.280
Just to remind that you don't care.

49:53.280 --> 49:59.280
You look up, and you see that you are already in the parking lot of the Contingent Woods,

49:59.280 --> 50:04.280
and looking around, you see five cars.

50:04.280 --> 50:08.280
One car has a notice on the driver's side window taped to it.

50:08.280 --> 50:12.280
Another car has a boot on one of the wheels.

50:12.280 --> 50:19.280
There is also an old Bronco, like an SUV, got a lift kit on it, and it is right up next

50:19.280 --> 50:23.280
to this little shack at the entrance, like the Park Ranger shack.

50:23.280 --> 50:33.280
You would also notice a 91 Firebird that belongs to the older brother of Ash Hornbeam,

50:33.280 --> 50:38.280
and you would know the older brother of Ash Hornbeam is like a party animal.

50:38.280 --> 50:44.280
And then also, Judy, your mom's minivan.

50:45.280 --> 50:52.280
Guys, I don't want to freak you out right now, but I'm pretty sure that's my mom's minivan

50:52.280 --> 50:54.280
that's parked here.

50:54.280 --> 50:56.280
Judy, why would that freak us out?

50:56.280 --> 50:59.280
What if I get in trouble for being here?

50:59.280 --> 51:02.280
You're 17 years old, Judy.

51:02.280 --> 51:06.280
I know, but it's after 6.30 PM, which is my curfew.

51:06.280 --> 51:07.280
My God.

51:07.280 --> 51:13.280
You already told your mom you were staying the night at my house, so if I see Krista,

51:14.280 --> 51:18.280
I'll shove you down into a ditch.

51:18.280 --> 51:19.280
That would be really good.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.280
Do you promise to shove me in the ditch?

51:20.280 --> 51:21.280
Promise me.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.280
I promise.

51:22.280 --> 51:26.280
Pinky promise with my whole life and death and afterlife maybe.

51:26.280 --> 51:29.280
I would love to shove you into a ditch right now.

51:29.280 --> 51:33.280
Oh my God, Elizabeth, thank you for saying that.

51:33.280 --> 51:36.280
Okay, if you promise, I'm totally fine, but then it's fine.

51:36.280 --> 51:38.280
Okay, let's go.

51:38.280 --> 51:39.280
Boo!

51:39.280 --> 51:42.280
An old man jumps up toward you.

51:42.280 --> 51:43.280
And says boo?

51:43.280 --> 51:44.280
And says boo.

51:44.280 --> 51:45.280
That's odd.

51:45.280 --> 51:46.280
Okay.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.280
Yeah.

51:47.280 --> 51:48.280
Is it Halloween?

51:48.280 --> 51:49.280
Nope, it is fall, but.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.280
It's so spooky season, though.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.280
It is spooky times.

51:52.280 --> 51:53.280
Spooky times.

51:53.280 --> 52:00.280
She is wearing a forest ranger uniform that is a state forest ranger uniform.

52:00.280 --> 52:07.280
I believe Shadow, since she comes out here often and bathes in the moonlight nude.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.280
Naked.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.280
Typical.

52:09.280 --> 52:10.280
Power giving.

52:10.280 --> 52:11.280
Very cool.

52:11.280 --> 52:12.280
Moonbeam, etc.

52:12.280 --> 52:15.280
So, you would know that this is not the normal ranger.

52:15.280 --> 52:20.280
Normally, there's a guy named Jeb who's a contention park ranger, but this is a different

52:20.280 --> 52:21.280
guy.

52:21.280 --> 52:23.280
And he says, hello there!

52:23.280 --> 52:31.280
Ah, you can see here, the name is Woodrow and I am a forest ranger and I need you guys

52:31.280 --> 52:34.280
to fill out some forms over here for me in the shack.

52:35.280 --> 52:38.280
Did you decide to be a ranger because your name has wood in it?

52:38.280 --> 52:42.280
That is 100% why I decided to become a ranger.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.280
Interesting.

52:43.280 --> 52:44.280
Anyway.

52:44.280 --> 52:46.280
It was either that or a boat driver.

52:46.280 --> 52:51.280
This is public property, so I think we're just going to be on our way.

52:51.280 --> 52:54.280
So, she comes out here naked and dances.

52:54.280 --> 52:55.280
This is Lindsey.

52:55.280 --> 53:02.280
So, she comes out here and dances naked and Jeb is usually here for that?

53:02.280 --> 53:08.280
Yeah, this is Zach and I think she probably goes deep into the woods before.

53:08.280 --> 53:10.280
Yeah, I don't take my clothes off in the parking lot.

53:10.280 --> 53:13.280
So, she sees Jeb before she gets naked.

53:13.280 --> 53:14.280
That is what I assumed.

53:14.280 --> 53:15.280
Pre and post nakedness.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.280
I was a little disturbed.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.280
Oh, okay.

53:17.280 --> 53:18.280
Alright.

53:18.280 --> 53:19.280
Pre and post, but not mid.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.280
Not dirt.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.280
Okay.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.280
Yeah.

53:22.280 --> 53:23.280
Alright.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.280
Just making sure.

53:24.280 --> 53:25.280
Only the squirrels and the trees.

53:25.280 --> 53:27.280
My psyche was bothered.

53:27.280 --> 53:29.280
I'm okay now.

53:30.280 --> 53:35.280
So, if you wouldn't mind getting your camping gear and coming on up to fill out these forms

53:35.280 --> 53:40.880
instead of barking at the knot, that would make me, you know, happy because it's my job

53:40.880 --> 53:42.280
to get these forms filled out.

53:42.280 --> 53:45.280
Don't put your real names, okay, girl?

53:45.280 --> 53:46.280
Okay.

53:46.280 --> 53:47.280
Right.

53:47.280 --> 53:51.280
I'll just put, my name is Jude.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.280
That's really good, Jude.

53:53.280 --> 53:57.280
Right, but it's still with the Y, but it's pronounced different.

53:57.280 --> 54:03.280
She runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.280
Ooh.

54:09.280 --> 54:17.280
The sun, the sun, the sun is sleeping soon.

54:17.280 --> 54:35.280
She knows, she knows, she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance

54:35.280 --> 54:39.280
beneath the shadow of the moon.

54:39.280 --> 55:07.280
She moves, she moves, she moves with the howling wind.

55:07.280 --> 55:21.280
The sun, the sun, the sun has come again, come again.

55:21.280 --> 55:31.280
Her eyes, her eyes have seen it all.

55:31.280 --> 55:42.280
The wonders of, the wonders of the shadow of the moon.

56:01.280 --> 56:06.280
Moon.
