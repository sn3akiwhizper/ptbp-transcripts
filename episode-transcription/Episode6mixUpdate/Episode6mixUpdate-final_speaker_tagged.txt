0.00 185.90 speaker0  Greetings, all my wolf pups, it's your radio dad, Wolf the dog, howling at y'all from Contentions best radio show that is recorded in the basement. Tell your friends to tune in to 694.2 PTBP for all the goings on in our wonderful little town. Now let's dive right into some local news. Julie Maxwell, back from the dead, kidnapped Leo Piston and took him to Splashylvania. She shot Leo Piston at the top of the two-fanged plunge. Officer Clark Bishop was on the scene. He shot and killed Julie Maxwell. Your buddy Wolf will now ride the two-fanged plunge with a heavy, heavy heart. Now it says here the two bodies were slammed into the ground by an unseen force before disappearing. Officer John Lee Pettymore took a weird picture of the missing John Peters. because your boy Wolf knows that cameras will steal your soul. Drew Andrews, upstanding citizen and police station secretary, translated the binary that the hooded fella gave John. It said, I killed the chief's pops, John. Sounds like this hooded boy is up to no good if you ask me. Keith is in a wheelchair, which is a damn shame because I don't think there's a single place with a wheelchair ramp in this whole town. The officers broke into a missing person's property, John Peters' storage units to be exact, and they found a whole bunch of goodies. One thing they found was so smelly, they decided not to open it until back in the police station, which makes total sense, I guess. They took everything back to the station in a U-Haul truck. In the plastic trunk, a woman's head, split in half with a small silver sphere in the middle, sat upon what was likely her own chopped up body. I'm gonna have to stop reading the news if it's all this fucked up. Your buddy Wolf is becoming scared of the dark. Which reminds me, you know, I had a weird dream last night. In the dream, I was walking my dog, Wolf, and he looked at me, and when he looked at me, he had my face, and then I looked in a mirror and I had his face. So anyway, never fear, because Contention's newest band is here with a hot one for y'all.
184.90 203.78 speaker1  Did you not record that? Every opportunity.
202.78 204.78 speaker2  No.
203.78 217.86 speaker1  You sound weird now. Oh, no. I'm just kidding. Peep up. So, Christian, before we get started, where's the four-wheeler?
216.86 222.38 speaker2  We rode it back to...
221.38 243.54 speaker1  Probably in evidence. There would probably, there probably would be a garage on the premises just for convenience of cars. Yeah, like pretty sure. Any of that, just a pound? A lot? It's an impound. Impound, yeah. And how did you move the 478 kilos of cocaine?
242.54 247.10 speaker2  In the U-Haul. And they're now in the evidence locker.
246.10 249.10 speaker1  Okay. 478.
248.10 257.42 speaker2  Except for one brick.
253.74 300.00 speaker1  all the items in the evidence room, he gets your attention at his desk. they confirmed his passing. I tried the chief a couple more times, still no response. I also looked into Cole's orphanage. I didn't find anything about it. There seems to be no record of a place called that anywhere around contention. And then you guys asked me to find a mechanical engineer of some kind for those papers with the diagrams and scribbles? that those diagrams show at least a dozen methods to sabotage the air brakes of a tractor trailer truck.
298.18 309.40 speaker0  I go and pat him on the back.
308.40 316.88 speaker2  That's pretty good. Thank you. Why are you receptionist at a police department if you know of?
312.92 326.16 speaker1  Well, you guys have always called me the receptionist, but I'm more of the office manager around here is how I like to see myself. That's good. That's good for you, Drew.
324.88 345.08 speaker2  Hey, Drew, you got a call, actually. Could you get that, buddy? Hello? about Charles and see if we can't find his plate number.
344.08 384.32 speaker1  Oh, yeah, for sure. Clark, you would recognize that for how drunk he seemed when he came in, he was driving this car very steadily. Actually, go ahead and roll human intelligence for me. Fail. 50 on a 30. Okay.
383.32 391.00 speaker2  or driving? Absolutely not.
390.00 397.84 speaker1  Oh. Oh.
396.84 418.40 speaker2  Fuck, I think it was. We should definitely find out about this guy. I guess he could have just been playing up only to get the keys. That's true.
417.40 423.60 speaker1  Yes.
422.60 427.60 speaker2  Yeah, sure. I want to run it.
426.60 432.84 speaker1  Those plates don't exist. Dang. Clever girl.
430.60 435.36 speaker2  He probably lives here if he's friends with John Peters.
434.24 436.36 speaker1  Did I know John at all?
435.36 443.78 speaker2  Nope. What does a Google search for John Peters contention come up with?
441.54 450.78 speaker1  Go ahead and roll computer science for me. I've got a decent one. It's a crit fail. Oh, I thought it was good. You guys know how to use computers.
449.78 475.70 speaker2  Oh, the worst crit fail. Oh, no. 100. Somebody is hacking. As you search through, it seems like you hit some pages. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
468.78 482.70 speaker1  So, it seems like you hit some pages that might have existed at one point but no longer exist. Clark, you know anything about computers? No. That's a younger man's game. How old are you?
481.70 499.10 speaker2  He's an old 35.
494.86 528.70 speaker1  So, the plate not existing doesn't mean we can't put out an APB for the plate on the Yeah. We'll do that. All points. car in security footage. What do you want to do next? I mean, we can still drive around and look for it.
527.70 573.34 speaker2  Or we could go... We found that... We have this note here that says, the cabin is in the woods stark west from the end of the trail about two and a half miles signed by Kay. But when I was riding around with the homeless people yesterday, they were driving down like a dirt road. I don't know if you'd call it a trail. Kathy is the name of the piston wife. There's some dirt roads and trails around there. We could walk around in the woods a little bit. Also, aren't there some woods?
567.46 594.06 speaker1  pig farm is where that trail that the school bus took with Keith Vigna in the back of it. And it leads off to some old unused country roads back there. There's also a place called the woods on the map, which is the woods of contention. It is on the far southwest.
591.90 605.78 speaker2  end of the trail about two and a half miles. I know that the woods are down in the southwest part of town. It would not be, because that was over on the southeast side of town.
603.42 608.78 speaker1  Well no, it's stark west two and a half miles from the trail.
607.22 617.18 speaker2  That could be true. Let's check it out.
614.06 637.82 speaker1  So we would probably put out a bulletin for her now, right? Did nobody do that? I yeah. Good work Drew. He is a dedicated civil servant.
636.82 641.98 speaker2  Should we check that out then? Somebody push me.
639.82 645.54 speaker1  Can we give him the four wheeler? Yeah.
644.54 656.02 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Awesome. our fucking knees. Yeah.
655.02 670.54 speaker1  It looks great. So you guys start rolling through town. You guys ride together. I take the car and I have the trunk full of all the things we might need. What would those things be?
669.54 674.64 speaker2  You know, some of the same. We'll figure out when we get there.
671.54 680.38 speaker1  Sounds good. Just maybe a quick overview. Some guns and my drone.
679.38 700.06 speaker2  Maybe a grenade. Just the one. Just one grenade. An assortment of guns for any conceivable scenario. Love it.
699.06 717.58 speaker1  Okay. So you guys make it out to the woods and you can park at the trailhead or you can actually park off the side of one of those country roads out there, which is actually closer to the X on the spot, but then you'll have to go through the woods themselves.
714.66 719.58 speaker2  I think we should go on the trip, park next to the trail and then we all ride the four wheeler down the trail.
718.58 736.58 speaker1  Okay. Okay. Perfect. So you guys are riding down the trail. Guys, take your shoes off. I flex a little bit. Every single time you guys pass a group of people, John Lee Pettymore is flexing up.
734.18 743.66 speaker2  Puts his sunglasses down over his head.
740.06 801.08 speaker1  John Lee Pettymore absolutely keeps his aviators. Yeah. So you may get down to the part of the trail where the X is. Is it called the trail butt or the trail because there's a trail head that starts the trail tail. The trail tail. So you guys get to the trail tail and it is a, it's a really serene view. It's a slight overlook, but the steepness is not vast. That doesn't make any fucking sense. It's just a really nice view. People come out here all the time. There's an, there's a bench that sits here and there's a few picnic tables and such around the area. People camp out here every once in a while. There's a few spots for that. A few fire pits and such around the area. It's really nice. Okay.
797.96 803.08 speaker2  I whip my phone out and I see where West is.
802.08 819.68 speaker1  Okay. This is terrain.
813.64 837.96 speaker2  Let's, let's guys hop, hop back on and go two and a half miles stark West. Yeah. Cue up the ATVs. Oh boy. Yeah.
836.96 844.40 speaker1  Listeners love me.
841.40 849.40 speaker2  You got to talk into it. Yeah. It smells now. Yeah.
848.40 850.40 speaker1  You did that.
849.40 852.40 speaker2  That's for yourself.
851.40 874.16 speaker1  That's why it really hurts. You come upon a clearing in the midst of the thick woods that is roughly 30 yards wide and 20 yards deep. The ground in this clearing is black and covered in rotted chard wood.
873.16 875.16 speaker2  around.
874.16 883.92 speaker1  Same. Just kind of milling around in the carnage or the charge. The Charnage.
882.92 891.68 speaker2  Let's roll.
889.02 920.44 speaker1  be rolling, I would be all three of you. I think the mechanic system calls for if it is a check like search where the more people the better than the person with the best score roles for the group. worst person roles for the group. That's just what the mechanic system is for Delta Green. Just want to throw that out.
916.80 926.52 speaker2  I would, I would say situationally though, if we're like far apart and somebody, well played pretty much right?
925.52 973.00 speaker1  Pretty much. While we've been recording this, I've been far more consumed with making sure the story is right than whether we're playing the game correctly. Yeah, you got a lot of names in here, buddy. There's so many names. Who has the best search? Not me. Not me. And John, did you pass? Yes. As you guys are milling about the area, you would see there, there are no bits of structure that are still standing. However, it is very clear that at one point in time there was a cabin here. It burned down. The remains have been basically untouched. No one's been out here since it happened, it looks like, and John, you hear a crack about 20 yards into the thick of the woods.
968.60 1001.40 speaker2  So shotgun level, but I'm peering straight in and focusing all my attention on that and I kind of snap and whistle to the other guys. What's going on, John? I hold a finger to my lips and point at where I heard the sound. When I see that, I go ahead and ready mine and I get my fucking, I should have named
1000.40 1003.76 speaker1  You see no movement.
1002.40 1016.46 speaker2  I'm going to start walking towards where I heard the sound. A okay. Probably just an animal, but I'm going to go check it out.
1013.60 1022.00 speaker1  Are the two of you following behind John?
1017.60 1024.00 speaker2  Here, I'll stay behind cause I'm in a wheelchair or actually I'm on an ATV I guess, but I can't really walk that well.
1023.00 1050.86 speaker1  Yeah. I would say, yeah, Keith is definitely still just sitting like at the edge. and boom, you see a man just start running. He's sprinting back through the woods away from you.
1049.86 1052.86 speaker2  after him.
1051.86 1066.88 speaker1  Yeah. Yeah. He's out in the open now. He is running. It's a tall lanky dude. But he's in the open. He's just visible. So you can just see him because he's not hiding anymore.
1063.76 1078.76 speaker2  I want to do my best to go straight at him on the ATV. You rub, shout and stop.
1074.72 1089.60 speaker3  I'm still kind of in pursuit, but taking the path that the guy would have taken.
1088.60 1101.36 speaker1  Pass. And I need Keith. He's going to do a literal drive for me.
1100.36 1103.36 speaker2  I'm fucking 99. Oh!
1102.36 1154.76 speaker1  Hell yes. to fight through it, but you are not in shape and you are not in a position to be chasing after someone in this kind of terrain because you're not an all terrain man and you start falling behind, but you see John ahead of you and he is just fighting through this brush, just going hard, just running as fast as he can straight towards this guy who's running away from you. And you notice Keith flying past you in a four wheeler and smashed directly into a large
1153.44 1164.84 speaker2  It's a four.
1156.92 1256.84 speaker1  Keith, as you drive into the tree, you brace with your feet and your left ankle that is completely swollen and wrapped probably in a boot snaps and you feel your ankle as you Go ahead and roll another athletics check for me. I rolled 54. You don't catch up to him at all. You guys are both still running through, so go ahead and make another roll for me. You turn around as you hear a crash from behind you and you see Keith crash into a tree and as soon as you turn back around, a branch comes out of nowhere. What's it called? Clothesline. Yeah. You get clotheslined by a pretty hefty branch. Go ahead and roll a D4 for me. Three. Take three damage as you fall flat on your back and the figure runs off into the distance. Cool. So you fire a couple of times into the woods. Clark, what do you want to do?
1255.84 1269.04 speaker3  Yeah. Oh Keith, can you feel that?
1267.36 1277.60 speaker2  I'm kind of in shock right now. Yeah, I bet, bud. I can tell it's going to hurt.
1276.60 1290.36 speaker3  Maybe you should drive.
1286.16 1294.36 speaker1  The ATV is now quite wonky as you drive him back. It's like wobbling. Yeah. It's real hard.
1293.36 1304.20 speaker4  Wiggling back and forth.
1301.76 1315.64 speaker2  Sad, John. Before we head out, is there any way we can go to see where he was running and track him?
1314.64 1319.20 speaker3  where he was hiding. I was wondering if he had been there for a while.
1318.20 1339.44 speaker2  Would that be- Survival. Survival? Man, I didn't think that would be that useful. Okay. I pass. Awesome. I die.
1332.84 1364.60 speaker1  Clark, as you look about, you find the exact large branch that had fallen on the ground that this person had stepped on to make that loud crack. And it doesn't really, it was kind of behind a pretty big log, which you think he then immediately hit the ground to hide behind before taking off. Racking our memories.
1363.60 1369.56 speaker2  town?
1364.60 1382.76 speaker1  I think based on how shitty all those roles were, you guys were just in the panic mode and had-
1379.76 1402.88 speaker2  In World, flash of human is Johnny Paymore's favorite band. They were his mom's favorite band.
1401.88 1430.48 speaker4  Yeah. Fuck.
1428.52 1438.64 speaker2  That's what I thought we were tracking him for, right?
1437.64 1439.64 speaker1  is-
1438.64 1451.04 speaker2  Get your drone out.
1450.04 1455.04 speaker3  Yeah. In his backpack.
1454.04 1462.04 speaker2  It was in my backpack. No, it wasn't. It's the ATV's little buddy.
1461.04 1465.52 speaker3  It's just wonky. Let's get back-
1464.52 1467.52 speaker1  Who's driving the ATV? Not me.
1466.52 1470.52 speaker2  I'll drive. I've got a good drive.
1469.52 1472.52 speaker1  Yeah.
1471.52 1489.56 speaker2  Nice. Oh. Perhaps out of anger at his recent failures, perhaps out of just a desire to prove something to his dead daddy. I don't know what inspires John Boehner's foot or John Lee Pennymore.
1486.56 1508.08 speaker4  I mean. Jesus, Thomas. driven right the fuck now.
1501.56 1516.20 speaker1  You drive rather quickly back to the trailhead and make it to your cruiser, which has the drone in the back.
1511.48 1521.24 speaker3  I set the little screen on the trunk and I start flying that bad boy.
1517.20 1523.24 speaker1  Go ahead and roll computer science for me.
1522.24 1525.24 speaker3  I've got zero on that.
1524.24 1528.24 speaker2  How about you- No.
1527.24 1541.56 speaker1  I can give it a try. I think Clark is going to give it a go for a minute. I mean-
1540.56 1550.12 speaker3  It's above us. We're all looking at it and then it just falls. Doesn't do anything.
1549.12 1553.12 speaker1  Yeah.
1552.12 1555.12 speaker3  Fuck.
1554.12 1556.12 speaker1  That's a crit fail.
1555.12 1558.12 speaker4  Wait, wait, wait.
1557.12 1562.32 speaker2  But how can he even roll with zero? All he can do is-
1559.12 1591.80 speaker1  To see whether he crit failed is literally why I had him roll. I think maybe there's a base of 20 on that or something. No, there's a zero. Yeah. Okay. So it adds up. I've done this before. Clark, as you begin flying the drone above you, you lose control of it and it dips down and- I'm going to roll real quick. Off my list.
1587.92 1599.60 speaker2  My D20 with a list of possible outcomes for a drone failure.
1598.60 1606.56 speaker1  at you.
1604.56 1622.12 speaker3  Fail.
1621.12 1648.24 speaker2  Probably pretty fucking. I'm imagining a pretty medium to large sized drone. I'm looking up, here's what happens when a drone-
1642.72 1653.60 speaker1  And you get knocked to the ground and one of its propellers is caught in your uniform.
1650.12 1655.60 speaker2  We just watched a video where drone blades flew into pig flesh. Let's see.
1654.60 1660.16 speaker1  Did it go into it?
1658.40 1668.16 speaker2  That's also an unshielded blade though. Okay. Which these are all pretty much contained. That's true, actually. At least surrounded. Yeah. And it broke off inside of it, too.
1667.16 1722.64 speaker1  Oh, damn. I will say it cut your chest up pretty bad and knocked you back to the ground. And the drone falls to the ground next to you on the ground. You would all see that the propellers are massively screwed up. Keith. Keith, you go looking through the police cruiser- Thank you. ... for a first aid kit of some sort and you guys did not bring one with you today. It's bizarre because normally there's one already in there.
1721.32 1729.68 speaker4  That's usually Tim's job.
1725.12 1734.08 speaker3  ... and then tie it around me very bra-like around my chest.
1733.08 1736.52 speaker1  What do you guys want to do now?
1735.08 1764.88 speaker4  That you have failed literally everything? Well, I'd like to try to fly the drone if it's not broken.
1761.00 1776.84 speaker2  and because my leg is starting to hurt extremely bad. Yeah.
1775.24 1783.52 speaker3  For the same foot.
1781.64 1790.32 speaker4  A well executed drone shot.
1783.52 1804.28 speaker1  A beautifully executed drone shot of the three of you sitting on the ground next to the police cruiser all crying.
1803.28 1805.28 speaker4  Jesus Christ.
1804.28 1806.28 speaker2  Oh, my God.
1805.28 2004.76 speaker4  That was amazing.
1998.84 2024.72 speaker0  It's your grease granddad Wolf, the dog, and I'm here to let you all know that you can support this show and help it grow with some of that hard-earned dough. Yeah, you know that rhyme was so nice, I said it twice and make sure you go over to patreon.com slash pretending pod. The link is in the damn show notes, babies.
