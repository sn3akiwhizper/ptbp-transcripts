1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Greetings, all my wolf pups, it's your radio dad, Wolf the dog, howling at y'all from

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,840
Contentions best radio show that is recorded in the basement.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,080
Tell your friends to tune in to 694.2 PTBP for all the goings on in our wonderful little

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,600
town.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,880
Now let's dive right into some local news.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,640
Julie Maxwell, back from the dead, kidnapped Leo Piston and took him to Splashylvania.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,800
She shot Leo Piston at the top of the two-fanged plunge.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,920
Officer Clark Bishop was on the scene.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,240
He shot and killed Julie Maxwell.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,320
Your buddy Wolf will now ride the two-fanged plunge with a heavy, heavy heart.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,760
Now it says here the two bodies were slammed into the ground by an unseen force before

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
disappearing.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,320
That's gotta be wrong, right?

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,360
Somebody get Sam and Dean down here because that is some supernatural business.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,560
Officer John Lee Pettymore took a weird picture of the missing John Peters.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,240
If I had a dollar every time someone took a weird picture of me, I'd have zero dollars

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,000
because your boy Wolf knows that cameras will steal your soul.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,120
Drew Andrews, upstanding citizen and police station secretary, translated the binary that

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,960
the hooded fella gave John.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,720
It said, I killed the chief's pops, John.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,680
Sounds like this hooded boy is up to no good if you ask me.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,080
Keith is in a wheelchair, which is a damn shame because I don't think there's a single

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,580
place with a wheelchair ramp in this whole town.

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,220
The officers broke into a missing person's property, John Peters' storage units to

25
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,180
be exact, and they found a whole bunch of goodies.

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,020
One thing they found was so smelly, they decided not to open it until back in the police station,

27
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,900
which makes total sense, I guess.

28
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,300
They took everything back to the station in a U-Haul truck.

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,660
In the plastic trunk, a woman's head, split in half with a small silver sphere in the

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,380
middle, sat upon what was likely her own chopped up body.

31
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,020
I'm gonna have to stop reading the news if it's all this fucked up.

32
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,580
Your buddy Wolf is becoming scared of the dark.

33
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,900
Which reminds me, you know, I had a weird dream last night.

34
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:30,500
In the dream, I was walking my dog, Wolf, and he looked at me, and when he looked at

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,780
me, he had my face, and then I looked in a mirror and I had his face.

36
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,300
So anyway, never fear, because Contention's newest band is here with a hot one for y'all.

37
00:02:44,300 --> 00:03:03,580
It's Kudzu with no backbones.

38
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,900
Okay let's do it.

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Did you not record that?

40
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,260
What the fuck is wrong with you, Zach?

41
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
Every opportunity.

42
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,520
From the top.

43
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,740
It's literally every time something good happens.

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,180
Yeah, I was almost like, well maybe we should record soundcheck just in case.

45
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,780
So you admit this is your fault?

46
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,780
No.

47
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
You sound weird now.

48
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,060
Yeah, I think we need to go through it all again.

49
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,340
Alright, Joe, if you could test your mic for me.

50
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,340
Oh, no.

51
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
I'm just kidding.

52
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
Peep up.

53
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,860
So, Christian, before we get started, where's the four-wheeler?

54
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,860
We rode it back to...

55
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,980
I rode it back shirtless to the station.

56
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,380
Yeah, where'd you put it?

57
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,380
Probably in evidence.

58
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,060
I locked it up safely in a jail cell.

59
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,060
Eat it.

60
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,500
There would probably, there probably would be a garage on the premises just for convenience

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
of cars.

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Yeah, like pretty sure.

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,060
Or like even for like a stolen car situation where it's like, you know.

64
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Any of that, just a pound?

65
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,060
A lot?

66
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,060
It's an impound.

67
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,060
Impound, yeah.

68
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,540
And how did you move the 478 kilos of cocaine?

69
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
In the U-Haul.

70
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,100
And they're now in the evidence locker.

71
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Okay.

72
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,100
478.

73
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Except for one brick.

74
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,740
You guys asked Drew to look into a few things for you, and after you're finished up cataloging

75
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,420
all the items in the evidence room, he gets your attention at his desk.

76
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,420
Hey, fellas!

77
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,220
So, I called the mill on the other side of the city where the chief's dad works, and

78
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,820
they confirmed his passing.

79
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,620
I tried the chief a couple more times, still no response.

80
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,100
I also looked into Cole's orphanage.

81
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,280
I didn't find anything about it.

82
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,460
There seems to be no record of a place called that anywhere around contention.

83
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,860
And then you guys asked me to find a mechanical engineer of some kind for those papers with

84
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,340
the diagrams and scribbles?

85
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,660
Well, I actually happen to have a knack for that kind of thinking, and it seems to me

86
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,180
that those diagrams show at least a dozen methods to sabotage the air brakes of a tractor

87
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
trailer truck.

88
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,180
Nice work, Drew.

89
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,000
I go and pat him on the back.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,120
He is so giddy that you've accepted his help.

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,320
Uh, yeah, good work, Drew.

92
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,400
I gotta agree.

93
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
That's pretty good.

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Thank you.

95
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,920
Why are you receptionist at a police department if you know of?

96
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,880
Well, you guys have always called me the receptionist, but I'm more of the office manager around

97
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,000
here is how I like to see myself.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's good.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's good for you, Drew.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
What do you consider to be the difference?

101
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
I like to think that I have a little bit more-

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,160
Hey, Drew, you got a call, actually.

103
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Could you get that, buddy?

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Drew, I contentioned police department.

105
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,000
It's just me pranking them.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hello?

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,300
God, I wish I could fart into the mic right now.

108
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,480
We should look at surveillance footage from the station to see if we can find out more

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,080
about Charles and see if we can't find his plate number.

110
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Oh, yeah, for sure.

111
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,960
So you guys go into the surveillance room.

112
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,360
You would see that Charles arrived in a white Toyota.

113
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,400
Clark, you would recognize that for how drunk he seemed when he came in, he was driving

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
this car very steadily.

115
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,760
Actually, go ahead and roll human intelligence for me.

116
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Humant.

117
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,240
Because we're setting the podcast in Missouri.

118
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Fail.

119
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
50 on a 30.

120
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Okay.

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Everybody gets a plus 20 drive.

122
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
What a drink.

123
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,320
The contentioned police department wishes you to know that we do not condone drinking

124
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
or driving?

125
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Absolutely not.

126
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,000
Contention doesn't have Uber, but everybody has a friend, except for Clark Bishop.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,840
Wasn't it a white Toyota that Mildred saw?

130
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Fuck, I think it was.

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
That would make sense.

132
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,840
So do you think it was him that loaded up the trunk and all that stuff?

133
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,960
We should definitely find out about this guy.

134
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,520
He seemed to, oh, I was going to say he seemed to genuinely want to find his friend, but

135
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,600
I guess he could have just been playing up only to get the keys.

136
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
That's true.

137
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Or maybe both.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,400
I smelled the, this is Joe talking, I smelled the liquor on him, didn't I?

139
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Yes.

140
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,280
He cleverly poured liquor all over himself.

141
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,600
Let's go find him.

142
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Did we get a plate?

143
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Yeah, sure.

144
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I want to run it.

145
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Okay.

146
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Run them plates fast, run them, run them.

147
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Those plates don't exist.

148
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Dang.

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Clever girl.

150
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Does anyone we know know about Charles?

151
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,840
He probably lives here if he's friends with John Peters.

152
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,240
I didn't recognize him.

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
Did I know John at all?

154
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Nope.

155
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,280
What does a Google search for John Peters contention come up with?

156
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,540
Some pretty weird porn.

157
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,780
Go ahead and roll computer science for me.

158
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,780
I've got a decent one.

159
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,780
It's a crit fail.

160
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,780
Oh, I thought it was good.

161
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,780
22 on a 20.

162
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,780
His laptop battery explodes.

163
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,780
You guys know how to use computers.

164
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,780
Oh, the worst crit fail.

165
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Oh, no.

166
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,780
100.

167
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
Somebody is hacking.

168
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
As you search through, it seems like you hit some pages.

169
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Oh, no.

170
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,780
Oh, no.

171
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,780
Oh, no.

172
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,780
Oh, no.

173
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,780
Oh, no.

174
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,780
Oh, no.

175
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,780
Oh, no.

176
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,780
Oh, no.

177
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
Oh, no.

178
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,780
Oh, no.

179
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Oh, no.

180
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
Oh, no.

181
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Oh, no.

182
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
Oh, no.

183
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:55,700
So, it seems like you hit some pages that might have existed at one point but no longer

184
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
exist.

185
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Clark, you know anything about computers?

186
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
No.

187
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
That's a younger man's game.

188
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
How old are you?

189
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
35.

190
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
He's an old 35.

191
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
I, unfortunately, have zero.

192
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:13,820
Maybe we should just drive around and see if we see a white Toyota anywhere.

193
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
I'm down.

194
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,100
So, the plate not existing doesn't mean we can't put out an APB for the plate on the

195
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
car.

196
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,100
That's true.

197
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Very true.

198
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,100
Yeah.

199
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,100
We'll do that.

200
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
All points.

201
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
Bulletin.

202
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:32,740
Police work, please roll law.

203
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,400
I put that out so fast.

204
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Me too.

205
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,380
You put out an accurate APB for a white Toyota with the plates that you have seen on this

206
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,580
car in security footage.

207
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
What do you want to do next?

208
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,700
I mean, we can still drive around and look for it.

209
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Well.

210
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Or we could go...

211
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
We found that...

212
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,300
What, do we have a bunch of other leads to follow or something?

213
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,780
We have this note here that says, the cabin is in the woods stark west from the end of

214
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,580
the trail about two and a half miles signed by Kay.

215
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,260
But when I was riding around with the homeless people yesterday, they were driving down like

216
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
a dirt road.

217
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,820
I don't know if you'd call it a trail.

218
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Kathy is the name of the piston wife.

219
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,860
There's some dirt roads and trails around there.

220
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,740
We could walk around in the woods a little bit.

221
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,780
You want to gear up with some of the goodies we got yesterday?

222
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
I think we should.

223
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,860
Also, aren't there some woods?

224
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,460
So the piston farm is in the southeast part of town and the far east part of the piston

225
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,340
pig farm is where that trail that the school bus took with Keith Vigna in the back of it.

226
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,420
And it leads off to some old unused country roads back there.

227
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:43,620
There's also a place called the woods on the map, which is the woods of contention.

228
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,420
It is on the far southwest.

229
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,820
Okay, so let me go back.

230
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,900
Yeah, so we found this note that says the cabin is in the woods stark west from the

231
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,060
end of the trail about two and a half miles.

232
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,180
I know that the woods are down in the southwest part of town.

233
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,620
Would that be that trail you went down the other day with Kathy Piston?

234
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,420
It would not be, because that was over on the southeast side of town.

235
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,780
Well no, it's stark west two and a half miles from the trail.

236
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,220
So if that's the end of her trail...

237
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,780
That could be true.

238
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,360
Let's check it out.

239
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,060
Before we leave, we're on like day three of the chief being missing.

240
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,180
So we would probably put out a bulletin for her now, right?

241
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,740
Did nobody do that?

242
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,980
Drew is like, oh, I've been looking tirelessly.

243
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,380
I already told the city PD to be looking for her.

244
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,380
I yeah.

245
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Good work Drew.

246
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,020
He's not spending all his hours like putting up signs after work.

247
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,820
He is a dedicated civil servant.

248
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
We don't deserve him.

249
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Okay.

250
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Should we check that out then?

251
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Somebody push me.

252
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Oh yeah.

253
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,980
Can we give him the four wheeler?

254
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
Yeah.

255
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,540
Let's take the four wheeler out.

256
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,540
Yeah.

257
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,540
Yeah.

258
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,540
Yep.

259
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,540
Awesome.

260
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,020
And we are riding on either like wheel hub with shotguns just like propped up against

261
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,020
our fucking knees.

262
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,020
Yeah.

263
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,020
It looks great.

264
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,020
So you guys start rolling through town.

265
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,340
I take my shirt off.

266
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
In December.

267
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
No.

268
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
You guys ride together.

269
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,340
I take the car and I have the trunk full of all the things we might need.

270
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,540
Hell yeah.

271
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
What would those things be?

272
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,540
You know, some of the same.

273
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,540
We'll figure out when we get there.

274
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,640
Sounds good.

275
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,780
Just maybe a quick overview.

276
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,380
Some guns and my drone.

277
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,380
Perfect.

278
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,380
Maybe a grenade.

279
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,380
Just the one.

280
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
Just one grenade.

281
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,580
An assortment of guns for any conceivable scenario.

282
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,740
Love it.

283
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,460
I love that.

284
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,380
I'm a pretty easy going game master.

285
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,620
I'm a pretty gentle handler.

286
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,060
Well, I'll say.

287
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,060
I'm a soft handler.

288
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
Okay.

289
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,200
So you guys make it out to the woods and you can park at the trailhead or you can actually

290
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,300
park off the side of one of those country roads out there, which is actually closer

291
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,660
to the X on the spot, but then you'll have to go through the woods themselves.

292
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,580
I think we should go on the trip, park next to the trail and then we all ride the four

293
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
wheeler down the trail.

294
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,580
Okay.

295
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
Okay.

296
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,580
Perfect.

297
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,780
So you guys are riding down the trail.

298
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,980
Guys, take your shoes off.

299
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,980
Keep my shirt on.

300
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
I keep it on.

301
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
Whatever.

302
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
You pass.

303
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,500
I flex a little bit.

304
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,180
Every single time you guys pass a group of people, John Lee Pettymore is flexing up.

305
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,580
Puts his sunglasses down over his head.

306
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,060
Do you normally keep your sunglasses on the back of your head?

307
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,660
John Lee Pettymore absolutely keeps his aviators.

308
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,580
No, his tactical Oakleys.

309
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,780
Yeah, absolutely.

310
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,380
It's not even really bright out today, but they're nice.

311
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
Yeah.

312
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,480
So you may get down to the part of the trail where the X is.

313
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,420
Is it called the trail butt or the trail because there's a trail head that starts the trail

314
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,420
tail.

315
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
What is the trail tail?

316
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,420
The trail tail.

317
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,860
So you guys get to the trail tail and it is a, it's a really serene view.

318
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,460
It's a slight overlook, but the steepness is not vast.

319
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,860
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

320
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,240
It's just a really nice view.

321
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
People come out here all the time.

322
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,560
There's an, there's a bench that sits here and there's a few picnic tables and such around

323
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
the area.

324
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,500
People camp out here every once in a while.

325
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,680
There's a few spots for that.

326
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,960
A few fire pits and such around the area.

327
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
It's really nice.

328
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Okay.

329
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,080
I whip my phone out and I see where West is.

330
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Let's go that way.

331
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Okay.

332
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Can we take the four wheeler through this?

333
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,420
It's an ATV all terrain vehicle.

334
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,520
It's an all terrain vehicle.

335
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
And this.

336
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
What's it altering?

337
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
This is terrain.

338
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Okay.

339
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,680
Let's, let's guys hop, hop back on and go two and a half miles stark West.

340
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Yeah.

341
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Cue up the ATVs.

342
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:53,960
Cut back to, uh, 20 minutes ago when I was on a prank phone call with Andy, Jesus Christ.

343
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
That was totally.

344
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Oh boy.

345
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Yeah.

346
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Listeners love me.

347
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Honestly.

348
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Pretty good at it.

349
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I always forget.

350
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,400
You got to talk into it.

351
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Yeah.

352
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
It smells now.

353
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
It's a fart mic.

354
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Yeah.

355
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
You did that.

356
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
That's for yourself.

357
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
That's okay.

358
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
That's why it really hurts.

359
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,120
You and no one else.

360
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,680
You come upon a clearing in the midst of the thick woods that is roughly 30 yards wide

361
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,700
and 20 yards deep.

362
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,880
The ground in this clearing is black and covered in rotted chard wood.

363
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,160
Looks like there was a cabin here once I want to go up to the wood and take a peek

364
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
around.

365
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Same.

366
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,100
Just kind of milling around in the carnage or the charge.

367
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
The Charnage.

368
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,920
I'm going to search.

369
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Let's roll.

370
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,020
I was meaning to ask you guys, uh, when we have the roles that all three of you would

371
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,680
be rolling, I would be all three of you.

372
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,400
I think the mechanic system calls for if it is a check like search where the more people

373
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,440
the better than the person with the best score roles for the group.

374
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:10,240
And if it's something like stealth where it's everybody needs to be, yeah, well then the

375
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,720
worst person roles for the group.

376
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,800
That's just what the mechanic system is for Delta Green.

377
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Just want to throw that out.

378
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,440
I would, I would say situationally though, if we're like far apart and somebody, well

379
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,520
for sure, but if the three of you were side by side, I like it and that's how we've always

380
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
played pretty much right?

381
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Pretty much.

382
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,720
While we've been recording this, I've been far more consumed with making sure the story

383
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,560
is right than whether we're playing the game correctly.

384
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,660
Yeah, you got a lot of names in here, buddy.

385
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,760
There's so many names.

386
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Who has the best search?

387
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Not me.

388
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Not me.

389
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
And John, did you pass?

390
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Yes.

391
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,960
As you guys are milling about the area, you would see there, there are no bits of structure

392
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,600
that are still standing.

393
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,440
However, it is very clear that at one point in time there was a cabin here.

394
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,480
It burned down.

395
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,080
The remains have been basically untouched.

396
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,640
No one's been out here since it happened, it looks like, and John, you hear a crack

397
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,600
about 20 yards into the thick of the woods.

398
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,000
So shotgun level, but I'm peering straight in and focusing all my attention on that and

399
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,080
I kind of snap and whistle to the other guys.

400
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
What's going on, John?

401
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,520
I hold a finger to my lips and point at where I heard the sound.

402
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,120
When I see that, I go ahead and ready mine and I get my fucking, I should have named

403
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,840
this gun my regular, tiny, super powerful gun.

404
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,800
I kind of start backing like maybe towards some cover, like the ATV or whatever, but

405
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,400
I say, identify yourself, silence, looking into the woods.

406
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
You see no movement.

407
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Okay.

408
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm going to start walking towards where I heard the sound.

409
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,480
I'm covering, covering him like a, like a good police boy.

410
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
I don't know.

411
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Did it sound like a snap twig?

412
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
A okay.

413
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,600
Probably just an animal, but I'm going to go check it out.

414
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,460
Are the two of you following behind John?

415
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,600
Should somebody maybe stay behind?

416
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,000
Here, I'll stay behind cause I'm in a wheelchair or actually I'm on an ATV I guess, but I can't

417
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
really walk that well.

418
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah.

419
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,840
I would say, yeah, Keith is definitely still just sitting like at the edge.

420
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,280
We are playing a fantasy game.

421
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
You're right now.

422
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
A centaur.

423
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,720
Keith is definitely like at the edge of the clearing or sitting, sitting on the four wheeler

424
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,560
and boom, you see a man just start running.

425
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,400
He's sprinting back through the woods away from you.

426
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,860
I shout at Keith on the four wheeler and like point to where I saw it and I take off straight

427
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,860
after him.

428
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,860
Can I see the figure?

429
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
Yeah.

430
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
Yeah.

431
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
He's out in the open now.

432
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
He is running.

433
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
It's a tall lanky dude.

434
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,040
No, he's running away from you into the woods.

435
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
But he's in the open.

436
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
He's just visible.

437
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,760
So you can just see him because he's not hiding anymore.

438
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,880
I want to do my best to go straight at him on the ATV.

439
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
You rub, shout and stop.

440
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,280
And if you, if John is taking a beeline to the guy, I'm actually kind of going more toward

441
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,720
where he was hiding originally.

442
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,760
I'm still kind of in pursuit, but taking the path that the guy would have taken.

443
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
You know what I mean?

444
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,680
You're going to center ball him for me.

445
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,600
I need, um, I need John and Clark to both roll athletics for me.

446
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Pass.

447
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,800
28 on a 50.

448
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Fail.

449
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,120
67 on a 30.

450
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Okay.

451
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
And I need Keith.

452
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
He's going to do a literal drive for me.

453
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Oh my god.

454
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
I'm fucking 99.

455
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Oh!

456
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Hell yes.

457
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,000
The engine falls out.

458
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,840
Clark as you begin running into the woods, the brush is hitting you and you're trying

459
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,880
to fight through it, but you are not in shape and you are not in a position to be chasing

460
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,120
after someone in this kind of terrain because you're not an all terrain man and you start

461
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,560
falling behind, but you see John ahead of you and he is just fighting through this brush,

462
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,440
just going hard, just running as fast as he can straight towards this guy who's running

463
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
away from you.

464
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,080
And you notice Keith flying past you in a four wheeler and smashed directly into a large

465
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
tree.

466
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,360
Keith, if you want to roll a D6 for me.

467
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,440
It completely fucks up his other foot.

468
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,760
It's a four.

469
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,920
I need you to take four damage.

470
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:24,840
Keith, as you drive into the tree, you brace with your feet and your left ankle that is

471
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,600
completely swollen and wrapped probably in a boot snaps and you feel your ankle as you

472
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,560
hear it crunch.

473
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,280
Oh no.

474
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:43,160
Leasing up my good foot.

475
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,920
John, you're still in pursuit.

476
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,440
Go ahead and roll another athletics check for me.

477
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,080
Are we competing now?

478
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,320
Oh, I failed my roll.

479
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
He failed as well.

480
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
I rolled 54.

481
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,440
You don't catch up to him at all.

482
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,480
You guys are both still running through, so go ahead and make another roll for me.

483
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,160
Oh, fuck.

484
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
100.

485
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Good fail.

486
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,320
Absolutely delightful.

487
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,320
You turn around as you hear a crash from behind you and you see Keith crash into a tree and

488
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,640
as soon as you turn back around, a branch comes out of nowhere.

489
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
What's it called?

490
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Clothesline.

491
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Yeah.

492
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,480
You get clotheslined by a pretty hefty branch.

493
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,000
Go ahead and roll a D4 for me.

494
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Three.

495
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,280
Take three damage as you fall flat on your back and the figure runs off into the distance.

496
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,720
I want to try to fire at it if I can.

497
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,400
Take your damage real quick and then roll firearms at negative 40.

498
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Cool.

499
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,640
39 on a...

500
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,600
Adjusted on a 20.

501
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,200
So you fire a couple of times into the woods.

502
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
Clark, what do you want to do?

503
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,840
So I'm probably coming up on the ATV at this point.

504
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Yeah.

505
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
I'm seeing how I can help that.

506
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,400
I hold my leg up and it's just my foot's just kind of flopping around.

507
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Oh shit.

508
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,360
Oh Keith, can you feel that?

509
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,040
I'm kind of in shock right now.

510
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,240
Yeah, I bet, bud.

511
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,680
I can tell it's going to hurt.

512
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,160
I'm lifting him up and trying to get him onto the ATV.

513
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,600
Yeah, you can pick him up and get him on there.

514
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Maybe you should drive.

515
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
I don't know if I...

516
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,200
I'm trying to put him back into the driver's seat.

517
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,160
Get out of here, Keith.

518
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,360
The ATV is now quite wonky as you drive him back.

519
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
It's like wobbling.

520
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Yeah.

521
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
It's real hard.

522
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Wiggling back and forth.

523
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,760
At the first person we pass back on the trail, John very shamefully puts his shirt back on.

524
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,200
Sad, John.

525
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,960
Before we head out, is there any way we can go to see where he was running and track him?

526
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,640
Yeah, I was going to see if I could find any, if he tore his clothing on anything, especially

527
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
where he was hiding.

528
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,200
I was wondering if he had been there for a while.

529
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
There's no tracking.

530
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Would that be-

531
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Survival.

532
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Survival?

533
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Man, I didn't think that would be that useful.

534
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Okay.

535
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I pass.

536
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
35 on a 60.

537
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Oh, do you have a dope survival?

538
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Awesome.

539
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
I do not pass.

540
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
I die.

541
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,840
You fail surviving.

542
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,440
Clark, as you look about, you find the exact large branch that had fallen on the ground

543
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,600
that this person had stepped on to make that loud crack.

544
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,000
And it doesn't really, it was kind of behind a pretty big log, which you think he then

545
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,960
immediately hit the ground to hide behind before taking off.

546
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,480
Do I see any-

547
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,560
There are no signs that he was there for some time or anything.

548
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Racking our memories.

549
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,600
Does this guy share a frame or any physical characteristics with anybody we know from

550
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
town?

551
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,560
I think based on how shitty all those roles were, you guys were just in the panic mode

552
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
and had-

553
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,320
We might have been chasing our own shadows for all we know.

554
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,840
You saw a flash of human.

555
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,760
Dude, good band name.

556
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Flash of human?

557
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Oh, yeah.

558
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
Oh, man.

559
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,760
In World, flash of human is Johnny Paymore's favorite band.

560
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
They were his mom's favorite band.

561
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,560
What do you think that fella was watching us for?

562
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,600
I don't know if he was watching us or if we spooked him.

563
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Why do you-

564
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Why was he out here though?

565
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,920
I'm starting to think something funny is going on in contention.

566
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,880
Yeah, you guys could have gotten some information there.

567
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Yeah.

568
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Fuck.

569
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,840
I don't know about you guys, but this to me seems like perhaps a seriously blown opportunity.

570
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Yup.

571
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,640
Yeah, you guys really fucked that up.

572
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,120
Oh, that sucks.

573
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,760
Well, let's go check out that orphanage I guess.

574
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,240
You ever feel like you're just throwing the dice in life and it's not coming up?

575
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,520
If the guy had kept running in a straight line, would I know where he would potentially

576
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
come out?

577
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,480
That's what I thought we were tracking him for, right?

578
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,640
Yeah, and based on that, the woods, quote unquote, is an extremely large area, but it

579
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
is-

580
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Get your drone out.

581
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Yes.

582
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Good idea.

583
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
It is surrounded-

584
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Fuck you, Game Master.

585
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Bye.

586
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,040
It is surrounded by roads.

587
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Great.

588
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Great idea, Keith.

589
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Yeah.

590
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
And I'm good.

591
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Of where?

592
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
In his backpack.

593
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
It was in my backpack.

594
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
No, it wasn't.

595
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,200
It's the ATV's little buddy.

596
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,040
The ATV still drives though, right?

597
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
It's just wonky.

598
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
It's just wonky.

599
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Let's get back-

600
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,520
As quick as possible back to there.

601
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Who's driving the ATV?

602
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
Not me.

603
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
I'll drive.

604
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
I've got a good drive.

605
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
I did just get fucked up.

606
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Yeah.

607
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Drive at negative 20 for me.

608
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Nice.

609
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
Oh.

610
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,960
Perhaps out of anger at his recent failures, perhaps out of just a desire to prove something

611
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,360
to his dead daddy.

612
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,560
I don't know what inspires John Boehner's foot or John Lee Pennymore.

613
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Whoops.

614
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I mean.

615
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Jesus, Thomas.

616
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Either way, nobody has ever driven an ATV down a dirt track better than you see an ATV

617
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,800
driven right the fuck now.

618
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,560
It's not like a one, but it is a six.

619
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Okay.

620
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Yeah.

621
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:08,080
You drive rather quickly back to the trailhead and make it to your cruiser, which has the

622
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,880
drone in the back.

623
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,480
I pop that sucker out.

624
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,200
I set the little screen on the trunk and I start flying that bad boy.

625
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Okay.

626
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,240
Go ahead and roll computer science for me.

627
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Damn it.

628
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
I've got zero on that.

629
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,240
Here.

630
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
How about you-

631
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
No.

632
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
I'll give it.

633
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
I can give it a try.

634
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
I think Clark is going to give it a go for a minute.

635
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Well, yeah.

636
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
I mean-

637
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,320
Before, as you're driving it, the two of you are watching his screen.

638
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,560
I am very determined and clear headed as I guide it upward about 10 feet.

639
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
It's above us.

640
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,440
We're all looking at it and then it just falls.

641
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,600
Doesn't do anything.

642
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,120
Go ahead and make a roll for me.

643
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Yeah.

644
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
He has zero.

645
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
44.

646
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Fuck.

647
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Yeah.

648
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
That's a crit fail.

649
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Wait, wait, wait.

650
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Okay.

651
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
But how can he even roll with zero?

652
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
All he can do is-

653
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,320
To see whether he crit failed is literally why I had him roll.

654
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,600
Can you roll on a skill you don't have though?

655
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,840
Because you could crit fail instead of just fail.

656
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,720
I had Luke do the same thing on forensics, I think.

657
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
I think maybe there's a base of 20 on that or something.

658
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
No, there's a zero.

659
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Yeah.

660
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Okay.

661
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
So it adds up.

662
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
I've done this before.

663
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,720
Clark, as you begin flying the drone above you, you lose control of it and it dips down

664
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,920
and- I'm going to roll real quick.

665
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Off my list.

666
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,800
My D20 with a list of possible outcomes for a drone failure.

667
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,600
Clark, the drone out of your control, but technically in your control comes flying directly

668
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
at you.

669
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,720
And I try and dodge it.

670
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,560
Go ahead and roll dodge for me.

671
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Fail.

672
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
It hits you directly in the chest.

673
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,240
Oh, in the chest?

674
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Yeah.

675
00:26:52,240 --> 00:27:00,120
Now, guys, I don't actually know anything about drones based on what you've been imagining.

676
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
How bad would this hurt?

677
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
Probably pretty fucking.

678
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,420
I'm imagining a pretty medium to large sized drone.

679
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,080
If it's going speedily, it probably doesn't feel great.

680
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,960
Okay, go ahead and roll a D4 for me.

681
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Four.

682
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,600
Yeah, you lose four damage.

683
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,900
Like it shatters his collarbone.

684
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm looking up, here's what happens when a drone-

685
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,720
It knocks you to the ground and cuts you up in the chest.

686
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,240
And you get knocked to the ground and one of its propellers is caught in your uniform.

687
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,120
Oh, fuck.

688
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,600
We just watched a video where drone blades flew into pig flesh.

689
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Let's see.

690
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Did it go into it?

691
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,400
It didn't cut it up, but it stabbed a good three inches.

692
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,160
That's also an unshielded blade though.

693
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Yeah.

694
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Okay.

695
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Which these are all pretty much contained.

696
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
That's true, actually.

697
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
At least surrounded.

698
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Yeah.

699
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
And it broke off inside of it, too.

700
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Oh, damn.

701
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,480
I will say it cut your chest up pretty bad and knocked you back to the ground.

702
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,860
And the drone falls to the ground next to you on the ground.

703
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,640
You would all see that the propellers are massively screwed up.

704
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,120
And being a cop is hard.

705
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Fuck.

706
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,600
Dude, are you- Here, I want to first aid him.

707
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Oh, okay.

708
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,080
We got a 61 on a 60.

709
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,480
Luke off mic just shook his head and looked at Joe and shrugged his head.

710
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,960
Luke, you go looking through the police cruiser for-

711
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Keith.

712
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,280
Keith, you go looking through the police cruiser- Thank you.

713
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,480
... for a first aid kit of some sort and you guys did not bring one with you today.

714
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,840
It's bizarre because normally there's one already in there.

715
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,520
We had to make room for the guns.

716
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,320
Some drunk cut his forehead open in the back and we had to patch him up and forgot to resupply.

717
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,640
That's usually Tim's job.

718
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,120
I'd pull off my uniform- Hell, yeah.

719
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,680
... and then tie it around me very bra-like around my chest.

720
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,080
That's incredible.

721
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
What do you guys want to do now?

722
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Oh, man.

723
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,520
That you have failed literally everything?

724
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,880
Well, I'd like to try to fly the drone if it's not broken.

725
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,840
It is in such disrepair that flying it would be extremely difficult.

726
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,560
I've got drone repair.

727
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,960
That's super handy.

728
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,120
In this edition, it's repair drone.

729
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:21,000
Oh, man, guys- Yeah, Keith starts crying because of his failures

730
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,880
and because my leg is starting to hurt extremely bad.

731
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Yeah.

732
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,120
I'm going to go to the- John starts crying too.

733
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,240
I'm going to go to the hospital the second day in a row.

734
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,840
For the same foot.

735
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,640
The camera pans out and begins to lift on the scene and does an aerial shot-

736
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,520
A well executed drone shot.

737
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,320
A beautifully executed drone shot of the three of you sitting on the ground next to the police

738
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,040
cruiser all crying.

739
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,200
I got to call my mom.

740
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Can we take a break?

741
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,280
Yeah, we can take a break.

742
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Oh, God.

743
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Jesus Christ.

744
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Oh, my God.

745
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
That was amazing.

746
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,600
That was the most Three Stooges things I think we've ever done.

747
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,520
We were hitting branches and flying drones into us.

748
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,440
I just dropped straight on the first tree.

749
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,440
We literally just were knocking ourselves out.

750
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,440
So what the fuck do we do now?

751
00:30:49,440 --> 00:31:17,440
Oh, my God.

752
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Oh, my God.

753
00:31:45,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Oh, my God.

754
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:42,440
Oh, my God.

755
00:32:42,440 --> 00:33:11,440
Oh, my God.

756
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:18,840
Greetings, my greasy grandkids.

757
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,760
It's your grease granddad Wolf, the dog, and I'm here to let you all know that you can

758
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,760
support this show and help it grow with some of that hard-earned dough.

759
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:36,800
Yeah, you know that rhyme was so nice, I said it twice and make sure you go over to patreon.com

760
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,760
slash pretending pod.

761
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,960
The link is in the damn show notes, babies.

762
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,720
Thanks for listening, my bacon buddies.
