00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
Did y'all know that real human people eat mushrooms?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.100
Those weird little fuckers

00:06.100 --> 00:08.460
that grow out of the poop or something.

00:08.460 --> 00:11.560
Damn, and y'all thought I was nasty.

00:11.560 --> 00:14.700
And here you are just eating dirt fungus

00:14.700 --> 00:16.840
like it's going out of style.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.860
I'll take a pot of day old warm cream

00:19.860 --> 00:23.340
any day over mud fucking mushrooms.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.900
Speaking of fucking, y'all are listening

00:25.900 --> 00:28.800
to the radio show that fucks the most.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.360
694.2 PTBP.

00:32.360 --> 00:37.360
And I am your most fuckingest host, Wolf the Dog.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.140
I'm excited to announce a new project

00:40.140 --> 00:42.840
for our citizens of contention.

00:42.840 --> 00:47.000
We want to write a Delta Green scenario as a community.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.800
Over the next few months,

00:48.800 --> 00:51.320
we'll be having prompted writing contests

00:51.320 --> 00:54.820
to find the best meaty chunks y'all can muster.

00:54.820 --> 00:59.000
We'll use each round's winner to inform the next prompt

00:59.000 --> 01:01.280
until we have enough juicy morsels

01:01.280 --> 01:03.920
to make ourselves a narrative feast.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.060
To get in on this tub of greasy love,

01:07.060 --> 01:12.060
head on down to reddit.com r slash pretending to be people.

01:12.660 --> 01:16.100
Show us what you've got and vote for your favorites

01:16.100 --> 01:18.580
to help us choose the winners.

01:18.580 --> 01:21.700
Is 89 episodes a long time?

01:21.700 --> 01:23.340
Are we friends now?

01:23.340 --> 01:26.420
Would a friend throw a wolf a fucking bone

01:26.420 --> 01:31.260
and slap those follow buttons on Twitter and the Instagrams?

01:31.260 --> 01:33.440
Would a friend take it a step further

01:33.440 --> 01:36.420
and spend a minute typing up a five-star review

01:36.420 --> 01:38.340
on Apple podcasts?

01:38.340 --> 01:41.060
If you do, I might read it on air

01:41.060 --> 01:43.160
like I'm about to read this review

01:43.160 --> 01:48.160
from Hello Under Dash Cerise entitled Best Wolf Ever.

01:49.180 --> 01:50.420
They right.

01:50.420 --> 01:51.480
Listen, y'all.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.320
This here actual play role-playing podcast

01:54.320 --> 01:58.520
is really creative and might just spoil you for any others.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.000
If you don't know what Delta Green is,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.120
you're in for a treat.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.960
Imagine X-Files meets Lovecraft meets Night Vale,

02:06.960 --> 02:10.240
except the agents are pretty terrible at their jobs.

02:10.240 --> 02:14.160
But actually, really, the best part is Wolf the dog

02:14.160 --> 02:16.360
as the intro DJ.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.160
In the very many large, numerous amounts

02:19.160 --> 02:22.800
of new music tracks he plays every week.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.560
Hell yeah, baby.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.520
Finally, some recognition for all the damn hard work I do,

02:28.520 --> 02:32.080
especially when it comes to seeking new music out.

02:32.080 --> 02:35.160
I don't know what all those things you listed are,

02:35.160 --> 02:37.600
but I assume that they meant that you think

02:37.600 --> 02:40.940
that this weird podcast is good?

02:40.940 --> 02:42.560
I wouldn't fucking know.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.480
Never listened to a second of it personally.

02:45.480 --> 02:50.160
This was one of 234 tasty reviews.

02:50.160 --> 02:54.920
And when we hit 311 on Apple Podcasts, I'll tell you what.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.800
Every person who has typed up a sweet treat of a review

02:57.800 --> 02:59.920
will be entered in a drawing

02:59.920 --> 03:02.840
to win a pretended to be people t-shirt.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.400
That's right, folks.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.320
The merch is real.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.100
It's just that you have to win a drawing

03:09.100 --> 03:11.680
to get your mitts on these shits.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.200
Until my producer figures out how the fuck

03:14.200 --> 03:17.560
the internet works, same, honestly,

03:17.560 --> 03:19.400
then it'll be for sale.

03:19.400 --> 03:24.400
And remember, most of those 234 reviews weren't written.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.840
They just hit the fifth star,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.480
which still makes Wolfie smile.

03:29.480 --> 03:33.480
But you must write a review to be entered into the contest.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.100
Also, that makes each of your chances

03:36.100 --> 03:39.620
of winning one of these sick teas that much greater.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.020
So get in on it while the getting's good.

03:43.020 --> 03:46.800
Do y'all remember my dog, Wolf, the dog?

03:46.800 --> 03:49.780
Today, I found him sitting at a little desk

03:49.780 --> 03:52.660
with a microphone and sunglasses on.

03:52.660 --> 03:56.920
It looked like he had some kind of broadcasting kit.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.620
What the fuck?

03:58.620 --> 04:01.860
Where the fuck did he get sunglasses from?

04:01.860 --> 04:04.980
Time for the most stable part of this here reality.

04:04.980 --> 04:07.220
It is the news.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.820
Last time, John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth

04:10.820 --> 04:14.020
let slip to Anne Love that he is not, in fact,

04:14.020 --> 04:16.580
her former partner from K-Cell,

04:16.580 --> 04:20.100
but rather he is, in fact, one of the vectors

04:20.100 --> 04:22.860
K-Cell was tasked with destroying.

04:22.860 --> 04:27.180
Anne then put an impossibly clean blade into John's head

04:27.180 --> 04:29.900
and with a chant continued to move it deeper

04:29.900 --> 04:33.860
into this cranium down into his throat

04:33.860 --> 04:36.700
before eventually ending his life.

04:36.740 --> 04:39.380
For a sweet, sweet moment.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.860
In the muddy, ankle-deep, fish-infested overflow

04:43.860 --> 04:45.780
of Bean's pond.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.700
Clark did what he could, but it just seems like

04:48.700 --> 04:51.600
this Anne Love is one resilient fucker.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.060
Round and round and round she goes.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.420
Will she stop?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.140
Nobody knows.

04:57.140 --> 04:58.980
There's only one thing I do know

04:58.980 --> 05:02.420
and that's that I put my trust in kudzu with no backbone.

05:06.700 --> 05:34.700
Quick behind the GM screen here at the top of episode 89.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.940
Thomas, you might find this interesting.

05:38.940 --> 05:42.380
Clark, he, oh, no, your name is Joe.

05:42.380 --> 05:47.380
And, fuck, we're deep in it now.

05:47.700 --> 05:52.700
We're so deep in it, my notes here for the last episode say

05:54.140 --> 05:57.940
if Anne finds out that John is ball

05:57.940 --> 06:01.100
she will make an excuse to walk away

06:01.100 --> 06:02.900
to chant over her blade,

06:02.900 --> 06:05.220
make them roll alertness to hear that

06:05.220 --> 06:06.960
before attacking John.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.500
Yeah, see, we're totally railroaded.

06:15.860 --> 06:18.180
I think something in my mind was just like,

06:18.180 --> 06:20.740
you know what, he's probably just gonna fucking tell her.

06:23.220 --> 06:25.580
And then instead of having to make an excuse to go away

06:25.580 --> 06:27.740
you guys are like, hey, can we have a minute?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.100
Yeah.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.220
Will you walk away and chant over your blade real fast?

06:32.260 --> 06:33.100
We gotta talk.

06:36.780 --> 06:38.660
Take all the time you need.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.300
That was a really good Anne Love impression.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.260
I gotta admit, both Clark and Joe were surprised

06:47.260 --> 06:50.260
that Kevin did tell her about ball.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.800
That popped out of nowhere.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.580
Well, yeah, it did.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.460
That's because I completely forgot

06:56.460 --> 07:01.300
that we weren't telling her who I was.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.260
That you were John, right, right, right.

07:04.260 --> 07:06.300
Too many secrets and lies, man.

07:08.620 --> 07:12.020
Oh, actually that's what, season two, no secrets, no lies.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.260
No repercussions, no secrets, no lies.

07:20.820 --> 07:22.460
We'll still fuck it up, don't worry.

07:22.460 --> 07:23.300
Yeah.

07:25.980 --> 07:28.020
I mean, if you guys were just truthful with everyone

07:28.020 --> 07:30.300
right off the bat, you wouldn't have to keep track

07:30.300 --> 07:31.860
of all your lies.

07:31.860 --> 07:34.500
It's more or less what I was attempting there.

07:37.580 --> 07:38.860
Radical honesty.

07:41.740 --> 07:44.000
I gotta get this off my chest.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.660
Well, she sure knew a lot about ball.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.840
You know that thing, me and my, you and my dad

07:52.840 --> 07:56.840
were sent to contention to take care of, I'm one of them.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.840
Let's see, the note in the green box said they got

08:00.840 --> 08:04.320
nine of 12, so I guess that's 10 of 12 now.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.240
What the fuck, what the fuck?

08:06.240 --> 08:08.740
I don't remember the note, I got a final note.

08:08.740 --> 08:11.280
That was like episode five or six, I mean.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.480
Holy shit, yeah, it was like over a year and a half ago.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.880
And that's just in release time, not when we actually played.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.240
It's funny, here, this is a page from back

08:26.600 --> 08:29.120
when we first started of what my notes looked like.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.040
Very detailed, so detailed, so many words on the page.

08:33.040 --> 08:38.040
This was last session, and that was the entire session

08:40.100 --> 08:45.100
was this bottom quarter of a page and then two sentences

08:45.400 --> 08:46.640
at the top of the next.

08:49.400 --> 08:53.760
That's fair, as you've lost sanity, you've also lost

08:53.760 --> 08:58.040
all motivation to keep track of the events of this game.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.760
Here was a good day, at some point I just wrote

09:01.760 --> 09:04.600
like four notes on a page and then went to the next page

09:04.600 --> 09:05.680
for the next session.

09:09.040 --> 09:14.040
Here's me getting theomania, belief you are a god.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.480
Yep, is that the last note you took?

09:17.480 --> 09:19.240
Oh, nope, oh my god.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.720
Oh yes, that is righteous.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.960
That was my god phase.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.560
Then it's back to normal notes.

09:29.160 --> 09:33.240
My notes for last episode have a ton of stuff.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.880
We didn't do any of it, except for that one,

09:37.880 --> 09:40.760
the chant over her blade before attacking Jon.

09:40.760 --> 09:45.640
I found what we'd written down, what I wrote down

09:45.640 --> 09:49.520
for what was found in the storage lockers.

09:49.520 --> 09:54.280
And I wrote like bricks of cocaine, a burlap sack,

09:54.280 --> 09:57.480
lots of cash, and then it just says lots of great shit.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.040
And then it skips down, it says three notes on a table.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.040
I don't describe those notes.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.280
Three notes on a table?

10:08.280 --> 10:11.320
If you would ask me if there were three notes on a table

10:11.320 --> 10:13.760
in that fucking green box, I'd be like, no,

10:13.760 --> 10:16.320
there weren't just three notes sitting on a table

10:16.320 --> 10:17.640
that we didn't like.

10:17.640 --> 10:18.920
Do you want me to tell you what they were?

10:19.640 --> 10:21.000
I wrote three notes on a table,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.160
including newspaper clipping about Cole's orphanage,

10:25.160 --> 10:27.160
which has recently been brought up,

10:27.160 --> 10:28.760
which is kind of cool that I just read that.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.000
Well, it keeps getting, yeah, I mean,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.200
they did a shitty job of erasing it from history

10:32.200 --> 10:35.400
because everybody's fucking talking about it.

10:35.400 --> 10:40.200
Let's see, one is a note that says the cabin

10:40.200 --> 10:43.720
is in the woods, stark west from the end of the trail,

10:43.720 --> 10:47.920
about 2.5 miles, signed K.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.880
Okay, so we investigated that.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.560
But then it also says, we took care of nine of them

10:53.560 --> 10:56.080
as well as the leader.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.720
That's the one I didn't remember just now.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.360
I remember it phrased like that,

11:00.360 --> 11:02.400
didn't think they were talking about ball babies.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.400
Yeah, there's another one that says

11:04.400 --> 11:06.840
the work is difficult in particular,

11:06.840 --> 11:09.360
but I've had 12 successes.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.680
Life isn't as complex as they believe.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.980
They are quite simple.

11:14.980 --> 11:17.680
It will be their downfall.

11:17.680 --> 11:21.140
And then finally, the newspaper ad from 25 years ago

11:21.140 --> 11:25.720
for Kohl's Orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.400
Which we did end up asking somebody about

11:28.400 --> 11:30.080
and they did tell us about it a little bit.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.800
We've talked about Kohl's a number of times with people.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.440
Kohl's Orphanage is the orphanage

11:35.440 --> 11:38.160
that John Lee Pettymore came from.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.960
It also was, I believe you asked Drew

11:40.960 --> 11:42.440
to look up information on it

11:42.440 --> 11:44.960
and he couldn't find any information.

11:44.960 --> 11:45.800
Right.

11:45.800 --> 11:50.640
However, Randy Angst, the first time you talked to him,

11:50.640 --> 11:53.600
had a distinct memory of an orphanage

11:53.600 --> 11:55.480
existing under that name.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.000
And then did we learn,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.140
we learned more about it in the woods arc, right?

11:59.140 --> 12:00.920
Certainly out of character.

12:00.920 --> 12:05.680
That was a big part of the Ken Krenkelhoff story.

12:05.680 --> 12:06.960
Yup, yup, yup.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.800
Yup, yup.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.820
Ken might be chilling in a door somewhere, even to this day.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.600
I believe that door, along with the rest

12:16.280 --> 12:17.120
of the cabin was set on fire.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.160
Oh, that's right.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.600
Yup, nevermind. Poor door boy.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.440
Poor door boy.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.200
Krenkelhoff door boy.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.200
Well, do you guys want to get into this?

12:29.200 --> 12:30.080
Yeah, let's hit it.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.640
John Lee Pettymore the first body is like,

12:32.640 --> 12:34.520
oh, okay, that seems about right.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.360
Sorry.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.260
I think Thomas might be calling me.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.440
I'm on Do Not Disturb right now.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.560
So I'll have to look at my phone

12:43.560 --> 12:45.000
to see if he's actually calling me.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.120
No, he's calling Luke.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.740
For sure he's calling Luke.

12:48.740 --> 12:50.640
Luke didn't pick up because he's too busy playing.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.440
Do you have your phone set on Do Not Disturb?

12:53.440 --> 12:54.540
Oh no, I don't.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.460
It should be ringable.

12:57.460 --> 12:58.880
No, it's ringing.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.720
Hello?

12:59.720 --> 13:01.760
Hey, follow me.

13:01.760 --> 13:02.680
Off mic.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.720
Oh, they're just walking away from their microphones.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.800
They could just turn off their microphones,

13:08.800 --> 13:11.080
but they've decided to take their headphones off

13:11.080 --> 13:13.880
and walk away from their cameras.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.760
Oh, I can hear them actually.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.560
Oh, I can absolutely hear what they're talking about.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.220
Thomas is so fucking loud, it's crazy.

13:21.220 --> 13:22.760
He just asked Joe.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.800
He just told Joe that he has 15 luck

13:25.800 --> 13:29.560
and that he can spend 10 to have a vision.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.680
And he asked Joe what would be the most

13:32.800 --> 13:34.620
prudent information to learn.

13:35.660 --> 13:36.800
Go lie down right there now.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.840
Now they're back.

13:37.920 --> 13:38.760
Oh.

13:40.600 --> 13:44.200
I was narrating the phone call for our listeners

13:44.200 --> 13:47.240
because you left your microphones on.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.980
And Thomas is really loud,

13:51.980 --> 13:54.280
so I could hear his side of the conversation.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.040
Oh yeah, look, it's really plain and audacity.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.240
Shit, it's like, yeah, it's totally all there.

14:07.840 --> 14:12.480
Fuck, all right.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.480
Well, now I'm actually gonna leave the room for a second

14:14.480 --> 14:16.440
so you guys can just talk to each other on mic

14:16.440 --> 14:18.400
if you wanna do that. Nice try.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.200
He made a big show of pulling out his earphones,

14:23.200 --> 14:25.120
but we know he's been on speaker this whole time.

14:25.120 --> 14:28.040
The earphones aren't what's plugged in, it's his earbuds.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.520
Those are just decoy earphones.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.000
Did you guys have a good conversation?

14:35.000 --> 14:35.960
Yeah.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.480
Yeah, yeah.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.520
Wouldn't you like to know?

14:38.520 --> 14:41.040
Why don't you just check the track and find out?

14:41.040 --> 14:43.880
We should have said like, fuck you, Zach, or some shit.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.480
That would actually be really funny.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.360
I like listening to the conversations you guys have

14:49.360 --> 14:50.240
when I've left,

14:50.240 --> 14:51.920
because typically in the middle of the episode,

14:51.920 --> 14:54.600
you forget that I'm gonna listen back to him.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.360
So when you guys just keep talking about

14:56.360 --> 15:00.120
how much you love me and appreciate that I'm doing this,

15:00.120 --> 15:02.040
it's like, joke's on you.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.840
We're just trying to get you

15:03.840 --> 15:05.280
to treat our characters well.

15:08.040 --> 15:08.880
We know you're listening.

15:08.880 --> 15:09.720
Well, speaking of which.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.160
We're just trying to earn a favor.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.040
John Lee Pettymore, the thirst body

15:14.040 --> 15:17.080
is in a fucking waterbed grave,

15:17.080 --> 15:20.760
and Clark is standing behind it,

15:20.760 --> 15:24.280
and you can see the hilt of this blade

15:24.280 --> 15:28.240
sticking up out of the water above the head.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.720
And right ahead of that is Anne Love,

15:30.720 --> 15:35.400
whose wry smile is just sitting

15:35.400 --> 15:40.120
as it always seems to be underneath a single eye.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.680
You've seen the other eye in action

15:43.680 --> 15:45.960
when her hair gets tousled about.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.120
Like, she has two eyes.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.200
We're not worried about that, but.

15:52.520 --> 15:53.800
I wasn't until now.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.760
Yeah, why do you?

15:58.480 --> 15:59.600
You're being really suspicious.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.440
We're not worried about that.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.320
About how many eyes this person has.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.760
She's a cyclops.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.960
Is it more or less than two?

16:12.800 --> 16:16.160
Ooh, there's the question for anyone with bangs, honestly.

16:16.160 --> 16:21.160
Spider Anne has as many eyes as a spider does.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.280
It literally would have rhymed.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.880
How many eyes do spiders have?

16:32.880 --> 16:34.240
Luke, look that up.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.200
All right, so.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.520
He's having his own fun.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.800
Yeah, but I miss him.

16:42.800 --> 16:43.840
Oh, me too.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.480
I mean, I get to spend time with him,

16:45.480 --> 16:50.480
but I still miss him and his terrible, terrible internet.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.880
Are you dating him?

16:52.880 --> 16:54.000
Are you dating Luke?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.480
Are you dating Luke, dude?

16:55.480 --> 16:57.080
Don't tell my ex-girlfriend.

16:57.080 --> 16:57.920
Are you dating?

16:59.200 --> 17:00.960
That's not our joke.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.640
Oh, fuck, I always forget that that's like

17:03.640 --> 17:08.040
the stapled, good joke, Scott Ockerman.

17:08.040 --> 17:08.880
All right, so.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.000
Okay, nice deflection.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.040
But for real, dude, are you dating Luke?

17:14.280 --> 17:17.400
We're not supposed to tell anyone about it.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.280
I fucking knew that something like this

17:20.280 --> 17:21.920
would tear the podcast apart.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.120
You get the five of us together

17:26.120 --> 17:28.240
and eventually somebody's not gonna be able

17:28.240 --> 17:30.000
to keep it in their pants.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.920
And I'm surprised, I'm surprised at you, Zach.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.760
Luke, I expected.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.480
Joe, sure, Justin, of course, but you?

17:39.480 --> 17:41.720
Taylor said she'll only let me keep doing it

17:41.720 --> 17:43.680
if she takes Luke's spot

17:43.680 --> 17:46.000
and plays Keith Vigna the rest of the time.

17:46.000 --> 17:46.840
Okay, cool.

17:46.840 --> 17:47.760
I don't know, a chick?

17:50.160 --> 17:51.260
You don't know any?

17:53.400 --> 17:56.280
I'd like to spend 10 luck to have a vision.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.320
Oh, okay, cool.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.320
What, that's crazy.

18:02.560 --> 18:05.160
Thomas, you can spend 10 luck to get a vision?

18:05.160 --> 18:06.000
That's nuts.

18:06.000 --> 18:06.840
Fuck yeah, dude.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.360
How much luck do you have?

18:08.360 --> 18:12.360
Well, I have 15 because I spent 10 of my 25

18:12.360 --> 18:14.560
to avoid major damage.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.400
Hell yeah.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.200
And I'm still hanging on with one hit point here.

18:18.200 --> 18:23.200
You see one weak finger rise up from the pavement

18:24.640 --> 18:26.480
from a shattered body.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.640
It's all he can muster,

18:27.640 --> 18:29.520
but you see life in John Lee Pettymore

18:29.960 --> 18:32.880
as he urges you to wait a minute as he has this vision.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.440
Okay, yeah, that seems perfect.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.320
Joe, take off your headphones, I suppose,

18:42.320 --> 18:43.800
unless you already know what the question

18:43.800 --> 18:44.800
he's gonna ask is.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.640
I don't 100%, I'll play it like that.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.000
Take them off.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.920
Yeah, yeah.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.000
All right, Thomas.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.560
Where's the book?

18:54.560 --> 18:56.880
Your entire face is underwater

18:56.920 --> 18:59.920
and typically your eyes would roll back

18:59.920 --> 19:02.360
into your head during one of these,

19:02.360 --> 19:07.360
but as you lift a finger and begin finding yourself in ball,

19:09.560 --> 19:12.280
you seem to have the ability to reach out

19:12.280 --> 19:16.440
into the collective unconsciousness of the entire universe

19:16.440 --> 19:20.560
to pick out certain memories that exist

19:20.560 --> 19:23.880
from people throughout different times.

19:23.880 --> 19:28.880
And you see Gary Daley ushering Eunice and Jerry Bishop

19:30.840 --> 19:33.680
into the back of the Daley Fuh,

19:33.680 --> 19:38.680
and you see him passing this book to the bishops.

19:38.760 --> 19:43.360
The book is covered in uncured leather

19:43.360 --> 19:47.080
with some hairs, maybe some acne.

19:48.800 --> 19:53.800
There's some stretch marks on the binding of this book

19:53.800 --> 19:56.680
and he hands it to him and then reality begins

19:56.680 --> 20:00.920
to kind of fade up and blink and turn

20:00.920 --> 20:04.040
like you're turning channels on a television.

20:04.040 --> 20:08.560
And then you're inside the bishop home.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.240
And you see Eunice and Jerry,

20:10.240 --> 20:13.240
they're talking about this book that they have

20:13.240 --> 20:16.320
just sitting on their kitchen table

20:16.320 --> 20:19.560
and they're sitting on either side

20:19.560 --> 20:22.360
discussing options, seemingly.

20:22.360 --> 20:26.880
And a young Clark Bishop walks into the room

20:27.960 --> 20:32.200
and quickly, Jerry gets up and is like, oh, no, no, no,

20:32.200 --> 20:34.120
and sits him in front of the TV

20:34.120 --> 20:36.200
where Wheel of Fortune is on.

20:37.760 --> 20:41.720
Memories kind of fade, reality blinks out again,

20:41.720 --> 20:46.080
and you see Eunice and Jerry at the television.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.520
It's in this entertainment center.

20:48.520 --> 20:51.560
They move the television out of the way

20:51.600 --> 20:56.080
and there's a false bottom of this entertainment center

20:56.080 --> 21:01.080
and there's a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.760
And you're just watching them open it up.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.160
What code did they punch in?

21:06.160 --> 21:07.720
I'm not gonna give you the code.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.040
You asked where the book is, not how to get it.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.960
I'll fight you for it.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.200
All right, come over here.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.000
I could use some human touch.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.720
That's not Luke's, I mean my wife's.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.040
You're Luke's.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.240
And you see them punching a code,

21:29.240 --> 21:31.560
but the camera is just on their faces

21:31.560 --> 21:32.840
as they're typing it in.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.800
Oh, great.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.440
Listen, Zach, I've seen enough below deck

21:36.440 --> 21:38.800
to know how this is gonna go with Luke.

21:38.800 --> 21:43.400
So you just need to end it now to keep things professional.

21:43.400 --> 21:47.000
Otherwise we're gonna tear this whole organization apart

21:47.000 --> 21:49.240
with sex and recriminations.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.760
This thing was doomed the second you put two feisty,

21:52.760 --> 21:56.680
hot 20 somethings in it like me and Luke, baby.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.520
Yeah.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.120
You know when we started,

22:00.120 --> 22:04.240
Joe, Justin and I were hot 20 somethings as well.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.000
Of course this was years ago.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.480
In the before times.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.080
And they placed the book in this safe

22:15.080 --> 22:18.200
in the false bottom of this entertainment center

22:18.200 --> 22:21.360
and they close the door and click lock

22:21.360 --> 22:25.280
and you see them look at each other and they embrace.

22:25.280 --> 22:29.080
And then you're back under this muddy, murky water

22:29.080 --> 22:31.080
right outside of Bean's Pond.

22:31.080 --> 22:34.160
And the year is whatever year it is.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.000
2000.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.400
I'm gonna bring Joe back.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.320
Hi, I'm back.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.200
Hey, Joe.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.360
Hello.

22:45.400 --> 22:49.320
Clark and Anne are just staring at each other

22:49.320 --> 22:52.040
waiting for John to be done with his vision.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.720
John is still weakly holding up his finger

22:56.720 --> 22:59.400
and he starts to writhe in the water and

23:01.800 --> 23:03.560
Don't you touch him, man, don't you touch him.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.320
And Anne is looking down at him with massive eyes,

23:06.320 --> 23:07.720
just so confused.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.440
And he rolls over on his side.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.960
John, John.

23:16.200 --> 23:20.320
I know where your book is, Anne.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.880
That's a nice try.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.600
That's a nice try.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.080
Okay, I guess we'll persuade.

23:28.080 --> 23:28.920
10.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.000
How?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.200
Well, I'm something of a savior

23:33.200 --> 23:37.920
and I have the second sight as part of that whole package.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.400
He's not lying about that, Anne.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.400
I've seen him see things before.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.880
I can see into moments into the past

23:43.960 --> 23:47.680
or rather moments into the not now.

23:47.680 --> 23:52.680
And well, I saw a whole little saga of the book,

23:53.360 --> 23:54.200
but

23:54.200 --> 23:55.040
Tell me now.

23:55.040 --> 23:58.960
Well, it is at Clark's parents' house,

23:58.960 --> 24:00.720
but you'll never find it without me.

24:00.720 --> 24:01.800
What do you want?

24:01.800 --> 24:04.520
Well, when we find the book,

24:04.520 --> 24:06.360
I want you to teach us the spell

24:06.360 --> 24:07.960
to help us get through that door.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.120
Okay, neither one of you are gonna be armed

24:10.120 --> 24:12.640
and I'm gonna walk behind you with two guns.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.000
No. One on each of you.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.480
No, no, no, no, no.

24:15.480 --> 24:16.880
Other way around maybe.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.560
Well, why would I trust you?

24:20.240 --> 24:23.120
After all this, you think I'm gonna trust you?

24:23.120 --> 24:25.400
You're the one who's trading the book for your life

24:25.400 --> 24:26.760
essentially right now.

24:26.760 --> 24:31.120
I'm the one with a gun pointed at your head.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.480
I reload my gun.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.160
Just so you know, in this mud,

24:34.160 --> 24:36.000
you've kind of turned over.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.640
You're on your back now.

24:37.640 --> 24:42.480
You've got a massive knife going all the way down

24:42.480 --> 24:44.760
through your skull, touching your uvula,

24:44.760 --> 24:48.080
and she has a gun pointed at you.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.880
And you reach for your gun?

24:50.880 --> 24:52.240
Yes.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.080
Good call.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.920
Okay, no guns.

24:57.920 --> 24:58.960
We all leave them here.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.080
Wow, what if we just all had guns?

25:01.080 --> 25:04.280
This is gonna end in a bloodbath if you don't...

25:04.280 --> 25:05.120
Can we not?

25:05.120 --> 25:07.600
This town is full of fanatics and freaks,

25:07.600 --> 25:09.320
and you know, you've got your magic,

25:09.320 --> 25:11.400
but I'd rather have my gun.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.120
You know, a lot of people are trying to find us.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.680
I mean, you do have a knife.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.040
We're not joking about that yet.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.800
Okay.

25:21.800 --> 25:24.680
It's cool that you can talk normally though.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.880
All right, so everyone has their guns

25:26.880 --> 25:28.920
and we'll just all be good

25:28.920 --> 25:31.840
because we both need each other to get this done,

25:31.840 --> 25:33.680
hopefully by the end of the episode.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.000
Can you get your knife out of my head?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.400
I don't know if that's a great idea.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.800
For bleeding's sake,

25:41.800 --> 25:45.000
I mean, I'd rather have my knife back, you know,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.400
but it doesn't seem like you'll survive

25:48.400 --> 25:50.720
and I now need you, unfortunately.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.320
You're magic, but something tells me

25:52.320 --> 25:54.200
you probably don't know any healing.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.080
Oh, that's a good point.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.080
No, I could do that.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.440
Could you throw a little bit of that my way

26:00.440 --> 26:02.240
and then you could maybe have your knife back?

26:02.240 --> 26:03.200
It's really hard.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.720
This is a very big knife

26:04.720 --> 26:06.760
and it's hard to hold my head up with it.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.680
She kind of crouches down on the ground.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.600
There's just enough of the knife sticking out.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.480
There's just enough of the blade sticking out at the top

26:18.480 --> 26:20.880
to where she can wiggle her fingers in

26:20.880 --> 26:25.160
and she begins cutting right in between two of her fingers,

26:25.160 --> 26:27.840
just enough to get blood to start coming out.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.800
And then she starts chanting,

26:30.800 --> 26:35.920
Dem artai rat, dem artai rat, dem artai rat.

26:35.920 --> 26:36.760
On the last one,

26:36.760 --> 26:41.760
she pulls the knife all the way up out of your head.

26:43.040 --> 26:47.320
And with a chant, the blood that comes out of her hand

26:47.320 --> 26:51.480
forms like a jackhammer tube of coagulation

26:51.480 --> 26:53.800
straight down into your throat

26:53.800 --> 26:56.160
and you can taste Anne loves blood.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.320
Both of you roll sanity.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.160
Oh no.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.320
Oh ho ho ho ho.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.640
Fail, 48.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.000
Fail, 78 on an eight.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.240
What's your power there?

27:13.240 --> 27:14.080
My power?

27:14.080 --> 27:15.920
Oh, fuck me, dude.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.280
It's a 60.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.840
So I rolled over my power.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.760
We were all gonna be...

27:26.760 --> 27:28.440
This may work in our advantage.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.080
Yeah, show her Clark's a wild card.

27:33.080 --> 27:37.560
Fucking maybe, but this episode was gonna be fine.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.640
It was about to happen.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.960
It was about to happen.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.480
Okay, you're both gonna lose a D4.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.320
Oh, for real?

27:45.320 --> 27:46.440
For blood magic.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.280
One.

27:47.280 --> 27:51.360
That puts a column of blood through the entire head.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.360
I'm at 15.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.200
Two.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.440
I lose two and that puts me at my breaking point.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.240
All right.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.560
That means you break, right?

28:01.560 --> 28:03.520
That means it's time for a new mania.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.040
What a time for it.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.640
What a time for it.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.440
What a time to be a fan of this podcast.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.360
Ha ha ha ha ha.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.280
Listeners, I'm glad you're here with us right now.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.800
This is...

28:15.800 --> 28:17.280
We were so close.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.880
Everything was gonna be all right.

28:19.880 --> 28:20.880
What the...

28:28.880 --> 28:32.280
So, it's time to roll, baby.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.720
Oh, fuck me.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.120
It's still time to roll, baby.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.040
Oh boy.

28:40.040 --> 28:45.040
Sample mania's table from Call of Cthulhu, 7th edition.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.760
D100, three times.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.840
94?

28:48.840 --> 28:52.040
94 is theomania.

28:52.040 --> 28:52.920
God damn it.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.200
The belief that he or she is a god.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.600
Hey, you get a second chance.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.280
So, we meet again.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.600
Ha ha ha ha ha.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.240
A 62?

29:03.240 --> 29:08.200
62 is gonna be legiro mania,

29:08.200 --> 29:13.200
an uncontrollable compulsion to make loud or shrill noises.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.680
No, thank you.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.520
We don't need to roll.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.360
I'll take that one.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.200
Ha ha ha ha ha.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.640
Fuck you.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.640
And the last one.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.480
51.

29:24.480 --> 29:27.360
51 is gonna be gymnomania.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.960
Is that nudity?

29:31.960 --> 29:33.520
Yes, it is indeed.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.640
It is a compulsion with nudity.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.560
Oh boy.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.840
Oh, I didn't wanna take the belief in God thing

29:40.840 --> 29:43.520
because I was so fucking bad at it before,

29:43.520 --> 29:46.440
but I also don't wanna be taking my clothes off all the time.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.320
Ha ha ha ha ha.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.600
Joe, what an opportunity you've been given

29:52.720 --> 29:54.640
here at this stage.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.480
Yeah.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.240
I mean, yeah, no, 100%.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.040
I know that right now would be a really good time

30:00.040 --> 30:01.480
for Clark to think that he's a god

30:01.480 --> 30:05.240
because we are in overseer territory.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.720
I just worry that it's hard for me to play it sometimes

30:09.840 --> 30:12.400
because how does a god decide,

30:12.400 --> 30:14.600
how does a god go somewhere else

30:14.600 --> 30:16.080
when people wanna go somewhere else?

30:16.600 --> 30:17.680
You know what I mean?

30:17.680 --> 30:19.000
It's hard sometimes.

30:19.840 --> 30:21.480
I'll try it, I'll try it.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.600
That's all that anyone's asking.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.040
No one listens to this fucking show anyway.

30:30.040 --> 30:33.200
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.320
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.760
I once again believe that I am a god.

30:37.760 --> 30:38.720
Yes, you do.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.360
How hard do you believe it?

30:41.360 --> 30:43.600
Also, remember that each one of these manias,

30:43.600 --> 30:47.560
it strips away Clark Bishop's being.

30:47.560 --> 30:51.200
Clark is no longer who he was when he started.

30:51.200 --> 30:55.200
He's been taken over, especially with this one.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.800
So much of Clark's self was dictated

30:58.800 --> 31:02.120
by his almost nonchalance.

31:03.720 --> 31:08.560
However, I mean, you got that big overseer dick energy, dude.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.760
Spread it around, slap it on the table.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.840
Bring it out betwixt the robes opening.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.480
Yeah, I got it, you got it.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.360
But also that would be a compulsion of nudity,

31:21.360 --> 31:22.200
so whatever.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.280
I pick both, I pick both, I pick both.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.960
Hey, how much did Anne Love fail me for?

31:40.960 --> 31:42.520
Oh, let me roll.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.160
Oh, you get a D6.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.240
Five.

31:45.240 --> 31:46.840
Fuck yeah.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.200
So I'm at six.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.040
So the thing that sent me over the edge

31:50.040 --> 31:54.160
was seeing her cut her finger with the blade in his head.

31:54.160 --> 31:57.320
So I'm gonna lash out at her and try and,

31:57.320 --> 32:00.160
I want to wrestle the knife away from her.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.720
And I'm yelling, what the fuck is that?

32:02.720 --> 32:05.840
Fucking knife, blood magic, fucking shit.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.120
Like rushing her now.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.880
Okie dokie, that'll be unarmed combat.

32:13.480 --> 32:16.360
I pass a 41 on a 70.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.760
She passed with a 36.

32:18.760 --> 32:19.840
Yes.

32:19.840 --> 32:24.280
She pulls the large knife up out of John Lee Pettymore's

32:24.280 --> 32:27.040
head as she finishes this incantation.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.760
And before she knows it, you're just on her.

32:29.760 --> 32:32.360
And you grab the knife out of her hand,

32:32.360 --> 32:33.760
screaming about blood magic.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.720
And she just jumps back and she's like,

32:35.720 --> 32:38.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.680
It's literally healing.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.720
It's my blood.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.240
It's healing him.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.880
What the fuck is your problem?

32:43.880 --> 32:45.360
It's not, it's not, it's not right.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.760
That's not, that's not something a person

32:46.760 --> 32:47.800
should be able to do.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.680
Too fucking bad.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.200
Clark, I will say that personally at this moment,

32:52.200 --> 32:53.840
I have no objections.

32:53.840 --> 32:54.960
Are you, are you, are you you?

32:54.960 --> 32:55.800
Are you all right?

32:55.800 --> 32:56.640
Are you you?

32:57.160 --> 32:59.360
It was her blood that went inside of you.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.600
Yeah, I know.

33:00.600 --> 33:04.320
She gave me a well, a well, a much needed transfusion.

33:05.640 --> 33:06.480
I feel better.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.440
I feel better, Clark.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.360
I don't, I don't, I don't like, I don't like any of this.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.800
This is, this is, this is,

33:16.960 --> 33:18.040
this isn't the way it's supposed to be.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.600
This isn't the way it's supposed to happen.

33:19.600 --> 33:20.560
Clark, man.

33:20.560 --> 33:23.280
None of this is the way it was supposed to happen.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.640
No, I'm pretty sure this is exactly

33:25.680 --> 33:27.000
the way it was supposed to happen.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.120
Now we talked about guns, but I really,

33:31.120 --> 33:32.840
I would appreciate the knife back,

33:32.840 --> 33:35.880
but you seem to have a whole look in your eyes

33:37.920 --> 33:38.760
right now.

33:38.760 --> 33:43.360
So just by the time we get to your parents' house,

33:43.360 --> 33:44.840
can we call it that still?

33:44.840 --> 33:46.760
Then I would like to have that knife back

33:46.760 --> 33:48.280
if that's possible.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.200
I'll think about it, but I'm holding onto it for now.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.560
That was, that was freaky.

33:52.560 --> 33:53.520
That was freaky shit.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.520
Does Clark have a gun?

33:54.520 --> 33:55.640
I don't technically.

33:55.640 --> 33:56.480
Can I fish another water?

33:56.480 --> 33:57.320
Oh, you dropped it?

33:57.320 --> 33:58.160
Yeah.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.120
Yeah, and as you pick it up out of the water,

34:00.120 --> 34:02.520
it's water-locked, so you're just kinda like.

34:02.520 --> 34:05.520
All right, and Clark's gonna hold onto the knife

34:05.520 --> 34:08.280
and you're gonna drop your gun here in the pond with ours.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.280
Oh, so we are going no guns?

34:10.280 --> 34:12.000
I thought we were going all guns.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.920
I've, your mouth is kinda like a gun.

34:15.920 --> 34:16.760
What?

34:16.760 --> 34:18.920
She says spells and stuff to make people get hurt.

34:18.920 --> 34:19.760
All right.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.440
She's kinda got a built-in gun.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.960
Well, it helped too.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.200
I need pills.

34:26.200 --> 34:29.280
I need, I need strong pills.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.640
Do you have any of those at your house, Clark?

34:31.640 --> 34:34.360
I mean, there's a chance I got something there,

34:34.360 --> 34:37.440
but I could just top you up right now, right here.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.920
Here, just come here, just come here.

34:38.920 --> 34:39.760
What?

34:39.760 --> 34:41.400
What?

34:41.400 --> 34:44.280
He crawls, he crawls a little bit towards you.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.040
I put my hand on his head on the wound

34:48.040 --> 34:49.920
and I try to heal him.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.160
Clark tries to heal him.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.480
Okay.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.240
John Lee Pettymore starts praying.

34:56.240 --> 34:57.080
Yeah.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.880
It's like, no, I get it, I get it.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.200
Through crest, all things are possible.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.480
Is there a roll that I could make to-

35:05.480 --> 35:07.000
Go ahead and roll unnatural.

35:14.440 --> 35:16.080
I passed.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.960
It's a 31 on a 49.

35:18.960 --> 35:22.480
Whoa, I forgot we had good unnatural scores.

35:23.480 --> 35:26.680
This game is broken wide open.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.400
Joe?

35:29.400 --> 35:30.240
Yeah.

35:30.240 --> 35:34.640
Some words pop into your mind

35:34.640 --> 35:39.120
and you know that if you can spill some blood

35:39.120 --> 35:42.840
and say these words, that you can make it happen.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.840
I've got the knife in my hand still.

35:44.840 --> 35:48.600
So I take a page out of the book that I just saw

35:48.600 --> 35:51.240
and love demonstrate for me.

35:51.320 --> 35:54.240
And I do a little cut on the side of my thumb.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.200
So it's kind of dripping a little bit.

35:56.200 --> 36:00.240
And I say, damn all to year it.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.040
Damn all to year it.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.920
Damn all to year it.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.800
And as you finish saying the last one,

36:05.800 --> 36:09.720
the blood just like flows out of your thumb

36:11.440 --> 36:14.320
and goes up into the nostrils

36:14.320 --> 36:17.480
and the mouth of John Lee Pettymore.

36:17.480 --> 36:22.160
And you see the ooze pouring from his eyes

36:22.160 --> 36:24.320
and his ears and his mouth

36:24.320 --> 36:27.280
and the blood flowing on top of the ooze

36:27.280 --> 36:29.520
into all of his orifices.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.600
Go ahead and roll a D six.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.400
It's a one.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.960
Joe, every little bit helps.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.400
And I just want to say you started this

36:45.440 --> 36:48.240
by losing your goddamn mind over and love

36:48.240 --> 36:50.440
cutting yourself on that knife to heal me.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.960
And you ended it by fucking getting the courage

36:53.960 --> 36:54.840
to do that yourself.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.440
So I'm really proud of you, man.

36:59.520 --> 37:04.520
Joe Clark and just Clark needs to roll sanity on this one

37:05.160 --> 37:10.160
due to your change of pace and mindset

37:10.880 --> 37:15.880
and your shocking ability to be able to do this yourself.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.800
That's a fail.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.440
And that's going to be another D four.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.280
Fuck me, dude.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.440
It's a 79.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.640
It's over my power.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.560
Fuck, and I rolled a four.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.120
Fuck me, dude.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.800
How much do you have left?

37:34.800 --> 37:36.480
I got two, baby.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.600
Oh my God.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.080
Oh, okay.

37:41.080 --> 37:43.640
Upon seeing that it fucking worked,

37:45.400 --> 37:48.240
Clark's mind like starts to fracture

37:48.240 --> 37:52.280
and he pulls the knife away and yells, it worked.

37:52.280 --> 37:57.280
It's what I was always meant to be.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.720
It's what I was always meant to be.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.120
We don't need you anymore, Anne.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.680
We don't need you anymore.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.600
And I go right after her with the knife.

38:04.600 --> 38:05.440
Yes!

38:10.160 --> 38:11.000
Yes!

38:16.040 --> 38:16.880
Hey, Joe.

38:16.880 --> 38:17.720
Yeah.

38:17.720 --> 38:18.800
How much luck do you have?

38:18.800 --> 38:19.640
A lot.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.120
Do you need to know an exact number?

38:21.120 --> 38:25.640
No, I don't, but this just seems like a good opportunity

38:25.640 --> 38:29.280
if you wanted to literally spend all of your luck points

38:29.280 --> 38:32.120
to determine the outcome of this fight.

38:33.560 --> 38:37.160
You can also just spend luck points to change a roll.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.320
You could also do that.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.760
Don't let him, don't let him.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.680
This is, you're talking to the devil right now.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.520
And he's like, hey, Joe, give me all your luck.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.600
You don't have to do that.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.440
I'm just saying.

38:46.440 --> 38:47.280
There's a lot of things you can do

38:47.280 --> 38:48.280
in this fight with that luck.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.440
Instead of having to roll against me,

38:50.440 --> 38:53.200
who crits constantly during combat,

38:55.200 --> 38:57.480
you could just spend all of your luck

38:57.480 --> 39:00.520
and decide exactly how you finish off

39:00.520 --> 39:02.600
and love in this moment.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.640
You do only have two sanity, so.

39:05.640 --> 39:06.480
Yeah.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.760
Yeah.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.120
And I do want to, I do kind of want to finish her off.

39:10.120 --> 39:10.960
Yeah.

39:10.960 --> 39:11.880
You know where the book is.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.880
You told us you know where the book is, right?

39:13.880 --> 39:15.320
Yeah, I'm going to try and finish her off.

39:15.320 --> 39:20.320
I'm going to spend my hefty bank of 65 luck.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.320
Holy shit.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.720
And I'm going to call this like it is,

39:26.720 --> 39:29.280
Clark rushes her with unnatural strength.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.080
Oh yes, he does.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.320
In a flash is on her and he just wants to shove,

39:35.880 --> 39:38.880
he wants to do to her what she did to John.

39:38.880 --> 39:41.400
He wants to bring the knife down through her head.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.600
And that's exactly what happens.

39:44.600 --> 39:48.040
Clark rushes her with eyes akimbo,

39:48.040 --> 39:51.080
knowing what he has always been

39:51.080 --> 39:53.800
and was always meant to be

39:53.800 --> 39:58.600
and jumps up in the air with a dagger in both hands

39:58.600 --> 40:01.600
and comes down on top of Anne Love's head,

40:01.600 --> 40:06.600
whose eyes are so wide because she's never seen anyone

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
pick up any sort of unnatural ability A at all,

40:12.080 --> 40:17.080
B that quickly or C without any sort of training whatsoever.

40:18.480 --> 40:22.680
And you come down and pierce the top of her skull.

40:22.680 --> 40:27.040
And as you shove the knife into the top of her head,

40:27.040 --> 40:30.880
you see one of her eyes directly starts looking

40:30.880 --> 40:35.000
into your eyes and the other one just fills completely

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
with blood and the blood begins pouring down her face.

40:40.600 --> 40:45.600
She stops breathing and you stand back

40:46.040 --> 40:51.040
and she wobbles forward, backward, forward.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.880
And the knife still in her skull,

40:53.880 --> 40:58.880
she just falls back into the overfilled beans pond.

41:01.880 --> 41:06.600
And begins floating out into the middle

41:06.600 --> 41:08.400
of the mushroom shaped pond.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.760
Holy shit, Clark, that was awesome.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.880
We should go and get that book.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.680
Yeah, you haven't changed furniture, have you?

41:21.240 --> 41:24.080
As a matter of fact, no, why do you ask?

41:24.080 --> 41:28.520
Woo, okay, it'll make more sense when we get there.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.660
I'm not gonna tell you in case you decide to and love me.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.160
Yeah, let's go.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.760
As Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore the third

41:41.760 --> 41:45.920
trudge north through the town of contention,

41:45.920 --> 41:48.760
heading up through the warehouse district,

41:48.760 --> 41:51.960
pass subtropolous and all of downtown

41:51.960 --> 41:54.400
on the west side of A plus storage

41:54.400 --> 41:59.400
where you found the storage units G10, G11, and G12

41:59.640 --> 42:03.320
filled with, what was the quote, cool stuff.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.160
Lots of cool shit.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.000
Awesome things.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.320
Lots of cool shit.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.640
Lots of cool shit.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.360
Past Julie Maxwell's apartment building.

42:11.360 --> 42:14.240
I've got a really, really dumb story.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.400
There was a local trucking company

42:16.400 --> 42:20.760
that had this like billboard on I-44

42:20.760 --> 42:23.920
and it had like a picture of an electric guitar

42:24.400 --> 42:28.840
and like a motorcycle and like a baseball bat

42:28.840 --> 42:32.440
and in really big letters, it said cool stuff.

42:32.440 --> 42:36.520
And in really small letters, it said trucks bring it.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.840
But it was really hard to see the trucks bring it part.

42:39.840 --> 42:43.600
So it just looked like a dope billboard for cool stuff.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.880
I remember that billboard.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.040
I totally remember it.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.080
That's like an intimidating thing

42:52.120 --> 42:55.360
for like a sports team called the trucks.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.040
Trucks bring it.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.040
Trucks bring it.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.120
Oh, the trucks is such a good name

43:01.120 --> 43:02.960
for an American sports team.

43:02.960 --> 43:04.200
The trucks would be so good.

43:04.200 --> 43:05.760
Holy shit.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.920
Oh my God, your mascot could be like a dude

43:08.920 --> 43:11.240
inside a blow up semi.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.800
It could literally just be a dude fucking

43:13.800 --> 43:18.800
like tearing up your field in a tricked out like F-150.

43:19.560 --> 43:24.560
They could bring out like a fake field to put on top.

43:24.880 --> 43:26.520
That's how fields work, right?

43:26.520 --> 43:27.960
Yeah, for sure, fake field.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.360
When it rains, they pull out the fake field

43:30.360 --> 43:32.640
at baseball games.

43:32.640 --> 43:36.160
I was 17 years old and I was playing Ultimate Frisbee

43:36.160 --> 43:38.180
at the park that's across the street

43:38.180 --> 43:41.080
from our double A stadium here in Springfield

43:41.080 --> 43:43.620
where the Springfield Cardinals play.

43:43.620 --> 43:48.620
And it was raining and a few of us thought

43:48.920 --> 43:51.740
to ourselves, there's a game tonight, isn't there?

43:51.740 --> 43:54.320
So the tarps probably on the field.

43:54.320 --> 43:57.560
And so we ran and we jumped the fence

43:57.560 --> 44:01.720
and we ran down the third base side

44:01.720 --> 44:04.520
and we hopped onto the field.

44:04.520 --> 44:08.280
And I slip and slid from third base

44:08.280 --> 44:11.200
over the mound towards first.

44:13.120 --> 44:17.360
And then took off running and security yards chased me

44:17.360 --> 44:22.360
for like a block, but I was more agile back when I was 17.

44:25.320 --> 44:28.600
And it's still one of my greatest memories.

44:28.600 --> 44:30.400
It's honestly very cool.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.720
Yeah, Zach, that's a lot cooler

44:33.720 --> 44:35.640
than my story about a billboard.

44:40.640 --> 44:43.320
But also I saw that billboard and I was like,

44:43.320 --> 44:44.480
oh, that's so cool.

44:48.280 --> 44:52.960
And as you pass Julie Maxwell's apartment,

44:52.960 --> 44:56.160
you look up and see a billboard that has an electric guitar

44:57.720 --> 44:58.960
and a baseball bat.

45:00.680 --> 45:01.720
And what else was it?

45:02.600 --> 45:07.400
It was like a convertible and like a basketball.

45:07.400 --> 45:09.440
I remember the basketball and the electric guitar.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.680
I could see both of those pictured perfectly.

45:12.680 --> 45:14.800
And for some reason, all this billboard says is

45:14.800 --> 45:16.080
trucks bring it.

45:17.360 --> 45:22.360
Well, yeah, we haven't talked about the local

45:23.040 --> 45:27.040
rookie league baseball team outside of town, the trucks.

45:27.040 --> 45:29.240
The trucks, the contention trucks.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.320
John weakly says, trucks bring it.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.000
He's got season tickets.

45:41.480 --> 45:43.520
And as you're trudging through contention,

45:43.520 --> 45:47.880
you hear screams coming from the East

45:47.880 --> 45:51.880
and you can echo locate well enough here in contention

45:51.880 --> 45:55.280
to know that these screams are coming from

45:55.280 --> 45:58.680
the first church of contention as you're heading North

45:58.680 --> 46:01.560
up towards Clark Bishop's home.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.600
Does it sound like a lot of screams?

46:03.600 --> 46:08.200
It sounds like a lot of screens, tens of screens.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.840
Is it loud enough that we would stop in our tracks for it?

46:12.520 --> 46:14.200
It's not something we're just catching a whiff of

46:14.200 --> 46:15.240
on the air.

46:15.240 --> 46:19.960
Off in the distance about when you hit A plus storage,

46:19.960 --> 46:22.480
you start hearing it and it's just.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.760
Just shit like that.

46:31.760 --> 46:33.400
I don't want you to go there.

46:33.400 --> 46:36.360
I just want us to feel bad about not going there.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.320
Just enough.

46:37.320 --> 46:38.160
Yeah.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.840
John, I think if we stay the course,

46:40.840 --> 46:43.320
the whole point of our mission here is that overseer

46:43.320 --> 46:48.280
will come back and I'll save everyone.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.360
I don't think there's anything that's going to help us

46:50.360 --> 46:51.440
by helping them now.

46:51.440 --> 46:55.480
If they just are released into a world full of this goo,

46:55.480 --> 46:57.520
we need, we need me and myself.

46:57.520 --> 46:58.360
Yeah.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.840
I mean, I'm still pretty knife brained buddy.

47:00.840 --> 47:04.680
So I'm in no position to run off

47:04.680 --> 47:07.480
and save a bunch of people at this church.

47:07.480 --> 47:09.320
I think we need all the help we can get.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.160
All right.

47:10.680 --> 47:12.440
And those pills, did you say you had pills?

47:12.440 --> 47:14.000
You didn't have pills.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.240
What was the deal with that?

47:15.240 --> 47:18.600
I gave you, I gave you, I gave you health.

47:18.600 --> 47:19.600
I healed you.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.880
The one, okay.

47:22.560 --> 47:25.480
If I took an aspirin or something.

47:25.480 --> 47:27.480
I genuinely forgot it was just for one.

47:28.920 --> 47:29.760
No, I healed you.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.600
I healed you.

47:30.600 --> 47:31.440
I healed you.

47:31.440 --> 47:32.840
Good job, buddy.

47:32.840 --> 47:34.160
Thank you.

47:34.160 --> 47:36.440
Let's go, let's go, let's go get that book.

47:36.440 --> 47:37.640
Let's go get that book.

47:38.640 --> 47:40.360
Yeah, we just keep going.

47:40.360 --> 47:41.800
Clark, your home.

47:41.800 --> 47:42.640
How's it look?

47:42.640 --> 47:43.480
Well, as you're approaching,

47:43.480 --> 47:45.320
you do notice that the creek

47:45.320 --> 47:50.320
that runs kind of behind your house, dry, completely dry.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.600
But the home itself looks the exact same

47:52.600 --> 47:54.880
as you left it yesterday.

47:55.960 --> 47:58.560
Yeah, I opened the door.

47:58.560 --> 48:03.560
That familiar smell just wafts right up through your nose.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.360
And it's almost unseemly

48:06.360 --> 48:11.320
because you're not the man you were who lived here.

48:11.320 --> 48:14.360
John, welcome to my parents' house.

48:14.360 --> 48:19.360
I guess it's mine, but is this what you need?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.480
Is this where the book could be?

48:21.480 --> 48:22.880
Yeah, I think so.

48:22.880 --> 48:26.160
No drugs is what we decided.

48:26.160 --> 48:27.320
There's no drugs here.

48:27.320 --> 48:28.760
Joe, go ahead and roll luck.

48:29.760 --> 48:30.600
Fuck you.

48:34.480 --> 48:39.480
That's my favorite joke that I've done on this podcast.

48:44.920 --> 48:46.720
That one's just for the GM.

48:50.880 --> 48:53.480
Some of them gotta be.

48:53.480 --> 48:57.120
Clark, not even like wine or anything?

48:58.920 --> 48:59.760
Definitely not.

48:59.760 --> 49:03.000
There might be a beer or two in the fridge.

49:03.320 --> 49:06.400
Please bring me two, one, two drink

49:06.400 --> 49:08.960
and one, two press to my head.

49:08.960 --> 49:11.600
I do, I go to the fridge and grab a couple beers.

49:11.600 --> 49:16.200
Okay, you need to move the TV.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.800
Just take it off the stand.

49:18.800 --> 49:21.040
Oh, okay.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.120
And I go and do that.

49:22.120 --> 49:26.120
I just, I guess, pluck it up and put it down on the ground.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.200
Is that it, John?

49:28.200 --> 49:30.120
You don't see a door?

49:30.120 --> 49:31.880
Nope, the TV's on the ground now.

49:31.920 --> 49:32.760
What do we do?

49:32.760 --> 49:34.640
God damn it, ow.

49:35.880 --> 49:39.720
Okay, I don't know, really try poking around in there.

49:39.720 --> 49:42.480
Is it just a flat top where this TV's staying?

49:42.480 --> 49:44.600
I just kinda start smacking on it.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.200
When you start smacking on it,

49:46.200 --> 49:48.880
it kinda like wobbles a little bit.

49:48.880 --> 49:52.320
Two corners stay put and the other two corners kinda wobble.

49:52.320 --> 49:54.800
Oh, I got something here, it's moving.

49:54.800 --> 49:58.080
And you can remove the entire flat wood piece

49:58.080 --> 49:59.880
from underneath the television.

49:59.880 --> 50:00.700
I do so.

50:00.700 --> 50:04.540
And underneath, there's the door of a safe

50:04.540 --> 50:08.820
that has an alphanumerical keypad.

50:08.820 --> 50:12.020
I think maybe the Wheel of Fortune letters

50:12.020 --> 50:13.980
or maybe your name or some other bullshit

50:13.980 --> 50:15.620
that meant something to your parents, I don't know.

50:15.620 --> 50:19.980
Clark is gonna remember that his mother always told him

50:21.060 --> 50:24.460
that I was born with the best letters.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.940
Clark always remembers.

50:30.700 --> 50:31.540
Yeah.

50:35.660 --> 50:37.140
It's only three in the morning.

50:37.140 --> 50:39.180
It's shocking you can't remember this.

50:39.180 --> 50:44.180
Yeah, he's gonna put in R-S-T-L-N-E.

50:46.140 --> 50:48.380
And the door unlocks.

50:48.380 --> 50:49.220
Yeah.

50:50.500 --> 50:54.900
And when it opens, you see a book inside

50:54.900 --> 50:58.060
that is made out of uncured leather

50:58.060 --> 51:00.540
and it's got like hair on it.

51:01.260 --> 51:02.660
Some pimples, maybe a rash.

51:02.660 --> 51:05.020
There's stretch marks on the spine.

51:05.020 --> 51:06.300
I found my book, Jon.

51:06.300 --> 51:07.860
I grab it and hold it up.

51:09.420 --> 51:10.900
And as soon as you grab it.

51:10.900 --> 51:13.060
Yeah, I was worried about that.

51:15.020 --> 51:16.620
All right, you guys can stop recording.

51:16.620 --> 51:20.080
Oh, you son of a bitch.

51:21.300 --> 51:23.700
Do I really stop recording right there?

51:23.700 --> 51:24.540
No.

51:24.540 --> 51:25.540
Oh shit, okay.

51:25.540 --> 51:28.780
Your eyes go blank and suddenly you're standing

51:28.780 --> 51:31.700
in the abandoned water park, Splashylvania.

51:31.700 --> 51:33.900
You're looking up at the two-fanged plunge.

51:33.900 --> 51:35.740
Julie Maxwell fires a bullet

51:35.740 --> 51:38.420
that tears through the body of Leo Piston.

51:38.420 --> 51:41.780
You raise your firearm and immediately put lead

51:41.780 --> 51:44.740
in the crazed Julie Maxwell's forehead.

51:44.740 --> 51:48.820
The two bodies begin slumping down the twin slides,

51:48.820 --> 51:51.180
leaving a trail of blood behind.

51:51.180 --> 51:52.060
You blink.

51:52.060 --> 51:55.500
You're standing in the suburbs in the middle of the street

51:55.500 --> 51:57.380
in front of Dr. Marie Jacobs' house.

51:57.380 --> 52:00.700
You see James the mill worker floating off the ground,

52:00.700 --> 52:04.180
Aiden and Alice Little are bravely holding a vacuum

52:04.180 --> 52:06.160
to this hovering man's feet.

52:06.160 --> 52:10.620
But from out of the vacuum bag erupts an oily black ooze

52:10.620 --> 52:14.180
that immediately encompasses the twin children.

52:14.180 --> 52:17.900
And you can see them fighting violently

52:17.900 --> 52:20.820
inside the muck that envelops them.

52:20.820 --> 52:22.900
When you look over at Jon,

52:22.900 --> 52:26.580
you see the same viscous sludge is dripping

52:26.620 --> 52:28.940
from every hole in his face.

52:28.940 --> 52:29.860
You blink.

52:29.860 --> 52:32.300
You're staring at a gaunt young boy.

52:32.300 --> 52:34.220
The two of you are hanging in a cage

52:34.220 --> 52:37.100
above a deprived and debaucherous crowd.

52:37.100 --> 52:39.780
The cage is shocking you, burning your skin

52:39.780 --> 52:44.660
as the ceiling of this juice box lowers slowly.

52:44.660 --> 52:46.660
You don't wanna do it.

52:46.660 --> 52:48.220
You don't wanna push him back in,

52:48.220 --> 52:51.780
but either one of you dies or you both die.

52:51.780 --> 52:55.220
You push the boy's body back into the plexiglass room

52:55.220 --> 52:58.220
just in time for the roof to come down,

52:58.220 --> 53:02.500
squeezing the boy pulp onto the ravenous audience below.

53:02.500 --> 53:03.820
You blink.

53:03.820 --> 53:06.660
You're all over the CSU campus.

53:06.660 --> 53:08.740
This one's a rapid fire montage,

53:08.740 --> 53:10.540
murder after murder after murder,

53:10.540 --> 53:12.300
finishing off with your own,

53:12.300 --> 53:16.060
your own yourself ending screwdriver plunge.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.240
You blink.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.900
You're standing outside of Bean's pond,

53:19.900 --> 53:22.300
an ankle deep muddy overflow,

53:22.300 --> 53:24.500
and you know what you are capable of.

53:24.500 --> 53:27.940
You know what you are and you scream

53:27.940 --> 53:31.060
as you jump and bury the knife in your hands

53:31.060 --> 53:34.020
down through the skull of Anne Love,

53:34.020 --> 53:36.580
the woman who murdered your parents.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.020
You blink.

53:38.020 --> 53:43.020
You're back standing in your parents' living room.

53:43.380 --> 53:47.700
You look down and your hands are covered in blood

53:47.700 --> 53:50.180
and the blood begins moving,

53:50.180 --> 53:53.940
collecting between the covers of this book

53:54.220 --> 53:56.300
made from human skin,

53:56.300 --> 53:59.540
and the blood begins forming pages,

53:59.540 --> 54:04.100
each page a result of your actions.

54:04.100 --> 54:05.860
Roll Sanity.

54:05.860 --> 54:08.500
It's going to be a one slash one D six plus one.

54:10.300 --> 54:11.580
Don't pass.

54:11.580 --> 54:12.760
31 on a two.

54:16.400 --> 54:17.340
Roll a D six.

54:19.300 --> 54:20.920
Real quick, Joe,

54:20.920 --> 54:23.580
did you hear how Zach just like rattled off

54:24.100 --> 54:25.540
all the Bishop murders?

54:25.540 --> 54:28.120
Total like basic true crime bitch.

54:31.180 --> 54:32.020
I forgot I forgot.

54:32.020 --> 54:34.620
I forgot to tell Thomas to take his headphones off.

54:36.080 --> 54:36.920
Yeah, it was like,

54:36.920 --> 54:38.380
it seems like I shouldn't be hearing this,

54:38.380 --> 54:39.860
but I'm glad I did.

54:41.700 --> 54:44.140
It was a trip down memory lane.

54:44.140 --> 54:45.060
I rolled a one.

54:45.060 --> 54:48.260
I swear it's a oneer.

54:48.260 --> 54:51.780
So I cling, isn't there like a thing though?

54:51.780 --> 54:53.020
Isn't it if you were at one,

54:53.500 --> 54:54.340
it's still not good.

54:54.340 --> 54:56.300
Well, no, it's just that the San loss for that

54:56.300 --> 54:57.780
was a D six plus one.

55:00.620 --> 55:01.460
Okay.

55:01.460 --> 55:04.260
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

55:04.260 --> 55:05.840
Yeah, so Clark is a,

55:05.840 --> 55:07.220
Clark is,

55:07.220 --> 55:10.060
he's not there.

55:10.060 --> 55:11.240
His sanity is gone.

55:11.240 --> 55:14.020
One of the pages flits open

55:14.020 --> 55:16.540
and these pages that have been created

55:16.540 --> 55:21.540
by the blood rushing from your hands form letters.

55:22.100 --> 55:25.820
And you see these two words just repeated

55:25.820 --> 55:28.140
over and over and over.

55:28.140 --> 55:32.900
And in the middle is this picture of this hooded figure

55:32.900 --> 55:37.580
with this light that is just beaming from its face.

55:37.580 --> 55:39.300
However, in this one,

55:39.300 --> 55:43.580
you can very clearly see your own face,

55:43.580 --> 55:46.720
the face of a young Clark Bishop,

55:46.720 --> 55:50.940
and you feel compelled to begin chanting,

55:50.940 --> 55:54.540
knuckles almond, knuckles almond, knuckles almond,

55:54.540 --> 55:56.740
knuckles almond, knuckles almond.

55:56.740 --> 56:00.020
John Lee Pettymore, you see a flash of light

56:00.020 --> 56:02.340
and Clark Bishop is no longer standing

56:02.340 --> 56:04.300
in front of his entertainment center

56:04.300 --> 56:07.300
in his living room of his parents' home.

56:07.300 --> 56:08.700
Holy shit.

56:17.700 --> 56:18.540
Hey Thomas.

56:18.540 --> 56:19.540
Hey Zach.

56:19.540 --> 56:21.260
What does John Lee Pettymore want to do?

56:21.260 --> 56:22.340
What does he see?

56:23.740 --> 56:24.880
Clark is just gone?

56:24.880 --> 56:25.720
Yep.

56:25.720 --> 56:26.680
Is the book gone too?

56:26.680 --> 56:27.520
Yep.

56:27.520 --> 56:28.520
Does the TV turn on?

56:28.520 --> 56:29.360
Yep.

56:29.360 --> 56:32.220
John presses play on the VCR,

56:32.220 --> 56:34.540
lies down on the couch,

56:34.540 --> 56:38.480
and lets himself watch Wheel of Fortune for 20 minutes.

56:38.480 --> 56:43.480
Clark, you're standing in a dark alleyway.

56:51.040 --> 56:52.600
Yeah, yeah.

56:52.600 --> 56:54.840
And walking toward you.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.720
Is it Jim Cook?

56:56.720 --> 56:58.340
It's Jim Cook.

56:58.340 --> 57:00.060
Do I have any agency over this?

57:01.840 --> 57:03.080
Do you want agency?

57:03.080 --> 57:05.300
I mean, I know what happens.

57:05.300 --> 57:06.580
Clark remembers.

57:06.580 --> 57:09.460
And immediately, in the shadows,

57:09.460 --> 57:11.260
you just pounce on him,

57:11.260 --> 57:13.420
throw him to the ground.

57:13.420 --> 57:17.340
And with both of your hands wrapped around his neck,

57:17.340 --> 57:19.940
he begins struggling.

57:19.940 --> 57:21.240
They didn't have to die.

57:21.240 --> 57:22.820
They didn't have to die.

57:22.820 --> 57:23.820
You couldn't find it.

57:23.820 --> 57:24.940
They didn't have to die.

57:24.940 --> 57:29.940
In your grasp, in the grip of both of your hands,

57:30.220 --> 57:33.940
wrapped around Jim Cook's throat,

57:33.940 --> 57:36.160
you feel his life extinguish.

57:37.420 --> 57:38.260
Holy shit.

57:40.260 --> 57:41.100
Oh no.

57:44.300 --> 57:45.140
Oh my God.

58:06.580 --> 58:11.580
What's up, what's up everybody?

58:15.140 --> 58:17.380
It's Zach, I'm Zach.

58:17.380 --> 58:19.180
I'm just gonna slide in here real quick

58:19.180 --> 58:22.940
at the end of this episode to drop some pretty big news.

58:22.940 --> 58:27.940
So Taylor and I are moving to South Korea on Thursday.

58:28.480 --> 58:31.420
It's been our dream for years to teach English in Korea.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.600
We're so absolutely stoked.

58:33.600 --> 58:37.720
This long time plan is finally coming to fruition.

58:37.720 --> 58:40.640
I know, I know you're super excited for us

58:40.640 --> 58:43.880
and not at all wondering what is happening with the show.

58:43.880 --> 58:46.660
Well, that's just super supportive of you.

58:46.660 --> 58:48.740
Thank you so much.

58:48.740 --> 58:52.240
But if you are wondering, I have some answers for you.

58:52.240 --> 58:56.320
So first off, we've already recorded the next full arc

58:56.320 --> 58:57.320
of season one,

58:57.320 --> 59:01.120
and we've started recording the final arc that follows.

59:01.120 --> 59:04.240
This campaign has enveloped my life

59:04.240 --> 59:07.160
like a squamous viscous ooze,

59:07.160 --> 59:10.560
and I'm not going to compromise its quality

59:10.560 --> 59:13.560
just because I'm moving halfway around the world.

59:13.560 --> 59:16.080
We've had a fair amount of practice recording over Zoom

59:16.080 --> 59:17.980
at this point, so I'm not worried about anything

59:17.980 --> 59:21.280
except that I'll have to wake up early to record now.

59:21.280 --> 59:26.080
All MPC voices will soon become much deeper.

59:26.080 --> 59:28.900
Next week, we'll be releasing a bonus episode

59:28.900 --> 59:32.420
from our Patreon vault to try to coax some of you

59:32.420 --> 59:36.220
into giving us money during a full-blown economic crisis

59:36.220 --> 59:38.640
because we're fucking ruthless.

59:38.640 --> 59:42.820
And the Friday after that, on August 14th,

59:42.820 --> 59:45.940
the penultimate arc of season one

59:45.940 --> 59:48.860
of pretending to be people begins.

59:48.860 --> 59:52.740
I'm so gosh darn jazzed for y'all to hear it,

59:52.740 --> 59:56.040
and I'm so pumped to play through the end of this campaign.

59:56.040 --> 59:57.680
Ha!

59:57.680 --> 59:59.480
Last thing, fear not.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.240
The end of season one will not be the end

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.960
of pretending to be people.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.960
I have delicious, insidious plans for the future.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:13.280
Seriously, thank you all so much for listening.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.180
We have such a blast making this show,

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.680
and we're so stoked y'all enjoy it.
