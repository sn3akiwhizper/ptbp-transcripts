0.00 285.78 speaker0  Did y'all know that real human people eat mushrooms? Those weird little fuckers that grow out of the poop or something. Damn, and y'all thought I was nasty. And here you are just eating dirt fungus like it's going out of style. I'll take a pot of day old warm cream any day over mud fucking mushrooms. Speaking of fucking, y'all are listening to the radio show that fucks the most. 694.2 PTBP. And I am your most fuckingest host, Wolf the Dog. I'm excited to announce a new project for our citizens of contention. We want to write a Delta Green scenario as a community. Over the next few months, we'll be having prompted writing contests to find the best meaty chunks y'all can muster. We'll use each round's winner to inform the next prompt until we have enough juicy morsels to make ourselves a narrative feast. To get in on this tub of greasy love, head on down to reddit.com r slash pretending to be people. Show us what you've got and vote for your favorites to help us choose the winners. Is 89 episodes a long time? Are we friends now? Would a friend throw a wolf a fucking bone and slap those follow buttons on Twitter and the Instagrams? Would a friend take it a step further and spend a minute typing up a five-star review on Apple podcasts? If you do, I might read it on air like I'm about to read this review from Hello Under Dash Cerise entitled Best Wolf Ever. They right. Listen, y'all. This here actual play role-playing podcast is really creative and might just spoil you for any others. If you don't know what Delta Green is, you're in for a treat. Imagine X-Files meets Lovecraft meets Night Vale, except the agents are pretty terrible at their jobs. But actually, really, the best part is Wolf the dog as the intro DJ. In the very many large, numerous amounts of new music tracks he plays every week. Hell yeah, baby. Finally, some recognition for all the damn hard work I do, especially when it comes to seeking new music out. I don't know what all those things you listed are, but I assume that they meant that you think that this weird podcast is good? I wouldn't fucking know. Never listened to a second of it personally. This was one of 234 tasty reviews. And when we hit 311 on Apple Podcasts, I'll tell you what. Every person who has typed up a sweet treat of a review will be entered in a drawing to win a pretended to be people t-shirt. That's right, folks. The merch is real. It's just that you have to win a drawing to get your mitts on these shits. Until my producer figures out how the fuck the internet works, same, honestly, then it'll be for sale. And remember, most of those 234 reviews weren't written. They just hit the fifth star, which still makes Wolfie smile. But you must write a review to be entered into the contest. Also, that makes each of your chances of winning one of these sick teas that much greater. So get in on it while the getting's good. Today, I found him sitting at a little desk with a microphone and sunglasses on. It looked like he had some kind of broadcasting kit. What the fuck? Where the fuck did he get sunglasses from? Time for the most stable part of this here reality. It is the news. Last time, John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth let slip to Anne Love that he is not, in fact, her former partner from K-Cell, but rather he is, in fact, one of the vectors K-Cell was tasked with destroying. Anne then put an impossibly clean blade into John's head and with a chant continued to move it deeper into this cranium down into his throat before eventually ending his life.
283.86 295.42 speaker1  of Bean's pond. Clark did what he could, but it just seems like this Anne Love is one resilient fucker.
294.06 338.94 speaker0  Will she stop? Nobody knows. There's only one thing I do know and that's that I put my trust in kudzu with no backbone.
335.70 393.10 speaker1  Thomas, you might find this interesting. Clark, he, oh, no, your name is Joe. if Anne finds out that John is ball she will make an excuse to walk away to chant over her blade, make them roll alertness to hear that before attacking John. you know what, he's probably just gonna fucking tell her. you guys are like, hey, can we have a minute?
392.26 416.46 speaker2  We gotta talk. Take all the time you need. that Kevin did tell her about ball. That popped out of nowhere.
414.58 442.46 speaker1  That's because I completely forgot Too many secrets and lies, man. Oh, actually that's what, season two, no secrets, no lies.
440.82 448.02 speaker2  We'll still fuck it up, don't worry. Yeah.
445.98 454.50 speaker1  I mean, if you guys were just truthful with everyone right off the bat, you wouldn't have to keep track
451.86 476.84 speaker2  It's more or less what I was attempting there.
472.84 486.24 speaker1  were sent to contention to take care of, I'm one of them. Let's see, the note in the green box said they got nine of 12, so I guess that's 10 of 12 now.
484.32 502.88 speaker2  What the fuck, what the fuck?
498.48 506.24 speaker1  And that's just in release time, not when we actually played.
502.88 538.04 speaker2  It's funny, here, this is a page from back was this bottom quarter of a page and then two sentences
533.76 544.60 speaker1  all motivation to keep track of the events of this game.
541.76 559.24 speaker2  like four notes on a page and then went to the next page for the next session.
557.48 589.52 speaker1  Oh, nope, oh my god. Oh yes, that is righteous. That was my god phase. My notes for last episode have a ton of stuff. We didn't do any of it, except for that one, the chant over her blade before attacking Jon.
585.64 611.32 speaker2  for what was found in the storage lockers. And I wrote like bricks of cocaine, a burlap sack, lots of cash, and then it just says lots of great shit. I don't describe those notes.
608.28 621.00 speaker1  If you would ask me if there were three notes on a table in that fucking green box, I'd be like, no, there weren't just three notes sitting on a table that we didn't like. Do you want me to tell you what they were?
619.64 635.40 speaker2  I wrote three notes on a table, including newspaper clipping about Cole's orphanage, which has recently been brought up, which is kind of cool that I just read that. Well, it keeps getting, yeah, I mean,
632.20 690.08 speaker1  because everybody's fucking talking about it. Let's see, one is a note that says the cabin is in the woods, stark west from the end of the trail, about 2.5 miles, signed K. as well as the leader. didn't think they were talking about ball babies. Yeah, there's another one that says the work is difficult in particular, but I've had 12 successes. Life isn't as complex as they believe. They are quite simple. for Kohl's Orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.
688.40 698.16 speaker2  and they did tell us about it a little bit.
695.44 730.82 speaker1  that John Lee Pettymore came from. It also was, I believe you asked Drew to look up information on it and he couldn't find any information. Right. However, Randy Angst, the first time you talked to him, had a distinct memory of an orphanage existing under that name. And then did we learn, we learned more about it in the woods arc, right? Certainly out of character. That was a big part of the Ken Krenkelhoff story.
727.80 737.12 speaker2  Ken might be chilling in a door somewhere, even to this day.
736.28 740.44 speaker1  of the cabin was set on fire. Oh, that's right. Yup, nevermind. Poor door boy.
739.60 747.20 speaker2  Poor door boy.
744.88 774.54 speaker1  Krenkelhoff door boy. Yeah, let's hit it. John Lee Pettymore the first body is like, oh, okay, that seems about right. Sorry. I'm on Do Not Disturb right now. So I'll have to look at my phone to see if he's actually calling me. No, he's calling Luke. Luke didn't pick up because he's too busy playing.
773.44 788.80 speaker2  Oh no, I don't. It should be ringable. Off mic.
786.72 863.20 speaker1  They could just turn off their microphones, but they've decided to take their headphones off and walk away from their cameras. Thomas is so fucking loud, it's crazy. He just asked Joe. He just told Joe that he has 15 luck and that he can spend 10 to have a vision. And he asked Joe what would be the most prudent information to learn. Now they're back. Oh. I was narrating the phone call for our listeners because you left your microphones on. And Thomas is really loud, so I could hear his side of the conversation. Well, now I'm actually gonna leave the room for a second so you guys can just talk to each other on mic if you wanna do that. Nice try.
860.80 875.00 speaker2  He made a big show of pulling out his earphones, but we know he's been on speaker this whole time.
872.52 908.88 speaker1  Did you guys have a good conversation? That would actually be really funny. I like listening to the conversations you guys have when I've left, because typically in the middle of the episode, you forget that I'm gonna listen back to him. So when you guys just keep talking about how much you love me and appreciate that I'm doing this, it's like, joke's on you. We're just trying to get you to treat our characters well.
908.04 917.08 speaker2  We know you're listening. Well, speaking of which. We're just trying to earn a favor.
914.04 962.44 speaker1  is in a fucking waterbed grave, and Clark is standing behind it, and you can see the hilt of this blade And right ahead of that is Anne Love, whose wry smile is just sitting as it always seems to be underneath a single eye. when her hair gets tousled about. Like, she has two eyes. We're not worried about that, but. You're being really suspicious.
959.60 968.76 speaker2  We're not worried about that.
966.24 1003.84 speaker1  She's a cyclops. How many eyes do spiders have? Luke, look that up. All right, so. He's having his own fun. Yeah, but I miss him.
1002.80 1012.88 speaker2  Oh, me too.
1011.52 1015.48 speaker1  Are you dating him? Are you dating Luke?
1014.00 1017.92 speaker2  Are you dating Luke, dude?
1017.08 1030.00 speaker1  Are you dating? That's not our joke. Oh, fuck, I always forget that that's like All right, so.
1028.88 1054.76 speaker2  Okay, nice deflection. would tear the podcast apart. and eventually somebody's not gonna be able to keep it in their pants.
1053.44 1077.32 speaker1  Luke, I expected. if she takes Luke's spot and plays Keith Vigna the rest of the time. Okay, cool. I don't know, a chick? You don't know any?
1076.28 1092.36 speaker2  Oh, okay, cool. What, that's crazy. Thomas, you can spend 10 luck to get a vision? That's nuts.
1088.36 1106.48 speaker1  Well, I have 15 because I spent 10 of my 25 And I'm still hanging on with one hit point here. You see one weak finger rise up from the pavement
1104.64 1122.32 speaker2  from a shattered body. It's all he can muster, but you see life in John Lee Pettymore as he urges you to wait a minute as he has this vision.
1120.44 1298.80 speaker1  Joe, take off your headphones, I suppose, unless you already know what the question he's gonna ask is. Your entire face is underwater and typically your eyes would roll back into your head during one of these, but as you lift a finger and begin finding yourself in ball, you seem to have the ability to reach out into the collective unconsciousness of the entire universe to pick out certain memories that exist from people throughout different times. And you see Gary Daley ushering Eunice and Jerry Bishop into the back of the Daley Fuh, The book is covered in uncured leather with some hairs, maybe some acne. There's some stretch marks on the binding of this book and he hands it to him and then reality begins to kind of fade up and blink and turn like you're turning channels on a television. And then you're inside the bishop home. And you see Eunice and Jerry, they're talking about this book that they have just sitting on their kitchen table and they're sitting on either side discussing options, seemingly. And a young Clark Bishop walks into the room and sits him in front of the TV where Wheel of Fortune is on. Memories kind of fade, reality blinks out again, They move the television out of the way and there's a false bottom of this entertainment center and there's a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry. And you're just watching them open it up. You asked where the book is, not how to get it. I could use some human touch. You're Luke's. but the camera is just on their faces as they're typing it in.
1296.44 1312.76 speaker2  to know how this is gonna go with Luke. So you just need to end it now to keep things professional. Otherwise we're gonna tear this whole organization apart
1309.28 1365.36 speaker1  This thing was doomed the second you put two feisty, hot 20 somethings in it like me and Luke, baby. in the false bottom of this entertainment center and they close the door and click lock and you see them look at each other and they embrace. And then you're back under this muddy, murky water right outside of Bean's Pond.
1364.20 1372.04 speaker0  Hello.
1369.32 1379.40 speaker1  waiting for John to be done with his vision.
1376.72 1386.32 speaker2  and he starts to writhe in the water and
1383.56 1392.96 speaker1  And Anne is looking down at him with massive eyes, just so confused.
1392.00 1405.60 speaker0  John, John.
1403.88 1421.40 speaker1  That's a nice try. 10. How?
1419.40 1452.64 speaker2  I've seen him see things before. And well, I saw a whole little saga of the book, but Well, it is at Clark's parents' house, but you'll never find it without me. to help us get through that door.
1450.12 1455.48 speaker1  and I'm gonna walk behind you with two guns. No. One on each of you.
1454.00 1465.40 speaker2  No, no, no, no, no.
1463.12 1509.32 speaker1  You're the one who's trading the book for your life essentially right now. I'm the one with a gun pointed at your head. you've kind of turned over. You're on your back now. You've got a massive knife going all the way down through your skull, touching your uvula, and she has a gun pointed at you. And you reach for your gun? Okay, no guns. We all leave them here. Wow, what if we just all had guns? This is gonna end in a bloodbath if you don't... Can we not?
1507.60 1521.80 speaker2  and you know, you've got your magic, but I'd rather have my gun. You know, a lot of people are trying to find us.
1520.24 1537.00 speaker1  Okay. It's cool that you can talk normally though. All right, so everyone has their guns and we'll just all be good because we both need each other to get this done, hopefully by the end of the episode.
1535.16 1541.80 speaker2  Can you get your knife out of my head?
1539.40 1545.00 speaker1  For bleeding's sake,
1541.80 1550.72 speaker2  I mean, I'd rather have my knife back, you know,
1548.40 1562.24 speaker1  and I now need you, unfortunately. You're magic, but something tells me No, I could do that.
1560.44 1575.60 speaker2  and then you could maybe have your knife back? It's really hard. This is a very big knife and it's hard to hold my head up with it.
1572.68 1633.24 speaker1  There's just enough of the knife sticking out. There's just enough of the blade sticking out at the top and she begins cutting right in between two of her fingers, just enough to get blood to start coming out. she pulls the knife all the way up out of your head. And with a chant, the blood that comes out of her hand forms like a jackhammer tube of coagulation straight down into your throat and you can taste Anne loves blood.
1631.00 1657.56 speaker2  What's your power there? My power? Oh, fuck me, dude. It's a 60. So I rolled over my power. We were all gonna be... This may work in our advantage.
1653.08 1659.96 speaker1  Fucking maybe, but this episode was gonna be fine.
1658.64 1666.44 speaker2  It was about to happen.
1665.32 1680.24 speaker1  For blood magic. One. That puts a column of blood through the entire head. I'm at 15.
1679.36 1683.52 speaker2  All right. That means you break, right?
1681.56 1689.44 speaker1  That means it's time for a new mania. What a time for it. What a time for it.
1687.64 1697.28 speaker2  What a time to be a fan of this podcast.
1695.80 1715.12 speaker1  We were so close.
1713.72 1720.04 speaker2  It's still time to roll, baby.
1718.40 1756.52 speaker1  Oh boy. D100, three times. 94? 94 is theomania. God damn it. The belief that he or she is a god. Hey, you get a second chance. an uncontrollable compulsion to make loud or shrill noises.
1755.68 1762.64 speaker2  We don't need to roll. I'll take that one.
1760.64 1771.96 speaker1  And the last one.
1769.52 1794.64 speaker2  Is that nudity? Yes, it is indeed. because I was so fucking bad at it before, but I also don't wanna be taking my clothes off all the time. Ha ha ha ha ha.
1792.72 1800.04 speaker1  here at this stage.
1797.24 1843.60 speaker2  I know that right now would be a really good time for Clark to think that he's a god because we are in overseer territory. I just worry that it's hard for me to play it sometimes because how does a god decide, how does a god go somewhere else when people wanna go somewhere else? You know what I mean? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, I'm gonna do it. I once again believe that I am a god.
1841.36 1888.28 speaker1  Also, remember that each one of these manias, it strips away Clark Bishop's being. Clark is no longer who he was when he started. He's been taken over, especially with this one. So much of Clark's self was dictated by his almost nonchalance. Spread it around, slap it on the table. Bring it out betwixt the robes opening. so whatever.
1886.44 1904.16 speaker2  I pick both, I pick both, I pick both.
1902.52 1910.04 speaker1  Oh, you get a D6. Five. Fuck yeah.
1908.20 1944.28 speaker2  So the thing that sent me over the edge was seeing her cut her finger with the blade in his head. So I'm gonna lash out at her and try and, I want to wrestle the knife away from her. Like rushing her now.
1939.84 1959.68 speaker1  She pulls the large knife up out of John Lee Pettymore's head as she finishes this incantation. And before she knows it, you're just on her. And you grab the knife out of her hand, screaming about blood magic. And she just jumps back and she's like,
1958.32 1962.24 speaker3  It's literally healing.
1960.72 1967.80 speaker1  It's healing him. What the fuck is your problem? It's not, it's not, it's not right.
1966.76 1987.44 speaker2  should be able to do. Too fucking bad. Clark, I will say that personally at this moment, I have no objections. Are you all right? Are you you?
1986.48 1995.80 speaker1  I feel better, Clark.
1993.36 2007.00 speaker2  This is, this is, this is, this isn't the way it's supposed to be. This isn't the way it's supposed to happen. Clark, man. None of this is the way it was supposed to happen.
2005.68 2033.52 speaker1  the way it was supposed to happen. Now we talked about guns, but I really, I would appreciate the knife back, but you seem to have a whole look in your eyes So just by the time we get to your parents' house, can we call it that still? Then I would like to have that knife back if that's possible.
2032.56 2034.52 speaker2  That was freaky shit.
2033.52 2036.48 speaker1  Does Clark have a gun?
2035.64 2040.12 speaker2  Can I fish another water?
2038.16 2048.28 speaker1  Yeah, and as you pick it up out of the water, it's water-locked, so you're just kinda like.
2045.52 2050.28 speaker2  and you're gonna drop your gun here in the pond with ours.
2048.28 2056.76 speaker1  Oh, so we are going no guns? I thought we were going all guns. I've, your mouth is kinda like a gun.
2055.92 2081.40 speaker2  What? She says spells and stuff to make people get hurt. All right. She's kinda got a built-in gun. I need, I need strong pills. Do you have any of those at your house, Clark? but I could just top you up right now, right here. Here, just come here, just come here.
2079.76 2089.92 speaker1  What?
2088.04 2129.40 speaker2  and I try to heal him. John Lee Pettymore starts praying. Through crest, all things are possible. Is there a roll that I could make to- Go ahead and roll unnatural. It's a 31 on a 49.
2128.56 2144.84 speaker1  Joe? Yeah. Some words pop into your mind and you know that if you can spill some blood and say these words, that you can make it happen.
2142.84 2169.72 speaker2  I've got the knife in my hand still. So I take a page out of the book that I just saw and love demonstrate for me. And I do a little cut on the side of my thumb. So it's kind of dripping a little bit. And I say, damn all to year it. Damn all to year it.
2165.80 2205.40 speaker1  the blood just like flows out of your thumb and goes up into the nostrils and the mouth of John Lee Pettymore. And you see the ooze pouring from his eyes and his ears and his mouth and the blood flowing on top of the ooze into all of his orifices. Go ahead and roll a D six.
2202.96 2214.84 speaker2  And I just want to say you started this by losing your goddamn mind over and love cutting yourself on that knife to heal me.
2213.96 2237.80 speaker1  to do that yourself. So I'm really proud of you, man. due to your change of pace and mindset and your shocking ability to be able to do this yourself.
2236.44 2291.00 speaker2  That's a fail. Fuck me, dude. It's a 79. It's over my power. Fuck, and I rolled a four. Fuck me, dude. Oh my God. Oh, okay. Upon seeing that it fucking worked, Clark's mind like starts to fracture and he pulls the knife away and yells, it worked. It's what I was always meant to be. We don't need you anymore, Anne. We don't need you anymore. And I go right after her with the knife.
2290.16 2298.80 speaker3  Yes!
2297.72 2301.12 speaker1  How much luck do you have?
2299.64 2309.28 speaker2  Do you need to know an exact number?
2305.64 2318.32 speaker1  if you wanted to literally spend all of your luck points to determine the outcome of this fight.
2317.16 2320.76 speaker2  You could also do that.
2318.36 2324.52 speaker1  Don't let him, don't let him.
2322.68 2326.44 speaker2  And he's like, hey, Joe, give me all your luck.
2325.60 2327.28 speaker1  I'm just saying.
2326.44 2337.48 speaker2  There's a lot of things you can do
2335.20 2346.48 speaker1  you could just spend all of your luck and decide exactly how you finish off and love in this moment.
2345.64 2388.04 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah. And I do want to, I do kind of want to finish her off. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to try and finish her off. I'm going to spend my hefty bank of 65 luck. Clark rushes her with unnatural strength. In a flash is on her and he just wants to shove, he wants to do to her what she did to John. He wants to bring the knife down through her head.
2384.60 2491.66 speaker1  Clark rushes her with eyes akimbo, knowing what he has always been and was always meant to be and jumps up in the air with a dagger in both hands and comes down on top of Anne Love's head, whose eyes are so wide because she's never seen anyone pick up any sort of unnatural ability A at all, B that quickly or C without any sort of training whatsoever. And you come down and pierce the top of her skull. And as you shove the knife into the top of her head, you see one of her eyes directly starts looking into your eyes and the other one just fills completely with blood and the blood begins pouring down her face. And the knife still in her skull, she just falls back into the overfilled beans pond. And begins floating out into the middle of the mushroom shaped pond.
2488.56 2505.92 speaker2  I'm not gonna tell you in case you decide to and love me.
2501.76 2526.32 speaker1  trudge north through the town of contention, heading up through the warehouse district, pass subtropolous and all of downtown on the west side of A plus storage where you found the storage units G10, G11, and G12 Lots of cool shit. Awesome things.
2525.00 2531.36 speaker2  Lots of cool shit.
2529.10 2540.76 speaker1  Past Julie Maxwell's apartment building.
2536.40 2575.36 speaker2  that had this like billboard on I-44 and it had like a picture of an electric guitar and like a motorcycle and like a baseball bat and in really big letters, it said cool stuff. And in really small letters, it said trucks bring it. So it just looked like a dope billboard for cool stuff. I remember that billboard. I totally remember it.
2572.12 2579.04 speaker1  for like a sports team called the trucks.
2577.04 2588.92 speaker2  Trucks bring it. Oh, the trucks is such a good name for an American sports team.
2585.76 2670.40 speaker1  Oh my God, your mascot could be like a dude inside a blow up semi. It could literally just be a dude fucking That's how fields work, right? Yeah, for sure, fake field. When it rains, they pull out the fake field I was 17 years old and I was playing Ultimate Frisbee at the park that's across the street from our double A stadium here in Springfield where the Springfield Cardinals play. And it was raining and a few of us thought to ourselves, there's a game tonight, isn't there? So the tarps probably on the field. And so we ran and we jumped the fence and we ran down the third base side and we hopped onto the field. And I slip and slid from third base over the mound towards first. And then took off running and security yards chased me for like a block, but I was more agile back when I was 17. And it's still one of my greatest memories.
2668.60 2673.72 speaker2  It's honestly very cool.
2671.80 2709.44 speaker1  Yeah, Zach, that's a lot cooler oh, that's so cool. you look up and see a billboard that has an electric guitar and a baseball bat. And what else was it?
2707.40 2716.08 speaker2  I remember the basketball and the electric guitar. I could see both of those pictured perfectly.
2714.80 2774.20 speaker1  trucks bring it. The trucks, the contention trucks. you hear screams coming from the East and you can echo locate well enough here in contention to know that these screams are coming from Does it sound like a lot of screams? It sounds like a lot of screens, tens of screens.
2772.52 2782.48 speaker2  It's not something we're just catching a whiff of on the air.
2779.96 2798.16 speaker1  you start hearing it and it's just. I don't want you to go there.
2797.32 2818.36 speaker2  Yeah. John, I think if we stay the course, the whole point of our mission here is that overseer will come back and I'll save everyone. I don't think there's anything that's going to help us by helping them now. If they just are released into a world full of this goo,
2817.52 2827.48 speaker1  Yeah. I mean, I'm still pretty knife brained buddy.
2824.68 2834.00 speaker2  and save a bunch of people at this church. All right.
2832.44 2849.76 speaker1  You didn't have pills. The one, okay.
2848.92 2851.44 speaker2  No, I healed you.
2850.60 2861.80 speaker3  I healed you. Good job, buddy. Thank you. Let's go get that book.
2860.36 2863.48 speaker2  Clark, your home.
2862.64 2901.48 speaker1  Well, as you're approaching, you do notice that the creek that runs kind of behind your house, dry, completely dry. as you left it yesterday. And it's almost unseemly because you're not the man you were who lived here.
2900.00 2992.32 speaker2  Is this where the book could be? There's no drugs here. Definitely not. Just take it off the stand. Oh, okay. And I go and do that. I just, I guess, pluck it up and put it down on the ground. Nope, the TV's on the ground now. What do we do? Is it just a flat top where this TV's staying? I just kinda start smacking on it. When you start smacking on it,
2988.88 3013.98 speaker1  Two corners stay put and the other two corners kinda wobble. from underneath the television. And underneath, there's the door of a safe that has an alphanumerical keypad.
3012.02 3031.54 speaker2  or maybe your name or some other bullshit that meant something to your parents, I don't know. Clark is gonna remember that his mother always told him that I was born with the best letters.
3030.70 3039.18 speaker3  Yeah.
3037.14 3048.38 speaker1  It's shocking you can't remember this.
3046.14 3058.06 speaker2  And the door unlocks. Yeah.
3054.90 3066.30 speaker1  that is made out of uncured leather and it's got like hair on it. Some pimples, maybe a rash.
3065.02 3088.78 speaker2  I found my book, Jon. I grab it and hold it up. And as soon as you grab it. No.
3085.54 3252.76 speaker1  Your eyes go blank and suddenly you're standing Julie Maxwell fires a bullet that tears through the body of Leo Piston. You raise your firearm and immediately put lead in the crazed Julie Maxwell's forehead. The two bodies begin slumping down the twin slides, leaving a trail of blood behind. You blink. You're standing in the suburbs in the middle of the street in front of Dr. Marie Jacobs' house. You see James the mill worker floating off the ground, Aiden and Alice Little are bravely holding a vacuum to this hovering man's feet. But from out of the vacuum bag erupts an oily black ooze that immediately encompasses the twin children. And you can see them fighting violently inside the muck that envelops them. When you look over at Jon, you see the same viscous sludge is dripping from every hole in his face. You blink. You're staring at a gaunt young boy. The two of you are hanging in a cage above a deprived and debaucherous crowd. The cage is shocking you, burning your skin as the ceiling of this juice box lowers slowly. You don't wanna do it. You don't wanna push him back in, but either one of you dies or you both die. You push the boy's body back into the plexiglass room just in time for the roof to come down, squeezing the boy pulp onto the ravenous audience below. You blink. You're all over the CSU campus. This one's a rapid fire montage, murder after murder after murder, finishing off with your own, your own yourself ending screwdriver plunge. You blink. You're standing outside of Bean's pond, an ankle deep muddy overflow, and you know what you are capable of. You know what you are and you scream as you jump and bury the knife in your hands down through the skull of Anne Love, the woman who murdered your parents. You blink. You're back standing in your parents' living room. You look down and your hands are covered in blood and the blood begins moving, collecting between the covers of this book made from human skin, and the blood begins forming pages, each page a result of your actions.
3251.58 3274.62 speaker2  31 on a two. all the Bishop murders?
3272.02 3278.38 speaker1  I forgot to tell Thomas to take his headphones off.
3276.92 3314.02 speaker2  it seems like I shouldn't be hearing this, but I'm glad I did. I rolled a one. So I cling, isn't there like a thing though? Isn't it if you were at one, it's still not good. Well, no, it's just that the San loss for that Okay. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Yeah, so Clark is a, Clark is, he's not there. His sanity is gone.
3311.24 3384.88 speaker1  One of the pages flits open and these pages that have been created by the blood rushing from your hands form letters. And you see these two words just repeated over and over and over. And in the middle is this picture of this hooded figure with this light that is just beaming from its face. However, in this one, you can very clearly see your own face, the face of a young Clark Bishop, and you feel compelled to begin chanting, and Clark Bishop is no longer standing in front of his entertainment center in his living room of his parents' home. What does John Lee Pettymore want to do?
3383.74 3414.84 speaker2  Clark is just gone? Yep. Is the book gone too? Yep. Does the TV turn on? Yep. and lets himself watch Wheel of Fortune for 20 minutes.
3412.60 3416.72 speaker1  And walking toward you.
3414.84 3429.46 speaker2  Is it Jim Cook? Do I have any agency over this? I mean, I know what happens. Clark remembers.
3426.58 3443.82 speaker1  And immediately, in the shadows, you just pounce on him, throw him to the ground. he begins struggling.
3442.82 3453.94 speaker3  You couldn't find it. They didn't have to die.
3450.22 3458.26 speaker1  wrapped around Jim Cook's throat, you feel his life extinguish.
3457.42 3491.58 speaker2  Holy shit.
3486.58 3497.38 speaker3  What's up, what's up everybody?
3495.14 3618.68 speaker1  It's Zach, I'm Zach. I'm just gonna slide in here real quick at the end of this episode to drop some pretty big news. So Taylor and I are moving to South Korea on Thursday. It's been our dream for years to teach English in Korea. We're so absolutely stoked. This long time plan is finally coming to fruition. I know, I know you're super excited for us and not at all wondering what is happening with the show. Well, that's just super supportive of you. Thank you so much. But if you are wondering, I have some answers for you. So first off, we've already recorded the next full arc of season one, This campaign has enveloped my life like a squamous viscous ooze, and I'm not going to compromise its quality just because I'm moving halfway around the world. We've had a fair amount of practice recording over Zoom at this point, so I'm not worried about anything except that I'll have to wake up early to record now. Next week, we'll be releasing a bonus episode from our Patreon vault to try to coax some of you into giving us money during a full-blown economic crisis because we're fucking ruthless. And the Friday after that, on August 14th, the penultimate arc of season one of pretending to be people begins. I'm so gosh darn jazzed for y'all to hear it, and I'm so pumped to play through the end of this campaign. Last thing, fear not. The end of season one will not be the end of pretending to be people. I have delicious, insidious plans for the future. Seriously, thank you all so much for listening. We have such a blast making this show, and we're so stoked y'all enjoy it.
