0.00 160.00 speaker0  This is weird. Can y'all hear me? Because all I'm doin' right now is thinkin' real hard towards y'all soft gooey brains. Ha ha ha ha. My powers are weird and ever-changin'. I am telepathin' live from 694.2 PTBP straight into your mind cavity. It's your Espa that's the besta. Wolf the dog. I wanna give a resoundin' awwwwwwwwwww to all of you who donated to the bail project. Y'all raised $6,654. And I got one final winner to announce. The fifth person to receive an official PTBP t-shirt is Roxy from Hamburg, Germany.
151.00 192.00 speaker1  And with that, these boys erased the final two pieces in the Little family puzzle from this plane of existence. The veil was lifted. Bishop, Pettymore, and Vigna saw the truth of their situation.
185.00 318.00 speaker0  And I have been given the green light to drop this brand new track on y'all's here in contention. Get ready to add this smash of a banger to your apocalypse playlist. It's kudzu with no backbone. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Pretending to be People. My name is Zach, and I am your handler, or your gum, as some might say. This is the 85th episode. We've done the same intro every time. No, no, no. The intro of this show is that Chris the cat introduces a cool new song every once in a while when he feels like it. Not every time. That doesn't sound right. Hey, guys, why didn't you think anything about Casey Kristoff?
310.00 450.00 speaker2  I just thought that it was going to turn out that he had a bunch more information to give us, and then we never got to talk to him about it. What's your source on that? I've just never been more proud of somebody for being themselves. I got a minor in possession charge outside of a Dave Matthews Band show when I was 18 years old. Throw your dick down, babe. Go! Hell yeah. I want to talk to Kristoff, but if we're still talking to this girl, let's finish that up. I don't think we were going to just completely dismiss him, but, you know, things happen. People explode a little bit and beat up an old lady. It happens.
446.00 453.00 speaker3  Did I pick it up? And it had some writing on it. You just looked at it. You didn't pick it up.
450.00 539.00 speaker2  Did I read it? You did. What did it say again? and then I remembered that it was just your DM voice saying it. It wasn't a character saying it out loud. And thankfully we're not in the same room, so. You would have had a smack coming. There's literally no way that appliances get better every year. What does that stand for? General Electric. Go to do 84 entire clothings pending not dry goods.
536.00 553.00 speaker0  They put that at number two?
549.00 584.00 speaker2  I mean, if you like new ones, it's fine. It's all electric. Dude, speaking of lists, that made me think... No, no, no. Let's hang out on this dryer humid for a while. Should we stop recording this particular segment?
582.00 608.00 speaker3  It's so fucking funny. Yeah, sure. Hi. Hey. I do too. The diarrhea? Oh boy.
607.00 680.00 speaker2  On the dot. I'm about to take a quiz. Which Queer Eye cast member are you? While driving late one night, you hit a deer with your car. By the way, it is lying broken and bloody on the pavement. You can tell it is not going to live for long. The dying deer looks you in the eyes and yells, I'm you. How would you kill the deer? I would get back in my car and run it over to finish the job. I would snap the deer's neck. I would tape the deer to the hood of my car, drag it into my house and put its head in my microwave. I would make a sign that says I deserve this because I shoplifted and I would hang it around the deer's neck. Then I would drive away and leave the deer to die in agony. watching YouTube videos of flight towers talking inexperienced pilots how to land a plane in emergencies? Oh no. Oh, I actually am still recording. Good.
679.00 685.00 speaker3  and then you don't role play. Okay, should we just keep recording on this and start?
684.00 688.00 speaker2  Yeah. Okay.
686.00 701.00 speaker3  I'm keeping all the below deck shit. Good. Arguably the thing I know the most about right now.
699.00 707.00 speaker2  I'm rewatching Lost.
705.00 711.00 speaker3  Yeah, but I'm not there yet.
709.00 726.00 speaker2  Is it J.J. Abrams that did that? No, it's Michael Bay. No, he did Super 8.
724.00 779.00 speaker3  you guys won your power contest and you felt like the external forces grip on your perception was loosening. And the scene as you knew it in a single blink changed completely. Immediately, Bean's Pond was surrounded by this floating moat that you saw the first time when you arrived in contention and it was completely encircling the church. The church? Yes, the campus there. However, now it is surrounding you. And John and Clark, you guys are right next to it. It's like right behind you. And Keith, I believe you have been shot in the ribs and shot in the hip. Correct. And you are trying to make your way down the basin, this muddy, muddy basin where there used to be a pond. Still no water in it. That wasn't a gag on your mind space.
777.00 785.00 speaker2  I think I made it down already. Oh, you made your way down.
784.00 793.00 speaker3  Okay. I think we'll start off with that.
792.00 796.00 speaker2  That's right.
793.00 825.00 speaker3  So hold on to that roll for me as you roll it and I will continue to explain that you saw... Fuck! Don't ever lie. 77 on a 60.
824.00 838.00 speaker2  Okay, beautiful.
833.00 872.00 speaker3  You guys look up and you see Casey Kristoff, Van Halen t-shirt, cut off jeans, mullet, pencil-thin mustache. He's holding a pistol to the back of Kerry Page's head. The body thereof. The body thereof. And then right next to them, we've got Pastor Adam Kane, Daddy Kane, wearing the strange-looking motorcycle helmet with all the tubes. The red light is lit and he's driving a four-wheeler. Yeah.
868.00 881.00 speaker2  When you last episode were like, THE four-wheeler. THE four-wheeler. Damn it.
875.00 892.00 speaker3  And strapped to the back of this four-wheeler, you see the radio. Its green light is lit and holding on for dear life on top of this radio is an extremely determined black cat that you recognize.
891.00 926.00 speaker2  Yes. It's the agent. and sunglasses on the back of his head. And I think he was just coming down to investigate how we had fucked up so bad. Yeah. So what was the timeline of the cat? The cat was a cat. Then the cat and Doug Jacobs switched. And then Doug Jacobs and the cat's body got switched with Agent Trent Chad.
921.00 935.00 speaker3  Yeah, I believe that was your guys' doing in the police station inventory room.
934.00 949.00 speaker2  He deserved it. If he had told us what the fuck they were doing there. Oh, no.
948.00 958.00 speaker3  I know that.
955.00 961.00 speaker2  for no goddamn good reason. Yeah.
960.00 965.00 speaker3  No reason whatsoever.
964.00 973.00 speaker2  Can you elaborate on that? Yeah. It's just frosty out. No, no.
972.00 978.00 speaker3  Gotcha. Just a reminder that it's December 6th.
975.00 982.00 speaker2  Is the wall moving or is it just stationary water?
978.00 988.00 speaker3  The wall is not like encroaching or growing away from you. However, the water is flowing. That's kind of what I meant.
986.00 994.00 speaker2  So is it like spinning around the circle? Yes, it is. Gotcha. And there are fish in it? There are shitloads of fish in it.
992.00 1020.00 speaker3  And it smells vile. Yeah.
1019.00 1032.00 speaker2  How did you...
1031.00 1041.00 speaker3  Ooh. That's a good idea. Yeah. We're going to get a good take.
1040.00 1051.00 speaker2  Good cats.
1048.00 1067.00 speaker3  Do you know like the wet fish food? And he put it in the air ventilating system of our youth minister's truck.
1065.00 1087.00 speaker2  Jesus made a bunch of fish, so it's kind of... What does the wall smell like?
1081.00 1101.00 speaker3  So when I was in seventh grade, it was a hot summer day, but bright and early in the morning before the sun was out, my brother took that wet fish food and he put it in the air ventilation system of our youth minister's truck.
1096.00 1102.00 speaker2  And then the truck just sat outside and baked in the heat all day.
1101.00 1133.00 speaker3  Yeah. And I was running an errand with him later in the day and we got in there and he turned the air conditioning all the way up and we both just like... it for like four months. Just a little smelly.
1132.00 1140.00 speaker2  I mean, that's the golden question. We're in a pickle.
1139.00 1151.00 speaker3  Yeah, we are. So we're going to start with Casey Kristoff pulling the trigger. No, so...
1149.00 1161.00 speaker2  Because fuck you guys.
1158.00 1178.00 speaker3  So Clark Bishop, it's on you. You took that talent and immediately I was like, oh, you want to act first every time? You want to lead off every single...
1175.00 1189.00 speaker2  How fast is Adam Kane going and which direction is he going? Is he aiming for like a person or is he aiming for the door? He was literally aiming his gun at Keith, but was he driving in a particular direction?
1187.00 1236.00 speaker3  He's got both hands on the wheel. He's aiming the four wheeler at Keith. Or as we said last time, the impossible metal plate. Yeah, very cool. Begrudgingly. Anything with wheels, that guy can do cool stuff on. It's pronounced pastrami. Pastrami. Yeah, his dad was a deli. It's a deli.
1235.00 1265.00 speaker2  Is that meatloaf? Oh no. Clark is going to... Clark, I want to point my gun at Adam Kane and yell stop the vehicle while I'm aiming at him. And I want to use my turn to use the aim action. Correct?
1264.00 1285.00 speaker3  Plus 20 on your next shot. Which will put your firearms at what? Like 100.
1284.00 1287.00 speaker2  aiming for him.
1286.00 1304.00 speaker3  Okay, sick. Do pistols have an aimer? Iron sights?
1302.00 1311.00 speaker2  Do pistols have an aimer? Hey, you got your episode title.
1309.00 1316.00 speaker4  That's you. You did it, bud. You're the pistols aimer.
1315.00 1321.00 speaker2  It's you. It's been inside you the whole time. Yeah.
1319.00 1330.00 speaker4  Isn't that wonderful?
1329.00 1375.00 speaker3  No, that actually plays here. You are looking down and right back over the top of your sights, you see the bridge of Adam Kane's nose and both of his eyes are staring straight back at you and they are massive. He looks scared. Did he always have those things? He did. Those are the two descriptors of Pastor Adam Kane currently known as Daddy. John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.
1374.00 1405.00 speaker2  to have to stop right there, buddy. Cause there's only one daddy in this town. Oh, okay. Oh, I forgot about that.
1399.00 1559.00 speaker3  Your left side is just rocked by a couple bullets that hit some pretty brutal spots, your hip and your ribs. And as your left foot lands on the mud, it hits a rock and you just feel your whole leg stiffens. It does that thing where you kind of hyper extend your knee on it, but that just shoots your, your thigh bone directly up into this hip. That's just been shattered and you feel a crack as you just immediately crumble forward. But seeing as how you're on a pretty steep incline, it makes a belly flop noise as your face just hits the mud and you start slowly sliding down this hill. Yuck. Oh, pastor Adam Kane just leans forward. He's got just horror in his eyes as he makes direct eye contact with Clark Bishop, knowing directly into this muddy base and whipping up just wet mud behind him as he just back and forth, back and forth, his back end sliding around. And he goes right over the impassable metal plate over the top and then whips his back end, just spraying Keith Vigna's back with mud like a bad guy from an eighties ski movie. And this black cat turns on the radio, hops off and starts running away, leaving the radio directly in between pastor Adam Kane on this four wheeler and Keith Vigna face down in the mud. The radio is on and Casey Kristoff hollers with his pistol pointed into the back of Carrie Page's body's head. Just so you know, Mr. Bishop, Mr. Pettymore, if either one of you fire those weapons, your friend Drew Andrews here is dead.
1558.00 1569.00 speaker2  I cock mine.
1567.00 1583.00 speaker3  Bubble gum tree. Bubble gum tree. Bubble gum tree.
1582.00 1589.00 speaker0  Drew, babe.
1586.00 1620.00 speaker4  Any, any he'll say, he won't say anything. John moves his gun to Casey and lets that do the talking for him.
1619.00 1623.00 speaker3  Yeah.
1620.00 1632.00 speaker2  And then I'm, how close is the pastor to me?
1625.00 1645.00 speaker3  So basically you could reach out with your hand and, and touch the back of the four wheeler
1643.00 1649.00 speaker2  The radio is in the, on the back of the four wheeler.
1648.00 1652.00 speaker3  So he is facing.
1651.00 1656.00 speaker4  Yeah, man.
1654.00 1660.00 speaker3  Thomas fucking get over it. Okay.
1659.00 1667.00 speaker2  Oh yeah.
1666.00 1680.00 speaker3  do? How do you do it? Tell me how your body moves.
1679.00 1710.00 speaker2  Okay. Uh, do you want to hold it over your head? So what's your luck at now? Uh, down to 35. Cause I was, I was at 45 then 35 then I gained luck back and now I'm down again.
1705.00 1714.00 speaker3  So, uh, this radio has been ratcheted to the back of this four wheeler as to not fall off.
1711.00 1736.56 speaker2  I want to take the butt of my gun and smash a tube on it.
1729.08 1787.10 speaker3  And pastor Adam Kane reaches in the side bag of this four wheeler, grabs a fish out and squeezes it so hard that it completely busts into two separate halfs above his head. Tail end falls on one side, head falls on the other, and you see just guts and sin like all this like what's inside a fish guys? Guts. Oh bones. Tiny little bones. Yeah. Guts and tiny little fish bones kind of fall onto the helmet and immediately the light on his helmet turns green. Everybody roll power.
1785.10 1822.42 speaker4  I hate contested rules.
1819.70 1834.14 speaker2  And that's just off the top of my head, I bet there's a lot. I mean recently it's for sure the revelation of how I fucked up getting the Cain family
1830.86 1835.14 speaker3  That would 100% be the one that he latches onto.
1834.14 1849.56 speaker2  Okay. Yeah that's a recent one that has been newly opened in his mind, like he didn't regret that until recently. Now it's a big, big deal.
1843.46 1891.64 speaker3  Clark your gun is aimed at this four wheeler and immediately the four wheeler is a minivan and it's turned over and it's on fire and it's still in this mud basin. It's still right there. But then you hear these screams and you remember hearing these screams. The van explodes and you are rushing toward it and you're back on the concrete, you're on the main drag heading north out of contention. But there's nothing you can do to stop it and then you're watching this child being taken off on a stretcher into the back of an ambulance.
1890.64 1924.36 speaker2  Oh yeah, 100%.
1922.40 1934.64 speaker4  the vacuuming of their children.
1932.16 2006.82 speaker3  and it's the exact scene that you remember. They're holding on to this man, unkempt hair, wearing these rubber waders. You know him as James the mill worker and they're trying to hold on to him and you're trying to hold on to them but they're floating away above Bean's Pond and they're just floating up and then all at once you see behind them the sky envelopes out and opens this massive hole and coming out of it is just like an oil spray of this ooze but it's coming at you horizontally and it grabs onto them and in this weird whirlwind slowly, slowly pulls Like if a person was in a balloon trying desperately to get out, you see their hands and their feet kicking, kicking and trying to get out and then they just out of existence. Roll sanity.
2004.14 2024.82 speaker4  That's not John's biggest regret. What's John's biggest regret?
2022.82 2031.82 speaker3  We'll see what happens.
2030.02 2043.82 speaker4  Of course not.
2037.84 2149.44 speaker3  turns into your sprint car that you wrecked and you see across the way where there once was Casey Kristoff holding a gun to the back of Kerry Page's head, you see little Elvis Duncan's Jr. and his face is split wide open, there's blood running down it. You know 100% that if your defective safety harness hadn't taken his eye from him, blood begins to kind of like continue to pour down, you see that where his eye should be, there's
2144.40 2162.16 speaker2  of just facing the embarrassment of being beans and going to work for his brother.
2157.28 2223.28 speaker3  has just smeared fish all over this old motorcycle helmet. The four wheeler is surrounded by children who are all wearing party hats and they're And you turn back and you see Ferguson standing where Clark and John just were and he's wearing his beautiful suit, it's got a rose on his lapel and you look back at these birthday party clad children and instead you see a life, a life at Bar Corp. What would that look like for Keith?
2214.92 2237.20 speaker2  that he sees and takes care of, a wife probably and spends the weekends barbecuing at Ferguson's house and our children play together.
2232.80 2283.40 speaker3  and you're just sitting at the edge of the bed by yourself. Roll sanity. Everybody roll a D4. 1. Alright, John loses 2, Clark and Keith both lose 1 sanity. No. Just keep it in mind for the future. We didn't talk about that on the normal show.
2279.44 2288.40 speaker4  It was if you had passed sanity and you were supposed to take damage no matter what.
2285.48 2297.20 speaker3  I just wasn't paying attention so you got off. Yes.
2292.24 2310.36 speaker4  So we have it written down as 1 slash 1 D4 is the sanity damage. Which would mean 1 if you pass slash 1 D4 if you fail because that's 1 up to 4.
2307.48 2325.64 speaker3  Which thank you Luke and I will remember moving forward. It's very kind of you. Oh wow.
2324.44 2340.32 speaker4  It's a 1. It's our word against his. If everybody else says it right now that it's all him, it's my dudes. What is it?
2339.32 2341.32 speaker2  It's a 2.
2340.32 2348.28 speaker4  Could be worse. I'll take it. Even though we also saw him roll that 1.
2344.24 2356.40 speaker2  He rolled a 1 and then said no no no and then he cut that audio out.
2354.60 2364.80 speaker4  I'm real sorry buddy. I hope you know how much I love you. I've been taking Prozac for 3 years.
2363.80 2367.80 speaker2  No Prozac. Guys he's pro me.
2366.80 2376.04 speaker0  He really liked it.
2372.80 2378.80 speaker4  And I should have thought of it like years ago but I just thought of it when I was in
2377.72 2409.20 speaker2  That was really good. It obviously took me a second but thumbs up. It's working for me.
2407.20 2437.00 speaker4  Your friend Tim. Vitatim. Vitimin. Wow.
2436.00 2447.00 speaker2  Doxycycline. Doxycycline.
2446.00 2453.00 speaker3  Uh oh. I'm frozen. Can you hear me?
2451.00 2455.00 speaker4  Let's all roll higher than that.
2454.00 2460.00 speaker2  Oh no.
2459.00 2462.00 speaker0  You're back.
2461.00 2470.52 speaker2  I could hear you the whole time. It was just frozen. Okay. Yay.
2469.52 2471.52 speaker4  Knock on wood.
2470.52 2480.52 speaker2  My internet hasn't been out in three days. So. Shit. Oh, two rounds. He rolled a one for something.
2479.52 2482.52 speaker0  That not one really changed this entire situation.
2481.52 2552.64 speaker3  you can hear Carrie Andrews. Carrie Andrews. Carrie Andrews. Carrie Andrews. Carrie Andrews. Carrie Andrews. You can hear Carrie Andrews still hollering across the muddy divide. Don't you give them shit, boys. You hear me? Don't you give them anything but the cold graves they deserve. Clark, you see Casey Kristoff is still in the same position, pistol to the back of the head of blindfolded inside out Drew Carey. John, you immediately realize you are no longer holding your gun. Looking down, you see agent Trent Catt has not only knocked your weapon from your hand, but also ejected the magazine and is trying to grab the ammo with his mouth. Keith, you are being held under your arms, behind your neck, feet dragging in the mud in front of you as pastor Adam Cain hauls you toward the impassable metal plate. And as these two men approach the partially buried door, you all see that it begins sliding Time to fly, time to stream.
