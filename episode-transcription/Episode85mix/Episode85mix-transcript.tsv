0	12000	This is weird. Can y'all hear me? Because all I'm doin' right now is thinkin' real hard towards y'all soft gooey brains.
12000	17000	Ha ha ha ha. My powers are weird and ever-changin'.
17000	26000	I am telepathin' live from 694.2 PTBP straight into your mind cavity.
26000	32000	It's your Espa that's the besta. Wolf the dog. I wanna give a resoundin'
32000	36000	awwwwwwwwwww
36000	45000	to all of you who donated to the bail project. Y'all raised $6,654.
45000	48000	And I got one final winner to announce.
48000	58000	The fifth person to receive an official PTBP t-shirt is Roxy from Hamburg, Germany.
58000	64000	Congratulations, Roxy. Damn, I wish I coulda won one of them shirts.
64000	72000	I kept mailin' that Zach idiot all kinds of dumpster treasure that was worth at least $5.
72000	79000	Anywho, yesterday I was dippin' into a bucket of applesauce and it was somethin' special.
79000	83000	You probably wanna know how ol' Wolfie makes his special sauce.
83000	89000	Applesauce is when I let all the apples I steal from dumpsters around town
89000	97000	sit in a bucket until they change from a solid to a sort of delicious slurry of a sauce.
97000	104000	You can dip all kinds of shit in it. Other less liquid apples, baby carrots,
104000	112000	tortilla chips, or like your whole body before goin' out on the town to find a new honey to love on.
112000	118000	But I digress so that I may digest the news.
118000	123000	Last time, our three mentally exhausted anti-heroes?
123000	130000	Not quite heroes, though. Not yet fully villains, though either, I suppose.
130000	136000	Our broken protagonists raced through the tunnels under the town of contention.
136000	142000	When they popped out at Bean's Pond, they saw a different reality than the real one.
142000	151000	Asher and Avery Little gave it the best shot, but they were unable to grasp retribution for the missing children.
151000	160000	And with that, these boys erased the final two pieces in the Little family puzzle from this plane of existence.
160000	166000	The veil was lifted. Bishop, Pettymore, and Vigna saw the truth of their situation.
166000	171000	Casey Kristoff is holding Carrie Page's body at gunpoint.
171000	179000	Pastor Adam Kane is on the four-wheeler gunnin' it down into the former pond toward Keith with the helmet on.
179000	185000	And a hell-bent black cat on the back atop the radio with its green light lit.
185000	192000	And I have been given the green light to drop this brand new track on y'all's here in contention.
192000	198000	Get ready to add this smash of a banger to your apocalypse playlist.
198000	203000	It's kudzu with no backbone.
209000	225000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to Pretending to be People.
225000	230000	My name is Zach, and I am your handler, or your gum, as some might say.
230000	232000	Who says gum? Nobody.
232000	235000	Guys, why don't you do the intro we do?
235000	240000	I've always called you my handsome-ler, so I don't know what your gum thing is about.
240000	244000	That's very sweet, but why aren't you guys doing the intro?
244000	247000	This is the 85th episode. We've done the same intro every time.
247000	257000	No, no, no. The intro of this show is that Chris the cat introduces a cool new song every once in a while when he feels like it.
257000	258000	Not every time.
258000	261000	Is it Chris? Is it Chris the cat?
261000	262000	Frank the parrot.
262000	263000	That doesn't sound right.
263000	265000	I think it's Pete the parrot.
265000	267000	Craig the cow.
267000	270000	Craig the cow, that's right. That's it.
270000	273000	I can't believe we all forgot that.
273000	276000	Hey, guys, why didn't you think anything about Casey Kristoff?
276000	283000	We just improved a lot of work for Justin.
283000	292000	I tried to think about Casey Kristoff, but we kept talking to other people in the room, and then we had to leave.
292000	302000	I heard Craig's snarky little comment about how we just ignored him, but personally, I never noticed him in the first place.
302000	310000	I internalized that he was not paying attention to the book he was reading, so I knew he was overhearing us as we spoke.
310000	318000	I just thought that it was going to turn out that he had a bunch more information to give us, and then we never got to talk to him about it.
318000	327000	I'm so mad at the people playing real playing games when I'm listening to their podcasts all in a row.
327000	335000	I'm sorry, the dog. Cut this whole part out. The dog. Anyway, Craig the cow.
335000	343000	Do you know what the best song of 2018 was? It's Again and Again by the Dave Matthews Band.
343000	344000	What's your source on that?
344000	347000	Ultimateclassicrock.com.
347000	352000	Shouldn't they not keep us updated on current music?
352000	362000	Guys, I was at the grocery store today, and I saw this dude in his mid-40s rocking a Dave Matthews Band O2 tour shirt.
362000	367000	I've just never been more proud of somebody for being themselves.
368000	374000	I got a minor in possession charge outside of a Dave Matthews Band show when I was 18 years old.
374000	377000	Who hasn't?
377000	384000	All of us except for Zach. This is the dog corner I was talking about. I'm sorry.
384000	390000	Our audio is still far better than many other quarantine podcasts, so it should be fine.
390000	394000	Throw your dick down, babe. Go!
394000	398000	I put in work to make sure that that's true, motherfucker.
398000	400000	Hell yeah.
400000	405000	Luke, any issue with Casey Kristoff before you dive into another song from another list on the internet?
405000	412000	What do you mean, any issue? Fuck that guy. I have all issues with him. What do you mean, though?
412000	418000	Nobody did anything about what was clearly a character who was eavesdropping.
418000	423000	I think if you go back two episodes, maybe, I said something like,
423000	427000	I want to talk to Kristoff, but if we're still talking to this girl, let's finish that up.
427000	430000	I think those exact words came out of my mouth.
430000	434000	I don't think we were going to just completely dismiss him, but, you know, things happen.
434000	440000	People explode a little bit and beat up an old lady. It happens.
440000	446000	Something fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket. A piece of paper fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket.
446000	450000	Did I pick it up? And it had some writing on it. You just looked at it. You didn't pick it up.
450000	453000	Did I read it? You did. What did it say again?
453000	456000	It says, Iyinaha fersat sayiya.
456000	461000	Oh yeah, because I wanted to make the joke of the time that I wanted to punch you saying that,
461000	466000	and then I remembered that it was just your DM voice saying it. It wasn't a character saying it out loud.
468000	472000	I punch. I punch. I immediately punch. Throat punch.
472000	475000	And thankfully we're not in the same room, so. You would have had a smack coming.
475000	479000	Punch me through the phone. How about best lists of all time?
482000	487000	Top dryers, go. Okay. I like a Kenmore, I like a Whirlpool.
487000	491000	Air. Most used dryer of all time.
491000	497000	Best dryers of all time. Let's see.
497000	504000	Well, if we go under the assumption that they get better every year, then the best dryer of all time.
504000	507000	There's literally no way that appliances get better every year.
507000	511000	Yeah, I was about to say that's kind of the antithesis of appliances these days.
511000	515000	But let's just go under the assumption that that is true.
517000	523000	And the answer is the GE GTD84ECPNDG.
523000	526000	What does that stand for? General Electric.
526000	536000	Go to do 84 entire clothings pending not dry goods.
536000	539000	They put that at number two?
543000	549000	I'm personally fond of the LGDLE7300WE.
549000	553000	I mean, if you like new ones, it's fine. It's all electric.
554000	557000	I like my gas powered dryer.
558000	562000	Dude, speaking of lists, that made me think...
562000	565000	No, no, no. Let's hang out on this dryer humid for a while.
567000	571000	The dog break is longer than I thought it was going to be.
571000	573000	Yeah.
573000	578000	Should we stop recording this particular segment?
578000	582000	Well, I mean, I don't even think I'll have to edit anything we've done so far.
582000	584000	It's so fucking funny.
585000	587000	Yeah, sure.
587000	588000	Hi.
588000	589000	Hey.
589000	590000	Okay, I'm going to go pee real quick.
590000	593000	So Murphy has a diarrhea or something. I'm really sorry.
593000	594000	Bummer.
594000	595000	Oh, I straight up thought that was a joke.
595000	596000	I do too.
596000	597000	The diarrhea?
597000	602000	No, the Luke leaving to go pee like right when you came back.
602000	604000	Oh boy.
605000	607000	We're doing it, man. 730.
607000	608000	On the dot.
608000	610000	I'm going to go pee.
613000	614000	You burned it.
615000	618000	I'm about to take a quiz. Which Queer Eye cast member are you?
618000	621000	While driving late one night, you hit a deer with your car.
621000	624000	By the way, it is lying broken and bloody on the pavement.
624000	626000	You can tell it is not going to live for long.
626000	628000	The dying deer looks you in the eyes and yells,
628000	630000	I'm you. How would you kill the deer?
630000	633000	I would get back in my car and run it over to finish the job.
633000	635000	I would snap the deer's neck.
635000	637000	I would tape the deer to the hood of my car,
637000	640000	drag it into my house and put its head in my microwave.
640000	644000	I would make a sign that says I deserve this because I shoplifted
644000	646000	and I would hang it around the deer's neck.
646000	649000	Then I would drive away and leave the deer to die in agony.
649000	652000	Do the microwave one so you get Anthony.
652000	653000	Okay.
654000	657000	Did I tell you guys I got addicted for a day or two
657000	662000	watching YouTube videos of flight towers talking inexperienced pilots
662000	664000	how to land a plane in emergencies?
664000	666000	That sounds awesome.
666000	668000	That sounds so good.
668000	670000	It was wildly fascinating.
671000	672000	Oh no.
672000	674000	Oh, I actually am still recording.
674000	675000	Good.
675000	679000	Everybody who role plays knows that sometimes you get everybody together
679000	680000	and then you don't role play.
680000	683000	Okay, should we just keep recording on this and start?
684000	685000	Yeah.
685000	686000	Okay.
686000	688000	I'm keeping all the below deck shit.
688000	691000	Good. Arguably the thing I know the most about right now.
692000	696000	Mine is Crusader Kings, Below Deck, and The Sopranos.
699000	701000	I'm rewatching Lost.
701000	702000	I never started it.
702000	705000	I mean, Lost famously sucks at the end.
705000	707000	Yeah, but I'm not there yet.
707000	709000	It's not Michael Bay, is it?
709000	711000	Is it J.J. Abrams that did that?
711000	713000	No, it's Michael Bay.
715000	717000	What did Michael Bay do? Is he Transformers?
717000	719000	No, he did Super 8.
721000	724000	So last time, Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and John Lee Pettymore,
724000	726000	you guys won your power contest
726000	731000	and you felt like the external forces grip on your perception was loosening.
731000	736000	And the scene as you knew it in a single blink changed completely.
736000	740000	Immediately, Bean's Pond was surrounded by this floating moat
740000	743000	that you saw the first time when you arrived in contention
743000	747000	and it was completely encircling the church.
747000	749000	The church? Yes, the campus there.
749000	752000	However, now it is surrounding you.
752000	755000	And John and Clark, you guys are right next to it.
755000	757000	It's like right behind you.
757000	763000	And Keith, I believe you have been shot in the ribs and shot in the hip.
763000	764000	Correct.
764000	769000	And you are trying to make your way down the basin,
769000	772000	this muddy, muddy basin where there used to be a pond.
772000	773000	Still no water in it.
773000	776000	That wasn't a gag on your mind space.
776000	777000	Am I not in it already?
777000	779000	I think I made it down already.
779000	780000	Oh, you made your way down.
780000	784000	You've yet to roll a dexterity check to not fall on your way down there.
784000	785000	Okay.
785000	787000	I think we'll start off with that.
787000	792000	Okay, I was going down to check and see if it actually said about me, about Bean.
792000	793000	That's right.
793000	796000	So hold on to that roll for me as you roll it
796000	799000	and I will continue to explain that you saw...
799000	800000	Fuck!
805000	806000	What was it?
806000	807000	77.
807000	810000	Oh, no!
810000	812000	I should have lied, but...
812000	814000	Oh, I'm super glad you didn't.
814000	815000	Don't ever lie.
815000	817000	There's no point.
817000	820000	The game lives and dies on us being truthful.
820000	822000	77 on a 60.
822000	824000	Holy shit.
824000	825000	Okay, beautiful.
825000	832000	So Keith is sliding face first down the side of the mud basin.
833000	838000	You guys look up and you see Casey Kristoff, Van Halen t-shirt,
838000	841000	cut off jeans, mullet, pencil-thin mustache.
841000	846000	He's holding a pistol to the back of Kerry Page's head.
846000	848000	The body thereof.
848000	850000	The body thereof.
850000	853000	And then right next to them, we've got Pastor Adam Kane,
853000	858000	Daddy Kane, wearing the strange-looking motorcycle helmet with all the tubes.
858000	861000	The red light is lit and he's driving a four-wheeler.
861000	862000	Yeah.
862000	865000	That's the part that hurt the most.
865000	868000	That's the fucking part that hurt the most.
868000	872000	When you last episode were like, THE four-wheeler.
872000	874000	THE four-wheeler.
874000	875000	Damn it.
875000	881000	And strapped to the back of this four-wheeler, you see the radio.
881000	886000	Its green light is lit and holding on for dear life on top of this radio
886000	891000	is an extremely determined black cat that you recognize.
891000	892000	Yes.
892000	893000	It's the agent.
893000	895000	Agent Trent Chad is in that cat's body.
895000	900000	That's the guy who showed up to the Contention PD with Red Bulls piled in his car
900000	903000	and sunglasses on the back of his head.
903000	907000	And I think he was just coming down to investigate how we had fucked up so bad.
907000	909000	Yeah.
909000	912000	So what was the timeline of the cat?
912000	913000	The cat was a cat.
913000	915000	Then the cat and Doug Jacobs switched.
915000	921000	And then Doug Jacobs and the cat's body got switched with Agent Trent Chad.
921000	926000	Yeah, I believe that was your guys' doing in the police station inventory room.
926000	933000	Well, Agent Trent Chad shouldn't have showed up with such mysterious motives and purposes.
933000	934000	Yeah.
934000	935000	He deserved it.
935000	937000	If he had told us what the fuck they were doing there.
937000	943000	Well, also Clark had just come back from a little visit out of town with some darts.
943000	947000	I was able to make him do what I wanted and that was my goal.
947000	948000	Oh, no.
948000	949000	I know that.
949000	955000	I just mean we might have done it to somebody else if he hadn't gotten all in our business
955000	958000	for no goddamn good reason.
958000	959000	Yeah.
959000	960000	Yeah.
960000	961000	No reason whatsoever.
961000	964000	You mentioned something about ice crystals forming on the water wall.
964000	965000	Can you elaborate on that?
965000	966000	Yeah.
966000	967000	It's really fucking cold outside.
967000	969000	But they're not like impenetrable or anything like that.
969000	970000	It's just frosty out.
970000	971000	No, no.
971000	972000	That is just some flavor.
972000	973000	Gotcha.
973000	975000	Just a reminder that it's December 6th.
975000	978000	Is the wall moving or is it just stationary water?
978000	982000	The wall is not like encroaching or growing away from you.
982000	984000	However, the water is flowing.
984000	985000	That's kind of what I meant.
985000	986000	Yeah.
986000	988000	So is it like spinning around the circle?
988000	989000	Yes, it is.
989000	990000	Gotcha.
990000	991000	And there are fish in it?
991000	992000	There are shitloads of fish in it.
992000	994000	And it smells vile.
994000	999000	You remember the smell when John stuck his head in the back of the truck?
999000	1001000	I remember that this thing smells.
1001000	1002000	I just want to...
1002000	1004000	I'm looking, Zach, what does this smell like?
1004000	1005000	Oh, okay.
1005000	1006000	Yeah.
1006000	1014000	So when I was in seventh grade...
1014000	1019000	My brother shed on my face and gave me pink eye.
1019000	1020000	How did you...
1020000	1021000	No.
1021000	1023000	Tell this story every podcast.
1024000	1027000	And then I edit it out because you guys don't laugh hard enough.
1027000	1031000	I should just edit the laughter in.
1031000	1032000	Ooh.
1032000	1034000	That's a good idea.
1036000	1037000	I'll use that.
1037000	1038000	That was genuine.
1038000	1039000	Yeah.
1039000	1040000	We're going to get a good take.
1040000	1041000	Good cats.
1046000	1048000	So my brother got fish food.
1048000	1051000	Do you know like the wet fish food?
1051000	1060000	And he put it in the air ventilating system of our youth minister's truck.
1060000	1063000	That wasn't very Christ-like of him.
1065000	1067000	Jesus made a bunch of fish, so it's kind of...
1067000	1070000	Must have been a shitty youth minister.
1078000	1080000	What does the wall smell like?
1080000	1081000	Oh, yeah.
1081000	1087000	So when I was in seventh grade, it was a hot summer day, but bright and early in the morning
1087000	1094000	before the sun was out, my brother took that wet fish food and he put it in the air ventilation
1094000	1096000	system of our youth minister's truck.
1096000	1101000	And then the truck just sat outside and baked in the heat all day.
1101000	1102000	Yeah.
1102000	1106000	And I was running an errand with him later in the day and we got in there and he turned
1106000	1111000	the air conditioning all the way up and we both just like...
1119000	1126000	So it smells like if someone had put a rotting fish in your wheel well and you couldn't find
1126000	1128000	it for like four months.
1128000	1129000	So stinky.
1129000	1130000	Yeah.
1130000	1131000	Just a little smelly.
1131000	1132000	Now what?
1132000	1133000	I mean, that's the golden question.
1133000	1134000	We're in a pickle.
1135000	1137000	Is it like, are we still doing turns or...
1137000	1138000	Oh, yeah.
1138000	1139000	Are we in turn order still?
1139000	1140000	Yeah, we are.
1140000	1144000	So we're going to start with Casey Kristoff pulling the trigger.
1144000	1145000	No, so...
1149000	1151000	Because fuck you guys.
1153000	1158000	We'll start with Clark as per usual and Keith's first turn will be his 77 roll.
1158000	1161000	So Clark Bishop, it's on you.
1161000	1162000	Oh, fuck.
1162000	1167000	You took that talent and immediately I was like, oh, you want to act first every time?
1167000	1170000	You want to lead off every single...
1170000	1175000	You want to set the tone for every interaction?
1175000	1178000	How fast is Adam Kane going and which direction is he going?
1178000	1181000	Is he aiming for like a person or is he aiming for the door?
1181000	1185000	He was literally aiming his gun at Keith, but was he driving in a particular direction?
1185000	1187000	So he actually doesn't have a gun out.
1187000	1189000	He's got both hands on the wheel.
1189000	1191000	He's aiming the four wheeler at Keith.
1191000	1192000	Oh, gotcha.
1192000	1197000	Who is actually right across the door from him.
1197000	1200000	Or as we said last time, the impossible metal plate.
1200000	1203000	And is he on top of the ponder inside of it?
1203000	1207000	He is about to drop in like a skateboarder might.
1207000	1209000	Yeah, very cool. Begrudgingly.
1209000	1213000	Are there any famous four wheeler people?
1213000	1215000	Travis Pastrana probably.
1215000	1219000	Anything with wheels, that guy can do cool stuff on.
1219000	1220000	It's pronounced pastrami.
1220000	1221000	Pastrami.
1221000	1222000	Yeah.
1222000	1223000	Oh, I didn't know that this entire time.
1223000	1225000	Yeah, his dad was a deli.
1225000	1227000	So fucking stupid.
1227000	1230000	Never mind, I'll find...
1230000	1231000	Is that meatloaf?
1231000	1232000	It's a deli.
1232000	1235000	Oh my God.
1235000	1236000	Is that meatloaf?
1236000	1237000	Oh no.
1237000	1240000	Fuck.
1240000	1244000	Clark is going to...
1244000	1252000	Clark, I want to point my gun at Adam Kane and yell stop the vehicle while I'm aiming
1252000	1253000	at him.
1253000	1257000	And I want to use my turn to use the aim action.
1257000	1258000	Oh yeah, absolutely.
1258000	1262000	That gives me a bonus to my next round's shot.
1262000	1263000	Correct?
1263000	1264000	It does indeed.
1264000	1265000	Plus 20 on your next shot.
1265000	1267000	Which will put your firearms at what?
1267000	1268000	Like 100.
1268000	1271000	Oh, it is 100, yeah.
1271000	1273000	Can't miss, baby.
1273000	1275000	Triple zeroes is a fail though.
1275000	1277000	Yeah, 100 will still be a crit fail.
1277000	1284000	I want to use that mechanic to impress upon in the world that Adam Kane knows that I'm
1284000	1285000	aiming for him.
1285000	1286000	Oh, hell yeah.
1286000	1287000	Okay, sick.
1287000	1290000	And he knows I'm not going to miss.
1290000	1295000	So as you're just following him, you see down the...
1295000	1299000	Do pistols have an aimer?
1299000	1301000	Iron sights?
1302000	1304000	Do pistols have an aimer?
1304000	1306000	Hey, you got your episode title.
1306000	1309000	Yeah, buddy.
1309000	1311000	That's you.
1311000	1313000	You did it, bud.
1313000	1315000	You're the pistols aimer.
1315000	1316000	It's you.
1316000	1318000	It's been inside you the whole time.
1318000	1319000	Yeah.
1319000	1321000	Isn't that wonderful?
1321000	1322000	Hey there, buddy.
1322000	1327000	Why don't you just, you know, just point the gun and then you'll pull the trigger.
1327000	1329000	So it's one drawn gun.
1329000	1330000	No, that actually plays here.
1330000	1337000	You are looking down and right back over the top of your sights, you see the bridge
1337000	1344000	of Adam Kane's nose and both of his eyes are staring straight back at you and they are
1344000	1345000	massive.
1345000	1347000	He looks scared.
1347000	1352000	He looks scared or he has massive eyes like that fucking John Peters video.
1352000	1358000	He does have very, very pitch black eyes and a weird balloon shaped head.
1358000	1359000	Did he always have those things?
1359000	1360000	He did.
1360000	1361000	Yeah.
1361000	1362000	Yeah.
1362000	1367000	Those are the two descriptors of Pastor Adam Kane currently known as Daddy.
1367000	1368000	Oh yeah.
1368000	1369000	John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.
1369000	1374000	I would also like to, uh, I'd like to aim at Adam and I'm going to say you're going
1374000	1375000	to have to stop right there, buddy.
1375000	1380000	Cause there's only one daddy in this town.
1380000	1385000	I like wink over it at Clark.
1385000	1388000	I'm like, it's him.
1388000	1389000	Okay.
1389000	1391000	Luke, do you tell me what happens?
1391000	1392000	Oh, okay.
1392000	1394000	Oh no, don't do that.
1394000	1397000	I mean, I rolled a crit fail on my getting down.
1397000	1398000	Oh, I forgot about that.
1398000	1399000	Gotcha.
1399000	1405000	Your left side is just rocked by a couple bullets that hit some pretty brutal spots,
1405000	1407000	your hip and your ribs.
1407000	1415000	And as your left foot lands on the mud, it hits a rock and you just feel your whole leg
1415000	1416000	stiffens.
1416000	1421000	It does that thing where you kind of hyper extend your knee on it, but that just shoots
1421000	1424000	your, your thigh bone directly up into this hip.
1424000	1431000	That's just been shattered and you feel a crack as you just immediately crumble forward.
1431000	1438000	But seeing as how you're on a pretty steep incline, it makes a belly flop noise as your
1438000	1444000	face just hits the mud and you start slowly sliding down this hill.
1444000	1445000	Yuck.
1445000	1451000	I'm going to do drugs probably on my next turn.
1451000	1453000	That'll do.
1453000	1456000	It's a three and a seven.
1456000	1459000	Oh, pastor Adam Kane just leans forward.
1459000	1466000	He's got just horror in his eyes as he makes direct eye contact with Clark Bishop, knowing
1466000	1476000	full well that his shot will ring true and he just noses down in and guns the four wheeler
1476000	1482000	directly into this muddy base and whipping up just wet mud behind him as he just back
1482000	1485000	and forth, back and forth, his back end sliding around.
1485000	1492000	And he goes right over the impassable metal plate over the top and then whips his back
1492000	1502000	end, just spraying Keith Vigna's back with mud like a bad guy from an eighties ski movie.
1502000	1513000	And this black cat turns on the radio, hops off and starts running away, leaving the radio
1513000	1520000	directly in between pastor Adam Kane on this four wheeler and Keith Vigna face down in
1520000	1521000	the mud.
1521000	1529000	The radio is on and Casey Kristoff hollers with his pistol pointed into the back of
1529000	1532000	Carrie Page's body's head.
1532000	1537000	She's blindfolded and she's on her knees with her hands behind her back.
1537000	1541000	All right now, everybody, everybody come on down.
1541000	1548000	Just so you know, Mr. Bishop, Mr. Pettymore, if either one of you fire those weapons, your
1549000	1551000	friend Drew Andrews here is dead.
1551000	1554000	And if I fire my weapon, Adam's dead.
1554000	1556000	Does he have any reaction to that?
1556000	1558000	He cocks the pistol.
1558000	1559000	I cock mine.
1559000	1567000	Carrie pages blindfolded on her knees, hands behind her back, starts hollering.
1567000	1569000	Bubble gum tree.
1569000	1571000	Bubble gum tree.
1571000	1572000	Bubble gum tree.
1572000	1573000	Bubble gum tree.
1573000	1575000	It's him.
1575000	1581000	A giant smile goes across the face of Carrie pages.
1581000	1582000	Yay, it's Drewby.
1582000	1583000	Drew, babe.
1583000	1586000	John's going to move his gun to Casey.
1586000	1589000	Any, any he'll say, he won't say anything.
1589000	1594000	John moves his gun to Casey and lets that do the talking for him.
1594000	1596000	Keith Vigna, what do you do?
1596000	1602000	As you're laying there, you hear this radio flip on and the noise starts kicking up.
1606000	1612000	That was a disturbingly good radio sound.
1612000	1617000	Uh, I'm going to take another big bump from my finger.
1617000	1618000	Yep.
1618000	1619000	Lose 10 luck for me there.
1619000	1620000	Yeah.
1620000	1623000	And then I'm, how close is the pastor to me?
1623000	1625000	Uh, Oh, he's, he's right on the other side.
1625000	1632000	So basically you could reach out with your hand and, and touch the back of the four wheeler
1632000	1640000	and then the radio is strapped on right there.
1640000	1643000	And then pastor Adam Kane is right on the other side of the radio.
1643000	1645000	The radio is in the, on the back of the four wheeler.
1645000	1646000	Yeah.
1646000	1648000	And he's whipped his tail in toward you.
1648000	1649000	So he is facing.
1649000	1651000	He has a tail.
1651000	1652000	Yeah, man.
1652000	1654000	People are animals in this game.
1654000	1656000	Thomas fucking get over it.
1656000	1657000	Okay.
1657000	1659000	I want to try to get to the radio.
1659000	1660000	Oh yeah.
1660000	1666000	You would be prone normally, but with losing that 10 luck, taking a quick, what do you
1666000	1667000	do?
1667000	1668000	How do you do it?
1668000	1669000	Tell me how your body moves.
1669000	1679000	I, then I get on my hands and knees and look at the radio and pounce from that position.
1679000	1680000	Okay.
1680000	1685000	What's the goal here to grab the radio and either smash it or turn it off.
1685000	1688000	Uh, do you want to hold it over your head?
1688000	1690000	Like John Cusack.
1690000	1691000	It starts raining.
1691000	1693000	Once I get to it, I'll decide what I do.
1693000	1698000	I'm allowing you to do your action on this turn because you've taken the luck damage.
1698000	1699000	So what's your luck at now?
1699000	1700000	Uh, down to 35.
1700000	1705000	Cause I was, I was at 45 then 35 then I gained luck back and now I'm down again.
1705000	1710000	So, uh, this radio has been ratcheted to the back of this four wheeler as to not fall off.
1710000	1711000	What do you do?
1711000	1714000	I want to take the butt of my gun and smash a tube on it.
1714000	1716000	Fuck yeah dude.
1716000	1729080	As soon as you do that, this noise just, oh shit.
1729080	1736560	And pastor Adam Kane reaches in the side bag of this four wheeler, grabs a fish out and
1736560	1743900	squeezes it so hard that it completely busts into two separate halfs above his head.
1743900	1750500	Tail end falls on one side, head falls on the other, and you see just guts and sin like
1750500	1752700	all this like what's inside a fish guys?
1752700	1753700	Guts.
1753700	1754700	Oh bones.
1754700	1755700	Tiny little bones.
1755700	1756700	Yeah.
1756700	1760260	Guts and tiny little fish bones kind of fall onto the helmet and immediately the light
1760260	1763060	on his helmet turns green.
1763060	1764060	Everybody roll power.
1764060	1767060	Oh yes little bitch.
1767100	1774100	20 on 50.
1774100	1775100	Six.
1775100	1778100	I pass a 35 on a 60.
1778100	1781100	I rolled a 57, which is a success.
1781100	1782100	Oh shit.
1782100	1785100	Oh god damn it.
1785100	1787100	I hate contested rules.
1787100	1791100	Damn it.
1791100	1796860	Your perceptions begin to change, but this time you can literally watch it happen.
1797060	1809860	Let's see, everybody take off your headphones except for Joe.
1809860	1813740	What is the moment that Clark most regrets?
1813740	1815400	Oh fuck dude.
1815400	1819700	I've got three that I can think of.
1819700	1822420	And that's just off the top of my head, I bet there's a lot.
1822420	1828660	I mean recently it's for sure the revelation of how I fucked up getting the Cain family
1828660	1830860	out of the van.
1830860	1834140	That would 100% be the one that he latches onto.
1834140	1835140	Okay.
1835140	1839500	Yeah that's a recent one that has been newly opened in his mind, like he didn't regret
1839500	1840840	that until recently.
1840840	1843460	Now it's a big, big deal.
1843460	1849560	Clark your gun is aimed at this four wheeler and immediately the four wheeler is a minivan
1849560	1854080	and it's turned over and it's on fire and it's still in this mud basin.
1854080	1855740	It's still right there.
1855740	1860900	But then you hear these screams and you remember hearing these screams.
1860900	1866600	The van explodes and you are rushing toward it and you're back on the concrete, you're
1866600	1870800	on the main drag heading north out of contention.
1870800	1876320	But there's nothing you can do to stop it and then you're watching this child being
1876320	1880400	taken off on a stretcher into the back of an ambulance.
1880400	1882400	Roll sanity.
1882400	1890640	Oh my god, I fail 97 way the fuck over my power.
1890640	1891640	Oh yeah, 100%.
1891640	1892640	Oh no!
1892640	1893640	Oh boy.
1893640	1912680	So Thomas, what is the moment so far that John Lee Pettymore regrets most?
1912680	1922400	Multiple images flash before him, but because of the recent slayings of the ashers, he pictures
1922400	1924360	the vacuuming of their children.
1924360	1932160	Yes, and literally floating above this four wheeler, two children holding on to each other
1932160	1934640	and it's the exact scene that you remember.
1934640	1942240	They're holding on to this man, unkempt hair, wearing these rubber waders.
1942240	1947260	You know him as James the mill worker and they're trying to hold on to him and you're
1947260	1954100	trying to hold on to them but they're floating away above Bean's Pond and they're just floating
1954100	1963220	up and then all at once you see behind them the sky envelopes out and opens this massive
1963220	1970340	hole and coming out of it is just like an oil spray of this ooze but it's coming at
1970340	1977460	you horizontally and it grabs onto them and in this weird whirlwind slowly, slowly pulls
1977460	1981860	them like they're in a balloon almost.
1981860	1987340	Like if a person was in a balloon trying desperately to get out, you see their hands and their
1987340	1995340	feet kicking, kicking and trying to get out and then they just out of existence.
1995340	1996340	Roll sanity.
1996340	1998900	Can I also roll deception?
1998940	2002860	Well, it's not a skill but...
2002860	2004140	Persuade.
2004140	2006820	That's not John's biggest regret.
2006820	2009140	What's John's biggest regret?
2009140	2011140	It's fucking up his racing career.
2011140	2016340	He doesn't give a shit about any of this.
2016340	2018480	Like deeply.
2018480	2021820	This is kind of just happening to him right now?
2021820	2022820	Roll sanity motherfucker.
2022820	2024820	We'll see what happens.
2024820	2025820	Hold on.
2025820	2030020	Oh, why do I even need... no, 56 doesn't pass.
2030020	2031820	Of course not.
2031820	2037840	And so as this blinks out, you kind of shake it off and then the four wheeler down below
2037840	2043820	turns into your sprint car that you wrecked and you see across the way where there once
2043820	2053400	was Casey Kristoff holding a gun to the back of Kerry Page's head, you see little Elvis
2053480	2061480	Duncan's Jr. and his face is split wide open, there's blood running down it.
2061480	2064480	Oh no.
2064480	2070480	Oh fuck.
2070480	2071480	And you know...
2071480	2074280	Oh god.
2074280	2081600	You know 100% that if your defective safety harness hadn't taken his eye from him, blood
2081600	2087560	begins to kind of like continue to pour down, you see that where his eye should be, there's
2087560	2095560	just a skin grave.
2095560	2101440	Like if a melon baller was made of skin, you'd be looking into its scoop.
2101440	2107880	A skin grave.
2107880	2110600	You had me, but then you went too far.
2110600	2116600	That's what I'm here for.
2116600	2126600	Y'all were having a bunch of laughs for your worst regret.
2126600	2136160	Luke, what's Keith Vigna's biggest regret?
2136160	2144400	Keith Vigna's biggest regret is changing his name and moving towns and becoming a cop instead
2144400	2149440	of just facing the embarrassment of being beans and going to work for his brother.
2149440	2157280	So you're standing over this now defunct radio and you're looking at Pastor Adam Kane who
2157280	2162160	has just smeared fish all over this old motorcycle helmet.
2162160	2168320	The four wheeler is surrounded by children who are all wearing party hats and they're
2168320	2174800	all chanting, beans, beans, Keith, beans his only friends are figurines, beans, beans,
2174800	2179040	Keith, beans will blow your friends to smithereens.
2179040	2189440	And you turn back and you see Ferguson standing where Clark and John just were and he's wearing
2189440	2195920	his beautiful suit, it's got a rose on his lapel and you look back at these birthday
2195920	2204560	party clad children and instead you see a life, a life at Bar Corp.
2204560	2206200	What would that look like for Keith?
2206200	2214920	It'd be upper management, failed up to upper management, nepotism, nice house with a dog
2214920	2223280	that he sees and takes care of, a wife probably and spends the weekends barbecuing at Ferguson's
2223280	2225880	house and our children play together.
2225880	2232800	And you think about all that and then you just see the inside of a room at Hotel Motel
2232800	2237200	and you're just sitting at the edge of the bed by yourself.
2237200	2238200	Roll sanity.
2238200	2248680	35 on a 8.
2248680	2250280	Everybody roll a D4.
2250280	2251680	Oh no.
2251680	2252680	2.
2252680	2253680	1.
2253680	2254680	1.
2254680	2258040	Alright, John loses 2, Clark and Keith both lose 1 sanity.
2258040	2262360	I probably shouldn't bring this up but are we still doing the D4 plus 1?
2262360	2269240	Alright, no, cause that was a 1 slash 1 D4 so if you would have, no fuck that was, yeah
2269240	2271720	no that would make sense for that to be the thing.
2271720	2272720	No.
2272720	2274400	Just keep it in mind for the future.
2274400	2279440	We didn't talk about that on the normal show.
2279440	2283400	It was if you had passed sanity and you were supposed to take damage no matter what.
2283400	2285480	This one would have been that.
2285480	2288400	I just wasn't paying attention so you got off.
2288400	2289400	Cool.
2289400	2291240	Well but we all failed though, right?
2291240	2292240	Yes.
2292240	2297200	So we have it written down as 1 slash 1 D4 is the sanity damage.
2297200	2302840	Which would mean 1 if you pass slash 1 D4 if you fail because that's 1 up to 4.
2302840	2307480	So it should have been according to the Patreon rule that I made 1 D4 plus 1.
2307480	2310360	Which thank you Luke and I will remember moving forward.
2310360	2311360	It's very kind of you.
2311360	2319920	So, I am about to roll a D4, pretty important D4, cause it's how many rounds this lasted.
2319920	2320920	Oh wow.
2320920	2321920	Roll a 1.
2321920	2323080	Yeah roll a 1.
2323080	2324440	Oh he just rolled it.
2324440	2325640	It's a 1.
2325640	2327560	It's our word against his.
2327560	2333940	If everybody else says it right now that it's all him, it's my dudes.
2333940	2337320	He's moved his camera into a perfect position.
2337320	2338320	What is it?
2338320	2339320	It's a 2.
2339320	2340320	It's a 2.
2340320	2341320	Could be worse.
2341320	2342320	I'll take it.
2342320	2344240	Even though we also saw him roll that 1.
2344240	2348280	He rolled a 1 and then said no no no and then he cut that audio out.
2348280	2354600	He's gonna have to do a lot of that this episode.
2354600	2356400	I'm real sorry buddy.
2356400	2357800	I hope you know how much I love you.
2357800	2361080	I've been taking Prozac for 3 years.
2361080	2363800	Does that make you love people?
2363800	2364800	No Prozac.
2364800	2365800	Guys he's pro me.
2365800	2366800	Oh look at him.
2366800	2367800	He really liked it.
2367800	2368800	I really liked it too.
2368800	2369800	It's so dumb.
2369800	2372800	It was good.
2372800	2376040	And I should have thought of it like years ago but I just thought of it when I was in
2376040	2377720	the kitchen like 10 minutes ago.
2377720	2378800	That was really good.
2378800	2382680	It obviously took me a second but thumbs up.
2382680	2389960	I wanted to wait until I could see you in person but I couldn't.
2389960	2392600	None of my medications have any fun jokes.
2392600	2398480	I have my friends names in them.
2398480	2399480	Celexa.
2399480	2402760	I don't know anyone named Alexa.
2402760	2404240	Celexa wasn't good for me.
2404240	2405960	It's working for me.
2405960	2406960	Vitamin B.
2407200	2409200	Your friend Tim.
2409200	2410200	What?
2410200	2411200	I know.
2411200	2415200	It's not in there but it sounds like it could be.
2415200	2416200	Vitatim.
2416200	2417200	Vitimin.
2417200	2418200	Wow.
2418200	2428520	I'm a big fan of John Boyega's character from Star Wars because I be pro Finn.
2428520	2429520	Wow.
2429520	2432480	That's basically mine.
2432480	2435480	I thought that's what we were doing.
2436000	2437000	Doxycycline.
2437000	2442000	I want none more for anything.
2442000	2443000	Doxycycline.
2443000	2446000	I just rolled not one.
2446000	2447000	Uh oh.
2447000	2448000	I'm frozen.
2448000	2449000	Can you hear me?
2449000	2451000	It's a contested roll.
2451000	2453000	Let's all roll higher than that.
2453000	2454000	Can you guys hear me?
2454000	2455000	Oh no.
2455000	2456000	No way.
2456000	2457000	Oh shit.
2457000	2458000	I can hear you guys still.
2458000	2459000	You're back.
2459000	2460000	You're back.
2460000	2461000	Okay.
2461000	2462000	I could hear you the whole time.
2462000	2463000	It was just frozen.
2463520	2464520	Okay.
2464520	2465520	Yay.
2465520	2466520	That was scary.
2466520	2467520	That was scary.
2467520	2468520	Yeah.
2468520	2469520	Thank goodness.
2469520	2470520	Knock on wood.
2470520	2471520	My internet hasn't been out in three days.
2471520	2472520	So.
2472520	2473520	Shit.
2473520	2474520	I knock on that floor for you.
2474520	2475520	Okay.
2475520	2476520	I forgot what we're waiting on.
2476520	2477520	Oh, two rounds.
2477520	2478520	He rolled a one for something.
2478520	2479520	Oh guys.
2479520	2480520	That not one really changed this entire situation.
2480520	2481520	As your realities begin flooding back and your senses match your actual surroundings,
2481520	2482520	you can hear Carrie Andrews.
2482520	2483520	Carrie Andrews.
2483520	2484520	Carrie Andrews.
2484520	2485520	Carrie Andrews.
2485520	2486520	Carrie Andrews.
2486520	2487520	Carrie Andrews.
2487520	2488520	Carrie Andrews.
2488520	2489520	Carrie Andrews.
2489520	2490520	Carrie Andrews.
2491040	2496720	You can hear Carrie Andrews still hollering across the muddy divide.
2496720	2498400	Don't you give them shit, boys.
2498400	2499460	You hear me?
2499460	2503400	Don't you give them anything but the cold graves they deserve.
2503400	2509240	Clark, you see Casey Kristoff is still in the same position, pistol to the back of the
2509240	2512760	head of blindfolded inside out Drew Carey.
2512760	2518560	John, you immediately realize you are no longer holding your gun.
2518600	2524280	Looking down, you see agent Trent Catt has not only knocked your weapon from your hand,
2524280	2530160	but also ejected the magazine and is trying to grab the ammo with his mouth.
2530160	2537820	Keith, you are being held under your arms, behind your neck, feet dragging in the mud
2537820	2545560	in front of you as pastor Adam Cain hauls you toward the impassable metal plate.
2545560	2552640	And as these two men approach the partially buried door, you all see that it begins sliding
2552640	2554640	open.
2554640	2559920	Oh, in trouble.
2575560	2583560	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
2583560	2594560	How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
2594560	2598560	There's no time to go.
2598560	2606560	No time to go.
2606560	2609560	Time to fly, time to stream.
