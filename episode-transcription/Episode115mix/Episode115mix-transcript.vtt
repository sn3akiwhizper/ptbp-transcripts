WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
Greetings, friends.

00:02.840 --> 00:06.160
It's your BFF, WTD.

00:06.160 --> 00:10.160
BFF means beefy, funny friend.

00:10.160 --> 00:15.160
And a WTD means wet-tongued doggy.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.080
You're welcome.

00:17.080 --> 00:22.080
TTYL, time to yell loudly.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.640
There is a new howlin' with Wolf,

00:24.640 --> 00:29.200
and that makes my nasty old heart always burst with love.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.960
This howlin' with Wolf is from Distant Egg Song,

00:32.960 --> 00:36.600
location, Houston, they write.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.320
Thanks much to the trash slurpin' host with the most.

00:40.320 --> 00:44.160
Always glad to hear your voice on the airwaves.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.980
This goes out to Tamantha in St. Louis.

00:48.980 --> 00:52.960
Hey, Vinnie, glad you turned me on to this podcast.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.120
It made my 2020 better.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.360
Regarding your question, I checked in Ma's recipe book.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.280
The way to render the sacrificial,

01:02.280 --> 01:05.400
purulent goo from a gamer's flesh

01:05.400 --> 01:09.280
is to go low and slow for a minimum of eight hours.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.080
Glad to see you and Vinnie and Galina.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.920
Let's do it again soon.

01:13.920 --> 01:18.080
Your brother from the Venuccia mother, Vinnie.

01:18.080 --> 01:22.160
Mmm, damn, that recipe sounds

01:22.200 --> 01:27.200
abso-fuckin'-lutely tasty, scrumptious, unctuous.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.280
I must visit this all-mother

01:32.280 --> 01:36.260
and exchange my forbidden recipes with them.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.840
If you wanna write up somethin'

01:37.840 --> 01:41.300
for your BFF forever, Wolf to Hal,

01:41.300 --> 01:43.360
you can go fuck yourself.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.680
Ha ha ha, I'm just kiddin'.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.360
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, I got some hot news.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.760
I have it on good authority

01:50.760 --> 01:55.080
that this here is the second of two Q&A sessions

01:55.080 --> 01:58.680
to wrap up season one of somethin'.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.600
And I have it on even better authority

02:00.600 --> 02:05.600
that next Friday on November 5th, ha ha, shucks, for real,

02:05.600 --> 02:08.380
am I gonna have to say some corny, stankin',

02:08.380 --> 02:11.280
remember, remember nonsense?

02:11.280 --> 02:14.640
V might be for vendetta to some folks,

02:14.640 --> 02:19.640
but to me, V is for volumizing shampoo and conditioners.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.600
And beginning next Friday, November 5th,

02:23.600 --> 02:26.560
we will have a guest seated at the head of the table.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.260
You might know him as the rules lawyer

02:29.260 --> 02:33.360
on the Glass Cannon Network star finder program

02:33.360 --> 02:35.280
Androids and Aliens.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.680
And if you don't, you'll get to know David Winters

02:38.680 --> 02:41.880
as the handler of pretending to be people

02:41.880 --> 02:45.040
for the next five weeks

02:45.040 --> 02:49.320
as he runs Joe, Luke, Thomas, and some idiot named Zack

02:49.840 --> 02:52.240
through a classic Delta Green scenario.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.480
Get ready for an absolute mess, y'all.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.200
And finally, get ready for ol' Wolfie

02:58.200 --> 03:00.320
to be an absolute mess.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.920
It's time to say goodbye to a brand new song.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.400
This premiere will be the last time I play it here

03:07.400 --> 03:12.400
on the main feed of 694.2 PTBP.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.240
So if you want to hear this infant baby

03:15.240 --> 03:17.400
of a banger ever again,

03:17.400 --> 03:20.760
you actually have tons of options.

03:20.760 --> 03:25.280
One of which is just Google cuts you with no backbone.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.040
Luke, you have a question for Justin?

03:58.040 --> 04:01.280
Oh yeah, did you see the article came out today

04:01.280 --> 04:04.640
or just the story of Chokin'?

04:04.640 --> 04:05.480
No.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.060
Yeah, Chokin' on Deez Nuts.

04:08.880 --> 04:09.880
Got him!

04:09.880 --> 04:10.720
He didn't get him.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.560
He didn't say Chokin'.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.380
He didn't say it.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.640
Yeah, but I did.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.480
I got you.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.320
Yeah, he got you.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.720
He got you to say Chokin' on Deez Nuts.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.680
Yeah, I got you to say it.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.240
And then I wasn't a participant.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.840
Reverse got him!

04:23.840 --> 04:24.900
Reverse got him.

04:26.040 --> 04:26.880
I got got.

04:26.880 --> 04:27.700
Thanks, Joe.

04:29.240 --> 04:32.600
Someone in the UX industry, user experience industry

04:32.600 --> 04:35.280
was telling me that like a lot of people she works with

04:35.280 --> 04:37.240
no longer use Photoshop.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.320
They use a program called Figma.

04:41.440 --> 04:46.440
And I just had to like, be like, yeah, wow, interesting.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.660
Because it's not a person I could say Figma balls to.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.120
You know what?

04:56.120 --> 05:00.760
We fucked around pretty hard last time.

05:00.760 --> 05:05.320
And then it took us a long time to get into the questions.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.460
And this time took a long time for y'all to find out.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.080
I have a bad story first.

05:11.080 --> 05:11.920
You want to hear it?

05:11.920 --> 05:12.740
I do want to hear it.

05:12.740 --> 05:13.580
Let's fuck around.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.800
Let's fuck around.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.080
So whenever we were clapping,

05:18.080 --> 05:21.160
I forgot that I had stabbed my hand with a steak knife

05:21.160 --> 05:23.120
earlier this week.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.640
Why did you do that?

05:24.640 --> 05:25.480
Oh, wow.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.540
I have a hole in my hand.

05:26.540 --> 05:27.380
Shit.

05:27.380 --> 05:28.200
Wait, I didn't see it.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.520
So that first clap, I clapped and like almost went.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.120
Yeah, show us your hand hole again, please.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.240
It's hard to see.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.080
Hold it over to the screen.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.040
It's like, Zach doesn't know how to use Windows.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.360
Yeah, oh.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.180
How'd you do that?

05:40.180 --> 05:41.640
It doesn't look that bad.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.480
It's deep.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.760
I was trying to split two hash browns apart

05:48.760 --> 05:50.600
that were frozen with a steak knife.

05:50.720 --> 05:54.840
And I was holding them in my hand

05:54.840 --> 05:59.840
where the knife, when it pierced through, would stab me.

05:59.880 --> 06:03.160
And I literally went, I shouldn't be doing this.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.720
And as I said that, it's spiraling.

06:05.720 --> 06:06.960
Nice.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.040
Like without much pressure at all.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.280
And I just like stabbed into my hand

06:12.280 --> 06:13.880
and I just was like, oh man.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.960
The fact that you were sober when you did this.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.060
Oh, it was an afternoon, yeah.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.000
So you were drinking for a few hours at that point.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.960
I'd been gone for hours, you know, a Tuesday afternoon.

06:27.960 --> 06:28.840
Yeah, Tuesday afternoon.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.920
So this is, you woke up and this was like

06:30.920 --> 06:32.680
a midnight snack, almost.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.800
And yeah, and luckily I was okay,

06:36.800 --> 06:40.580
but I did see some hand chicken meat, as I like to call it.

06:40.580 --> 06:44.240
Cause if you've ever like sliced chicken,

06:44.240 --> 06:46.080
where it like kind of the muscle kind of split,

06:46.080 --> 06:47.720
I did a little bit of that,

06:47.720 --> 06:49.160
which was very fun to look at.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.520
And I was like, oh man, that's bad.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.520
You guys make chicken different than I do.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.320
You ever split your chicken meat, bro?

06:56.320 --> 06:58.200
You might not have seen the inside of your hand.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.120
It's chickeny.

06:59.120 --> 06:59.960
Oh.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.960
Have you ever seen the inside of your body?

07:03.960 --> 07:05.680
Yeah, yeah.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.700
Yeah, I've had some x-rays done.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.880
I suppose I've seen the inside of my body.

07:09.880 --> 07:10.800
Technically, yeah.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.640
Yeah.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.040
I go with Zach to his colonoscopy and take a gander.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.860
Yeah, I do want it.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.280
I'm Zach's second opinion.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.040
I'm like, nah, I think there's something wrong.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.880
That looks, doesn't look normal.

07:21.880 --> 07:22.720
Pollip.

07:23.920 --> 07:24.760
It's a pollip.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.000
That's a pollip. Is that a Pokemon?

07:27.000 --> 07:27.900
That's so cute.

07:27.900 --> 07:28.740
Yeah.

07:29.640 --> 07:33.820
Sir, it's, we try to get the patients as clean as possible,

07:33.820 --> 07:34.960
but it's clearly shit.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.200
You can see the corn.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.360
Yeah, that's a pollip.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.200
Wake him up, tell him.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.440
You gotta wake him up because they put you in a daze.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.240
It's a real a pollip of daisy.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.120
Oh my God.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.520
Pollip of daisy.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.040
What?

07:51.040 --> 07:51.860
Do we have any questions?

07:51.860 --> 07:52.700
All of them.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.240
The bollard asks, what the fuck?

07:57.240 --> 07:58.200
Fuck you too.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.840
I think what the fuck is an appropriate question.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.760
Yeah, that was my first question to you.

08:06.760 --> 08:07.680
To what we've done.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.160
When you stop the recording, it's the last episode.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.000
Oh yeah.

08:11.000 --> 08:11.820
I think that's what I said.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.840
I think that is what you said at the end of season one.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.160
The fuck?

08:15.160 --> 08:17.440
I mean, it's just a small town mystery.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.680
Just a small town mystery.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.040
They also asked, will we ever find out the backstory

08:28.040 --> 08:29.800
of Wolf the dog?

08:29.800 --> 08:32.080
I mean, we've had at least a-

08:32.080 --> 08:32.920
There's a little bit.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.240
We learned a little bit.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.840
If you can, if you're, you know.

08:36.840 --> 08:37.680
If you're smart.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.720
Pretty clever, but yeah, you can,

08:39.720 --> 08:41.160
all of Wolf the dog is in there.

08:41.160 --> 08:43.160
So go back, re-listen, get those numbers up.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.920
Definitely re-listen and get those numbers up.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.760
Actually, at the Patreon $100 tier,

08:48.760 --> 08:51.520
I will call you on Discord and tell you.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.520
You have to be subscribed for two years.

08:55.520 --> 08:59.360
It's patreon.com slash Justin wants money.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.520
Yeah, alternatively, you can Venmo Justin $200.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.960
If you listen to the 694.2 PTBP Pledge Drive episode,

09:10.960 --> 09:15.960
you can see at least the story of Wolf the dog.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.200
Yeah, there's some slight origin story in there.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.040
That's how he comes into the studio.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.320
He's a great DJ who loves eating trash

09:23.320 --> 09:25.240
and I don't know why it needs to be any more than that.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.080
Yup.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.840
Celery Top asks, to do hakenu.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.080
To do hakenu to you as well, son.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.280
Nerds, cling as they cling on.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.400
To do hakenu are true words of power,

09:37.440 --> 09:39.680
but how did you come up with vis-a-girl

09:39.680 --> 09:41.760
and shuck-a-tee-felicia?

09:41.760 --> 09:42.880
Asked and answered.

09:42.880 --> 09:43.720
Asked and answered.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.040
We went over this one last time,

09:45.040 --> 09:47.920
but hey, Celery Top, we like what you do.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.760
You've done some sick art.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.400
Exactly, pasted it again in the Google document.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.920
I think Celery Top did the Contention Trucks artwork,

09:55.920 --> 09:59.360
which is fucking rad, yeah.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.360
Abadfeeling asks, question,

10:02.360 --> 10:04.960
what was up with the feet eating?

10:04.960 --> 10:06.160
I'm curious about that too.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.800
No, I was gonna ask you, Joe, if you had an idea.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.120
My only theory,

10:10.120 --> 10:11.800
and I don't know if these guys know this yet,

10:11.800 --> 10:14.880
that was how I was introduced to that light plane world

10:14.880 --> 10:17.400
with the jibugabuntubus, and-

10:17.400 --> 10:18.240
You can say it.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.600
It was a jagant umbropithecus.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.120
It was a xenonimatoh that they attached to my foot

10:23.120 --> 10:24.280
to send me there.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.200
And so I assume it's maybe covering up evidence

10:26.200 --> 10:27.640
of those scars on,

10:27.640 --> 10:30.200
he kept mentioning that scar on my foot.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.200
I assume it was maybe covering that up in some way,

10:32.200 --> 10:35.200
but I wasn't sure why they needed to consume it.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.480
I didn't know what was up with that.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.800
They had to do it.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.640
All right.

10:38.640 --> 10:43.120
And I mean, did you have a reason at the time

10:43.120 --> 10:44.520
beyond it's real spooky?

10:44.520 --> 10:46.680
Yes, it was simply what Joe said,

10:46.680 --> 10:48.900
that it is a thing that shows

10:48.900 --> 10:50.840
that you have been at the circle of knowledge.

10:50.840 --> 10:53.120
And if you were a Delta Green agent

10:53.120 --> 10:54.640
and you were like cleaning up

10:54.640 --> 10:56.720
after like a mission or something,

10:56.720 --> 10:59.160
and one of the parts of the mission

10:59.160 --> 11:02.840
was that certain people had this crazy scar

11:02.840 --> 11:04.600
on the bottom of their left foot,

11:04.880 --> 11:06.960
then yeah, you'd cut it off and-

11:06.960 --> 11:07.800
Feed it to them.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.640
Like you do.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.480
Okay, but Chief Maggie Cook had some serious issues

11:12.480 --> 11:14.140
with James the Mill Worker specifically,

11:14.140 --> 11:15.800
because James the Mill Worker

11:15.800 --> 11:18.200
clearly had issues with Chief Maggie Cook

11:18.200 --> 11:19.680
and his own blood,

11:19.680 --> 11:22.160
if you would have tested the blood at his house

11:22.160 --> 11:24.420
that spelled out stop her,

11:24.420 --> 11:25.920
that was James the Mill Worker's blood

11:25.920 --> 11:28.640
because he knew that Chief Maggie Cook

11:28.640 --> 11:31.200
was going down this dark path.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.080
Hold on, tested with the Advanced Crime Lab

11:34.520 --> 11:36.820
at the contention police station?

11:36.820 --> 11:37.660
Yeah.

11:37.660 --> 11:39.980
Drew Andrews is a-

11:39.980 --> 11:40.820
Vampire.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.680
He's a vampire and you just give him a little blood.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.520
I forgot about it.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.440
He licks it.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.280
He laps it up.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.560
And then he goes,

11:47.560 --> 11:50.640
and his head vibrates and shakes around

11:50.640 --> 11:52.080
and then he blows blood.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.600
James the Mill Worker's blood.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.880
And then he tells you who's blood it was.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.840
We kept forgetting to take advantage of that.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.240
You guys are idiots.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.560
Compliment and question from a bad feeling,

12:02.560 --> 12:05.440
the various theme songs for the show's various arcs

12:05.440 --> 12:08.500
strike me as something very cool this show does

12:08.500 --> 12:13.500
that other TTRPG podcasts don't do.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.620
Will this continue in season two?

12:15.620 --> 12:16.460
Yes.

12:16.460 --> 12:17.600
Any bangers picked out yet?

12:19.120 --> 12:19.960
No bangers.

12:19.960 --> 12:20.920
No bangers picked out.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.280
Circling some?

12:22.280 --> 12:23.120
We're circling.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.360
We're circling.

12:24.360 --> 12:28.400
How did you pick the songs and where did you find them?

12:28.400 --> 12:32.060
We chose the song so far from bands

12:32.420 --> 12:35.620
that either we know or have seen live.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.500
Yeah, Springfield bands for the most part.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.100
Springfield bands that we're into, yeah.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.780
Connected to the region at the least, yeah.

12:41.780 --> 12:42.700
For sure.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.760
Justin and I were in a band

12:45.760 --> 12:49.500
and we played with Blue False Indigo

12:49.500 --> 12:52.580
and that's kind of how we met them

12:52.580 --> 12:54.580
and who else was on the show?

12:55.580 --> 12:57.340
We played with Dream Girl and Kudzu before too.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.540
That's right, yeah.

12:58.580 --> 13:03.180
And Kudzu, who you might know from a song

13:03.180 --> 13:04.860
that we've used a couple of times on the show

13:04.860 --> 13:08.300
called No Backbone, the lead singer of that band

13:08.300 --> 13:11.060
is a very good promoter in Springfield

13:11.060 --> 13:13.220
who always makes sure that bands coming through

13:13.220 --> 13:14.760
are well taken care of,

13:14.760 --> 13:16.340
that they have a good place to sleep

13:16.340 --> 13:17.540
and that they get paid.

13:17.540 --> 13:20.900
So we were happy to promote Kudzu, yeah,

13:20.900 --> 13:23.200
which No Backbone's a fucking banger.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.580
The rest of the songs, I mean,

13:24.580 --> 13:26.420
we've got Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin,

13:26.420 --> 13:29.880
who's just a fucking staple of the Springfield scene.

13:29.880 --> 13:33.060
We've all seen them countless times, I would imagine.

13:33.060 --> 13:33.900
More than any other band.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.740
Joe and I's band have played with them a couple of times,

13:36.740 --> 13:39.700
not to dunk on y'all's bands.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.780
And then who else do we have?

13:42.780 --> 13:46.740
Grady P. Drug, who is just an excellent musician.

13:46.740 --> 13:49.500
We saw him a couple of weekends ago actually

13:49.500 --> 13:51.540
and he was phenomenal.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.300
A Dragon in Three, which is an offshoot

13:54.300 --> 13:56.820
of Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin, yeah.

13:56.820 --> 13:59.920
And they are an incredible little outfit

13:59.920 --> 14:03.240
who I am always stoked to throw them on.

14:03.240 --> 14:06.340
And I'm looking forward to new music from them, hopefully.

14:06.340 --> 14:08.260
Creek Rocks are some friends of mine

14:08.260 --> 14:09.980
and they've got a residency right now

14:09.980 --> 14:11.220
down in Silver Dollar City.

14:11.220 --> 14:12.540
Oh, no shit.

14:12.540 --> 14:13.380
Go check them out.

14:13.380 --> 14:14.860
That's super rad.

14:14.860 --> 14:15.980
That's probably coming to an end soon

14:15.980 --> 14:16.820
as the weather changes.

14:16.820 --> 14:19.060
I think they play in an outdoor amphitheater, but yeah.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.080
Creek Rocks, that song rules.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.620
We've been really happy, I think,

14:22.620 --> 14:24.180
with all the songs that we've been able to play.

14:24.940 --> 14:25.780
Do they have any pants left?

14:25.780 --> 14:26.620
To throw on the show.

14:27.580 --> 14:31.380
Wow, that is a deep cut from Luke talking about...

14:31.380 --> 14:32.800
There's a ride at Silver Dollar City

14:32.800 --> 14:34.020
called Fire in the Hole.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.100
Oh, yes, I should have got it.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.140
God dang it.

14:37.140 --> 14:39.500
And as you go through this ride,

14:39.500 --> 14:40.820
Luke, do you want to describe?

14:40.820 --> 14:42.940
Yeah, it's called, did you say what it's called?

14:42.940 --> 14:44.600
It's called Fire in the Hole.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.160
And you ride through and basically

14:47.160 --> 14:48.860
you just see a bunch of stuff.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.660
Like you see, is that the same one

14:50.660 --> 14:51.860
with like a prison escape or something?

14:51.860 --> 14:52.700
Oh, yeah.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.740
It's a town on fire.

14:54.620 --> 14:57.500
And the town is lit on fire by the...

14:57.500 --> 14:58.700
Bald Knobbers. Bald Knobbers.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.340
But they don't just light towns on fire, no.

15:01.340 --> 15:03.900
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

15:03.900 --> 15:04.740
At a certain...

15:04.740 --> 15:08.740
Yeah, I just hope you don't have any pants lying around.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.580
Why is that, Luke?

15:09.580 --> 15:13.340
Oh, because at one point in the ride you see a home.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.020
A home that is on fire.

15:15.020 --> 15:16.940
That's on fire and one of the guys

15:16.940 --> 15:18.580
is getting out of the home.

15:18.580 --> 15:19.700
He's hanging out the window.

15:19.700 --> 15:20.780
And she says...

15:20.780 --> 15:22.580
And he's wearing his long underwear.

15:23.540 --> 15:24.380
His nighttime clothes.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.780
And she says, whatever your name is,

15:26.780 --> 15:28.420
it's whatever his name is.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.500
Whatever your name is, get back in here

15:30.500 --> 15:31.980
and put on your pants.

15:31.980 --> 15:32.820
And he goes...

15:32.820 --> 15:33.640
And he says...

15:33.640 --> 15:35.020
I can't put on my pants.

15:35.020 --> 15:37.860
I ain't got no pants no more.

15:37.860 --> 15:40.620
The dang Bald Knobbers stole them.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.560
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.660
So that's just some local humor.

15:44.660 --> 15:45.980
We're trying to get local work.

15:45.980 --> 15:50.980
And blank a patch, shout out to blank a patch

15:51.420 --> 15:52.780
from NerdPoker.

15:52.780 --> 15:57.500
All right, so what was the fucking question?

15:57.500 --> 15:58.500
How do you pick the songs?

15:58.500 --> 15:59.340
Oh yeah, that was it.

15:59.340 --> 16:00.180
We answered it, good.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.060
Moving on.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.380
Black Moxa asks, congratulations.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.660
Oh, that's, thanks.

16:05.660 --> 16:09.300
Congratulations on excellent work across two continents.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.140
Thank you.

16:10.140 --> 16:10.960
Thank you.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.300
It was across three at one point,

16:12.300 --> 16:13.540
which I was super proud of

16:13.540 --> 16:15.460
when we had Scott Dorward playing with us.

16:15.460 --> 16:17.540
I bragged about that to people in my life

16:17.540 --> 16:20.380
that we were playing a game across three continents.

16:20.620 --> 16:21.460
That was cool.

16:21.460 --> 16:22.280
That was dope.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.120
That was rad.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.320
We're cool as fuck.

16:25.940 --> 16:28.480
So were the time loops and resets

16:28.480 --> 16:30.320
always part of your story?

16:30.320 --> 16:31.160
We're the coolest people who do this.

16:31.160 --> 16:31.980
No.

16:35.380 --> 16:36.980
Or did you have to introduce them

16:36.980 --> 16:39.900
after the characters got into impossible situations?

16:39.900 --> 16:40.900
Yes.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.940
Also, how...

16:41.940 --> 16:43.100
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.780
Did the characters get into impossible situations

16:45.780 --> 16:48.780
or did little Zachy get into an impossible situation?

16:48.780 --> 16:50.260
Yes, also yes.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.020
Very much yes.

16:52.020 --> 16:55.580
It was my doing that I had opened up the story

16:55.580 --> 16:57.980
to too many avenues.

16:57.980 --> 16:59.120
And I thought to myself,

16:59.120 --> 17:01.960
how will I take them down these avenues?

17:01.960 --> 17:03.060
And then I thought, well...

17:03.060 --> 17:05.520
Time travel, the greatest cop out of them all.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.060
And the easiest to handle.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.780
Exactly, famously.

17:10.780 --> 17:15.540
I have this future version of one of Joe's characters

17:15.540 --> 17:18.780
that I can play with who might be able to do some stuff.

17:18.780 --> 17:20.420
Yeah, fucking nightmare, honestly.

17:20.420 --> 17:21.580
Never gonna do it again.

17:21.580 --> 17:25.000
And also, how is the create-a-campaign

17:25.000 --> 17:27.500
this community contributed to going?

17:27.500 --> 17:28.580
Fantastic question.

17:28.580 --> 17:29.500
Yeah, it's a great question.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.920
It's going really well.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.820
Frankie and, no, no, no, no, no, no, hang on,

17:34.820 --> 17:38.400
have compiled everything that everyone has written

17:38.400 --> 17:42.140
and voted on up into one document

17:42.140 --> 17:47.140
and it is slowly being whittled down into a playable game.

17:47.780 --> 17:52.780
And it'll be out in, oh, what, 2031.

17:53.180 --> 17:54.020
Yeah.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.380
It'll be playable.

17:55.380 --> 17:56.940
Let's not put it that close.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.540
Okay, yeah.

17:58.540 --> 18:01.380
We were shooting for the 10th anniversary of the finale.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.140
Yeah, let's push that right now, actually.

18:04.140 --> 18:05.940
2053.

18:05.940 --> 18:08.820
Yeah, no, that campaign is dope.

18:08.820 --> 18:12.660
And if these guys have forgotten enough

18:12.660 --> 18:14.180
of what they might've read

18:14.180 --> 18:16.820
from what people wrote about that campaign,

18:17.340 --> 18:19.180
I would definitely be interested

18:19.180 --> 18:20.940
in running some form of that.

18:20.940 --> 18:22.240
I purposely didn't read a lot of it

18:22.240 --> 18:24.340
because I thought we played it at some point.

18:24.340 --> 18:27.060
Hey, guys, it's really fucking scary and cool.

18:27.060 --> 18:30.060
So I would be interested in using,

18:30.060 --> 18:33.280
maybe even just using parts of it to create a one-shot.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.120
What's up, Thomas?

18:34.120 --> 18:35.420
This is the first time I've even heard of it.

18:35.420 --> 18:36.740
Oh, right, perfect.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.820
The modest light.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.660
I've read as much as Thomas has.

18:40.660 --> 18:41.820
I knew about it.

18:42.340 --> 18:46.220
The modest light says,

18:46.220 --> 18:47.820
thanks for doing such great work.

18:47.820 --> 18:48.820
Hey, thanks.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.140
Honestly, it's been great

18:50.140 --> 18:52.100
just listening to you guys improv together.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.500
I felt like I've learned a lot

18:54.500 --> 18:57.540
about how to keep the jokes rolling in my own life

18:58.420 --> 19:02.740
just by analyzing how you all do it.

19:02.740 --> 19:03.580
Sit you on a bad path.

19:03.580 --> 19:04.620
Dangerous ground.

19:04.620 --> 19:06.300
Yeah, you're on thin ice, my friend.

19:06.300 --> 19:09.620
And let me tell you,

19:09.660 --> 19:11.500
you better walk back right now

19:11.500 --> 19:13.960
for the sake of your relationships.

19:13.960 --> 19:14.800
Yeah.

19:14.800 --> 19:15.620
You don't want this.

19:15.620 --> 19:16.460
And your career.

19:16.460 --> 19:17.300
You don't want this.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.580
And a future podcast editor.

19:18.580 --> 19:19.540
We don't do this.

19:19.540 --> 19:20.380
Right.

19:20.380 --> 19:21.620
Yeah, all six of us have,

19:21.620 --> 19:23.940
or there's five of us, I have no, no.

19:23.940 --> 19:28.300
You okay?

19:28.300 --> 19:32.300
All five of us have four friends, so maybe two of them.

19:33.540 --> 19:37.660
My dude, I literally was answering that question.

19:37.660 --> 19:39.740
Like, I was like, well, wait,

19:39.740 --> 19:41.540
let's talk about what we mean by friends

19:41.540 --> 19:43.380
because I have four friends.

19:45.940 --> 19:47.820
I have tons of people that I like

19:47.820 --> 19:49.180
and that I'll talk to in public.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.980
It's the people on the pod, yeah.

19:54.540 --> 19:59.180
How did you guys know it was a good idea to start a podcast?

19:59.180 --> 20:01.020
And did you have any fears going in?

20:01.020 --> 20:03.380
These are the two questions.

20:03.380 --> 20:05.260
I was the one who brought it up, right?

20:05.260 --> 20:06.100
Probably, for sure.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.180
Yeah, you've been wanting to do it for a while

20:07.620 --> 20:09.100
and I don't know if that just stemmed out of the idea

20:09.100 --> 20:13.300
of recording the games themselves to listen back to.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.020
But we also, we were all listening

20:16.020 --> 20:17.820
to a bunch of role-playing podcasts.

20:17.820 --> 20:18.660
We were.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.180
And when I listened to a lot of music,

20:20.180 --> 20:21.460
I thought I could play music.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.820
And when I listened to a lot of actual play podcasts,

20:23.820 --> 20:25.580
I thought I could do that too, so.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.580
The thing about the actual play podcast

20:27.580 --> 20:29.780
is that we were getting together every week

20:29.780 --> 20:32.540
and being as funny or funnier than them.

20:34.780 --> 20:35.940
We're like, why not record it?

20:35.940 --> 20:38.260
At least enough that we thought we could do this.

20:38.260 --> 20:41.380
Yeah, it was enough to where when I brought it up,

20:41.380 --> 20:43.940
no one balked at the idea, except for Taylor,

20:43.940 --> 20:47.100
who was like, all right, this is my cue to bail.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.180
Yeah.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.020
We felt good.

20:49.020 --> 20:49.860
We all felt good playing together

20:49.860 --> 20:52.340
and we thought it might translate.

20:52.340 --> 20:55.180
We honestly didn't expect this.

20:55.180 --> 20:56.340
No, not at all.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.140
Thomas is shaking his head like I did.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.500
I did.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.780
He was shaking his head, no,

21:01.780 --> 21:03.900
don't put a nod in his mouth.

21:06.540 --> 21:07.380
Ooh.

21:09.820 --> 21:10.660
These nuts.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.180
Did you guys, you guys didn't have any fears?

21:12.180 --> 21:13.860
No, I didn't.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.220
Going in, I definitely did.

21:15.220 --> 21:18.180
But like after the first session, I was fine.

21:18.180 --> 21:20.580
Do you guys have any fears now?

21:20.580 --> 21:21.940
Oh yeah, there's so much more to lose.

21:21.940 --> 21:22.780
One fear.

21:22.780 --> 21:25.300
Yeah, my fear, my biggest fear is success.

21:27.460 --> 21:31.020
When we first hit record and when we slipped into it

21:31.020 --> 21:33.020
and we finally found that we were just playing

21:33.020 --> 21:35.180
at a table together, my fears were allayed.

21:35.580 --> 21:37.620
I remember that we have fun doing it either way.

21:37.620 --> 21:38.460
That's right.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.300
Exactly.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.140
And it helps we didn't release it for so long.

21:41.140 --> 21:41.980
Yes.

21:41.980 --> 21:43.220
We kind of touched a bit.

21:43.220 --> 21:45.220
So that was on that stream the other night.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.780
The stream the other night, yeah, yeah.

21:46.780 --> 21:49.940
But we, yeah, because we did record so many episodes

21:49.940 --> 21:52.980
before releasing them, it really did allow us

21:52.980 --> 21:57.540
to just put the game we were playing on the air.

21:57.540 --> 21:59.940
We were very comfortable with what we were doing

21:59.940 --> 22:02.140
at that point because it was just the same thing

22:02.140 --> 22:03.180
we'd always done, kind of.

22:03.180 --> 22:04.020
Yeah.

22:04.020 --> 22:06.300
I think that's a smart way to do any creative thing

22:06.300 --> 22:08.420
like that is to build up a little bit

22:08.420 --> 22:11.260
and then start releasing it so you're not scared

22:11.260 --> 22:15.020
immediately from poor results after one thing.

22:15.020 --> 22:15.860
It's like edging.

22:15.860 --> 22:17.420
How do you feel about edging, Justin?

22:17.420 --> 22:18.860
It's the only way.

22:18.860 --> 22:22.220
Brenner Nunez says, what was the balloon shirt?

22:27.340 --> 22:31.460
To quote the great Nicole Byer, I don't want to edge.

22:31.460 --> 22:33.940
If you start fucking me, you better make me cum.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.260
She went on Punch Up the Jam and she punched up the jam.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.700
She was on it.

22:46.700 --> 22:50.540
Bruno Nunez asks, what was the balloon shaped head kid

22:50.540 --> 22:52.500
from the JLP the Third Flashback?

22:52.500 --> 22:56.660
I mentioned a balloon shaped headed kid multiple times.

22:56.660 --> 22:57.740
He had very dark eyes.

22:57.740 --> 22:58.940
Who was it, Joe?

22:58.940 --> 23:00.900
It was Pastor Adam Kane.

23:00.900 --> 23:03.140
It was Pastor Adam Kane as a child.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.700
When we were listening to the episodes in real time

23:05.700 --> 23:08.700
and I got to my flashback, I had already

23:08.700 --> 23:11.860
played at that point a scene with Pastor Adam Kane

23:11.860 --> 23:14.820
and he described him exactly the same way.

23:14.820 --> 23:16.900
And I texted Zach, you son of a bitch.

23:16.900 --> 23:20.700
I know who the balloon head kid is.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.740
Yeah, that was a fun one.

23:21.740 --> 23:25.500
I thought you were just dunking on that poor kid.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.380
This balloon headed mommy stuck kid.

23:27.380 --> 23:29.860
So there's this balloon headed idiot next year.

23:29.860 --> 23:31.180
Did you have a flashback with him

23:31.180 --> 23:32.740
or was that just a mistake on their part?

23:32.740 --> 23:35.580
That is from the flashback of his father,

23:35.580 --> 23:39.260
John Lee Pettymore the Third, burning down the Kane home.

23:39.260 --> 23:41.220
When you put on the watch.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.780
Yeah, when John put on the watch,

23:42.780 --> 23:47.380
he saw his dad rescue him is one way of saying it.

23:47.380 --> 23:50.380
Steal him and burn down the house of his family

23:50.380 --> 23:52.020
is another way of saying it.

23:52.020 --> 23:55.020
The gherkin at Merlin's Merkin says,

23:56.020 --> 24:02.420
he says, will sweet boy Justin be a regular for season two

24:02.420 --> 24:05.140
or will he be banished back into the pit

24:05.140 --> 24:09.340
from whence he came until another uncle PC is introduced?

24:09.340 --> 24:11.180
The pit, the pit.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.900
Zach said I can't come out of the pit.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.660
Yeah, he's going to be, he's an uncle.

24:15.660 --> 24:18.260
He's an uncle forever.

24:18.260 --> 24:21.420
No, but we talked about that and it's just

24:21.420 --> 24:24.620
my schedule is going to be so freaking wacky with grad school

24:24.620 --> 24:27.900
crap, especially when we're going to start recording it.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.260
He already does side characters.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.220
He already makes all the music.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.060
You guys asked too much from him.

24:33.060 --> 24:35.380
And he's trying to escape from that pit.

24:35.380 --> 24:37.780
I'm trying, please.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.740
And Zach keeps putting, like digging,

24:39.740 --> 24:40.940
Zach's down there with me digging it.

24:40.940 --> 24:42.820
He keeps sending more grad school assignments down there

24:42.820 --> 24:45.460
and he's like, ah, you want to finish, don't you?

24:45.460 --> 24:48.700
No, but I think being a regular on top of all the extra stuff

24:48.700 --> 24:51.980
would for me right now would be just a little bit too much.

24:52.020 --> 24:55.140
Even though I've had a blast.

24:55.140 --> 24:57.260
If you do all my assignments, you'll

24:57.260 --> 25:00.180
finally earn your Zachster's degree one of these days.

25:00.180 --> 25:02.540
What'd you say?

25:02.540 --> 25:07.260
Alexia says, I love this format where I can just immediately

25:07.260 --> 25:10.340
move on to something else.

25:10.340 --> 25:13.580
Alexia says, thank you for making this amazing show.

25:13.580 --> 25:14.620
Thanks.

25:14.620 --> 25:17.700
It's been such a light these months.

25:17.700 --> 25:19.140
Thanks.

25:19.140 --> 25:20.340
You're welcome.

25:20.340 --> 25:24.500
Question, how do you manage to find so many amazing bands

25:24.500 --> 25:25.540
local to you?

25:25.540 --> 25:27.700
Well, it all dates back to the Ozarks Jubilee.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.900
You see?

25:29.900 --> 25:31.420
That's not, that's kind of a joke.

25:31.420 --> 25:32.100
That's also true.

25:32.100 --> 25:32.780
It's also true.

25:32.780 --> 25:34.380
It has a really cool musical history.

25:34.380 --> 25:36.300
And it's just been full of musical talent.

25:36.300 --> 25:39.100
We've had a burgeoning musical scene forever.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.380
And exactly, it does go back to the Jubilee.

25:41.380 --> 25:43.900
I saw this question earlier on.

25:43.900 --> 25:45.940
And I wanted to plug, there's a documentary out there

25:45.940 --> 25:46.420
right now.

25:46.420 --> 25:49.060
You can find it on thecenterofnowhere.com.

25:49.060 --> 25:51.620
And it's kind of about the history of Springfield music.

25:51.620 --> 25:52.700
It used to be on Amazon.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.140
But I think they had some weird thing where

25:54.140 --> 25:55.780
they took a bunch of documentaries down.

25:55.780 --> 25:57.300
But you can find it on that website.

25:57.300 --> 25:58.700
They're trying to hide the truth.

25:58.700 --> 26:02.100
They want to silence the truth of the Springfield music scene.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.900
Well, I also think, I don't know.

26:03.900 --> 26:07.380
Zach, did your parents also take you to a bunch of musical stuff?

26:07.380 --> 26:09.340
Because your parents do music stuff.

26:09.340 --> 26:10.580
And mine do.

26:10.580 --> 26:12.740
And Joe's do also.

26:12.740 --> 26:13.340
Yeah.

26:13.340 --> 26:14.740
My parents tried to make it.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.000
They put out a cassette.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.760
And they moved to Nashville before they had kids.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.640
And put out a Christian cassette tape.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.200
And opened up for some notable acts.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.080
But neither one of them have Grammys.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.120
Switchfoot.

26:31.120 --> 26:31.920
Oh, yeah.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.840
Does anybody's dad here have a Grammy?

26:33.840 --> 26:34.340
Yeah.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.400
He's like, my dad's a good old.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.740
I was like, you have to explain.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.080
He's a good, good piano player.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.440
He's a really good piano player.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.680
He's on an album that won Grammy.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.040
Or it was a folk album of the year, I believe it was.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.480
We should make our dads do a battle of the pianos

26:53.480 --> 26:54.400
against each other.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.760
My dad would kick your dad's ass.

26:55.760 --> 26:56.800
Yeah, I'm sorry, Justin.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.280
But my dad's a really nice guy.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.040
He has a degree in composition.

27:03.040 --> 27:03.760
Music composition.

27:03.760 --> 27:04.640
What has he composed?

27:04.640 --> 27:05.140
Yeah.

27:05.140 --> 27:05.720
A cassette tape?

27:05.720 --> 27:06.220
Yeah.

27:06.220 --> 27:06.720
Yeah.

27:06.720 --> 27:10.960
He put out a one hit, not so much of a one-two.

27:10.960 --> 27:11.720
Have you heard it?

27:11.720 --> 27:12.840
He's a great dad, though.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.560
So good on him.

27:14.560 --> 27:17.640
Moving on, we found so many amazing local bands

27:17.640 --> 27:20.640
because there's so many amazing local bands around.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.600
We've got an embarrassment of riches around us.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.200
We really do.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.560
And also, throw yourself into the music scene

27:25.560 --> 27:26.760
in whatever town you're in.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.040
Because it's probably got good music.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.200
Yeah, I'm sure you're going to find something that you like.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.960
Also, it's really easy for people

27:31.960 --> 27:33.520
to record music these days.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.520
And so more people are making it.

27:35.520 --> 27:40.320
And there's a lot of garbage out there that you can step through.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.540
Want to go somewhere says question.

27:42.540 --> 27:45.020
Every time the boys woke up back in the cemetery,

27:45.020 --> 27:47.900
was there another group of them running around

27:47.900 --> 27:49.460
in the same city?

27:49.460 --> 27:50.180
Yes.

27:50.180 --> 27:52.140
Or was that an alternate timeline?

27:52.140 --> 27:52.820
Yes.

27:52.820 --> 27:53.780
Alternate universe.

27:53.780 --> 27:55.260
Yes kind of thing.

27:55.260 --> 27:58.460
So A, yes, there was an alternate version of them

27:58.460 --> 27:59.860
in that scenario.

27:59.860 --> 28:03.540
But in, for instance, the iteration

28:03.540 --> 28:06.260
where you guys went to the Glass Family Compound,

28:06.260 --> 28:09.880
that world continues on and keeps doing its own thing.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.880
The next time you come back, you're

28:11.880 --> 28:15.120
in a different iteration of that same plane.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.000
But you've done what you did previously before.

28:18.000 --> 28:18.880
Does that make sense?

28:18.880 --> 28:22.360
Yeah, I do get that sort of, so our guys are doing it?

28:22.360 --> 28:24.280
Yeah, so in the first one that you were in,

28:24.280 --> 28:25.320
there's only one of you.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.040
In the second one that you woke up in,

28:27.040 --> 28:28.520
there's two of you in that world.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.680
In the third one you woke up in, there's three of you

28:30.680 --> 28:31.480
in that world.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.440
Three collective yous.

28:32.440 --> 28:32.960
Yeah.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.440
And then in the last one, there's

28:34.440 --> 28:37.000
four of you in that collective universe.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.400
Well, there's not because you died in the CSU arc.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.360
But yeah, that was my idea with all that.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.880
We got another question here.

28:44.880 --> 28:48.560
What up with the names branded into their skin

28:48.560 --> 28:50.620
when they wake up at the cemetery?

28:50.620 --> 28:54.800
Was it an overseer hint on where they need to go next?

28:54.800 --> 28:55.440
Yes.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.200
Or was it something more than that?

28:57.200 --> 29:00.520
It was also a little bit more than that, but barely.

29:00.520 --> 29:03.900
It was simply that when you interact

29:03.900 --> 29:08.220
with the person who is branded on your body as a whole,

29:08.220 --> 29:10.820
your group will have that name crossed out.

29:10.820 --> 29:12.480
The next time you wake up and you only

29:12.480 --> 29:15.380
have until all your names are crossed out,

29:15.380 --> 29:17.480
then you have one last time to go through it.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.700
So first time you had one name crossed out.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.020
Second time you had the second name crossed out.

29:22.020 --> 29:25.580
Third time you ran into both Tildy B. Mitchell

29:25.580 --> 29:29.020
because Keith ran into Tildy B. Mitchell, Andrew Andrews,

29:29.020 --> 29:30.980
and therefore crossed out both of those names,

29:30.980 --> 29:33.860
giving you only one more chance at life.

29:33.860 --> 29:34.860
Thank goodness.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.340
Yeah, it worked out really fucking well, actually.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.380
So it was just the overseer saying, hey,

29:39.380 --> 29:40.500
you need to talk to these guys.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.100
But he was just hoping that you would figure out

29:42.100 --> 29:42.940
what you needed from him.

29:42.940 --> 29:43.620
Yes.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.140
Yeah, that was his.

29:45.140 --> 29:48.660
Again, that's what I intended for sure.

29:48.660 --> 29:49.740
Good, good, good, good.

29:49.740 --> 29:50.860
That's what I was hoping.

29:50.860 --> 29:55.460
Punk-ass book jockey, that's a great name, Compliments.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.940
I love the way, this is long.

29:56.940 --> 29:59.180
I love the way you created horror

29:59.220 --> 30:02.500
by constantly throwing new mysteries and problems

30:02.500 --> 30:04.620
and gross shit into the plot.

30:04.620 --> 30:07.860
Instead of being scary because of slowly built tension,

30:07.860 --> 30:11.260
it was scary from being completely overwhelming,

30:11.260 --> 30:13.020
like it was a mental breakdown.

30:13.020 --> 30:13.860
It was.

30:15.660 --> 30:17.340
Yeah, very cool inversion.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.940
I love that you wrote a time travel plot

30:19.940 --> 30:23.060
and still held characters and plot elements

30:23.060 --> 30:26.340
so loosely and let unexpected things happen.

30:26.340 --> 30:28.140
Yeah, that was really fucking hard.

30:28.380 --> 30:30.220
I loved how great everyone was

30:30.220 --> 30:32.780
at instantly bringing each new character to life.

30:32.780 --> 30:34.740
That's just good for you guys.

30:34.740 --> 30:35.580
Thank you.

30:35.580 --> 30:38.100
I love the way the players play

30:38.100 --> 30:40.980
like they are horror movie characters.

30:40.980 --> 30:43.940
Yes, again, thank you that I agree with that.

30:43.940 --> 30:45.820
Thank you for doing it.

30:45.820 --> 30:46.940
I thought it was great

30:46.940 --> 30:49.220
that no matter how tangled everything got,

30:49.220 --> 30:53.060
it always felt like there was an explanation for everything.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.140
If we could just understand.

30:55.140 --> 30:57.660
That's the amazing illusion Zach creates.

30:58.140 --> 31:00.620
I mean, your trust means everything to me.

31:00.620 --> 31:03.620
I love that when the players were given complete freedom

31:03.620 --> 31:06.580
in the final episodes, they kept topping,

31:06.580 --> 31:07.500
lol, lol,

31:08.820 --> 31:11.540
each unbelievably cool thing they did

31:11.540 --> 31:14.220
with another unbelievably cool thing.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.060
Thanks.

31:15.060 --> 31:15.900
Thank you, yeah.

31:15.900 --> 31:17.140
It felt cool at the end there, man.

31:17.140 --> 31:18.660
We all kind of felt like our power is unlocked.

31:18.660 --> 31:20.340
We're all just topping.

31:20.340 --> 31:21.180
And for you guys,

31:21.180 --> 31:23.700
what one thing do you wish you had done different?

31:23.700 --> 31:27.220
So they're saying, having done such cool stuff,

31:27.620 --> 31:30.060
what was the one thing you wish you had done differently

31:30.060 --> 31:31.620
as your character?

31:31.620 --> 31:33.060
I don't know if I would have changed this,

31:33.060 --> 31:34.780
but I would have been super curious

31:34.780 --> 31:37.060
how the whole thing would have gone if I'd gone with Leon.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.740
That really was a fork in the road

31:38.740 --> 31:40.340
that could have drastically changed

31:40.340 --> 31:41.300
the way this whole thing went.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.580
Yep, I have no idea what would have happened.

31:43.580 --> 31:45.660
If I wouldn't have jumped out of the bus,

31:45.660 --> 31:47.340
I would want to see what happened then.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.180
Ah, yes.

31:48.180 --> 31:49.020
Ooh, nice.

31:49.020 --> 31:51.540
Yeah, that bus was on its way to the mill.

31:51.540 --> 31:52.380
So you would have-

31:52.380 --> 31:54.060
Oh, you would have been right on it.

31:54.420 --> 31:57.820
I don't know what decisions I would make differently

31:57.820 --> 31:59.340
with Jon, probably a lot,

31:59.340 --> 32:01.460
but Jon does know as a character

32:01.460 --> 32:05.020
that he should have shot Keith like a long time ago.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.780
Oh my God.

32:09.020 --> 32:12.860
Who was your favorite interlude character that you made?

32:12.860 --> 32:16.340
So any of the small Mark characters?

32:16.340 --> 32:18.140
Yeah, Martin Cupertino.

32:18.140 --> 32:18.980
Oh, okay.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.980
So we got one from Calm Comfy Campground there.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.940
Everett Pace for me, I loved him.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.180
He was really fun.

32:24.180 --> 32:25.340
All three of those were really good.

32:25.340 --> 32:26.780
Justin, what about you?

32:26.780 --> 32:29.740
Like all of my beautiful children that I've created.

32:29.740 --> 32:34.740
Yeah, you got Don, you got Jack Pearlman.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.500
Don and Donovan, the two Donnies.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.940
Yeah, the Donnies.

32:38.940 --> 32:40.380
I really like Donovan because I love-

32:40.380 --> 32:42.220
Shut the fuck up.

32:42.220 --> 32:43.420
Who are you telling to shut the fuck up?

32:43.420 --> 32:44.420
Shut the fuck up, Donnie.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.260
Donnie.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.500
Oh, oh yeah.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.220
That old chestnut.

32:48.220 --> 32:49.780
It's a movie.

32:49.780 --> 32:51.780
No, I really enjoyed being Donovan

32:51.780 --> 32:55.500
because he felt so opposite of like all the characters.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.340
He was good.

32:56.340 --> 32:57.180
He was really good.

32:57.180 --> 32:58.820
And then his turn at the end, wow,

32:58.820 --> 33:01.140
you made some really dark decisions there.

33:01.140 --> 33:03.060
Yeah, I definitely wasn't forced upon it

33:03.060 --> 33:06.020
by some unknown entity.

33:06.020 --> 33:08.180
I messaged you and was like,

33:08.180 --> 33:09.740
hey, you want to get fucking wild?

33:09.740 --> 33:13.580
And you were like, anything to give Donovan more power

33:13.580 --> 33:15.540
is literally what you responded with.

33:15.540 --> 33:17.180
I would literally,

33:17.180 --> 33:19.900
you want me to kill all those members of contention?

33:20.900 --> 33:22.820
They also said for Zach,

33:22.820 --> 33:24.700
what do you need from the community

33:24.700 --> 33:27.700
to release the campaign notes in some form?

33:27.700 --> 33:28.540
Money.

33:30.860 --> 33:35.020
Which actions from the players did you most expect

33:35.020 --> 33:38.300
and which was the furthest from what you expected?

33:38.300 --> 33:39.300
Good question.

33:40.180 --> 33:43.340
I expected some things here and there,

33:43.340 --> 33:45.660
but most of the time I just,

33:45.660 --> 33:47.860
honestly guys, I set up scenarios

33:47.860 --> 33:49.820
with the hope that you will surprise me.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.300
I don't plan the ending of any of this stuff.

33:52.300 --> 33:56.580
And so everything, like fucking everything constantly.

33:56.580 --> 33:58.340
Yeah, but like, I mean,

33:58.340 --> 34:00.060
we touched on this in another question.

34:00.060 --> 34:01.460
I think the most surprising thing

34:01.460 --> 34:03.100
has to be the myriad Keith.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.540
Yeah, the myriad Keith name.

34:05.540 --> 34:06.380
I didn't plan it.

34:06.380 --> 34:08.740
No, yeah, that was the great thing.

34:08.740 --> 34:11.340
You could see that like by the twinkle in your eye,

34:12.700 --> 34:15.180
you had thought of it almost as you said it.

34:16.700 --> 34:19.300
That's the way to role play by my book.

34:20.220 --> 34:21.940
It just says, do what you want.

34:23.940 --> 34:26.540
What's the most squeamest thing

34:26.540 --> 34:29.060
you've seen in real life?

34:29.060 --> 34:29.900
Snake.

34:29.900 --> 34:30.740
A snake probably.

34:30.740 --> 34:31.580
A snake, yeah.

34:31.580 --> 34:33.940
I saw a really big giant black snake in Arkansas

34:33.940 --> 34:34.860
when I was a little kid.

34:34.860 --> 34:36.100
It was so cool.

34:36.100 --> 34:36.940
Oh, that's rad.

34:36.940 --> 34:39.500
It was so big that we heard it dragging itself

34:39.500 --> 34:42.060
across the concrete of the carport

34:42.060 --> 34:45.260
and we thought it was a plastic bag rustling in the wind.

34:45.260 --> 34:46.100
It's just loud.

34:46.100 --> 34:50.140
Do you ever feel like a fat snake?

34:50.140 --> 34:51.580
Like a fat snake.

34:53.100 --> 34:58.100
The snap, like I saw a snap, like a-

34:59.140 --> 34:59.980
Kimono dragon.

34:59.980 --> 35:01.900
I saw a huge turtle one time.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.180
I was like, that's cool.

35:04.180 --> 35:05.020
And it was wet.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.780
It was a big wet turtle.

35:06.780 --> 35:11.740
Edgeworth08 asks, what was the editing process like?

35:11.740 --> 35:16.060
How much did you cut and did it become less and easier?

35:17.020 --> 35:17.980
As time went on.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.300
Editing is-

35:19.300 --> 35:20.220
Difficult.

35:20.220 --> 35:24.940
I cut out anything that seems repetitive

35:24.940 --> 35:29.940
or unnecessary or dead air or me saying um,

35:32.940 --> 35:35.820
like with a long space on either side of it.

35:35.820 --> 35:37.820
That's mostly what I edit out.

35:37.820 --> 35:39.620
I don't edit out a lot of content.

35:39.620 --> 35:41.660
There's not like role-playing scenes

35:41.660 --> 35:43.780
that I have to cut ever.

35:44.780 --> 35:47.180
And as you all know from listening,

35:47.180 --> 35:50.220
when someone says like, hey, let's cut that out.

35:50.220 --> 35:55.220
That's typically like a cue to leave everything in.

35:55.900 --> 36:00.180
So you really hear pretty much everything that we do.

36:00.180 --> 36:02.020
Those of you in the Den of Sin just know

36:02.020 --> 36:07.020
that I edit out dead air.

36:10.100 --> 36:13.100
Not even a lot, just enough to keep it all going.

36:13.300 --> 36:15.180
I just want listening to this show

36:15.180 --> 36:18.500
to be a nonstop fucking ride.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.860
And that's kind of been my goal

36:20.860 --> 36:23.900
is that it just pushes, pushes, pushes constantly.

36:23.900 --> 36:24.740
For sure.

36:24.740 --> 36:26.480
TD underscore Woogie says,

36:26.480 --> 36:29.860
is Wolf the dog going to still be around in season two?

36:29.860 --> 36:31.360
I hope so.

36:31.360 --> 36:34.020
And there's a follow up from Sensory13 that says,

36:34.020 --> 36:36.660
and or Justin as a full-time character.

36:36.660 --> 36:39.340
Second chance to give us the right answer, Justin.

36:39.340 --> 36:42.060
What do you think?

36:42.060 --> 36:44.220
Yeah, you still busy?

36:44.220 --> 36:45.540
Say it.

36:45.540 --> 36:46.380
Fish.

36:52.100 --> 36:52.940
I don't know, Zach.

36:52.940 --> 36:55.820
Is Wolf the dog going to be in season two?

36:55.820 --> 37:00.820
Find out on the first episode of season two, but also.

37:01.000 --> 37:01.840
But maybe not.

37:01.840 --> 37:02.680
Yes.

37:04.220 --> 37:05.500
Oh, Justin said, maybe not.

37:07.300 --> 37:08.800
TBD apparently.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.180
I hope so too, TD underscore Woogie.

37:11.180 --> 37:14.620
I hope that Wolf is still around in season two as well.

37:14.620 --> 37:17.240
He might be busy, guys.

37:19.540 --> 37:21.860
Like underscore Larry says,

37:21.860 --> 37:23.540
this is a question for Zach.

37:23.540 --> 37:26.760
Were the story arcs inspired by the intro songs at all?

37:26.760 --> 37:28.380
Or were you able to find songs

37:28.380 --> 37:32.380
that the lyrics oddly tied up with the story arcs?

37:32.380 --> 37:34.940
Either way, it's very impressive.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.420
I found songs that matched what I was doing so far

37:39.420 --> 37:41.100
is my answer to this question.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.860
However, No Backbone was chosen

37:44.860 --> 37:49.480
before I decided that the balls would rip out your spine.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.320
Yeah.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.140
Yeah, right.

37:51.140 --> 37:55.180
So the plot of the balls definitely came from No Backbone,

37:55.180 --> 37:57.220
but then for the rest of the stuff,

37:57.220 --> 37:58.660
anything that was coincidental.

37:58.660 --> 37:59.780
Actually, you know what?

37:59.780 --> 38:01.180
I definitely listened to the lyrics

38:01.180 --> 38:02.980
and just like threw stuff in every once in a while.

38:02.980 --> 38:05.220
There's a really fun thing in Pretty Sexual

38:05.220 --> 38:09.660
that's like, I swore I knew you before this.

38:09.660 --> 38:10.500
Yeah.

38:11.020 --> 38:11.860
It was good.

38:11.860 --> 38:14.060
When I like heard that lyric,

38:14.060 --> 38:15.740
yeah, that probably definitely influenced

38:15.740 --> 38:18.240
even though that was gonna be probably part of the plot.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.900
Honestly, I don't know.

38:19.900 --> 38:20.740
Moving on.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.900
It was a lot of back and forth there, I think.

38:24.900 --> 38:29.900
Brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos.

38:30.780 --> 38:32.220
What about Brofose?

38:32.220 --> 38:33.460
Brofose.

38:33.460 --> 38:35.220
What was up with all the hand sanitizer

38:35.220 --> 38:37.280
in the Cabin in the Woods arc?

38:37.320 --> 38:41.240
The hand sanitizer specifically was being used

38:41.240 --> 38:45.000
by Mary, M-A-R-Y, Ball,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.720
who was Old Madge hanging out in the woods.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.660
Old Madge was M-A-R-Y, the ball,

38:51.660 --> 38:56.200
and she had concocted this gel

38:56.200 --> 39:00.560
that could be put on human skin

39:00.560 --> 39:02.380
and then would- And it killed bacteria.

39:02.380 --> 39:03.220
Would.

39:03.220 --> 39:04.060
Whoa.

39:09.660 --> 39:11.060
It was amazing.

39:11.060 --> 39:12.620
I hope that answers your question.

39:12.620 --> 39:15.560
Denny Cready asks the functions

39:15.560 --> 39:16.400
of all the different key devices.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.740
Well, you know, I wanna know.

39:21.120 --> 39:25.180
Basically, if you used the hand sanitizer,

39:25.180 --> 39:30.180
it allowed me as the handler to pull you out of reality

39:31.020 --> 39:34.860
and get you, quote, lost.

39:34.860 --> 39:38.160
So anytime someone used hand sanitizer,

39:38.160 --> 39:42.100
I took the initiative to anytime they were moving

39:42.100 --> 39:43.680
from one place to another,

39:43.680 --> 39:47.400
they got lost on the way to their destination.

39:47.400 --> 39:50.140
So that is what the hand sanitizer did.

39:50.140 --> 39:53.920
It allowed me to put the PCs into situations

39:53.920 --> 39:55.460
that they were not expecting.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.260
Cool. Yeah, that was really fun.

39:57.260 --> 39:59.300
Denny Cready says the functions

39:59.300 --> 40:01.620
of all the different goo devices is clear

40:01.620 --> 40:03.220
apart from the helmet.

40:03.220 --> 40:06.400
What exactly does the helmet do?

40:06.400 --> 40:07.520
You say that the functions

40:07.520 --> 40:10.060
of all the different goo devices is clear.

40:10.060 --> 40:13.380
Oh, they also say it seems it's either illusory

40:13.380 --> 40:17.220
or allows the user to benefit from other dimensions.

40:17.220 --> 40:20.280
The goo devices, let's go over them real quick.

40:20.280 --> 40:21.740
First ones, the camera.

40:21.740 --> 40:23.180
The camera takes pictures

40:23.180 --> 40:27.860
when it has been a certain amount of time in between uses.

40:27.860 --> 40:30.820
It was all based on time for these devices,

40:30.820 --> 40:33.860
or as we saw Pastor Adam Kane use,

40:33.860 --> 40:37.460
you could slam some goo up toward the,

40:37.460 --> 40:39.700
the goo was able to travel through glass,

40:39.700 --> 40:43.300
and so it could move into any of these devices

40:43.300 --> 40:46.460
and then charge them and make that green light lit.

40:46.460 --> 40:50.140
The camera was taking pictures of the dark place,

40:50.140 --> 40:52.400
the plane that you guys ended up in,

40:52.400 --> 40:54.260
and that was all just random

40:54.260 --> 40:57.040
and based on plot, how I wanted to do that.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.800
It wasn't based on location or time

40:58.800 --> 41:00.920
of what you guys were getting in those pictures.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.920
The gun, okay, this is the weird one.

41:03.920 --> 41:08.280
The gun had a bullet that was in the trunk

41:08.280 --> 41:11.480
that John Peters pulled from the green box.

41:11.480 --> 41:16.480
The bullet was to take the user to the Old West,

41:16.920 --> 41:21.260
specifically made by Keith Beans as Silas Cole

41:21.260 --> 41:23.020
to eventually get back there.

41:23.020 --> 41:28.020
However, that bullet was used by Tildi B. Mitchell, right?

41:28.700 --> 41:30.520
So she slams the bullet in.

41:30.520 --> 41:35.220
The person who used the gun previous was Jermaine Glass,

41:35.220 --> 41:37.780
who used it before the podcast started.

41:37.780 --> 41:40.980
So what happened was John Peters pulls the trunk

41:40.980 --> 41:43.220
out of the green box, goes home.

41:43.220 --> 41:46.740
He owes the Glass family mob a lot of money.

41:46.740 --> 41:49.860
The two brothers show up at John Peters' house

41:49.860 --> 41:50.900
to get the money.

41:50.900 --> 41:54.780
John Peters grabs the gun to try to defend himself,

41:54.780 --> 41:58.920
pulls the trigger, and inside the barrel of this gun,

41:58.920 --> 42:03.920
inside the chamber of this gun is, what is it?

42:04.060 --> 42:05.940
Not the bullet from the Old West.

42:05.940 --> 42:10.220
Therefore, the ooze goes in and fills up the chamber,

42:10.220 --> 42:14.740
sending him to the ooze plane of existence.

42:14.740 --> 42:18.580
The next time it's used, Tildi B. Mitchell grabs the bullet

42:18.580 --> 42:22.000
that was with it, slams it into the cylinder,

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
and then fires, which sends her to the Old West.

42:27.260 --> 42:32.260
Then the gun is used once more, finally, by Rose M-A-R-Y

42:33.940 --> 42:37.320
after the ball takes over Rosemary's body,

42:37.320 --> 42:41.000
but M-A-R-Y knows how to use this gun.

42:41.000 --> 42:46.000
So she blew snot into her hand,

42:46.320 --> 42:49.640
which would have filled her hand with ooze,

42:49.640 --> 42:51.760
and then she loads the gun with ooze

42:51.760 --> 42:56.520
so that she can get to that plane, and that is the gun.

42:56.520 --> 42:57.360
Straightforward.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.660
Very straightforward.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.880
The radio is obvious, it switches, you know.

43:02.880 --> 43:06.540
It's not obvious, I thought the illusory thing,

43:06.540 --> 43:07.920
but he brought up the different dimensions.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.560
Oh, the radio, the radio is obvious.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.400
Radio is obvious.

43:10.400 --> 43:13.840
The radio just switches bodies, but yes, the helmet.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.920
You are correct, though, it is illusory.

43:16.760 --> 43:20.240
So when the person who is wielding the helmet

43:20.240 --> 43:24.120
passes a power contest against someone,

43:24.120 --> 43:28.120
then they can change the reality of the person

43:28.120 --> 43:31.220
who they are contesting with by using the helmet.

43:31.220 --> 43:33.640
But is it an illusion, or is it actual dimensions?

43:33.640 --> 43:34.880
It is an illusion.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.560
Yeah, it is all illusory.

43:36.560 --> 43:39.680
So when you guys were all seeing different stuff

43:39.680 --> 43:43.000
at Bean's Pond, you were still interacting

43:43.000 --> 43:44.560
with what you thought was real,

43:44.600 --> 43:47.160
but as some of you saw,

43:47.160 --> 43:50.720
like the repercussions of your decisions

43:50.720 --> 43:52.080
came about in a different way.

43:52.080 --> 43:56.560
So it wasn't an alternate plane, it was simply illusory.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.940
Al-G-Rhythm, oh no.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.820
I haven't even seen the new Space Jam,

44:02.820 --> 44:05.020
and I know that that's the bad guy's name.

44:11.520 --> 44:14.080
It's so cool to know that Don Cheadle listens.

44:14.880 --> 44:18.080
He says, hello, I love your show.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.400
I have a couple questions.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.920
Originally, was the officer whose name changes

44:22.920 --> 44:26.440
throughout the show supposed to be the gaslight that it was?

44:26.440 --> 44:27.280
No.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.780
Or did Zach, oh yes, or did Zach Wright forget

44:29.780 --> 44:31.080
to write it down in his notes?

44:31.080 --> 44:32.100
No.

44:32.100 --> 44:35.160
Was it originally going to be memory manipulation,

44:35.160 --> 44:37.040
or was it always time fuckery?

44:37.040 --> 44:39.160
It was never either of those things, really,

44:39.160 --> 44:41.240
because it was just split dimensions.

44:41.280 --> 44:45.120
The whole thing is based off of the Mandela Effect,

44:45.120 --> 44:47.840
the Mandela Effect, which I'm a huge fan of.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.360
That's a concept that fascinates idiots.

44:49.360 --> 44:50.200
Exactly.

44:51.200 --> 44:54.020
When I heard about it in college or whatever,

44:54.020 --> 44:57.720
I immediately called my mom and was like,

44:57.720 --> 45:00.680
who wrote the books with the bears?

45:00.680 --> 45:01.680
What were they?

45:01.680 --> 45:02.880
The bears.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.640
That's the thing that was wrong, is who wrote the books?

45:05.640 --> 45:06.480
Who wrote the books?

45:06.480 --> 45:08.640
I always thought it was Emily B. Bear.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.520
It was Jan.

45:12.160 --> 45:17.160
Anyway, so when I was finally able to have Sinbad

45:18.360 --> 45:23.360
on the podcast, that's actually one of my crowning

45:26.600 --> 45:29.680
and achievements in my mind.

45:29.680 --> 45:33.240
Probably against the terms of service for-

45:33.240 --> 45:36.680
I looked it up a few times and I didn't find anything

45:36.680 --> 45:38.960
that said that it wasn't able to be used.

45:39.600 --> 45:43.000
PTBP, I didn't say anything about it.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.400
If you want to cut this, it does specifically have,

45:45.400 --> 45:48.260
there's categories of people who are doing promotion

45:48.260 --> 45:50.640
and not promotion, and you have to make sure that you do.

45:50.640 --> 45:52.820
But it's not promotion, it's art, baby.

45:56.600 --> 45:57.440
Cool.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.180
Luke, that's the name of our Detroiters firm,

46:02.180 --> 46:03.480
or that's our logo, at least.

46:03.480 --> 46:04.840
It's not promotion, it's art, baby.

46:04.840 --> 46:05.680
It's art.

46:06.580 --> 46:08.160
Gonna give us $50.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
All right, yeah, so it was just the time splitting off

46:14.480 --> 46:17.040
into different iterations of the same world,

46:17.040 --> 46:19.440
but infinite versions of that same world.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.340
What a great final question.

46:21.340 --> 46:23.240
The final question is-

46:23.240 --> 46:25.720
Zach looked up the definition of squamous,

46:25.720 --> 46:28.280
the ooze and the worms and all that.

46:28.280 --> 46:30.140
Are they goopy or are they squamous?

46:30.140 --> 46:32.680
Good question, Zach, what does squamous mean?

46:32.680 --> 46:33.520
Scaly, and I-

46:33.520 --> 46:36.520
Did you know that when you called the ooze squamous?

46:36.520 --> 46:41.520
I've always pictured the ooze as being squamous.

46:43.400 --> 46:44.300
I don't believe it.

46:44.300 --> 46:45.300
Scaly ooze.

46:45.300 --> 46:47.120
Like an old wet turtle.

46:47.120 --> 46:50.880
I don't think you've seen the ooze,

46:50.880 --> 46:52.580
this word or a turtle.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.680
Guys, it's Delta Green.

46:57.680 --> 46:58.840
Of course it's squamous.

46:58.840 --> 47:00.900
Of course it's squamous.

47:00.900 --> 47:03.600
It's a scaly, horrible ooze.

47:03.640 --> 47:07.080
It's very goopy and very squamous.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.760
See, it's just that those are nearly,

47:09.760 --> 47:10.920
it's not that they're quite-

47:10.920 --> 47:12.480
No, they're not antithetical,

47:12.480 --> 47:13.320
but they're close. They don't quite

47:13.320 --> 47:15.280
cancel each other out, but they almost do.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.680
Which makes it so creepy.

47:16.680 --> 47:19.520
Exactly, it's the conundrum that makes it so scary.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.000
The conundrum is that you didn't-

47:21.000 --> 47:22.400
Non-Newtonian liquid.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.480
Thank you, so a non-Newtonian liquid

47:25.480 --> 47:28.940
as both solid and liquid at the same time,

47:28.940 --> 47:33.520
and in my mind, that is essentially what this ooze was,

47:34.320 --> 47:36.960
that it's this horribly, if you look,

47:36.960 --> 47:38.400
if this thing-

47:38.400 --> 47:40.040
Yeah, but which part of that is scaly?

47:40.040 --> 47:41.920
Dude, if it reached out to you,

47:41.920 --> 47:44.080
and you looked at it, and you thought

47:44.080 --> 47:45.880
that you would poke your finger up to it,

47:45.880 --> 47:49.120
it would be hard, but it's still gooping

47:49.120 --> 47:51.320
and oozing toward you at all at the same time.

47:51.320 --> 47:53.200
But in a repeated scale pattern?

47:53.200 --> 47:54.960
A repeated scale pattern.

47:54.960 --> 47:55.800
Scaly?

47:55.800 --> 47:56.800
Yeah, squamous.

47:57.480 --> 47:58.640
Any questions?

48:03.640 --> 48:06.480
No, Zach didn't know what that word meant.

48:06.480 --> 48:08.440
Who would you cast as the ooze?

48:09.520 --> 48:10.760
Andy Serkis.

48:10.760 --> 48:11.800
Nice.

48:11.800 --> 48:12.980
It's all that mocap.

48:14.040 --> 48:16.520
Maybe the guy who did Jar Jar, since he's the OG.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.360
Nice.

48:17.360 --> 48:19.320
First one, first one in the biz to do that.

48:19.320 --> 48:20.720
Is the ooze a Sith?

48:20.720 --> 48:22.480
Is the ooze a Sith?

48:22.480 --> 48:24.640
From the ooze's perspective,

48:24.680 --> 48:26.880
contention PD is evil, so it's like.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.960
Justin, I have a question for you.

48:31.960 --> 48:35.000
As you've been making music for the show,

48:35.000 --> 48:39.840
have you changed your goal or perspective

48:39.840 --> 48:42.000
of each time you sit down to make a track?

48:42.000 --> 48:43.300
Oh, absolutely.

48:43.300 --> 48:45.040
Yeah, I actually have been thinking about that

48:45.040 --> 48:47.120
revving up for season two.

48:47.120 --> 48:49.640
I was actually messaging you,

48:49.640 --> 48:50.480
because I was like,

48:50.480 --> 48:52.660
here's the points I think we should hit,

48:52.660 --> 48:55.580
because I can't just make any old random song.

48:55.580 --> 48:57.460
I mean, I can, but then it would be like,

48:57.460 --> 49:02.460
okay, this is only useful for one really particular moment.

49:02.660 --> 49:04.400
So yeah, when I'm thinking about the music,

49:04.400 --> 49:07.940
I'm thinking about how it interplays with the,

49:07.940 --> 49:09.500
I don't know what the correct term is,

49:09.500 --> 49:13.020
the moment to moment of the sound, yes.

49:13.020 --> 49:15.780
I'm thinking of how the audio exists.

49:15.780 --> 49:18.940
No, I'm thinking of how the music interacts with

49:18.940 --> 49:20.780
the different tones.

49:20.780 --> 49:21.620
What was that?

49:21.620 --> 49:22.460
The feeling, the mood.

49:22.460 --> 49:25.140
Oh yeah, the mood, the feel, the vibe, the aura.

49:25.140 --> 49:26.580
But yeah, so I...

49:26.580 --> 49:28.100
Aria.

49:28.100 --> 49:29.020
God damn it.

49:29.020 --> 49:30.500
The start of it all.

49:30.500 --> 49:32.180
I, what do you get, oh God,

49:32.180 --> 49:34.540
you guys keep mumbling, interrupting, I can't.

49:34.540 --> 49:36.140
So you try to make it good now, right?

49:36.140 --> 49:38.660
So I'm gonna hit you, I'm gonna hit you.

49:38.660 --> 49:39.900
Aria.

49:39.900 --> 49:41.460
Yeah, I try to make it good.

49:46.380 --> 49:50.980
I wanna compliment you on that you do make tracks

49:50.980 --> 49:53.540
that fit these moods, but the Western one,

49:53.540 --> 49:57.300
the one that has that kind of tinkly guitar or piano riff,

49:57.300 --> 50:02.300
maybe it is, that is so perfectly creepy and old timey.

50:02.420 --> 50:04.180
It's one of my favorites, it's so good.

50:04.180 --> 50:05.020
Thank you.

50:05.020 --> 50:08.420
I liked the, it was fun to know ahead of time

50:08.420 --> 50:10.100
that there was gonna be the old West arc

50:10.100 --> 50:12.580
and be like, all right, let's do some...

50:12.580 --> 50:14.660
Basically I took what I would have done,

50:14.660 --> 50:17.160
like a weird arpeggiated synth thing or other,

50:17.160 --> 50:20.400
or just nasty synth stuff and converted it over

50:20.840 --> 50:24.600
to like Western instruments and stylings and stuff.

50:24.600 --> 50:25.800
And so that was very fun.

50:25.800 --> 50:28.400
The name that Justin gave the track

50:28.400 --> 50:32.640
that Joe brought up there, The Urgent Wind.

50:32.640 --> 50:34.280
Nice, yeah.

50:34.280 --> 50:36.840
The Urgent Wind was the time rewind.

50:36.840 --> 50:39.240
That one wasn't in the old Western arc, was it?

50:40.920 --> 50:42.280
That one's called A Road,

50:42.280 --> 50:44.480
then it just got uploaded to YouTube

50:44.480 --> 50:46.760
cause someone on the subreddit.

50:46.760 --> 50:49.120
A Road or A Road?

50:49.120 --> 50:51.080
A Road.

50:51.080 --> 50:51.920
A Rod.

50:51.920 --> 50:52.880
A Road.

50:52.880 --> 50:53.700
I love it.

50:53.700 --> 50:54.540
It's a good one.

50:54.540 --> 50:55.920
I thought you were talking about the one that's like...

50:55.920 --> 50:56.760
Waaah.

50:58.240 --> 50:59.560
No, I also love that one.

50:59.560 --> 51:00.800
That's my favorite track.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.280
The one that has the big strings.

51:02.280 --> 51:04.760
It's just me on a microphone going waaah.

51:09.360 --> 51:10.600
Zach never uses it,

51:10.600 --> 51:13.740
and it's Zach's, it's Joe's fucking favorite song.

51:15.160 --> 51:17.880
Put it in the show, coward.

51:17.880 --> 51:20.160
It's all right, I fall asleep to it at night anyway.

51:20.160 --> 51:23.040
Yeah, it's four hours long, so I get it.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.380
He's like, hey.

51:26.180 --> 51:27.720
Hey folks, thanks for listening.

51:27.720 --> 51:28.560
You're welcome.

51:28.560 --> 51:31.520
Wait, no, you, the listener, not me.

51:31.520 --> 51:35.000
No, we really appreciate you listening, Justin.

51:35.000 --> 51:35.920
Oh, yeah.

51:35.920 --> 51:36.760
Thanks, Justin.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.600
Thanks, Justin.

51:37.600 --> 51:38.420
You're welcome.

51:38.420 --> 51:39.420
Do you have any questions for us?

51:39.420 --> 51:40.260
Yeah.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.060
As a matter of fact.

51:45.240 --> 51:46.480
Unfurls a scroll.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.660
What the fuck?

51:48.880 --> 51:49.720
Hey, Zach.

51:49.720 --> 51:50.560
Good question.

51:50.560 --> 51:51.920
What the fuck, bro?

51:51.920 --> 51:54.400
Hey, Justin, I've been meaning to tell you,

51:54.400 --> 51:56.760
our friendship means a whole bunch to me,

51:56.760 --> 51:59.080
and I'm really proud of you,

51:59.080 --> 52:02.200
that you're taking the shot at grad school

52:02.200 --> 52:04.100
and really focusing on it.

52:04.100 --> 52:06.640
And while doing that,

52:06.640 --> 52:10.440
we've created the artistic collaboration

52:10.440 --> 52:13.320
that I've been most proud of in my entire life.

52:13.320 --> 52:16.600
And we've collaborated on a lot of artistic stuff together

52:16.600 --> 52:19.640
from music to short films to this.

52:19.640 --> 52:22.760
And this is like really fun to make.

52:22.760 --> 52:26.120
And I'm really glad that you're on the team.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.360
Thank you.

52:27.360 --> 52:28.200
Thank you.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.020
Me too.

52:29.020 --> 52:29.860
I agree.

52:29.860 --> 52:31.080
We weren't talking to the rest of you.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.360
This is me and Zach's time.

52:32.360 --> 52:33.180
Oh, sorry.

52:33.180 --> 52:34.020
I'm sorry.

52:34.020 --> 52:34.840
I'm sorry.

52:34.840 --> 52:35.680
I'm sorry.

52:35.680 --> 52:40.680
No, I love creative group collaboration is fucking rips.

52:42.880 --> 52:44.960
Everyone should try it sometime.

52:44.960 --> 52:45.800
Seriously.

52:45.840 --> 52:46.680
When you first started this,

52:46.680 --> 52:48.800
did you think our characters were gonna die

52:48.800 --> 52:51.180
and we would make new ones or were you?

52:51.180 --> 52:52.020
Yeah.

52:52.020 --> 52:52.840
Yeah.

52:52.840 --> 52:53.680
Yep.

52:53.680 --> 52:56.240
And I thought you'd have new ones.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.240
We're gonna do that in season two, by the way.

52:58.240 --> 53:01.080
I'm gonna pull out the rug from some of those

53:01.080 --> 53:04.980
Pulp Cthulhu rules that we're using.

53:04.980 --> 53:08.640
And we're gonna go a little bit harder on Delta Green

53:08.640 --> 53:12.400
to get some nice, satisfying character death.

53:13.320 --> 53:17.240
Is this a regular street like feed episode?

53:17.240 --> 53:18.320
This is.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.560
If you want to hear me play a minion,

53:21.520 --> 53:23.040
subscribe to the Patreon.

53:23.040 --> 53:23.880
Nope.

53:23.880 --> 53:26.000
That is also gonna be on the main feed.

53:26.000 --> 53:26.840
That is?

53:26.840 --> 53:27.660
Yeah.

53:27.660 --> 53:28.500
Do it anyway.

53:29.880 --> 53:31.600
He's talking about his own thing he's gonna put out.

53:31.600 --> 53:32.440
Oh, that's right.

53:32.440 --> 53:33.600
Yeah.

53:33.600 --> 53:38.600
Luke, are you gonna run a RPG where we all play minions

53:38.620 --> 53:40.380
and you play guru?

53:40.380 --> 53:41.220
Yes.

53:42.220 --> 53:45.380
Yes, we will be doing that before season two.

53:45.380 --> 53:47.380
Why did you conjure that into existence?

53:50.500 --> 53:51.460
I don't even.

53:51.460 --> 53:53.260
I quit if you don't edit that out.

53:55.180 --> 53:56.660
I'm writing it right now as soon as I.

53:56.660 --> 53:59.100
Do minions say anything except banana?

53:59.100 --> 54:01.580
Would we all just be yelling banana at Luke?

54:01.580 --> 54:02.700
What else do they say?

54:02.700 --> 54:06.580
Pudding and other kind of like desserts and fruits.

54:06.580 --> 54:07.420
Pudding.

54:09.300 --> 54:10.220
Oh my God.

54:11.580 --> 54:12.420
Yeah.

54:15.140 --> 54:18.100
Yeah, so thanks for listening.

54:18.100 --> 54:21.260
We're gonna be back next week, actually.

54:21.260 --> 54:22.900
We're gonna be back next week.

54:22.900 --> 54:27.180
If you follow along on Instagram or Twitter or Facebook,

54:27.180 --> 54:29.940
Reddit or Discord or any of the places

54:29.940 --> 54:32.780
where you can find out information from us

54:32.780 --> 54:36.160
outside of just listening to our voices speak,

54:36.160 --> 54:39.120
then you know that on November 5th,

54:39.120 --> 54:44.120
the first episode will be out of a short five episode run

54:44.520 --> 54:48.280
that we're doing with a guest handler

54:48.280 --> 54:51.200
running us through the Delta Green scenario,

54:51.200 --> 54:54.560
Convergence that is being updated by Delta Green

54:54.560 --> 54:56.360
and Arc Dream publishing right now

54:56.360 --> 54:59.760
and our handler was able to get his hands on

54:59.760 --> 55:03.280
straight from the source of Shane Ivy,

55:03.280 --> 55:06.740
a copy of the updated version of Convergence

55:06.740 --> 55:08.620
for the new Delta Green role playing game

55:09.120 --> 55:10.420
to run for us.

55:10.420 --> 55:13.140
And then after that, on the main feed,

55:13.140 --> 55:15.940
I will be running Control Copy,

55:15.940 --> 55:17.760
another Delta Green scenario,

55:17.760 --> 55:20.260
this one written by Dennis Detwiller,

55:20.260 --> 55:24.260
which the patrons voted on over on patreon.com

55:24.260 --> 55:25.820
slash pretending pod.

55:25.820 --> 55:29.940
They chose Control Copy for me to run for this crew

55:29.940 --> 55:32.780
and that'll be out after Convergence.

55:32.780 --> 55:36.260
And so that's what we've got ready now

55:36.260 --> 55:38.340
and more on the horizon.

55:38.920 --> 55:42.620
And we're all really, really looking forward to it.

55:42.620 --> 55:44.920
I can't wait to play.

55:44.920 --> 55:47.580
Yeah, we got so much good gaming ahead of us.

55:47.580 --> 55:49.140
Oh yeah.

55:49.140 --> 55:52.300
There's a lot of gaming left in these old bones, Joe.

55:52.300 --> 55:57.300
So let us tickle your ear holes

55:58.340 --> 56:03.340
with our Deez Nuts and Deez Nuts signing off.

56:03.340 --> 56:08.340
This has been Luke from NPR.

56:33.440 --> 56:38.440
Pweloo, how can you have enough

56:38.960 --> 56:43.960
Drowning out all the notes

56:45.960 --> 56:50.960
Pweloo, how can you have enough

56:50.960 --> 56:55.960
Pweloo, how can you have enough
