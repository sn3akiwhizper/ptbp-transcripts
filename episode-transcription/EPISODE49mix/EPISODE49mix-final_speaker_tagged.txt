0.00 84.50 speaker0  Salutations and greetings, friendos of all shapes and sizes. It's your geometry, Professor Wolf the dog, hittin' you up from the past. And I am here celebrating every hexagon I see, because that's just how Professor Wolfie likes to roll. And I'm rollin' in filth, live from the past, from 694.2 PTBP. Now we bout to roll on over to a new howlin' with Wolf. This week's howlin' with Wolf is simple. Name, Ahmed Adudi. Message, I have nipples, fucker. Could you milk me? Listen here, Ahmed Adudi. I don't know what you're tryin' to pull, but you better be happy I'm trapped here in the past, because I don't milk no one, lest we got prior arrangements made. I take the art of milkin' quite seriously, and it sounds like you're tryin' to play me for a fool. Last time I milked a stranger on the internet, I ended up with two gallons of sour milk. And let me tell y'all, this wasn't no buttermilk. I tried to make me a big ol' stack of pancakes out of that shit, and it damn near burnt my esophagus.

112.00 154.00 speaker0  Get to the campin', cuz y'all deserve this tent. With all of the pros and none of the cons, it's Blue False Indigo with Boooooooon Daaaaaaams.
148.50 204.00 speaker2  She knows that the time has come dance beneath the shadow of the moon since this human face, this head, went back down beneath the bush out of sight, and you're just sitting there. What do you do?
203.50 237.50 speaker3  Okay. Cuz I don't have any intent of using, I didn't wanna use this axe, it was just kind of like an intimidation thing. Sure. I think this is a job for more than one boy, because you know, I've seen horror movies and when you go off by yourself and try to do something, it doesn't usually end up well. So, I mean, I know nothing's gonna end up well, but I don't want it to be this soon. So I run back to camp where
236.00 287.50 speaker2  Jeremy Pettymore. as there was no wood at this campsite, which caught you off guard as you had called earlier to make an arrangement to make sure there was wood at the campsite, which you mentioned was a very dutiful thing for a 14-year-old boy to have done, especially Jeremy Pettymore. This is the only thing.
284.50 293.50 speaker3  He doesn't, like, talk to adults on the phone.
290.00 334.50 speaker2  And as you're walking around, you don't notice anything out of the ordinary, you don't notice anything interesting, however, sprinting back into the campsite. What's going on, man?
325.00 416.00 speaker3  There's a man in a bush by that log, and he doesn't sound, he sounds like he's making animal noises. I went over to the bush, but I was too spooked, and... Do you want to come check it out with me? Yeah, absolutely. You should grab one of the machetes or axes just in case. And Ash is like, okay, and I lead the way back to the bush. I want to pick up a stick that is on the ground, and I want to just poke at the bush. Oh man, there's so many sticks on the ground. Yeah, I want to pick up the longest one I can find and poke the bush with it. You gotta roll to make sure you don't pick up a short one.
406.00 422.00 speaker2  They seem almost like cuts, and he's bleeding, and he looks at you with these huge eyes, and he just freezes and stares at you.
420.50 429.00 speaker3  Yeah, I bring that up. Do we recognize this man as any of the missing people?
425.00 474.50 speaker2  I can barely make out anybody in this picture, but I don't know. When you squint, does he look like the top man? I don't have that written down. Ash, it's that one! Did we learn his name?
472.50 497.50 speaker3  We got a... You wanna put some pants on? We got a first aid kit if you need it, or a machete. He kind of walks up toward you pretty quickly.
489.50 528.50 speaker2  And he's using his fingers, pushing his fingertips together, and he looks at you and his eyes get really big. And then he kind of like, droops down his eyes to make a sad, solemn face. Like a puppy dog face.
527.50 539.50 speaker3  We ought to bring him back to the old man. He sniffs the air.
538.50 543.50 speaker2  Should I follow suit? Or should we try to red rover him?
542.50 545.50 speaker3  You're in front of him. You're in between.
544.50 548.50 speaker2  Let's try to stop him.
545.50 560.50 speaker3  We make eye contact and just grab each other's arms and try to like, clothesline him.
557.50 573.50 speaker2  Coming across a man in this state in the woods. I fail. I pass. Jeremy Pettymore will lose none. This is kind of fun.
568.50 575.50 speaker3  He's been around his criminal uncles long enough to see what a naked cut-up man looks like.
573.50 620.50 speaker2  Yeah, I've seen plenty of this. Yeah, I trip over the log that's located right next to me. It's perfect. And I need Jeremy Pettymore to, if you're going to attempt to grab him alone, roll an unarmed combat for me. And the man makes it right past through you and takes off running. And as he's running, I want you both to roll a humant for me.
619.50 640.50 speaker3  41 on a 50.
630.50 673.50 speaker2  And Jeremy, you see as he brushes past you and continues to sprint in his own way, this is not the sprint of a normal human man. Like, way too fast. Not only is it very fast, but he's also crouched. And as he comes across like any brush on the ground, he's using his front legs, I mean arms, to help him in his transport. So he's running on all fours essentially. And he is making his way directly to your campsite.
671.50 675.50 speaker3  Fuck, that shit is, I hate that.
673.50 676.50 speaker2  That's exactly what I'm imagining.
675.50 686.50 speaker3  It's really unnerving. Actually, probably not, she was probably homeschooled. That's it, that's a little bit of a relief.
685.50 703.50 speaker2  One can only hope.
701.50 732.50 speaker3  He doesn't know what the fuck is going on. Yeah, and I'm still firmly holding onto that axe, but when I start sprinting, I'm one hand in it. I'm holding it like when a server, such as myself, holds a steak knife up against your arm, blade away, so that it doesn't cut me if I fall.
728.50 739.50 speaker2  Yeah, ironically, that's actually the worst way to hold an axe.
737.50 750.50 speaker3  Ash has never been a lumberjack.
741.50 817.50 speaker2  When you arrive at the campsite, you see that this man is hunched over, he is ripped apart, whichever bag had food in it that you guys brought, and he is just going to town on any snacks that you may have brought, and he checks mixes. My little smokies! Fuck. Like, absolutely covered your eye. Actually, go ahead and roll a dexterity for me to make sure you don't stab yourself with that lumberjack's demise. It's also good real playing to listen to your players. Yeah, it is.
816.50 831.50 speaker3  You're out! Yeah, if so, he's a beast. It was a grave. You can pause it and play it back if you want. No, I appreciate the bluff.
829.50 853.50 speaker2  And I trust Ash Hornbeam. Right, so Jeremy Pettymore calls you out, and then does what?
846.50 863.50 speaker3  Disguise. Jeremy Pettymore is going to charge the naked man.
861.50 900.50 speaker2  So he's maybe belly on the ground. Prone eating little smokies and Chex mix. Yeah, let's go ahead and roll that unarmed. I'll still give you a plus 20 because he is busy. Critical success. Oh, shit. Well, then describe exactly what you would like to do with this giant, bloody, cut-up man. Naked. He's naked.
895.50 912.50 speaker3  and with the other, he just pushes the dude on the forehead straight off away from our backpack of food.
909.50 918.50 speaker2  and he looks at you, and he's just hissing. I want to throw the can at him.
917.50 920.50 speaker3  Brother, I've got more.
918.50 932.50 speaker2  That'll be athletics. Sail! The little smokies. Sail. Sail.
931.50 940.50 speaker3  Which is what I meant to do. I just wanted to throw a warning shot across his bow, his proverbial bow.
935.50 954.50 speaker2  Well, it actually seems to help because he immediately runs away toward them. He runs behind where he was, further away from you, and goes and grabs the can of little smokies and is attempting to open it, but cannot quite figure out how to do it.
950.50 962.50 speaker3  Did that ranger mention any way we could contact him out here? Shoot a gunshot. Oh, come on. Yeah, but maybe this thing will run away.
961.50 965.50 speaker2  What is that? I kind of would...
964.50 990.50 speaker3  We need to bring him in. Before you do that, I... What if we just keep giving him smokies? Ash is on the wrestling team, so Ash goes over and... Well, fuck it. leg lock him, and then...
985.50 1035.50 speaker2  So as you run up to him to do this, or even walk up to him to do this, he's going to take off running with the little smokies. In order to catch him before he dips, I need you to roll an athletics check against his own. Now we're going to go unarmed combat straight up and down against each other. Passed with a 26 on a 50. positive space.
1033.50 1078.50 speaker3  of towards where the pile of food is. So what's important? Or actually, I give him a knee in the face since that's closer, and then while that's kind of got him off guard, I just full Nelson him, push his face into the mud, and then I lock my legs around his legs so that he is pretty much immobile. Like Eddie Murphy. Perhaps found in the camping equipment from the Bronco or the other car. A hundred percent. And I want to tie him up while Luke's got him... Yeah. Got him wrestled down.
1072.50 1097.50 speaker2  If anyone knows how to tie up a naked man, it's Jeremy Pettymore. at the family get together. it, Jeremy.
1095.50 1102.50 speaker3  That's his fourth jar of moonshine. I get the rope ready.
1100.50 1129.50 speaker2  Take his keys and grab the rope.
1125.50 1134.50 speaker3  It was basically just said that faith is...
1133.50 1139.50 speaker2  Exactly. I was raised.
1135.50 1146.50 speaker3  The Pettymore one says, mow the lawn and tie up Don.
1142.50 1171.50 speaker2  And there's a little picture of Don D. Pettymore that's also like... Anyway. You guys have a tied up, naked, bloody man. And currently, you both are also just covered in this blood and mud. Oh shit.
1170.50 1175.50 speaker3  Yeah. That makes sense. But other... All the mud and shit.
1174.50 1182.50 speaker2  Yeah. We're like 14 year old boys out in the woods. I think we probably feel pretty cool. Yeah. I bet you do. All right. Jeremy, are you also hand sanitizing?
1181.50 1255.50 speaker3  No. That's all I do though. I keep all the mud and muck and blood on me, because I really don't have anything to clean it off with. Okay. And then I kind of want to start trying to calm him down with another can of smoke. Jeremy, stay. You think I ought to... Okay. Sounds good. And I take off towards the shack. Perfect. That is a pass of 38 on a 39.
1254.50 1312.38 speaker2  Cool. As you're running, the trees begin to warp and the trail becomes almost non-existent in front of you. And you are immediately looking at trees instead of the trail ahead of you. And you turn around and it's just trees. And you have no fucking clue where you are. You're by yourself. The sun is going down and you are in the woods of contention.
1311.38 1313.38 speaker3  Hey Joe.
1312.38 1326.26 speaker2  Howdy. Going to meet my buddies. Going to meet your buddies.
1325.26 1334.98 speaker0  Alrighty.
1333.10 1345.26 speaker1  You tell me what happens.
1340.54 1351.66 speaker2  search and alertness and sanity are. And then we'll just describe it in character.
1350.66 1364.30 speaker3  I think that'd be kind of fun.
1363.30 1367.30 speaker1  I did indeed. A 50.
1366.30 1383.34 speaker2  Okay. As you're walking down, you think to yourself, yes, this trail is exactly how I roll. I remember it.
1381.06 1396.26 speaker1  An 87 on a 50.
1390.26 1441.10 speaker2  So you're, uh, so you're walking down the trail and you make your way all the way back to the campsite where you normally camp every year with Jeremy Pettymore and Ash Hornbeam. And when you arrive from a distance, you can see two figures. One is Jeremy Pettymore and the other is not Ash Hornbeam, but rather it is an adult man He's cut all over his body and he has been tied up hands and ankles and then tied to
1439.90 1471.80 speaker1  Is he conscious? Little Smokies like the sausages. No, shark.
1469.00 1486.34 speaker2  I thought you were like cutting Ally with your...
1482.26 1493.82 speaker3  And then I have him put the blood in a vial and then I put it around my neck and then we have hoard sex.
1492.82 1512.86 speaker2  Call me... his blood. That's a lie. The 90s were crazy. What the fuck?
1511.74 1523.10 speaker1  He wanted the blood, really. He was just after the blood. I've tasted blood. Yeah, I think we all...
1522.10 1536.54 speaker2  You're being weird about it. You sat down and had a flight of blood or something.
1535.54 1538.54 speaker1  I've tasted blood. Okay, whatever.
1537.54 1540.54 speaker3  We've all done it.
1539.54 1548.22 speaker2  A woman specifically?
1547.22 1552.34 speaker1  Oh. Yeah. Like type O, positive. That's a good one, Shadow.
1551.22 1559.50 speaker2  Hey, name all the rest of them.
1558.50 1581.34 speaker1  Is C a blood type? A, B, O. C. Um, C, bitch.
1580.34 1582.34 speaker0  You know what they say.
1581.34 1619.18 speaker1  C is get degrees. C. I don't know why I keep doing that. Why is not my reaction to things? What are you doing? I keep going.
1614.18 1622.18 speaker2  And also like rolling her eyes in the back of her head while shoving both pinkies up her nose.
1619.18 1635.02 speaker1  She's a little bit like a fish out of water with pinkies.
1633.02 1639.02 speaker2  That'd be normal because that's what you do.
1638.02 1648.02 speaker1  Burn myself. I did it first. So it's a joke. We don't do that anymore. That's so earlier in the episode. Yeah, that's so.
1647.02 1663.86 speaker2  That's so last episode.
1660.86 1675.86 speaker1  you start coughing and then you throw up in your hand and then you run to the bathroom and then you throw up your guts for like five straight minutes while your friends sort of laugh and awkwardly sit in a room?
1674.86 1705.20 speaker4  Same. It's a pretty big toilet. It's pretty big. Farts is just a joke toilet for farts. For farts. It just has a joke hole for farts?
1698.70 1772.94 speaker2  You guys were in the parking lot and you were talking to Woodrow, the state ranger who is now looking over the contention woods and he jumped out at you and said boo because it's spoopy time as we said it's fall and he wants you to come to the shack and fill out some forms. a slight inventory of what you have on your persons and then you can fill out some forms, I'll take some pictures of you and then you'll head on into the woods. on all of them and so if you see any of them in their woods then you need to let me know.
1768.42 1782.54 speaker1  aren't taken of me and I don't fill out forms and I don't show you what's inside my bag normally when I go places.
1778.32 1784.54 speaker2  a picture of it and then you can just tell me everything that you got now come on down
1783.54 1845.42 speaker1  Whatever, can we just do this? Let's just do this so we can just go. I'm actually, I'm in witness protection program and so like my face can't be like photographed.
1842.70 1857.54 speaker4  a bumper sticker on it that says world's greatest son? You're right, you're right, it's not my mom, it's not.
1856.54 1865.74 speaker1  Calm down.
1860.70 1901.18 speaker4  also accidentally ran their key onto it but it wasn't me, it was probably another kid. They live in a gated community though, like is that possible to steal from the gated community? It's possible, right? It's totally fine.
1897.74 1903.34 speaker2  Correction, I am kneeling, I'm trying to get on his eye level.
1901.82 1911.34 speaker3  I'm letting him smell my hand. Uh-huh. And I'm giving him smokies with the other.
1908.46 1915.66 speaker2  And as you're doing that, you hear...
1913.10 1926.14 speaker4  Jeremy, what the fuck is going on? Oh hey man. Sir, sir, can you hear me? And I'm talking to the...
1925.74 1933.42 speaker3  Yeah. Take your Polaroid, you see all them missing folks? Uh-huh. Look at this here Polaroid of them missing folks.
1932.46 1945.58 speaker2  See the top left? Jeremy shows you a Polaroid that was taken of the board of the missing people, and there are tiny little Polaroids inside of this picture showing the faces. You can kind of make out the faces.
1944.70 1956.86 speaker3  Gotcha. One of them is that guy.
1955.90 1968.46 speaker4  You found him. Yeah, we saved him.
1962.62 2000.06 speaker3  and so Ash is on his way to the ranger station to take him back to civilization, and I'm trying to tame him with smokeless. How'd you find him?
1995.90 2003.42 speaker2  is that Ash just went down the trail, and you also...
2002.38 2032.70 speaker4  I didn't see Ash. I just came from the trail. He wasn't there. I didn't see him. I mean, he just went down. I just came from the trail.
2028.86 2036.14 speaker2  who is sniffing at Jeremy Pettymore's fingers.
2034.06 2059.82 speaker4  It's a 36 on a 35.
2053.58 2075.34 speaker2  Looking at this man, you no longer see humanity in his eyes, and you can only see this animalistic intent behind the eyes of this bloody, muddy, tied up human. Okay.
2073.58 2084.14 speaker3  so there was just a constant roar, and any infection I might get tomorrow is on your conscience.
2083.26 2131.74 speaker2  You know, just the day. Also, I rubbed infection all over his fingers earlier. That's what I call my pussy. All right.
2130.30 2142.88 speaker4  That's not a person. Of course it's a person. Look at his eyes. He's like feral or some shit, Jeremy.
2142.38 2164.30 speaker3  Jeez. civilized gentleman, and yes, yes, sir, and no, ma'am, and thank you, please? No, it's wild fuckers in the woods.
2160.22 2220.08 speaker4  We were gonna roast marshmallows, and we were gonna tell ghost stories, and we were gonna fall asleep way too early and wake up way too early. Ken, he's real friendly. Why don't you give him some fokies? Give him some fokies. Fuck no, I'm not going near him. Give him some fokies. Fuck no. Ash! Yeah, look at him. He's a little rusty.
2216.64 2223.84 speaker1  Well, it's sort of, it's like you, uh, Mr. Rogers.
2220.08 2237.20 speaker4  It's like a fucking nightmare trying to get a room noise with Luke. Yeah.
2233.44 2251.68 speaker1  and not make any noise, and you're like, what do I do? His name is Thomas. Right, Thomas. Something petty more.
2250.48 2258.00 speaker5  It's always something different. Gavin. Gavin.
2257.52 2261.36 speaker3  Gavin.
2258.00 2263.70 speaker5  Gavin is such a little slut whore. Frickin Gavin Pettymore.
2263.20 2270.08 speaker3  Whoa.
2269.76 2279.12 speaker5  Yeah.
2276.80 2288.40 speaker2  You hear from all the way in the shack. Now he's all the way in there and there's a little like open window. I don't know what you would call that. Like, uh, that you would walk up to.
2287.92 2290.40 speaker1  Exactly.
2288.40 2299.76 speaker2  Thank you so much, Lindsay.
2297.84 2302.56 speaker4  Like he seems pretty scary.
2300.16 2310.96 speaker5  He's not going to let us go into the woods until we take a picture. So just like, let him take a picture of us.
2309.20 2319.20 speaker1  and then he can put our picture up. Yeah.
2316.00 2336.96 speaker4  look so beautiful and like we don't.
2335.44 2347.92 speaker5  Can we just go into the woods please?
2347.52 2362.56 speaker2  It was like,
2360.40 2379.76 speaker5  Like your body isn't capable of burping. My body isn't capable of burping so it does this.
2378.56 2398.72 speaker1  Being Lindsay is pain. Let's just take the picture. Okay.
2396.00 2400.48 speaker2  who has the best alertness?
2399.68 2403.12 speaker1  I have 50. I have 50.
2402.80 2425.12 speaker2  All right. Well, let's have both of you roll. Why not?
2424.64 2463.92 speaker1  Oh my God. It was my first roll. So Lindsay. No.
2462.24 2469.20 speaker2  So it's price is right rules.
2468.40 2473.76 speaker1  I'm more alert.
2472.16 2529.52 speaker2  You both see everything. So in this little shack, there are some clipboards hanging on the walls. You've got one fire extinguisher. There is one ax, one machete, one flashlight. There's a giant thing of hand sanitizer that is sitting out on the like front, on the ledge. What's a ledge of a window called? A sill. It's on the sill. And there's, let's see what else. the bulletin board with a sheet of paper. It's got information on it, like behind each picture. And then he like kind of points at one side of them are sectioned off. And he's like, and those are the ones that are missing. So obviously be careful in there.
2527.28 2543.20 speaker5  Do I have something I can like take a picture of it with?
2540.32 2558.16 speaker2  That way, you know what the pictures of the people look like who are in the pictures. know. So, and then he just snaps a picture of Liz.
2554.00 2569.52 speaker1  weird that 18 people have gone missing in the woods and you're still letting us go into the woods as female minors without any adult supervision.
2567.76 2615.84 speaker2  looking to have a good time in the woods this evening. So Liz, I already know your name for some reason because you must have told me earlier. No. Okay. And if you were to go missing, where would we look for you first in order to find you quickest? Cause you're looking all higgly piggly and I'm just worried that y'all are going to be out here raising sand.
2615.12 2618.64 speaker5  In a tree. All right.
2616.64 2640.40 speaker2  This one's got a cap and wumpus mind. And I like that about you. All right. So, uh, he writes all that down and then he sticks the picture in the thumbtack and throws up the Polaroid and lifts it up and snaps a picture of you. What's that picture look like?
2639.44 2658.64 speaker1  Kind of deadly. And when I say deadly, I don't mean like the picture could kill. I mean like the person in the picture was killed and looks a little dead. Um, it's, it's my makeup. It's, it's not like...
2657.60 2661.36 speaker2  Deadly and gaunt.
2659.68 2671.84 speaker1  Like dead-ish. Not really deadly. You know, like just like dead-like. And I think that's all that needs to be described.
2670.08 2686.16 speaker2  You were just barking on a knot out here. What's your name? Shadow. All right. That's it. Is that a normal name for these times? What year is it? You don't know? I don't know. Let's leave it at that.
2684.00 2688.96 speaker1  That's what my parents wanted to call me. Sure.
2687.12 2702.96 speaker2  And, uh, same question. What are you doing out here in the woods?
2699.44 2708.00 speaker1  crawls on the earth and the moon. All right.
2706.16 2710.56 speaker2  He's reading off the paper again.
2709.28 2716.00 speaker5  Do you bring anything with you?
2713.76 2721.20 speaker2  What with your earthly moon activities?
2720.88 2739.84 speaker1  Yeah. stronger, but like a tree. Bitch.
2738.24 2752.32 speaker2  And for you, what is your name? Young Liz. Miss. My name's Judy.
2750.00 2763.68 speaker5  She's just pumping the hand sanitizer into her hand. Like it's falling out of her hand.
2760.16 2797.68 speaker2  Uh, any hand sanitizer for the other two? Absolutely not. And I would suggest that both of you take Ashford into the initiative that your friend here did as well in order to have clean hands. What does that mean?
2795.12 2805.44 speaker1  like I'm just wondering if we could like take the machete with us.
2804.24 2812.80 speaker5  Oh my God.
2810.88 2819.12 speaker2  My clean and new friend.
2814.40 2829.76 speaker4  Uh, we're just camping just for normal camping reasons. And I'm just doing whatever they are doing.
2825.92 2832.96 speaker2  but did you bring anything with you that is not also for camping?
2832.48 2838.40 speaker4  I'm sorry. I stole it.
2835.28 2853.84 speaker2  I will now offer it to both of your friends. That way, you know that I would have offered it to you as well. He like puts his hand on top of it and moves it toward you.
2850.56 2866.96 speaker1  I sort of think that like when people are supposed to die from germs, they should just let it happen.
2866.16 2871.84 speaker5  53. 53.
2870.64 2899.70 speaker2  What is your dexterity? Oh. So right before your hand gets out of the way, quite a bit of hand sanitizer glooshes right onto those palms. Right onto those pinchy boys. And you get hand sanitizer and it's like too much that you couldn't even like wipe it like together.
2898.98 2909.94 speaker5  Okay.
2907.70 2918.42 speaker4  I don't even care that much, so it's fine.
2917.62 2946.10 speaker2  All right, cool. What is your reason for not being here? I've already filled out that one. No, I already wrote that down as well. Oh yes. If you were to be hiding in the woods somewhere, where am I to re-find you?
2942.98 2958.66 speaker4  Probably just like whatever tree Liz is in. It's probably where I'd be.
2954.58 3031.22 speaker2  And the thumbtacks with the pictures go up on the board in the non-missing section. And he looks back up and he says, well, I think that each of you should have an excellent day. And, uh, yeah. And you notice as he turns around to post the thumbtacks into the bulletin board, you see that there's a slight trickle of blood going down the back of his neck. And it is starting to stain the uniform that he is wearing. He's looking around at just trees surrounding him. And then he hears a noise and looking in the direction of this noise, you see that there's a tree that is emitting light from like a hollow point. What are those called? They're like little round.
3029.78 3032.42 speaker3  I used to put stuff in. Exactly.
3031.70 3037.54 speaker2  It's one of those.
3034.74 3042.10 speaker3  It's like, put the money in the tree hole.
3040.18 3057.46 speaker2  oh, there might be some loud money over here. And you see that there is a bright light shining from inside this hole.
3056.02 3077.38 speaker3  Just trees all around. Go ahead and roll.
3075.94 3107.22 speaker2  shining tree that's making this noise. You feel this like great sense of pride in yourself. That way you're looking directly into camera.
3104.58 3109.38 speaker3  And I go, not this time audience.
3108.82 3134.90 speaker2  It's good. Good. It's important. So you are on the other side and you are right near this tree and you see that this light is emitting so brightly lit from inside the tree that you can't see what is inside this crevasse, this wooden crevice. But there's something inside. There's something deep in there.
3131.22 3139.06 speaker3  If I get like right up near it, it's not like blinding light, is it? No.
3135.14 3153.54 speaker2  If I get like right up near it, how big is the whole face sized? No, it's more like a forearm sized. Oh, okay.
3148.18 3179.38 speaker3  And I stick my hand into the hole and feel around up to my elbow. Yes. Okay.
3175.62 3214.74 speaker2  and your forearm seems to fit perfectly up to the elbow inside this hole. Up to my elbow? All the way. from elbow to fingertip.
3210.66 3245.54 speaker3  Dang, so this is like noodling but in the woods instead of the water. I don't hurt myself if I stay here but pulling out would be worse. Or like a finger trap.
3238.66 3338.82 speaker2  makes its way out probably a centimeter's worth is not there anymore and it is just
3314.98 3342.66 speaker6  She moves With the howling wind The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon
