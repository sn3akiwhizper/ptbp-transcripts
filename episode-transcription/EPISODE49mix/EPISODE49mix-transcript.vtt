00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Salutations and greetings, friendos of all shapes and sizes.

00:05.500 --> 00:10.500
It's your geometry, Professor Wolf the dog, hittin' you up from the past.

00:10.500 --> 00:14.500
And I am here celebrating every hexagon I see,

00:14.500 --> 00:18.500
because that's just how Professor Wolfie likes to roll.

00:18.500 --> 00:25.500
And I'm rollin' in filth, live from the past, from 694.2 PTBP.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Now we bout to roll on over to a new howlin' with Wolf.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
This week's howlin' with Wolf is simple.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Name, Ahmed Adudi.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
Message, I have nipples, fucker. Could you milk me?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.500
Listen here, Ahmed Adudi.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.000
I don't know what you're tryin' to pull,

00:47.000 --> 00:50.500
but you better be happy I'm trapped here in the past,

00:50.500 --> 00:55.000
because I don't milk no one, lest we got prior arrangements made.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.500
I take the art of milkin' quite seriously,

00:58.500 --> 01:02.500
and it sounds like you're tryin' to play me for a fool.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.500
Last time I milked a stranger on the internet,

01:05.500 --> 01:08.500
I ended up with two gallons of sour milk.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.500
And let me tell y'all, this wasn't no buttermilk.

01:11.500 --> 01:15.500
I tried to make me a big ol' stack of pancakes out of that shit,

01:15.500 --> 01:18.500
and it damn near burnt my esophagus.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.500

Get to the campin', cuz y'all deserve this tent.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.500
With all of the pros and none of the cons,

01:58.500 --> 02:05.500
it's Blue False Indigo with Boooooooon Daaaaaaams.

02:05.500 --> 02:11.500
She runs

02:11.500 --> 02:13.000
oooh

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
The sun

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
is sleeping soon

02:28.500 --> 02:34.000
She knows

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
that the time has come

02:38.500 --> 02:42.500
to dance beneath the

02:42.500 --> 02:48.500
dance beneath the shadow of the moon

02:54.500 --> 03:00.500
Luke, you said that it has felt like ages in the mind of Ash Hornbeam

03:00.500 --> 03:07.000
since this human face, this head, went back down beneath the bush out of sight,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.500
and you're just sitting there. What do you do?

03:09.500 --> 03:12.500
I get up and I go over to the bush with axe in hand.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.500
As you approach the bush, you hear like a

03:19.500 --> 03:23.500
I turn heel and I run back to camp as soon as I hear that.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.000
Okay.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.500
Cuz I don't have any intent of using, I didn't wanna use this axe,

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
it was just kind of like an intimidation thing.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.000
Sure.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.500
But whatever I just saw and whatever I just heard, yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
I think this is a job for more than one boy, because

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
you know, I've seen horror movies and when you go off by yourself and try to do something,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
it doesn't usually end up well.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
So, I mean, I know nothing's gonna end up well, but I don't want it to be this soon.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
So I run back to camp where

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
To meet up with Jeremy Pettymore.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Jeremy Pettymore.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.500
Jeremy Pettymore.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.000
Jerahim Pettymore.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, that is correct.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.500
Okay.

04:03.500 --> 04:22.000
Jeremy Pettymore, you're standing at your campsite and you've been looking around for anything out of the ordinary

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
as there was no wood at this campsite, which caught you off guard as you had called earlier

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
to make an arrangement to make sure there was wood at the campsite,

04:31.500 --> 04:38.000
which you mentioned was a very dutiful thing for a 14-year-old boy to have done, especially Jeremy Pettymore.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah, and not necessarily for a 14-year-old boy, but definitely for Jeremy Pettymore.

04:42.000 --> 04:42.500
Absolutely.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
This is the only thing.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.500
He doesn't, like, talk to adults on the phone.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.000
That makes a whole lot of sense.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.500
And as you're walking around, you don't notice anything out of the ordinary,

04:53.500 --> 04:59.500
you don't notice anything interesting, however, sprinting back into the campsite.

05:00.000 --> 05:12.000
Jeremy, Ash comes in, who typically has a level head, tends to keep cool, but you can tell that I am perturbed.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
What's going on, man?

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
As far as I could discern, there's literally nothing of interest in this entire vicinity.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
And you see me, like, two hand-wielding an axe with white knuckles, and I'm like,

05:25.000 --> 05:34.500
There's a man in a bush by that log, and he doesn't sound, he sounds like he's making animal noises.

05:34.500 --> 05:39.500
I went over to the bush, but I was too spooked, and...

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
Do you want to come check it out with me?

05:41.500 --> 05:42.500
Yeah, absolutely.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.500
You should grab one of the machetes or axes just in case.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
I've got this gun!

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
That is true!

05:49.500 --> 05:55.000
And Ash is like, okay, and I lead the way back to the bush.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.500
As you get back to the bush, you notice the exact same bush is still rustling with movement, and you hear a

06:07.500 --> 06:11.500
I want to pick up a stick that is on the ground, and I want to just poke at the bush.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.000
Oh man, there's so many sticks on the ground.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.500
Yeah, I want to pick up the longest one I can find and poke the bush with it.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.000
You gotta roll to make sure you don't pick up a short one.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.500
Uh, it's 93 feet long.

06:24.500 --> 06:34.000
You find the longest stick in the forest, and you poke at this bush from a distance, clearly, and you hear a

06:35.500 --> 06:46.000
And stepping back away from the bush is a naked human man who has scratches all over his body, and some are deeper than scratches.

06:46.000 --> 06:56.000
They seem almost like cuts, and he's bleeding, and he looks at you with these huge eyes, and he just freezes and stares at you.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.500
Thinking back to those Polaroids, the Polaroid of the Polaroids.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.000
Yeah, I bring that up.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Do we recognize this man as any of the missing people?

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
I can barely make out anybody in this picture, but I don't know.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
When you squint, does he look like the top man?

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah, we start squinting and squinting at the picture and looking up at the naked man, and then back.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
What would be a check that you could use to discern?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.500
I mean, as long as we don't have facial aphasia, I think that's uh...

07:22.500 --> 07:24.000
Do you have facial aphasia?

07:24.000 --> 07:24.500
No.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.500
Okay, then you can tell that it...

07:25.500 --> 07:27.000
I don't have that written down.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.500
Then you can tell that it is one of the people who has gone missing.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.500
Ash, it's that one!

07:33.500 --> 07:34.500
Did we learn his name?

07:34.500 --> 07:41.500
No, you did not, and it is much harder to read the names on this Polaroid than to see faces.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
Hey, hey guy?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.500
Wait, what time is it right now? Is it dark out?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
No, the sun is going down currently.

07:48.500 --> 07:52.500
Guy, it gets cold out here after the sun goes down this time of year.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.500
We got a... You wanna put some pants on?

07:54.500 --> 07:57.500
We got a first aid kit if you need it, or a machete.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.500
He kind of walks up toward you pretty quickly.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
Ooh, I point the gun at him.

08:02.500 --> 08:09.500
You point the gun at him, and that does not change his movement as his hands come together.

08:09.500 --> 08:17.500
And he's using his fingers, pushing his fingertips together, and he looks at you and his eyes get really big.

08:17.500 --> 08:23.500
And then he kind of like, droops down his eyes to make a sad, solemn face.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
Like a puppy dog face.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.500
Like a puppy dog eyes.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.500
I look at Ash.

08:29.500 --> 08:33.500
You should follow us back to the shack.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.500
Ash, what the hell, man? We don't want to take this thing anywhere.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.500
Well, it doesn't seem like he's going to hurt us, and honestly...

08:39.500 --> 08:47.500
He's a naked dog, man. I want to get him away from our campsite, but he's in that missing persons thing.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
We ought to bring him back to the old man.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
He sniffs the air.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.500
Oh right, our civic duty.

08:51.500 --> 08:58.500
And he looks back, and he looks behind you, and he smells the air, and he's going to start running for where your campsite is.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
Should I follow suit?

08:59.500 --> 09:01.500
Or should we try to red rover him?

09:01.500 --> 09:02.500
Are we in front of him, or...?

09:02.500 --> 09:03.500
You're in front of him. You're in between.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.500
Yeah.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.500
Let's try to stop him.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.500
We make eye contact and just grab each other's arms and try to like, clothesline him.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.500
Red rover, red rover, send freak boy right over.

09:11.500 --> 09:17.500
Go ahead and roll sanity for me, both of you, because this is not a normal situation.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.500
Coming across a man in this state in the woods.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.500
I fail.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
I pass.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.500
Okay, Luke, Ash Hornbeam is going to lose one sanity.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.500
Jeremy Pettymore will lose none.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.500
This is kind of fun.

09:28.500 --> 09:33.500
He's been around his criminal uncles long enough to see what a naked cut-up man looks like.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.500
Yeah, I've seen plenty of this.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.500
Like, you get into the shine a little too much.

09:38.500 --> 09:46.500
So as you guys reach out to each other to red rover, Ash freaks out and backs away and is going to let this guy go right through.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.500
Yeah, I trip over the log that's located right next to me.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
It's perfect.

09:50.500 --> 09:58.500
And I need Jeremy Pettymore to, if you're going to attempt to grab him alone, roll an unarmed combat for me.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.500
Ooh, fail, 67 on a 50.

10:03.500 --> 10:08.500
And the man makes it right past through you and takes off running.

10:08.500 --> 10:13.500
And as he's running, I want you both to roll a humant for me.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.500
Ooh, pass, 27 on a 40.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.500
41 on a 50.

10:20.500 --> 10:30.500
Alright, so you would both realize as he's running away from you, Ash you see from the ground on your butt after falling from tripping over this log.

10:30.500 --> 10:40.500
And Jeremy, you see as he brushes past you and continues to sprint in his own way, this is not the sprint of a normal human man.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
Like, way too fast.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.500
Not only is it very fast, but he's also crouched.

10:45.500 --> 10:58.500
And as he comes across like any brush on the ground, he's using his front legs, I mean arms, to help him in his transport.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.500
So he's running on all fours essentially.

11:01.500 --> 11:06.500
And he is making his way directly to your campsite.

11:06.500 --> 11:11.500
Have you seen that video of that horse girl who runs like a horse and jumps over stuff?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
Fuck, that shit is, I hate that.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
That's exactly what I'm imagining.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
It's really unnerving.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.500
And it's also terrifying, and people went to high school with that person.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
Actually, probably not, she was probably homeschooled.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.500
That's it, that's a little bit of a relief.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
One can only hope.

11:26.500 --> 11:32.500
I get off my butt and I start regularly running back to the campsite.

11:32.500 --> 11:39.500
Yeah, Jeremy Fettymore has certainly never seen anybody whose mind has been switched with that of a common house animal.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.500
No, Jeremy doesn't anymore.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.500
He doesn't know what the fuck is going on.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.500
He runs after it too.

11:46.500 --> 11:51.500
And he's kind of trembling with the pistol in his hand, but he's like, mister, I'll shoot.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
I'll do it.

11:52.500 --> 11:59.500
Yeah, and I'm still firmly holding onto that axe, but when I start sprinting, I'm one hand in it.

11:59.500 --> 12:08.500
I'm holding it like when a server, such as myself, holds a steak knife up against your arm, blade away, so that it doesn't cut me if I fall.

12:08.500 --> 12:12.500
Yeah, ironically, that's actually the worst way to hold an axe.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.500
They call that the lumberjack's demise.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.500
Well, I have never been a lumberjack.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.500
Ash has never been a lumberjack.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.500
He thinks that's the best way to do it, so that's how I do it.

12:21.500 --> 12:30.500
When you arrive at the campsite, you see that this man is hunched over, he is ripped apart, whichever bag had food in it that you guys brought,

12:30.500 --> 12:35.500
and he is just going to town on any snacks that you may have brought, and he checks mixes.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.500
My little smokies!

12:42.500 --> 12:49.500
Ash, without thinking, drops the axe, takes a running jump, and just both feet into this guy's head, kicks him off the food.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.500
Oh shit, Ash! Kicked him in the face!

12:51.500 --> 12:56.500
Roll an unarmed combat, and I'll give you a plus 20.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.500
Fuck.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.500
78 on what would be, with a plus 20, 70.

13:02.500 --> 13:14.500
He ducks right out of the way, he rolled an aught 7, and he continues to feast as you slide on your back, and you get covered in mud.

13:14.500 --> 13:22.500
Like, absolutely covered your eye. Actually, go ahead and roll a dexterity for me to make sure you don't stab yourself with that lumberjack's demise.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.500
I already, I said I dropped it before I did the flying kick.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.500
Well, that's extremely smart of you.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.500
It's also good real playing to listen to your players.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.500
Yeah, it is.

13:31.500 --> 13:36.500
As I slide in the mud, I hear Jeremy Pettymore go,

13:36.500 --> 13:37.500
You're out!

13:40.500 --> 13:42.500
I didn't hear it either, so for all we know, he's just lying.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.500
Yeah, if so, he's a beast.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.500
It was a grave.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
You can pause it and play it back if you want.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
No, I appreciate the bluff.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.500
And I trust Ash Hornbeam.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.500
Yeah, he's inherently really cool.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.500
Right, so Jeremy Pettymore calls you out, and then does what?

13:59.500 --> 14:05.500
Jeremy is going to look at his skill sheet that he hasn't seen in a couple weeks.

14:06.500 --> 14:13.500
Disguise. Jeremy Pettymore is going to charge the naked man.

14:13.500 --> 14:17.500
And how is the dude situated after his tussle with Luke?

14:17.500 --> 14:21.500
Oh, still crouched. He just crouched a little bit lower to get out of the way there.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
So he's maybe belly on the ground.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.500
Prone eating little smokies and Chex mix.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.500
He's got little weenies in his mouth and little Chexes on the ground.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.500
I'm going to just try to throw him off our food.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.500
Yeah, let's go ahead and roll that unarmed.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.500
I'll still give you a plus 20 because he is busy.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.500
Critical success.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.500
Oh, shit.

14:40.500 --> 14:46.500
Well, then describe exactly what you would like to do with this giant, bloody, cut-up man.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
Naked.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.500
He's naked.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.500
Jeremy Pettymore is like, give me those.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.500
And with one hand, he snatches the can of little smokies,

14:55.500 --> 15:00.500
and with the other, he just pushes the dude on the forehead straight off away from our backpack of food.

15:01.500 --> 15:09.500
So he backs up, and he gets on his haunches, and he's holding his hands up in front of him like a prairie dog,

15:09.500 --> 15:12.500
and he looks at you, and he's just hissing.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.500
I want to throw the can at him.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.500
You're going to waste your smokies?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
Brother, I've got more.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.500
That'll be athletics.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
Fail. 40 out of 30.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.500
You sail.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.500
Sail!

15:27.500 --> 15:29.500
The little smokies.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.500
Sail.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.500
Sail.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.500
Which is what I meant to do.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.500
I just wanted to throw a warning shot across his bow, his proverbial bow.

15:35.500 --> 15:40.500
Well, it actually seems to help because he immediately runs away toward them.

15:40.500 --> 15:46.500
He runs behind where he was, further away from you, and goes and grabs the can of little smokies

15:46.500 --> 15:50.500
and is attempting to open it, but cannot quite figure out how to do it.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.500
Did that ranger mention any way we could contact him out here?

15:55.500 --> 15:56.500
Shoot a gunshot.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.500
Oh, come on.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.500
Yeah, but maybe this thing will run away.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.500
What is that?

16:02.500 --> 16:03.500
I kind of would...

16:03.500 --> 16:04.500
Well, you're right.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500
We need to bring him in.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.500
Well, okay.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.500
Before you do that, I...

16:07.500 --> 16:09.500
What if we just keep giving him smokies?

16:09.500 --> 16:13.500
Ash is on the wrestling team, so Ash goes over and...

16:13.500 --> 16:15.500
Well, fuck it.

16:15.500 --> 16:21.500
Yeah, I go over, and I want to just full Nelson him and smash him onto the ground, and then

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
leg lock him, and then...

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
He's going to run away as soon as you approach him.

16:25.500 --> 16:30.500
So as you run up to him to do this, or even walk up to him to do this, he's going to take

16:30.500 --> 16:33.500
off running with the little smokies.

16:33.500 --> 16:41.500
In order to catch him before he dips, I need you to roll an athletics check against his own.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.500
A 12 on a 30.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.500
He rolled a 97.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.500
Hell yes.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.500
So you grab him.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.500
Now we're going to go unarmed combat straight up and down against each other.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.500
Can I support this?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
I failed.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.500
Passed with a 26 on a 50.

16:58.500 --> 17:03.500
You describe what you do, and then Thomas, you can put yourself in the situation in a

17:03.500 --> 17:04.500
positive space.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.500
I get up from my slide.

17:07.500 --> 17:13.500
I kick the can of little smokies before he can figure out how to open it up back kind

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
of towards where the pile of food is.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
So what's important?

17:16.500 --> 17:19.500
I give him a little elbow in the face since he...

17:19.500 --> 17:23.500
Or actually, I give him a knee in the face since that's closer, and then while that's

17:23.500 --> 17:29.500
kind of got him off guard, I just full Nelson him, push his face into the mud, and then

17:29.500 --> 17:34.500
I lock my legs around his legs so that he is pretty much immobile.

17:34.500 --> 17:39.500
You are a bloody muddy mess of a two clump person.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.500
I want to take a rope that we...

17:42.500 --> 17:43.500
Like Eddie Murphy.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.500
Perhaps found in the camping equipment from the Bronco or the other car.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.500
A hundred percent.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.500
And I want to tie him up while Luke's got him...

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
Yeah.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.500
Got him wrestled down.

17:52.500 --> 17:58.500
If anyone knows how to tie up a naked man, it's Jeremy Pettymore.

17:58.500 --> 18:08.500
Honestly, it falls far too often on the Pettymore children to hog tie the obliterated adults

18:08.500 --> 18:10.500
at the family get together.

18:10.500 --> 18:14.500
The other adults are too busy pouring more drinks, and they're just like, hey, handle

18:14.500 --> 18:15.500
it, Jeremy.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.500
That's his fourth jar of moonshine.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.500
I get the rope ready.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.500
Take his keys and grab the rope.

18:22.500 --> 18:28.500
Well, once a kid is old enough to push a lawnmower, he's old enough to tie up his uncle when he's...

18:28.500 --> 18:31.500
Which in the Pettymore family is like about three years old.

18:31.500 --> 18:37.500
I really hope that there's a beautiful circular cross stitch that says that in every Pettymore

18:37.500 --> 18:41.500
home.

18:41.500 --> 18:45.500
I'm trying to remember something specific that was in an ex-girlfriend's parents' house.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.500
It was basically just said that faith is...

18:49.500 --> 18:52.500
Being certain of what you hope for and sure of what you cannot see?

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
Yeah.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.500
Exactly.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.500
I was raised.

18:55.500 --> 18:59.500
The Pettymore one says, mow the lawn and tie up Don.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
Holy shit.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.500
Yeah.

19:02.500 --> 19:06.500
And there's a little picture of Don D. Pettymore that's also like...

19:06.500 --> 19:12.500
He's tied up and in the background, a little tiny Jeremy's just mowing the grass.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
Anyway.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
Anyway.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.500
You guys have a tied up, naked, bloody man.

19:17.500 --> 19:25.500
And currently, you both are also just covered in this blood and mud.

19:25.500 --> 19:29.500
I'm gonna sanitize my hands with the hand sanitizer.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.500
Oh shit.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
Yeah.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.500
That makes sense.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.500
But other...

19:33.500 --> 19:34.500
All the mud and shit.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.500
Yeah.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.500
We're like 14 year old boys out in the woods.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.500
I think we probably feel pretty cool.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.500
Yeah.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.500
I bet you do.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
All right.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
Jeremy, are you also hand sanitizing?

19:41.500 --> 19:42.500
No.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
That's all I do though.

19:43.500 --> 19:47.500
I keep all the mud and muck and blood on me, because I really don't have anything to clean

19:47.500 --> 19:48.500
it off with.

19:48.500 --> 19:52.500
I want to tie the wild man up to a tree.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.500
Okay.

19:53.500 --> 19:57.500
And then I kind of want to start trying to calm him down with another can of smoke.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.500
One at a time, giving him little smokies.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.500
And I'm trying to experiment with commands like, hey, sit.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.500
Jeremy, stay.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.500
You think I ought to...

20:06.500 --> 20:11.500
I mean, I can just run real fast back to the shack and go get that old man.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.500
Yeah.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.500
Let's split up.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.500
Okay.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.500
Sounds good.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.500
And I take off towards the shack.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
Perfect.

20:17.500 --> 20:26.500
Thomas, leave the room.

20:26.500 --> 20:46.780
Luke, as Ash Hornbeam runs back down the trail, I need you to make a sanity check.

20:46.780 --> 20:49.820
That is a pass of 38 on a 39.

20:49.820 --> 20:54.500
You are still going to lose one sanity, putting your current sanity at 38 now.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.500
Cool.

20:55.500 --> 21:05.660
As you're running, the trees begin to warp and the trail becomes almost non-existent

21:05.660 --> 21:07.780
in front of you.

21:07.780 --> 21:15.100
And you are immediately looking at trees instead of the trail ahead of you.

21:15.100 --> 21:18.740
And you turn around and it's just trees.

21:18.740 --> 21:22.620
And you have no fucking clue where you are.

21:22.620 --> 21:23.780
You're by yourself.

21:23.780 --> 21:30.900
The sun is going down and you are in the woods of contention.

21:30.900 --> 21:36.900
Exactly what I wanted to do.

21:36.900 --> 21:40.100
Perfect.

21:40.100 --> 21:47.420
Joe, Terry.

21:47.420 --> 21:51.380
That's me.

21:51.380 --> 21:52.380
Hey Joe.

21:52.380 --> 21:53.380
Howdy.

21:53.380 --> 22:00.180
I believe Ken Krenkelhoff was just walking down the trail, heading to his campsite.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.220
Going to meet my buddies.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.220
Going to meet your buddies.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.260
I got a couple checks for you to roll on your way there.

22:05.260 --> 22:06.260
Alrighty.

22:06.260 --> 22:07.260
First one's a survival check.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.860
Uh, I don't have my character sheet.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.260
Oh yeah, I have your character sheet.

22:10.260 --> 22:13.100
I was like, yeah, I'll just roll dice.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.980
You tell me what happens.

22:14.980 --> 22:20.540
I do eventually want to play a game where I am the only one who knows what you're like

22:20.540 --> 22:25.260
search and alertness and sanity are.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.360
And then we'll just describe it in character.

22:27.360 --> 22:30.660
That way you guys never know if you pass or fail.

22:30.660 --> 22:31.660
I think that'd be kind of fun.

22:31.660 --> 22:39.380
It would take away some of the dice rolling aspect, but it is what it is.

22:39.380 --> 22:43.300
I fail a 79 in my, you said survival, right?

22:43.300 --> 22:44.300
I did indeed.

22:44.300 --> 22:45.300
A 50.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.300
So I fail.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.300
Okay.

22:47.300 --> 22:50.500
As you're walking down, you think to yourself, yes, this trail is exactly how I roll.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.100
I remember it.

22:53.100 --> 22:59.540
And now I need you to roll an alertness check.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.060
I also fail that one.

23:01.060 --> 23:03.340
An 87 on a 50.

23:03.340 --> 23:08.260
All right, then nothing cool happens and you may as well fuck off.

23:08.260 --> 23:09.260
It's for real?

23:09.260 --> 23:10.260
No, I'm kidding.

23:10.260 --> 23:16.260
So you're, uh, so you're walking down the trail and you make your way all the way back

23:16.260 --> 23:23.040
to the campsite where you normally camp every year with Jeremy Pettymore and Ash Hornbeam.

23:23.040 --> 23:29.100
And when you arrive from a distance, you can see two figures.

23:29.100 --> 23:38.340
One is Jeremy Pettymore and the other is not Ash Hornbeam, but rather it is an adult man

23:38.340 --> 23:43.900
who is naked, who is covered in blood and mud.

23:43.900 --> 23:51.600
He's cut all over his body and he has been tied up hands and ankles and then tied to

23:51.600 --> 23:58.320
a tree and Jeremy Pettymore is waving little Smokies in front of his face.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.900
What the fuck?

23:59.900 --> 24:01.100
Is he conscious?

24:01.100 --> 24:02.100
Yes.

24:02.100 --> 24:04.240
Little Smokies like the sausages.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.640
What the fuck?

24:06.640 --> 24:23.480
Everyone is going to say that as he enters the clearing.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.480
Shark flips.

24:24.480 --> 24:27.000
Do you have sharp toenails right now?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
No, shark.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Shark.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.800
I thought you were like cutting Ally with your...

24:31.800 --> 24:32.800
Shark flip flops.

24:32.800 --> 24:33.800
Did she do that?

24:33.800 --> 24:34.800
Oh, all the time.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.220
All the time.

24:36.220 --> 24:39.720
Every time she comes in, she's like, look at me, I'm Sandra Dee and then she cuts me

24:39.720 --> 24:42.260
with her toenails.

24:42.260 --> 24:46.340
And then I have him put the blood in a vial and then I put it around my neck and then

24:46.340 --> 24:49.180
we have hoard sex.

24:49.180 --> 24:52.820
Call me Billy Bob Thornton.

24:52.820 --> 24:53.820
Call me...

24:53.820 --> 24:55.740
I don't get that.

24:55.740 --> 25:01.580
He used to wear Angelina Jolie's blood around his neck in a vial and she did the same with

25:01.580 --> 25:02.580
his blood.

25:02.580 --> 25:03.580
That's a lie.

25:03.580 --> 25:04.580
The 90s were crazy.

25:04.580 --> 25:05.580
What the fuck?

25:05.940 --> 25:06.940
That's a lie, right?

25:06.940 --> 25:11.740
And then Brad Pitt was like, give me some of that lot of blood.

25:11.740 --> 25:12.860
He wanted the blood, really.

25:12.860 --> 25:14.100
He was just after the blood.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.100
I've tasted blood.

25:16.100 --> 25:20.100
Yeah, I think we all...

25:20.100 --> 25:22.100
I think we've all tasted blood, Ally.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.100
You're being weird about it.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.460
I bite my lip on purpose every day.

25:25.460 --> 25:29.540
Ally said that she's tasted blood in an actual...

25:29.540 --> 25:32.660
You sat down and had a flight of blood or something.

25:32.660 --> 25:35.540
You acted as if you have sucked it from a woman.

25:35.540 --> 25:36.540
I've tasted blood.

25:36.540 --> 25:37.540
Okay, whatever.

25:37.540 --> 25:38.540
We've all done it.

25:38.540 --> 25:39.540
Right, right.

25:39.540 --> 25:40.540
A woman specifically?

25:40.540 --> 25:41.540
What kind of blood are you talking about, Lindsay?

25:41.540 --> 25:43.420
I said wound, but I meant wound.

25:43.420 --> 25:46.220
So would a flight of blood be like the different blood types?

25:46.220 --> 25:47.220
Oh.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.220
Oh.

25:48.220 --> 25:49.220
Yeah.

25:49.220 --> 25:50.220
Like type O, positive.

25:50.220 --> 25:51.220
That's a good one, Shadow.

25:51.220 --> 25:52.340
Hey, name all the rest of them.

25:52.340 --> 25:55.260
O negative, A, B, and C.

25:55.260 --> 25:58.500
Oh, so close.

25:58.500 --> 25:59.500
Is C a blood type?

25:59.500 --> 26:00.500
It's not.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.500
I think it's A and B. A and B are things, right?

26:03.340 --> 26:06.340
I can't wait to tell someone that I'm blood type C.

26:06.340 --> 26:07.340
A, B, O.

26:07.340 --> 26:08.340
What blood type?

26:08.340 --> 26:09.340
A, B, O.

26:09.340 --> 26:10.340
C.

26:10.340 --> 26:11.340
Um, C, bitch.

26:11.340 --> 26:13.340
Universal donor.

26:13.340 --> 26:15.340
Um, C.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.340
I don't really know anything against C.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.340
C plus, I think is what it is.

26:20.340 --> 26:21.340
You know what they say.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.340
C is get degrees.

26:22.340 --> 26:27.340
I'm a C student, so I have C plus blood.

26:27.340 --> 26:32.340
Do you think phlebotomists, when you leave, they're like, C plus.

26:33.180 --> 26:34.180
Yes.

26:34.180 --> 26:37.180
She clearly needed the crackers.

26:37.180 --> 26:40.180
I always need the crackers.

26:40.180 --> 26:42.180
Yeah, you're a C plus.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.180
C.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.180
I don't know why I keep doing that.

26:44.180 --> 26:46.180
Why is not my reaction to things?

26:46.180 --> 26:47.180
What are you doing?

26:47.180 --> 26:49.180
I keep going.

26:49.180 --> 26:52.180
It's an audio format, Taylor.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.180
She's sticking her tongue out for you listeners out there.

26:54.180 --> 26:59.180
And also like rolling her eyes in the back of her head while shoving both pinkies up her nose.

26:59.180 --> 27:02.180
She's a little bit like a fish out of water with pinkies.

27:03.020 --> 27:05.020
What if that was my initial reaction?

27:05.020 --> 27:10.020
It was just like you say something like ever so subtly offensive and I go.

27:10.020 --> 27:11.020
Oh my gosh.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.020
Yeah, Taylor.

27:12.020 --> 27:13.020
Oh dear God.

27:13.020 --> 27:15.020
That'd be normal because that's what you do.

27:15.020 --> 27:16.020
Because that's what I do.

27:16.020 --> 27:18.020
Burn on me.

27:18.020 --> 27:19.020
Burn myself.

27:19.020 --> 27:20.020
I did it first.

27:20.020 --> 27:23.020
So it's a joke.

27:23.020 --> 27:24.020
We don't do that anymore.

27:24.020 --> 27:26.020
That's so earlier in the episode.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.020
Yeah, that's so.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.020
That's so last episode.

27:28.020 --> 27:31.020
That's so pre throw up Taylor.

27:31.020 --> 27:32.020
Oh yeah.

27:32.860 --> 27:36.860
Taylor, do you want to talk about what happened the first time we sat down to record?

27:36.860 --> 27:40.860
You know how like when your friends just like relentlessly make fun of you so hard that

27:40.860 --> 27:43.860
you start coughing and then you throw up in your hand and then you run to the bathroom

27:43.860 --> 27:47.860
and then you throw up your guts for like five straight minutes while your friends sort of

27:47.860 --> 27:50.860
laugh and awkwardly sit in a room?

27:50.860 --> 27:54.860
What was I supposed to do if I went in there and I would throw up?

27:54.860 --> 27:55.860
Same.

27:55.860 --> 27:58.860
You could have thrown up with me.

27:58.860 --> 28:01.860
It's a pretty big toilet.

28:02.700 --> 28:03.700
It's pretty big.

28:03.700 --> 28:06.700
Farts is just a joke toilet for farts.

28:06.700 --> 28:07.700
For farts.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.700
It just has a joke hole for farts?

28:10.700 --> 28:13.700
You're not a part of turbo team.

28:13.700 --> 28:18.700
Alright, let's hop right on back in.

28:18.700 --> 28:25.200
You guys were in the parking lot and you were talking to Woodrow, the state ranger who is

28:25.200 --> 28:31.020
now looking over the contention woods and he jumped out at you and said boo because

28:31.180 --> 28:35.460
it's spoopy time as we said it's fall and he wants you to come to the shack and fill

28:35.460 --> 28:36.780
out some forms.

28:36.780 --> 28:40.700
Yeah, so if you don't mind just grab your camping gear, everything that you're gonna

28:40.700 --> 28:44.680
bring on in with you and we can talk about what you brought with you that way we have

28:44.680 --> 28:50.140
a slight inventory of what you have on your persons and then you can fill out some forms,

28:50.140 --> 28:53.980
I'll take some pictures of you and then you'll head on into the woods.

28:53.980 --> 29:00.280
This has never been protocol when Gary, I mean Jeb, used to do this.

29:00.280 --> 29:06.280
Well Gary, I mean Jeb is missing currently and we're looking for him but state sent

29:06.280 --> 29:11.040
me down here because there's about 18 missing people and I've got pictures and information

29:11.040 --> 29:16.760
on all of them and so if you see any of them in their woods then you need to let me know.

29:16.760 --> 29:20.440
We can get Officer Cox down here and take care of business.

29:20.440 --> 29:22.640
I don't think so.

29:22.640 --> 29:28.420
I don't know if you know my dad but he's like a lawyer and he really prefers when pictures

29:28.420 --> 29:32.940
aren't taken of me and I don't fill out forms and I don't show you what's inside my bag

29:32.940 --> 29:33.940
normally when I go places.

29:33.940 --> 29:38.320
Oh, I don't need to look inside your bag, I just need to look at your face and take

29:38.320 --> 29:42.540
a picture of it and then you can just tell me everything that you got now come on down

29:42.540 --> 29:43.540
to the shack.

29:43.540 --> 29:44.540
Whatever, can we just do this?

29:44.540 --> 29:45.540
Let's just do this so we can just go.

29:45.540 --> 29:49.940
I'm actually, I'm in witness protection program and so like my face can't be like photographed.

29:49.940 --> 29:54.220
Young lady, if you're in witness protection program then you have given yourself up.

29:54.220 --> 29:58.500
Okay, maybe I'm not in witness protection program but like, okay, fine, let's just do it.

29:58.500 --> 30:05.180
Um, Shadow, like if this guy is asking to take our picture because if in case we go

30:05.180 --> 30:11.340
missing then we should probably let him do it so the cops could find us if ever we were

30:11.340 --> 30:13.980
still missing like those other 18 people maybe.

30:13.980 --> 30:17.980
You hear, as he's walking away, he hollers back, he goes, that's exactly why we do it.

30:17.980 --> 30:20.460
Judy, why is your mom's car even here?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.740
Oh my gosh, oh no!

30:23.740 --> 30:33.660
What if my mom is one of the 18 people that is missing maybe in the woods?

30:33.660 --> 30:38.300
I wasn't implying that but like probably, but like what if it's not your mom?

30:38.300 --> 30:42.700
Right, what if it's just someone else that also drives the same car as my mom and has

30:42.700 --> 30:45.420
a bumper sticker on it that says world's greatest son?

30:45.420 --> 30:52.300
You're right, it's probably someone else.

30:52.300 --> 30:55.340
You're right, you're right, it's not my mom, it's not.

30:55.340 --> 30:56.540
Everyone loves their son.

30:56.540 --> 30:57.540
Calm down.

30:57.540 --> 31:00.700
There's that same scratch on the side from probably some other kid that she had that

31:00.700 --> 31:05.740
also accidentally ran their key onto it but it wasn't me, it was probably another kid.

31:05.740 --> 31:07.980
Someone probably just stole your mom's van, so calm down.

31:07.980 --> 31:10.460
Oh you're right, someone probably just stole it, it was totally fine.

31:10.460 --> 31:15.340
They live in a gated community though, like is that possible to steal from the gated community?

31:15.580 --> 31:16.540
It's possible, right?

31:16.540 --> 31:22.220
It's totally fine.

31:32.460 --> 31:37.740
Jeremy Pettymore, you are standing in front of this man.

31:37.740 --> 31:41.180
Correction, I am kneeling, I'm trying to get on his eye level.

31:41.820 --> 31:43.340
I'm letting him smell my hand.

31:44.060 --> 31:44.560
Uh-huh.

31:45.020 --> 31:47.100
And I'm giving him smokies with the other.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.460
Yeah, a hundred percent.

31:48.460 --> 31:51.340
And as you're doing that, you hear...

31:51.340 --> 31:51.980
What the fuck?

31:53.100 --> 31:55.660
Jeremy, what the fuck is going on?

31:55.660 --> 31:56.300
Oh hey man.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.140
Sir, sir, can you hear me?

32:00.140 --> 32:00.860
And I'm talking to the...

32:02.220 --> 32:04.700
Hey, did you talk to the ranger at all?

32:05.740 --> 32:06.140
Yeah.

32:06.140 --> 32:08.540
Take your Polaroid, you see all them missing folks?

32:08.540 --> 32:09.020
Uh-huh.

32:09.020 --> 32:11.260
Look at this here Polaroid of them missing folks.

32:11.260 --> 32:12.460
Hey, he's one of them, right?

32:12.460 --> 32:13.420
See the top left?

32:13.420 --> 32:18.780
Jeremy shows you a Polaroid that was taken of the board of the missing people,

32:18.780 --> 32:23.100
and there are tiny little Polaroids inside of this picture showing the faces.

32:23.100 --> 32:24.700
You can kind of make out the faces.

32:24.700 --> 32:25.580
Gotcha.

32:25.580 --> 32:26.540
One of them is that guy.

32:29.100 --> 32:32.700
Yeah, Ken looks back and forth, back and forth, squinty eyed, squinty eyed.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.260
I guess it kind of looks like him.

32:35.900 --> 32:36.860
You found him.

32:36.860 --> 32:38.300
Yeah, we saved him.

32:39.180 --> 32:42.620
And we tied him up and only wrestled with him a little bit,

32:42.620 --> 32:48.460
and so Ash is on his way to the ranger station to take him back to civilization,

32:48.460 --> 32:50.220
and I'm trying to tame him with smokeless.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.060
Why's he bleeding?

32:52.060 --> 32:53.340
Oh, he was like that when we found him.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.300
How'd you find him?

32:54.300 --> 32:57.420
Naked in the woods, acting like a wild man.

32:57.420 --> 32:59.020
Ken, roll intelligence for me real quick.

33:03.260 --> 33:04.700
Not my strong suit, but I passed.

33:06.300 --> 33:07.980
You just took a biology lesson.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.940
I passed with a two on a 25.

33:10.940 --> 33:15.900
Two on a 25 would let you know that what Jeremy just told you

33:15.900 --> 33:20.060
is that Ash just went down the trail, and you also...

33:22.380 --> 33:23.420
I didn't see Ash.

33:23.420 --> 33:24.620
I just came from the trail.

33:25.180 --> 33:25.740
He wasn't there.

33:25.740 --> 33:26.220
I didn't see him.

33:26.220 --> 33:27.420
I mean, he just went down.

33:27.420 --> 33:28.380
He just went down there.

33:28.380 --> 33:29.180
I didn't see him.

33:29.180 --> 33:30.060
I just came from the trail.

33:30.780 --> 33:31.280
Fuck.

33:32.460 --> 33:32.960
Ash!

33:34.300 --> 33:35.020
Ash!

33:39.100 --> 33:40.940
All right, don't lose your head right away.

33:42.380 --> 33:43.740
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

33:43.740 --> 33:44.300
He's bloody!

33:44.300 --> 33:45.020
He's bloody!

33:46.860 --> 33:48.860
This is your first time seeing this man,

33:48.860 --> 33:52.700
who is sniffing at Jeremy Pettymore's fingers.

33:53.260 --> 33:54.060
Oh, damn.

33:54.060 --> 33:56.140
It's a 36 on a 35.

33:56.140 --> 34:01.980
Go ahead and make that a 34 for your current sanity as you lose one.

34:01.980 --> 34:02.700
Jesus Christ.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.740
Sanity loss really gets the indigestion going.

34:05.820 --> 34:10.220
As that happens, Thomas, if you could plug your ears real quick.

34:13.580 --> 34:19.820
Looking at this man, you no longer see humanity in his eyes,

34:20.540 --> 34:24.220
and you can only see this animalistic intent

34:24.860 --> 34:29.180
behind the eyes of this bloody, muddy, tied up human.

34:29.180 --> 34:29.820
Okay.

34:29.820 --> 34:30.620
You're good, Thomas.

34:30.620 --> 34:33.580
I stuck my fingers in my ears and wiggled them around

34:33.580 --> 34:35.340
so there was just a constant roar,

34:35.340 --> 34:38.940
and any infection I might get tomorrow is on your conscience.

34:40.380 --> 34:41.500
Non-existent, my dude.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.460
What was on your fingers?

34:43.260 --> 34:44.140
You know, just the day.

34:45.100 --> 34:49.420
Also, I rubbed infection all over his fingers earlier.

34:50.460 --> 34:51.980
That's what I call my pussy.

34:55.980 --> 34:59.820
You get it tattooed, and the O is your clit.

34:59.820 --> 35:06.540
It's a circle, and it says infection.

35:06.540 --> 35:07.340
Like a teardrop.

35:07.340 --> 35:07.660
All right.

35:07.660 --> 35:10.220
So, no, no, no.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.900
A circle tattoo above the clit.

35:18.700 --> 35:19.740
All right, well.

35:19.740 --> 35:24.540
You see Ken get startled and start backing up away from you both.

35:24.540 --> 35:25.040
What the?

35:25.100 --> 35:25.600
What the?

35:26.860 --> 35:27.360
What's?

35:30.300 --> 35:31.740
That's not a person.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.420
Of course it's a person.

35:34.380 --> 35:35.100
Look at his eyes.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.260
He's like feral or some shit, Jeremy.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.420
Okay, but he's still a man.

35:42.380 --> 35:42.880
Jeez.

35:44.220 --> 35:48.060
Did you think the fucking hunt for old Madge was just all gonna be like

35:48.620 --> 35:53.500
civilized gentleman, and yes, yes, sir, and no, ma'am, and thank you, please?

35:54.060 --> 35:56.060
No, it's wild fuckers in the woods.

35:56.060 --> 36:00.220
We've never seen anything like this, Jeremy.

36:00.220 --> 36:04.300
We were gonna roast marshmallows, and we were gonna tell ghost stories,

36:04.300 --> 36:07.420
and we were gonna fall asleep way too early and wake up way too early.

36:08.220 --> 36:09.340
Ken, he's real friendly.

36:09.340 --> 36:10.540
Why don't you give him some fokies?

36:10.540 --> 36:11.580
Give him some fokies.

36:11.580 --> 36:12.700
Fuck no, I'm not going near him.

36:12.700 --> 36:13.340
Give him some fokies.

36:13.340 --> 36:13.840
Fuck no.

36:15.580 --> 36:16.080
Ash!

36:17.420 --> 36:17.920
Ash!

36:18.160 --> 36:18.660
Ash!

36:24.240 --> 36:26.160
I don't know why he's so scared of you, Rusty.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.720
You named him?

36:28.720 --> 36:29.360
Yeah, look at him.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.640
He's a little rusty.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.660
He got in that red dirt.

36:47.920 --> 36:52.000
You're worse at getting a room noise than Luke.

36:54.240 --> 36:54.880
Think about that.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.080
Well, it's sort of, it's like you, uh, Mr. Rogers.

37:00.080 --> 37:03.840
It's like a fucking nightmare trying to get a room noise with Luke.

37:03.840 --> 37:04.720
Oh my God.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.200
I mean, we're not doing this podcast anymore.

37:07.200 --> 37:07.700
Yeah.

37:08.320 --> 37:13.440
No, but it's like you, Mr. Rogers, us, where we just have to sit for one minute

37:13.440 --> 37:17.200
and not make any noise, and you're like, what do I do?

37:18.000 --> 37:21.520
You're going to want to have your mouth almost touching the microphone when you speak into it.

37:21.520 --> 37:21.760
Okay.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.760
But not farting into it like that other guy.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.760
His name is Thomas.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.120
His name is Thomas.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.080
Right, Thomas.

37:28.080 --> 37:28.960
Something petty more.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.680
It's always something different.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.200
It's always something petty more.

37:34.320 --> 37:34.820
Gavin.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.880
Gavin.

37:36.880 --> 37:37.520
Gavin.

37:37.520 --> 37:38.000
Gavin.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.360
Gavin is such a little slut whore.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.200
Frickin Gavin Pettymore.

37:43.200 --> 37:43.700
Whoa.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.120
We don't Gavin shame on this podcast.

37:48.240 --> 37:49.760
All right.

37:49.760 --> 37:50.080
Yeah.

37:50.080 --> 37:53.760
Young ladies, if you want to come on down, we're trying to get this information.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.800
You can get on into the woods and take care of business.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.120
You hear from all the way in the shack.

37:59.120 --> 38:03.360
Now he's all the way in there and there's a little like open window.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.560
I don't know what you would call that.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.720
Like, uh, that you would walk up to.

38:06.720 --> 38:07.920
Like a concession window.

38:07.920 --> 38:08.400
Exactly.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.400
Thank you so much, Lindsay.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.120
That was Lindsay.

38:12.800 --> 38:16.240
I don't know why, but I just don't trust this guy.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.840
Yeah, I don't trust him either.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.760
Like he seems pretty scary.

38:19.760 --> 38:20.160
Whatever.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.560
He's not going to let us go into the woods until we take a picture.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.400
So just like, let him take a picture of us.

38:24.400 --> 38:29.200
But like, what if he's taking our picture because then he's going to make us disappear

38:29.200 --> 38:30.960
and then he can put our picture up.

38:30.960 --> 38:31.520
Yeah.

38:31.520 --> 38:36.000
And also Elizabeth, it's like always easy for you to take a picture because you always

38:36.000 --> 38:39.200
look so beautiful and like we don't.

38:39.200 --> 38:45.920
Judy, we've been friends for so long and you used to call me beautiful and you don't anymore.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.440
And I just like, don't even know why.

38:47.440 --> 38:52.160
Like you used to tell me how wonderful and cute and sweet and hilarious I am.

38:52.160 --> 38:55.440
And excuse me, when did this turn into some kind of competition?

38:55.440 --> 38:56.960
Can we just go into the woods please?

39:00.720 --> 39:03.600
That was Lindsay's voice and it made the funniest noise.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.560
Was that inside your throat?

39:07.520 --> 39:07.920
It was like,

39:08.160 --> 39:19.360
I can't burp.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.560
Like your body isn't capable of burping.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.720
My body isn't capable of burping so it does this.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.360
GMing is pain.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.600
Sorry.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.760
Being Lindsay is pain.

39:44.320 --> 39:45.280
Oh my God.

39:46.960 --> 39:47.600
Okay, fine.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.960
Let's just take the picture.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.000
Okay.

39:50.000 --> 39:56.000
So when you guys walk up to the little shack at the entrance at the trailhead,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.720
who has the best alertness?

39:58.720 --> 39:59.680
I have 40.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.480
I have 50.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.200
I have 50.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.800
Oh, two fifties.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.120
All right.

40:03.120 --> 40:06.160
Well, let's have both of you roll.

40:06.160 --> 40:06.560
Why not?

40:09.600 --> 40:13.280
I rolled a, wait, what's 30 and zero?

40:13.280 --> 40:13.760
30.

40:13.760 --> 40:14.640
I rolled a 30.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.160
I rolled a 15.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.600
What's 30 and zero?

40:18.800 --> 40:23.200
30 plus zero is, hold on, let me do the numbers in my head.

40:24.640 --> 40:25.120
Oh my God.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.400
It was my first roll.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.440
I'm so nervous.

40:27.440 --> 40:32.000
Hey, that was both of your first rolls on this show and they both were successes.

40:32.480 --> 40:32.980
Yes.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.160
There's no way you won't die now.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.040
Can you describe that face for our listeners?

40:50.480 --> 40:51.760
It makes the exact same noise.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.040
Who succeeded more is the thing.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.120
So technically whoever got 15.

41:01.200 --> 41:01.840
So Lindsay.

41:01.840 --> 41:02.240
No.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.920
So it's price is right rules.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.560
Oh, so I win.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.920
Judy wins the role.

41:07.920 --> 41:08.400
Fuck you.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.200
I'm more alert.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.120
But you both see everything.

41:12.160 --> 41:13.760
You both see everything.

41:14.400 --> 41:18.400
So in this little shack, there are some clipboards hanging on the walls.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.920
You've got one fire extinguisher.

41:22.560 --> 41:27.200
There is one ax, one machete, one flashlight.

41:27.200 --> 41:32.800
There's a giant thing of hand sanitizer that is sitting out on the like front, on the ledge.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.240
What's a ledge of a window called?

41:34.240 --> 41:35.040
A sill.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.160
It's on the sill.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.720
And there's, let's see what else.

41:38.720 --> 41:46.800
Behind him, behind Woodrow is a bulletin board with many Polaroid pictures thumbtacked into

41:46.800 --> 41:48.960
the bulletin board with a sheet of paper.

41:48.960 --> 41:52.080
It's got information on it, like behind each picture.

41:52.080 --> 41:57.280
And he says, yeah, no, these are all the people who have gone into the woods.

41:57.280 --> 42:01.600
And then he like kind of points at one side of them are sectioned off.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.760
And he's like, and those are the ones that are missing.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.680
So obviously be careful in there.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.520
Do I have something I can like take a picture of it with?

42:09.520 --> 42:11.360
Probably not in the nineties.

42:11.360 --> 42:14.720
Probably not in the time that we're in right now.

42:14.720 --> 42:19.200
But I have a Polaroid that I can take a picture of you and it with.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.320
I can give you a picture of that.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.200
That way, you know what the pictures of the people look like who are in the pictures.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.920
That way, when you're in the woods and if you see one of them, then you could let me

42:25.920 --> 42:26.420
know.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.600
So, and then he just snaps a picture of Liz.

42:29.600 --> 42:34.000
I don't want to be counterproductive to what we're doing right now, but it sort of seems

42:34.000 --> 42:38.160
weird that 18 people have gone missing in the woods and you're still letting us go into

42:38.160 --> 42:42.160
the woods as female minors without any adult supervision.

42:42.160 --> 42:47.760
Well, I don't see age or gender, but I do see three very capable young ladies who are

42:47.760 --> 42:49.520
looking to have a good time in the woods this evening.

42:49.520 --> 42:54.400
So Liz, I already know your name for some reason because you must have told me earlier.

42:54.400 --> 43:00.480
So Liz Longley, he looks down at the piece of paper and he's like, let's see here.

43:00.480 --> 43:02.880
What is your business in the woods this evening?

43:02.880 --> 43:03.680
I just want to camp.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.840
I just really want to camp.

43:05.840 --> 43:06.160
Okay.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.760
And did you bring anything?

43:07.760 --> 43:09.680
And he's reading off the sheet.

43:09.680 --> 43:13.920
Did you bring anything that is not camping gear?

43:13.920 --> 43:14.560
No.

43:14.560 --> 43:15.360
Okay.

43:15.360 --> 43:21.920
And if you were to go missing, where would we look for you first in order to find you

43:21.920 --> 43:22.400
quickest?

43:24.240 --> 43:26.880
Are you sure you're not out here trying to paint your nose?

43:26.880 --> 43:30.880
Cause you're looking all higgly piggly and I'm just worried that y'all are going to be

43:30.880 --> 43:32.080
out here raising sand.

43:32.080 --> 43:35.120
And I guess, I don't know, like in a tree.

43:35.120 --> 43:35.840
In a tree.

43:35.840 --> 43:36.640
All right.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.640
This one's got a cap and wumpus mind.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.240
And I like that about you.

43:40.240 --> 43:40.640
All right.

43:40.640 --> 43:45.360
So, uh, he writes all that down and then he sticks the picture in the thumbtack and throws

43:45.360 --> 43:53.200
it up on the board of the side of the non-missing and his attention turns to shadow and he picks

43:53.200 --> 43:57.040
up the Polaroid and lifts it up and snaps a picture of you.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.240
What's that picture look like?

43:58.240 --> 43:58.720
Gaunt.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.400
Kind of deadly.

44:01.440 --> 44:03.760
And when I say deadly, I don't mean like the picture could kill.

44:03.760 --> 44:07.680
I mean like the person in the picture was killed and looks a little dead.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.080
Um, it's, it's my makeup.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.040
It's, it's not like...

44:12.000 --> 44:14.400
I just meant what face were you making, but that's fine.

44:14.400 --> 44:14.900
Yeah.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.400
I like this.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.640
Deadly and gaunt.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.360
Like dead-ish.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.240
Not really deadly.

44:22.880 --> 44:24.480
You know, like just like dead-like.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.320
Similar to death.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.080
And I think that's all that needs to be described.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.080
Wow.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.840
You were just barking on a knot out here.

44:31.840 --> 44:32.800
What's your name?

44:32.800 --> 44:33.680
Shadow.

44:33.680 --> 44:34.560
All right.

44:34.560 --> 44:35.360
That's it.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.840
Is that a normal name for these times?

44:37.840 --> 44:38.720
What year is it?

44:38.720 --> 44:39.280
You don't know?

44:39.280 --> 44:39.760
I don't know.

44:41.040 --> 44:41.920
Let's leave it at that.

44:42.640 --> 44:42.960
Yeah.

44:42.960 --> 44:44.000
My name is Shadow.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.160
That's what my parents wanted to call me.

44:46.160 --> 44:46.480
Sure.

44:46.480 --> 44:47.120
Of course.

44:47.120 --> 44:48.960
And, uh, same question.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.480
What are you doing out here in the woods?

44:51.920 --> 44:59.440
We're just trying to find ourselves through the earth and the moon and everything that

44:59.440 --> 45:02.960
crawls on the earth and the moon.

45:02.960 --> 45:03.840
All right.

45:03.920 --> 45:06.160
Well, and what else do we got here?

45:06.160 --> 45:08.000
He's reading off the paper again.

45:08.000 --> 45:08.480
Oh yeah.

45:09.280 --> 45:10.560
Do you bring anything with you?

45:10.560 --> 45:13.760
You seem like you might've brought something with you that's not camping gear.

45:13.760 --> 45:16.000
What with your earthly moon activities?

45:16.000 --> 45:20.320
I just brought some like crystals so that we could find our auras.

45:20.880 --> 45:21.200
Yeah.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.000
All right.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.480
And lastly, but not leastly, if you were to go missing, where would I might find you?

45:26.480 --> 45:32.560
I probably would go in like a tree that's like taller than the one Liz was in and like

45:32.560 --> 45:34.480
stronger, but like a tree.

45:34.480 --> 45:34.800
Bitch.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.240
Y'all seem to have a real nice rapport.

45:38.240 --> 45:39.840
And for you, what is your name?

45:39.840 --> 45:40.480
Young Liz.

45:41.280 --> 45:41.520
Miss.

45:42.080 --> 45:43.040
My name's Judy.

45:44.240 --> 45:50.000
And Judy is like far too busy furiously pumping the hand sanitizer in her hand.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.320
She's just pumping the hand sanitizer into her hand.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.120
Like it's falling out of her hand.

45:55.120 --> 45:58.160
Liz is just staring at her like she's just so appalled.

45:58.800 --> 45:59.200
Awesome.

46:00.160 --> 46:03.680
Uh, any hand sanitizer for the other two?

46:03.680 --> 46:04.800
Absolutely not.

46:05.760 --> 46:09.600
I prefer to be like one with the germs that want to enter my body.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.480
My mom always said sanitize saves lives.

46:12.480 --> 46:17.440
I agree that the saving of lives can be easily attained by sanitizing.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.760
And I would suggest that both of you take

46:19.760 --> 46:25.680
Ashford into the initiative that your friend here did as well in order to have clean hands.

46:25.680 --> 46:28.240
Could we save our lives with like that machete?

46:28.240 --> 46:29.120
I hope not.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.080
What does that mean?

46:30.080 --> 46:35.120
I mean, like if something is out there killing people like maybe Judy's mom,

46:35.120 --> 46:37.680
like I'm just wondering if we could like take the machete with us.

46:37.680 --> 46:40.160
Why would you say that?

46:40.160 --> 46:42.800
And Judy starts like licking the hand sanitizer.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.440
Oh my God.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.080
Jinx.

46:48.080 --> 46:50.880
And what is your reason for being in the woods here?

46:50.880 --> 46:52.800
My clean and new friend.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.240
I'm just here with my friends.

46:54.400 --> 46:59.120
Uh, we're just camping just for normal camping reasons.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.880
And I'm just doing whatever they are doing.

47:02.800 --> 47:05.920
And you don't seem like one to take initiative,

47:05.920 --> 47:09.760
but did you bring anything with you that is not also for camping?

47:09.760 --> 47:12.480
I don't have anything except the sanitizer.

47:12.480 --> 47:12.960
I'm sorry.

47:12.960 --> 47:13.760
I stole it.

47:13.760 --> 47:14.720
It's not stealing.

47:15.280 --> 47:18.400
I will now offer it to both of your friends.

47:18.400 --> 47:21.280
That way, you know that I would have offered it to you as well.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.280
And if you would like more, you can have some.

47:23.280 --> 47:23.840
Thank you.

47:23.840 --> 47:27.120
He like puts his hand on top of it and moves it toward you.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.720
And he's like, do you want to pump?

47:28.720 --> 47:30.560
I don't believe in sanitation.

47:30.560 --> 47:33.840
I sort of think that like when people are supposed to die from germs,

47:33.840 --> 47:35.440
they should just let it happen.

47:35.440 --> 47:40.080
I put my hand out and as he pumps, I pull my hand away and let it fall on the floor.

47:40.720 --> 47:40.960
Okay.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.960
I need you to roll dexterity for me.

47:44.800 --> 47:45.440
53.

47:46.160 --> 47:46.960
53.

47:48.000 --> 47:48.720
53.

47:49.440 --> 47:50.640
53 on what?

47:50.640 --> 47:51.840
What is your dexterity?

47:51.840 --> 47:52.340
Oh.

47:53.300 --> 47:55.140
Yeah, that would be a 50.

47:55.140 --> 47:56.580
Oh, that's a fail.

47:56.580 --> 48:04.180
So right before your hand gets out of the way, quite a bit of hand sanitizer glooshes

48:04.180 --> 48:05.380
right onto those palms.

48:07.140 --> 48:09.060
Right onto those pinchy boys.

48:09.060 --> 48:16.020
And you get hand sanitizer and it's like too much that you couldn't even like wipe it like together.

48:16.020 --> 48:18.340
I turn to Judy and I'm like, Judy, hold your hand out.

48:18.980 --> 48:19.700
Okay.

48:19.700 --> 48:21.700
Are you gonna touch my hand with your hand?

48:21.700 --> 48:23.620
I put some hand sanitizer in my hand, please.

48:24.340 --> 48:26.740
Well, I was going to, but now I'm not going to.

48:26.740 --> 48:27.700
Okay, that's totally cool.

48:27.700 --> 48:29.940
I don't even care that much, so it's fine.

48:29.940 --> 48:31.220
So do you rub it in?

48:31.220 --> 48:32.740
Yeah, you know.

48:32.740 --> 48:34.260
This is what role playing is all about.

48:37.620 --> 48:38.420
All right, cool.

48:38.420 --> 48:42.340
And I've got another question here for this timid one.

48:42.980 --> 48:45.940
What is your reason for not being here?

48:45.940 --> 48:47.460
I've already filled out that one.

48:47.460 --> 48:51.460
He's looking at the sheet and he's like, uh, yeah, you bring anything?

48:51.460 --> 48:53.380
No, I already wrote that down as well.

48:53.380 --> 48:53.940
Oh yes.

48:53.940 --> 48:57.460
If you were to be hiding in the woods somewhere, where am I to re-find you?

48:59.140 --> 49:02.180
Probably just like on the top of my head.

49:02.980 --> 49:06.100
Probably just like whatever tree Liz is in.

49:06.100 --> 49:07.220
It's probably where I'd be.

49:08.020 --> 49:11.860
Whatever tree Liz is in.

49:11.860 --> 49:14.580
Takes him a while to write it down, but he gets it done.

49:14.580 --> 49:18.660
And the thumbtacks with the pictures go up on the board in the non-missing section.

49:18.740 --> 49:20.980
And he looks back up and he says,

49:20.980 --> 49:24.900
well, I think that each of you should have an excellent day.

49:24.900 --> 49:27.460
And, uh, yeah.

49:27.460 --> 49:33.220
And you notice as he turns around to post the thumbtacks into the bulletin board,

49:33.220 --> 49:39.220
you see that there's a slight trickle of blood going down the back of his neck.

49:39.220 --> 49:43.860
And it is starting to stain the uniform that he is wearing.

49:49.060 --> 50:04.340
Ash horn beam is looking around at the sun going down.

50:04.340 --> 50:08.580
He's looking around at just trees surrounding him.

50:10.180 --> 50:14.420
And then he hears a noise and looking in the direction of this noise,

50:14.420 --> 50:22.100
you see that there's a tree that is emitting light from like a hollow point.

50:22.740 --> 50:23.780
What are those called?

50:23.780 --> 50:25.700
I know exactly what you're talking about.

50:25.700 --> 50:27.380
They're like little round.

50:27.380 --> 50:29.780
Yeah, I used to, there was one in my yard.

50:29.780 --> 50:31.220
I used to put stuff in.

50:31.220 --> 50:31.700
Exactly.

50:31.700 --> 50:32.420
It's one of those.

50:32.980 --> 50:34.100
It's like where you drop off.

50:34.740 --> 50:37.540
It's like, put the money in the tree hole.

50:37.540 --> 50:40.180
And, uh, with that in your mind, you think,

50:40.180 --> 50:42.100
oh, there might be some loud money over here.

50:46.260 --> 50:51.380
And you see that there is a bright light shining from inside this hole.

50:51.380 --> 50:56.020
When I look around, am I in like a hollow or is it just trees all around?

50:56.020 --> 50:57.460
Just trees all around.

50:57.460 --> 51:01.540
Can I do a search to see if I've, is there anything else unusual around me?

51:01.540 --> 51:02.180
Go ahead and roll.

51:04.980 --> 51:06.580
21 on a 40.

51:06.580 --> 51:15.940
There seems to be some sort of wire trip wire in between you and this bright light

51:15.940 --> 51:17.380
shining tree that's making this noise.

51:17.380 --> 51:22.180
Okay, well I'm going to make my way over to the tree, carefully avoiding the trip wire.

51:22.180 --> 51:24.820
Carefully avoiding the trip wire and you're safe now.

51:26.820 --> 51:27.940
That is what I do.

51:27.940 --> 51:29.860
Stepping carefully over the trip wire.

51:29.860 --> 51:33.780
You feel this like great sense of pride in yourself.

51:33.860 --> 51:37.780
And I also, I turn back at the trip wire and I wink and I give it finger guns.

51:38.580 --> 51:41.460
The camera is pointed from up from the trip wire.

51:41.460 --> 51:43.140
That way you're looking directly into camera.

51:43.140 --> 51:44.580
Right directly into camera.

51:44.580 --> 51:47.220
And I go, not this time audience.

51:48.820 --> 51:49.380
It's good.

51:49.380 --> 51:49.780
Good.

51:49.780 --> 51:50.580
Break the fourth wall.

51:50.580 --> 51:51.140
It's important.

51:51.140 --> 51:58.420
So you are on the other side and you are right near this tree and you see that this light

51:58.420 --> 52:04.420
is emitting so brightly lit from inside the tree that you can't see what is inside this

52:04.420 --> 52:07.380
crevasse, this wooden crevice.

52:08.340 --> 52:09.940
But there's something inside.

52:09.940 --> 52:11.220
There's something deep in there.

52:11.220 --> 52:14.900
If I get like right up near it, it's not like blinding light, is it?

52:14.900 --> 52:15.140
No.

52:15.140 --> 52:19.060
If I get like right up near it, how big is the whole face sized?

52:19.060 --> 52:22.020
No, it's more like a forearm sized.

52:22.020 --> 52:22.740
Oh, okay.

52:22.740 --> 52:28.180
Well, I think how convenient is that?

52:28.180 --> 52:33.540
And I stick my hand into the hole and feel around up to my elbow.

52:33.540 --> 52:37.460
You stick your hand into the hole up to your elbow.

52:37.460 --> 52:40.820
Do I feel like the bottom or the sides of it up to my elbow?

52:40.820 --> 52:41.140
Yes.

52:41.140 --> 52:41.620
Okay.

52:41.620 --> 52:45.780
And inside you feel nothing.

52:47.700 --> 52:49.140
I'm going to sniff the hole.

52:50.020 --> 52:55.620
Well, your forearm is currently covering all the holes, so there's no more light emitting

52:55.620 --> 52:59.380
and your forearm seems to fit perfectly up to the elbow inside this hole.

52:59.380 --> 53:02.740
Okay, I pull my arm out after feeling nothing or do I?

53:02.740 --> 53:09.460
As you attempt to pull your arm out, you feel a great pain on your skin.

53:09.460 --> 53:10.420
Up to my elbow?

53:10.420 --> 53:11.300
All the way.

53:11.300 --> 53:15.380
Think of it like you have your arm inside of a catfish.

53:16.340 --> 53:20.180
I can actually vividly imagine that, yeah.

53:20.180 --> 53:28.900
Now imagine that the whole internal insides of a catfish are razor sharp all the way down

53:28.900 --> 53:30.660
from elbow to fingertip.

53:30.660 --> 53:34.740
Dang, so this is like noodling but in the woods instead of the water.

53:34.740 --> 53:38.900
Are you going to attempt to pull your arm out slowly?

53:39.940 --> 53:44.980
Very slowly because I'm thinking like if they're like pointed in to where like

53:45.060 --> 53:49.220
I don't hurt myself if I stay here but pulling out would be worse.

53:49.220 --> 53:50.900
Or like a finger trap.

53:50.900 --> 53:58.660
It is very similar to both of those ideas as you lose one hit point and the skin that

53:58.660 --> 54:05.540
makes its way out probably a centimeter's worth is not there anymore and it is just

54:05.540 --> 54:05.540


54:05.540 --> 54:09.300
Completely like not scratches or anything just completely raw.

54:09.300 --> 54:09.540
Yep.

54:10.420 --> 54:14.260
And you realize that you are trapped.

54:14.980 --> 54:26.820
Ash Hornbeam hasn't maybe ever felt this way before but he doesn't know what to do.

54:44.980 --> 54:58.820
She knows

55:00.260 --> 55:02.820
That the time has come

55:06.260 --> 55:12.820
To dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon

55:14.980 --> 55:38.820
She moves

55:39.780 --> 55:42.660
With the howling wind

55:46.340 --> 55:54.660
The sun has come again

55:57.780 --> 56:06.660
Her eyes have seen it all

56:08.820 --> 56:20.660
The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon
