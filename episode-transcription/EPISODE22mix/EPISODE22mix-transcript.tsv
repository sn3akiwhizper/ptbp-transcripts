0	6320	Hello my students, it's your professor Wolf the Dog and I'm here to teach you all about
6320	14720	what's synthesizing here on 694.2 PTBP, Contentions only form of education.
14720	22440	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from AtKCruise36 on Twitter who tagged at PretendingPod, an
22440	25440	A plus thing to do my students.
26440	32120	The people of contention are fed up with our incompetent gun-crazy police force.
32120	38440	We the committee to unite the nearby townsfolk refuse to let good, hard-working folks be
38440	43780	terrorized by the likes of a petty more firing wildly into the sky.
43780	48860	The good lord knows we've suffered enough and the overflow in the offering plate shows
48860	50360	this to be true.
50400	56200	Head on down to the first church of contention to salve your soul and enjoy some casserole
56200	59360	prepared by our lady's auxiliary.
59360	63880	Coffee is always hot and so, so black y'all.
63880	68100	Speaking of the first church of contention, go ahead and send thoughts and prayers to
68100	69880	Pastor Adam Cain.
69880	73000	We all know he's going through hell today.
73000	77060	However, Professor Wolf is here to talk facts with y'all.
77060	79560	It's time for the news my babies.
79760	84920	Earlier this evening, the officers cleaned themselves up after fighting a large robot
84920	87520	man with feelings, perhaps.
87520	90120	Is it a robot if it has feelings?
90120	93280	What are the rules here, I don't know.
93280	98480	Keith Wigner found a single piece of music called The Rise of the End in the bench of
98480	100280	the stringless piano.
100280	105020	If that's true and I'm sober, that's high strangeness.
105140	111520	Clark Bishop found, in the flipped over coffee table, blueprints for calm, comfy campground.
111520	117980	A suspiciously planned out set of seven buildings, six encircling a large one in the center that
117980	120020	sits on Lake Combe.
120020	125020	A similar design was found drawn on a piece of paper in the pocket of one of those two
125020	130380	corpses they found in the pit under the trap door that Bishop fell into.
130380	134860	Then in James the Millworker's house, the officers remembered that he died in Chief
134860	139900	Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head, face down and a plate of foot meat.
139900	144300	They also remember the contents of the present that she received from an unknown source the
144300	145900	night she took off.
145900	152180	A red rose, a white hot hat, and a black silk bow tie.
152180	157360	All of which were present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by
157360	160720	statue respectively.
160720	165800	After undressing the bottom half of the still standing robot man, the gang finds a logo
165800	168680	on the smooth pelvic area.
168680	172440	It is an M made out of four double helices.
172440	177020	They voted and decided to store the legs in Keith's cruiser's trunk.
177020	182000	Is it just me or is life getting stranger and stranger around here?
183000	188400	An educator of the masses, Wolf, had another scary dream.
188400	195360	Today on December 4th, during a nap, I was eating a glass of water and began bleeding
195360	196840	all over the floor.
196840	200640	I looked down and my dog Wolf was lapping up the blood.
200640	205820	So then he looks up at me and he has a fish in his mouth and it's flopping around.
205820	211760	The blood from my mouth pours all over my wolf and then my dog's face is the face of
211760	218480	that fish and in the fish's mouth is my face.
218480	225080	Now class, find a partner for this next assignment or work in a group or fly solo.
225080	230200	It's your life and it also cuts you with no back bone.
241760	251880	Alright, maybe, maybe we should just get a good night's sleep and check out the mill
251880	252880	in the morning.
252880	254240	Because nobody's going to be at the mill right now.
254240	257480	Yeah, it'd be a good time for snooping but not a great time for investing.
257480	261080	I think it's a better time for snoozing than snooping.
261080	262680	That's the second smartest thing you've ever said.
262680	265320	I could get a few winks in, that's for sure.
265320	270440	Okay, hey John, do you want to just crash at my place because I think, I mean it's closer
270440	272400	than going all the way out to your house.
272400	275880	Keith, man, you know that's nice but hotel rooms just depress me and I'm really looking
275880	280040	forward to getting back to my home, just how I like it, you know.
280040	284440	Maybe we should all stay, maybe we should all stay at Clark's house so that we're together
284440	286720	just in case something dangerous happens.
286720	287720	I got plenty of beds.
287720	288720	Yeah, he does, he has plenty of beds.
288720	291880	I know we're just not a giant robot but are you a little, maybe you should go sleep with
291880	296120	Clark buddy, that's fine, there's no shame in a grown man being afraid after a robot
296120	297120	encounter.
297120	299640	No, I'm not afraid, I'm just thinking that we should probably all stick together at this
299640	300640	point.
300640	301640	You know, some weird shit's going on.
301640	302640	No man, I like-
302640	306880	What if the ooze, what if the, what's the closest waterway to you, you know?
306880	310640	Well there's actually, there's a beautiful little creek that runs right through my property.
310640	311640	Okay, well-
311640	314160	You guys can come, do you want to come stay out there, Keith?
314160	315480	No, not really.
315480	316480	Okay.
316480	321880	Oh actually, yeah, I forgot, I kind of have, well I'm going to call up this girl later
321880	322880	so.
322880	323880	Okay, well-
323880	325880	I'm pretty excited to show her my-
326040	327040	Also-
327040	328040	Zeke's a Hazard DVDs.
328040	329040	You guys have your-
329040	330040	And Smokey and the Bandit.
330040	331760	You guys have your cars at the police station?
331760	332760	Well-
332760	334120	I don't think we have cars in, I think-
334120	338440	Yeah, there's some cruisers but we need to get replacement cruisers.
338440	340560	The cruisers are still destroyed, right?
340560	341560	That is correct.
341560	342560	Yeah, I've got my-
342560	343720	You've got a truck out at your property-
343720	344720	Yeah, for sure.
344720	345720	That we talked about.
345720	346720	Oh wait, and then do you have a-
346720	348400	I don't think I do.
348400	354600	So you know, guys, I think it'd just be easiest for us to all stay at Clark's house tonight
354600	356440	since we only have one car.
356440	357800	You get pretty easily-
357800	362200	Yeah, I mean, the station's even easier to get to and we can just get new cars, buddy.
362200	365920	You have an impound lot so you can just take cars that have been impounded.
365920	369800	Okay, well, I guess I'll take you to the impound lot.
369800	372880	Hey Clark, man, can I talk to you for a second?
372880	378960	You know, I think Vigna's afraid of something and maybe just invite him over for a little
378960	379960	sleepover or something.
379960	381280	He doesn't seem like he wants to-
381280	383560	He seems spooked, you're right, you're right.
383600	386440	I'll put a word in his ear for sure, let him know he's welcome.
386440	387440	Yeah.
387440	391320	Oh, hey, so you sure you don't want to have a sleepover over at Clark's?
391320	392600	Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
392600	396880	Keith, you're more than welcome, though, to hang out for a little while, you know?
396880	401000	Well, I mean, I just, you know, I don't-
401000	405040	Buddy, this is cute, but I'm going back to my house.
405040	406040	You know what?
406040	407040	I'll take you up on that.
407040	408040	You got a spare bed?
408040	411040	Yeah, I got a spare bed, Keith.
411040	412040	Okay.
412520	413520	You like Salisbury Steak?
413520	415520	It will probably be safer for you tonight if you're with Clark.
415520	416920	Do you have Game Show Network?
416920	420120	As a matter of fact, I watch Wheel of Fortune every night.
420120	425120	Dude, I'm down to watch whatever's on Game Show Network, whether it be Match Game, Cash
425120	427440	Cab, Wheel of Fortune, whatever's going on.
427440	428440	I like that Cash Cab.
428440	431600	We're going to watch Wheel of Fortune, but I gotta warn you, I get a puzzle sometimes
431600	432600	a time.
432600	435960	Hey, well, let's see if I can't bestie on at least one round.
435960	436960	Ooh, good luck.
436960	443080	Okay, so I drive the three of us to the impound lot.
443080	448520	What kind of car do you get?
448520	449520	That is the question.
449520	450520	Yeah.
450520	457400	John Lee Pettymore is in the mood for the classics tonight, so I'm going to take a dope,
457400	461760	I don't know, cars, a cool 70s car.
461760	464680	How about like a Stingray Corvette, dude?
464680	466020	Do we have one of those?
466020	468500	Probably not impounded.
468500	470380	A 91.
470380	473300	There's a pretty sweet 91 Toyota Corolla.
473300	474300	Is it all modded?
474300	475300	No.
475300	476300	No.
476300	477300	Okay.
477300	478300	No.
478300	479300	When I said sweet, I was lying.
479300	480300	What about like a...
480300	483220	There's a cool lime green GEO over there.
483220	484220	No, I'm good.
484220	485820	I'll take the Corolla, I guess.
485820	488620	I'm going to take a 1990 Lincoln Town Car.
488620	489620	Nice.
489620	490620	Whoa.
490620	492460	I'm going to just stay in my cruiser.
492460	493620	My stepdad had one of those.
493620	494620	Really?
494620	495620	I think that year and everything.
496220	497220	He had one.
497220	498220	I remember feeling like it felt like a boat inside.
498220	499220	It was so wide.
499220	500220	It super is, yeah.
500220	501220	Okay.
501220	503940	And here are the keys for those.
503940	510460	And yeah, as soon as we get the cruisers back in working order, I'll make sure that you're
510460	511460	in them.
511460	519100	But for now, maybe let's not let the town know that you're cruising around in cars from
519100	520900	the impound lot, probably.
520900	521900	Oh, yeah.
521900	524140	I mean, definitely not a great idea.
524140	525860	I mean, don't like, you know...
525860	527340	Hey, Drew, I'll see you around, buddy.
527340	529260	And I drift out of the parking lot.
529260	530260	Okay.
530260	534860	Hey, Clark, I'll just follow you back home.
534860	535860	Follow me back over there?
535860	536860	Yeah, of course.
536860	537860	How old is it?
537860	538860	Nine.
538860	539860	Nine thirty, maybe now.
539860	540860	Sure.
540860	541860	Are there any late night food spots open?
541860	542860	Yeah.
542860	543860	I mean, you can always get a burger at Burgatory.
543860	544860	And Daily Fuzz is still open.
544860	548060	Well, I mean, you offered me Sal's Berry Steak.
548060	549060	That sounds...
549060	551540	I tell you what, I've been looking forward to my chicken nugget dinner.
551540	552540	So...
552540	553540	Okay.
553940	554940	Bring me a burger, bring it over.
554940	555940	That's fine.
555940	559940	Well, I mean, really what I'd like to do is have a bishop night.
559940	561760	Do you have an extra for me?
561760	562760	I got you.
562760	564360	I got a Sal's Berry Steak I've been holding back.
564360	565360	You can have that one.
565360	566360	Okay.
566360	568520	I'll just follow you home, then.
568520	570780	Who wants to go first?
570780	571780	You guys?
571780	572780	Whatever you want.
572780	573780	If you want to go first.
573780	574780	I think maybe...
574780	576780	Yeah, we'll have you guys here first.
583540	590540	I pull up into my driveway where you coming straight behind me?
590540	592540	Yeah, I was falling right behind you.
592540	596140	So I wait for him to get out of his car and I go up the steps, unlock my door and...
596140	598500	You got a driveway that's two cars wide, right?
598500	599980	I picture it one car wide.
599980	600980	Okay.
600980	601980	So I park behind you then.
601980	602980	Yep.
602980	606260	And I go up and unlock the door and I just kind of leave it open, but just walk straight
606260	609160	in and head toward the kitchen.
609160	611340	I get out of my cruiser.
611340	615620	I go to my trunk, I pop it open.
615620	623140	I see the legs of the robot in there and I forcefully pull up the false bottom and I
623140	630780	grab a bag of chips and a couple of Slim Jims and I drop it down, close my trunk and I walk
630780	636300	in and I walk in the open door, close it behind me and I look at Clark, I go, I brought a
636300	637300	couple of snacks.
637300	641540	I know we got a couple of meals going, but you know, I figured for maybe, maybe we could
641540	648220	watch a couple episodes and I put that on his coffee table and that'd be a good snack.
648220	652700	I go to my freezer and I pull out the chicken nuggets and I pull out the Salisbury steak
652700	655900	and Clark has always ever done one frozen dinner at a time.
655900	660760	So he's kind of baffled right now and he thinks about it for a while and then he puts both
660760	666700	of them into the microwave and just doubles the time.
666700	671520	I sit down, uh, Clark, could you describe, well, not Clark, but uh, could, could you
671520	674740	describe Clark's like a furniture situation?
674740	680660	Yeah, there's a couch that is along the window next to the door and there's a recliner right
680660	684880	across from the TV and everything is kind of dated.
684880	689340	So if I, if I sat on the couch, it would be in view of the television, view of the television,
689340	690620	but perpendicular to it.
690620	693060	So it's a little off kilter.
693100	698340	So, uh, I sit down on the side of the couch, closest, you just make yourself at home over
698340	699340	there Keith.
699340	702260	Mi casa, su casa, as the Spanish say.
702260	708300	I sit down on the side of the couch that's closest to like the, the, the, the best view
708300	712780	of the television cause I know that I'm in your house, you're cooking me food.
712780	718220	I did bring snacks over, but I don't, I don't feel like I should sit in your recliner.
718220	723140	So I sit down on that side of the couch, but I also do scoot the couch up a little
723140	724140	closer to TV.
724140	726980	I walk in and kind of pause.
726980	729940	Uh, did you move it?
729940	731940	Did you move the couch there?
731940	737900	Yeah, I just, you know, I figured if we're watching TV, I might as well, is that, I,
737900	743340	and I, I immediately, I move it back, scratching up the floor again as I move it back.
743340	744340	Clark winces.
744340	745340	I'm sorry, man.
745660	748500	So I get up and I, um, no, it's, it's, it's fine.
748500	750180	You're just Clark, just sit down.
750180	751180	Just sit down.
751180	752620	No, I got to keep an eye on these.
752620	753620	You know what?
753620	754620	I'm the guest here.
754620	755820	I'll, I'll keep an eye on the food.
755820	760100	You just sit down in your recliner, pop, pop the legs up, sit down.
760100	761100	Don't worry about it.
761100	762100	I, you know what?
762100	763100	I'm the guest.
763100	764180	I'm, I'm here to take care of you.
764180	767180	Clark uneasily sits down in the recliner.
767180	773340	I sit down on the, the, uh, the arm of the recliner and I'm like, you know, I'll just,
773340	776300	as soon as that microwave goes off, I'll, I'll get our stuff.
776300	784820	And I, I put my arm around Clark and I, I'm like, you know, turn on that game show network.
784820	787300	You know, this is a nice little bonding.
787300	792620	Clark leans forward real hard to get out of the arm and grabs the remote.
792620	798260	And I, I kinda, I pull my arm up and understanding how uncomfortable he is, I'm like, is this
798260	799260	good?
799260	807980	Now, how is the couch placed within the room?
807980	810780	Uh, I do want to emphasize that the house is immaculate.
810780	813900	Like I keep it pretty Spartan and clean.
813900	819260	I flip on the game show network and uh, I instantly kind of do the slack jot in front
819260	824020	of the TV face for, Oh, Hey, um, I kind of start to pop up.
824020	826860	No, I, I almost smells like plastic burning.
826860	832700	I almost forcefully like put my hand on Clark's chest and push him down into his comfy chair.
832700	833700	I kiss Keith.
833700	834700	I'll get it.
834700	851020	The microwave goes off, I get up and I, I go, I don't really, okay, um, ding.
851020	856840	I get up off the arm chair of the lazy boy and I go to the microwave and I open it up
856840	864680	and um, I see two microwave dinners stacked on top of each other and the plastic on the
864680	868800	top part is just melted into my Salisbury steak.
868800	874540	So I pull them out and like the chicken nuggets are cooked well and like I peel the plastic
874540	877440	top off of that and I'm like, Oh, these look good.
877440	882240	So I grabbed the chicken nugget, I swish it around in the mashed potato part of that and
882240	883240	I pop it in my mouth.
883240	884240	I'm like, yeah, that's pretty good.
884240	885760	It burns the fuck out of your mouth.
885760	886760	Yeah.
886760	892720	So did you pass your constitution check?
892720	893720	I did actually.
893720	894720	Yeah.
894720	895720	All right.
895720	896720	You can, you can deal with it.
896720	900880	So I, and then I get the Salisbury steak, the plastic is melted onto the Salisbury steak.
900880	906700	I try to peel the plastic off, but like I, it takes me like eight different peeling off
906700	907700	the edges to get in.
907700	911320	There's still a plastic on there, but I'm like, yeah, what, I mean, I'm a guest in this
911320	912320	house.
912320	913320	Fuck it.
913320	921640	So, um, yeah, so I bring, um, both TV dinners in there and I sit back down on the arm of
921640	925600	of Clark's chair and I'm like, okay, let's watch.
925600	928440	Uh, what is this like a, like jeopardy or something?
928440	932360	I only have one TV dinner tray stand that I use.
932360	936360	So I go over and grab that and I kind of start setting it up in front of me and I look up
936360	941400	at Keith sitting on the arm of my chair and I'm, Hey, you know, you can, you can use this.
941400	943360	Go, go take that over to that couch over there.
943360	944960	No dude, that's okay.
944960	945960	You can.
945960	948760	I stand up and start setting up the tray in front of the couch.
948760	949760	You can use it.
949760	952600	And I put it back in front of him.
952600	955960	Just lay, lay down and, and don't worry about it.
955960	957360	I'm just going to sit right here.
957360	961840	I I'm real, I'm, I'm starting to get a little weirded out that he's wanting to hover around
961840	962840	me.
962840	964040	So this is uncomfortable.
964040	970640	And I looked down at my chicken nugget tray and Hey, he, these usually have eight nuggets
970640	974880	in them, but this one only has, Oh yeah, that's, I was gonna, and I, I like
974880	981320	use my plastic fork to cut a little piece of my Salisbury steak out and I put it on
981320	987120	his chicken nugget tray, but it's the one piece of Salisbury steak that has like the
987120	991000	plastic still melted on top of it.
991000	992000	You know what?
992000	993520	I will take that tray and I take the tray.
993520	999520	I go sit down on the edge of the couch and I'm like, okay, let's uh, let's just play
999520	1004360	wheel fortune or how are, you know, that goes right buddy.
1004360	1007680	I uh, those chicken nuggets are cooked very well by the way.
1007680	1013400	I, I, I, uh, I kind of fumble with the, uh, the plastic on the Salisbury steak and I popped
1013400	1016280	that into my mouth first and I'm like, I do like that.
1016280	1017280	I do really like that.
1017280	1018280	Salisbury steak.
1018280	1019280	It's a good one.
1019280	1020280	I gave you just so you know.
1020280	1021280	Yeah.
1021280	1029440	I mean, and I, um, I, uh, take, I take like a little bite of it and like, it's okay.
1029440	1036520	I, for the sake of time, I finished my entire meal real quick and I like without a word
1036520	1041560	stand up and start walking back to the bedrooms and I go into like a linen closet and I get
1041560	1046800	out like a pillow and some sheets and I go into the spare bedroom that has a bed in it
1046800	1050160	but is bare and I get the sheets all on it.
1050160	1052400	Hey, uh, Keith, uh, I got your bed ready.
1052400	1053400	Dude.
1053400	1055560	This show is kind of like hangman real quick.
1055560	1064240	I need you both to roll an intelligence check against each other.
1064240	1066800	I got a 39 on a 55.
1066800	1070280	I got a 73 on a 50.
1070280	1076440	Clark wipes the floor with Keith while playing along to wheel of fortune.
1076440	1077440	Nice.
1077440	1078440	Anyway, that was happening.
1078440	1083200	Oh, I mean, I tell you what Keith, I watch this about every night, so don't feel bad.
1083200	1084760	You came up against a master.
1084760	1085760	Yeah.
1085760	1086760	Okay.
1086760	1089320	I think I might go home honestly, but oh, you don't want to.
1089320	1094760	I got the bed ready and if you're feeling, if you're feeling comfortable on your own
1094760	1100840	tonight, I respect that you should, you know, I think I forgot why I came over here initially.
1100840	1104040	It wasn't to, it was to hang out with you, Clark.
1104040	1105720	That's that I'll, I'll stay here.
1105720	1110080	It wasn't for any other reason other than I just wanted to hang out with you.
1110080	1111080	Yeah.
1111080	1112080	Of course.
1112080	1113080	I had a great time.
1113080	1116920	He knows deep inside that Keith was just real scared tonight about all the things we'd seen
1116920	1120640	today and he knows that he's, this is his way of reaching out for comfort and this is
1120640	1121640	time of need.
1121640	1126060	Um, I go to sleep in the bed that Clark has made for me.
1126060	1128960	I wait until Clark goes to sleep.
1128960	1129960	Yeah.
1129960	1133360	I go ahead and go to bed like right, like after that conversation, I'm like, I want
1133360	1135040	to, I want to pass out.
1135040	1140180	I call my landlord at the hotel and I say, Hey, is there an open room that I can stay
1140180	1142540	in besides my own tonight?
1142540	1146540	Cause I've got somebody that might be after me in the morning.
1146540	1147580	There's definitely an open room.
1147580	1150860	So I, um, I clean up our TV dinners.
1150860	1152940	I move the couch back.
1152940	1156500	I quietly leave Bishop's house.
1156500	1171180	Keith, when you may get back to hotel motel, you are getting out of your police cruiser
1171180	1175660	when a young girl approaches you.
1175660	1179800	She seems to be a high schooler and you recognize her.
1179800	1181100	This is your niece.
1181100	1183020	It's Ferguson's daughter.
1183020	1184020	What's her name?
1184020	1186260	Oh, my niece is Francis beans.
1186260	1187260	Okay.
1187260	1197660	So Francis Francis, she walks up to you and she puts a finger over her mouth and hands
1197660	1198980	you a note.
1198980	1199980	Yeah.
1199980	1204860	If you want to read that aloud, no one hates my dad more than you.
1204860	1207860	So I'm coming to you first with this opportunity.
1207860	1213420	I know you have no love for your parents, especially after they left everything to Fergie,
1213420	1216360	but I recently found out their deaths for no accident.
1216360	1218460	He killed them when he needed the money.
1218460	1221360	I found his will all of his money.
1221360	1225860	Some of which I think you deserve goes to me upon his death.
1225860	1231860	I will give you $1 million to kill my dad, please.
1231860	1233200	We deserve it.
1233200	1235300	He deserves it.
1235300	1238200	Follow me in your car, but don't make it obvious.
1238200	1243400	And she holds a lighter underneath the note and she lights it.
1243400	1244400	She kind of motions.
1244400	1248580	I throw the note off to the side as it's burning.
1248580	1256680	And she goes over and hops in her Chrysler Sebring and kind of motions for you to follow
1256680	1257680	her.
1257680	1258680	I look around.
1258680	1261440	Can I do a search for anyone around us?
1261440	1262440	Sure.
1262440	1263440	Yeah.
1263440	1264440	Six.
1264440	1268500	You see that no one is out and about right now.
1268500	1269500	No one's watching.
1269500	1273860	I reluctantly get in the passenger side of her car.
1273860	1281700	When you get into her car, she looks at you and she rolls her eyes and she's like, um,
1281700	1283840	maybe get in your own car.
1283840	1285440	Maybe follow me in your car.
1285440	1288860	Like it said on the fucking note, maybe.
1288860	1293340	No, take me to where you're going to go.
1293340	1294340	Okay.
1294460	1299380	And she drives up and hops on the highway and heads toward the city.
1309380	1314060	John Lee Pettymore, as you were driving north through contention on the way to your home,
1314060	1318340	you go over the bridge that travels over Coles Creek.
1318340	1324440	Looking out the window of your borrowed and pounded vehicle, you see animals of all size
1324440	1330940	and type filling the waters below, but you notice there are fewer and fewer animals the
1330940	1333960	farther north you drive.
1333960	1337780	After passing the highway and leaving the city limits of contention, you turn down a
1337780	1345180	long gravel road that eventually leads to the isolated home of officer Pettymore.
1345180	1346940	What do you do upon arrival?
1346980	1348740	I'm going to give Drew a call real quick.
1348740	1351020	Bring, bring, bring, bring.
1351020	1351520	Hey.
1351520	1353820	Hey Drew, is everything set for tonight?
1353820	1354820	Everything's ready to go.
1354820	1355820	When do you want me to come out?
1355820	1357500	Uh, what time did you tell them to meet?
1357500	1358500	2 a.m.
1358500	1359500	2 a.m.
1359500	1360500	All right.
1360500	1361500	Why don't you get here around midnight?
1361500	1362500	Okay, perfect.
1362500	1363500	All right.
1363500	1364500	I'll see you then.
1364500	1365500	All right.
1365500	1366500	Okay.
1366500	1367500	I'm excited buddy.
1367500	1368500	Me too.
1368500	1369500	We're going to be rich.
1369500	1370500	Hopefully.
1370500	1371500	Okay.
1371500	1372500	Okay.
1372660	1377860	Like John Lee Pettymore gives himself a moment to, uh, to imagine that just like, what if,
1377860	1378860	what if it does all go well?
1378860	1384340	What if I do get that money and he, he sits in the, the Toyota Corolla for about five
1384340	1388820	minutes just like letting himself feel that and kind of trying to de-stress a little bit.
1388820	1395360	He's going to try to get a little nap before, before, uh, everything goes down.
1395360	1398620	So yeah, he's just excited to get back to his home.
1398620	1399620	Absolutely.
1399620	1405780	As you walk into your house, however, your entire home has been flipped over.
1405780	1410620	It looks like someone broke in and rifled through all of your shit.
1410620	1412080	What the hell?
1412080	1413300	What the fucking hell?
1413300	1418220	As you're going through room by room, trying to piece together what's happening with your
1418220	1424660	gun out, you notice that you're, uh, Smokey and the Bandit DVDs and all the memorabilia
1424660	1426020	has been knocked over.
1426020	1427700	Some of it's been stepped on.
1427780	1429780	Smokey's!
1429780	1432780	I would do such a thing.
1432780	1434780	God damn it.
1434780	1440260	First this whole fucking town goes to shit and then somebody steps on my Smokey DVDs
1440260	1445300	and now it's fucking, what a goddamn horrible day.
1445300	1456980	And as you are looking about, you see, there is a Burgatory Rewards card for Keith Vigna
1456980	1457980	on the floor.
1457980	1460180	I'm, I'm gonna kill him.
1460180	1463980	I'm gonna fucking kill that son of a bitch.
1463980	1472860	That idiot, incompetent, coke-addled, motherfucking ransacker, I'm going to kill him.
1472860	1475780	You say to an empty, turned-over home.
1475780	1476780	Ah!
1476780	1479980	I fire my gun several times into the ceiling.
1479980	1486820	Dust and, like, the popcorn from the ceiling starts coming down around you.
1487660	1489660	You had popcorn in your ceiling, right?
1489660	1491300	Yeah, I keep several.
1491300	1492660	It's cheaper than insulation.
1492660	1494140	You just go to the stadium.
1494140	1500140	So the sprint car racing, they just used to give me big ol' bags of the popcorn.
1500140	1503620	If you keep it in plastic, it doesn't go bad.
1503620	1507700	And that is, yeah, the squirrels had chewed through all my old shit, so.
1507700	1509500	They definitely won't chew through the popcorn.
1509500	1510500	Well not in plastic.
1510500	1514180	They can't smell it.
1514180	1517940	It does, I mean, now that it's raining down on me here, it does look like the squirrel,
1517940	1522940	yeah, like, it's mostly just kernels, so, I think that, yeah, I think they got into
1522940	1523940	it.
1523940	1524940	Yeah.
1524940	1529500	He lets his frustration out, shooting, shooting his gun into the roof, and then he just collapses
1529500	1531140	onto the couch, dejected.
1531140	1535780	Would you run and try to make sure that the cocaine is still where you put it?
1535780	1537500	Would you be worried about that?
1537500	1538500	No.
1538500	1542940	Well, it was dark, but it would have taken, like, excavation to get it, yeah, and I don't
1542940	1544940	think I saw any signs of that.
1544940	1547460	How are you prepping for the deal that's going down?
1547460	1548580	I don't think he would sleep now.
1548580	1550660	I think he's too angry to sleep.
1550660	1557580	John Lee Pennymore just needs to stay focused, and he is unspeakably angry at Keith, but
1557580	1561920	he's going to rechannel that anger into just energy for tonight.
1561920	1568340	What he's going to do right now is smoke a big ol' bowl and put on smoking the bandit
1568340	1573580	and just de-stress for a minute and just fucking try to forget it all for a minute.
1573580	1576540	I'm going to be a rich man in two hours.
1576540	1579260	I just got to fucking, er, four hours.
1579260	1581300	Drew gets here in two hours.
1581300	1593780	I just got to calm down, watch Smokey, and then tomorrow I'm going to kill Keith Igna.
1593780	1598020	Then the credits roll on Smokey and the bandit extended cut.
1598020	1599020	The doorbell rings.
1599020	1600660	Gun draw, and I go to the door.
1600660	1601660	Yeah, it's Drew.
1601660	1602660	I peek through.
1602660	1603660	Hey, hey, buddy.
1603660	1604660	Hey!
1604660	1605660	Come on in.
1605660	1606660	Okay, cool.
1606660	1612460	And he is holding a pistol, and he is holding it, like, by the top.
1612460	1616060	Hey, Drew, you ever shot one of those before?
1616060	1617060	Nope.
1617060	1618060	Okay, we got a couple hours.
1618060	1620300	I'm going to give you a quick rundown on all this.
1620300	1622260	See, here's the safety.
1622260	1623260	You got that off.
1623260	1624260	Yep.
1624260	1625260	Yeah, you want to put that on.
1625260	1626260	Oh, okay.
1626260	1627260	Let's go.
1627260	1628260	I got a shooting tree.
1628260	1629260	Let's go back and shoot the shooting tree for a minute.
1629260	1632700	You guys go back and shoot the shooting tree for a minute, and he's not, you know, he's
1632700	1633700	not good.
1633700	1635580	I at least want to teach him how to, like, hold it.
1635580	1637580	Yeah, you don't think he's going to shoot you.
1637580	1638580	No.
1638580	1643620	Unless things get really bad, I want you to just keep that safety on, but I do feel like
1643620	1646900	we've taught you how to hold this and look more intimidating to the mafia.
1646900	1647900	I couldn't agree more.
1647900	1650020	I look very intimidating.
1650020	1653460	She says with four inches of gums just hanging out.
1653460	1655740	Man, Emmett made the right call.
1655740	1656740	Emmett's so cool.
1656740	1657740	What'd you say?
1657740	1658740	Nothing, buddy.
1658740	1659740	Okay, cool.
1659740	1663340	You're, hey, you can get a billion gum surgeries with all the money we're going to have.
1663340	1666340	I didn't even consider, oh my goodness.
1666340	1668180	Think about that, buddy.
1668180	1669980	John, what's sex like?
1669980	1671540	That's not bad.
1671540	1672540	Okay.
1672540	1673540	Maybe one day.
1673540	1675540	How old are you, dude?
1675540	1676540	I'm 57.
1676540	1677540	No.
1677540	1678980	He's in his early 30s.
1678980	1684060	God, you must moisturize.
1684060	1685300	We're getting you laid.
1685300	1686300	We're going to get you laid tonight.
1686300	1687300	Okay.
1687300	1688300	Probably not tonight.
1688300	1689300	I'm very tired.
1689300	1692420	I should not be making a cocaine deal at two in the morning.
1692420	1697500	I'm extremely wounded and this town is beset by unnatural horrors.
1697500	1700940	So maybe we'll have to wait until next week, but we'll get you laid, buddy.
1700940	1701940	Okay.
1701940	1702940	Oh my goodness.
1702940	1703940	Okay, cool.
1703940	1705940	Is there a strip club in town?
1705940	1711020	No, there's just a, there's an auto mechanic called sassy reds.
1711020	1712020	Okay.
1712020	1715240	It's a pink Cadillac.
1715240	1719980	It's coming up on, that's so much better.
1719980	1722460	So it's coming up on 2 AM.
1722460	1726340	I'm going to go ahead and have you lose two willpower for me.
1726340	1727340	Okay.
1727340	1728340	I'm down to eight.
1728340	1730540	And then what do you want to do last minute?
1730540	1732060	Get ready.
1732060	1735020	You think they could probably be rolling up whenever.
1735020	1738220	So drew, I've, I've made some arrangements here.
1738220	1742300	I'm just going to check to make sure that's all on place.
1742300	1744180	Just out to the woods.
1744180	1750980	I just kind of make a bird call and a similar, but slightly different bird returns.
1750980	1751980	The call.
1751980	1755300	I love the great Northern collar.
1755300	1756300	It's my favorite bird.
1756300	1757300	Drew.
1757300	1758300	How about you?
1758300	1759300	Oh, I've never heard of that one.
1759300	1760620	I'm a fan of pigeons.
1760620	1761620	Okay.
1761620	1764060	Those sure are birds.
1764100	1766020	Uh, I'm going to do a little bump too.
1766020	1767020	Okay, cool.
1767020	1771940	Go ahead and roll a D six, four, four willpower back, full.
1771940	1772940	Yeah.
1772940	1773940	12.
1773940	1778100	It feels to you like right before lunch, I'm ready to start my day.
1778100	1786420	That's a joke, but that's also just true to John and Thomas.
1786420	1792460	Well, we've established that John goes to work at like 7 AM.
1792500	1800100	Okay, so you hear a car turn down your road, you've got a long driveway and you see the
1800100	1809660	lights and it is a large white 15 passenger van that is pulling a white trailer behind
1809660	1817420	it and as it pulls up to your homestead, you would see painted on the van as well as the
1817420	1822540	trailer in large block letters, it says Jesus Christ ministries.
1822540	1823540	Oh shit.
1823540	1829740	As you're looking at it, it looks like the 15 passenger van is filled with children.
1829740	1833540	Hey, uh, uh, Drew, what the fuck are all the kids doing in the van?
1833540	1835340	I have absolutely no idea.
1835340	1837580	Um, who are we meeting exactly?
1837580	1838580	His name is the Duke.
1838580	1839580	He's with the mafia?
1839580	1840580	I don't-
1840580	1841580	How do you know the Duke?
1841580	1842580	I-I-
1842580	1844500	God, we should have covered some of this before.
1844500	1845500	Probably.
1845580	1852140	As you guys are having that conversation, the van passenger door opens up and the most
1852140	1856620	handsome man you've ever seen gets out of the van.
1856620	1862980	He has perfect hair, perfect teeth, a perfect jawline and he is wearing the fuck out of
1862980	1871180	a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel and he begins walking
1871180	1876140	up to the two of you on the porch and he just stands there.
1876140	1877740	He's the Duke?
1877740	1879260	Yes I am.
1879260	1880740	Are you Drew?
1880740	1881740	Drew's here.
1881740	1890300	Uh, yes, I'm Drew and I believe you've got some cocaine for me, is that correct?
1890300	1892940	I believe you have some money for us?
1892940	1895380	Uh, that is certainly correct.
1895380	1898740	Alright, well we'll point your boys where to dig in.
1898820	1902980	We got the cocaine on the property here, store it away, uh, why don't you show us the money?
1902980	1906580	You give half of it to us, we'll show you the first hole, give us the other half, we'll
1906580	1908100	show you the second hole.
1908100	1909300	Seems like a deal.
1909300	1914860	He is going to turn around and walk back into the van.
1914860	1922540	He kind of leans in, you hear him say something, and then he comes back out with a briefcase
1922540	1924260	handcuffed to his wrist.
1924300	1934460	I've got half, which is five billion dollars US currency, in this briefcase.
1934460	1940420	And you see a bunch of children run out, they're all carrying shovels, and they stay pretty
1940420	1944500	far away, they're like on the other side of the van, they all kind of line up, like staring
1944500	1948900	at you, all holding the shovels in the exact same way in front of them.
1948900	1952540	And he says, where do you want me to dig?
1952540	1956860	Drew, go take a look at that briefcase, make sure everything's alright.
1956860	1957860	Okay.
1957860	1963300	And he pops over there, looks into the briefcase, he cracks it open, closes it right back up,
1963300	1968980	Drew walks back, I don't know, it seems like a whole shitload of money in there, John.
1968980	1973300	Alright buddy, hold onto your britches, you're not Keith.
1973300	1975300	Keith, his britches too big.
1975300	1976460	Yeah, I think they're too big.
1976460	1977460	Too big.
1977460	1978460	Yeah, so they fall off.
1978460	1979460	Fucking first.
1979860	1985020	Anyway, alright, just hold onto your britches buddy, we're not through this yet.
1985020	1991300	Alright Duke, you see that maple tree over there?
1991300	1992540	Get to digging.
1992540	2000900	And he points, and the children in a beautiful single file line, all with the same movements
2000900	2005500	run over, and all at the exact same time begin digging.
2005540	2009900	Mr. Duke, while you got your children there digging, can I ask you a couple questions?
2009900	2010900	Go for it.
2010900	2014380	Uh, why you got children out here digging for cocaine at two in the morning?
2014380	2015980	I didn't have anybody else.
2015980	2016980	How'd you get them?
2016980	2020180	Um, well, I made those children.
2020180	2021180	They're yours?
2021180	2022180	Yep.
2022180	2023180	Same mom?
2023180	2025580	Uh, yeah, yeah, you can say that.
2025580	2032420	And he walks back over, and these kids are digging so fucking fast, dirt is just like
2032420	2038660	flying everywhere, and they get down and, I'm assuming this is where the cocaine is,
2038660	2039660	is that correct?
2039660	2041700	Okay, so about half of it.
2041700	2049380	And they start piling the cocaine into the trailer that is being pulled behind the van.
2049380	2056900	And the Duke walks over and unlatches the handcuff from the other end and hands you
2056900	2057900	the briefcase.
2057900	2060660	There's five million dollars in it.
2060660	2061660	Alright.
2061900	2065900	That's, wow, that's a lot of money.
2065900	2069820	Duke, uh, Duke, Duke, show us the other case.
2069820	2071340	You're a stickler.
2071340	2076940	And he walks back to the van and hooks another case onto his wrist and walks back over to
2076940	2078860	you and gives you a peek.
2078860	2079860	Looks the same.
2079860	2082460	Alright, just round back behind that woodpile.
2082460	2083740	Your boy should see the hole.
2083740	2085580	Well, alright.
2085580	2092380	And he sends the children over to behind the woodpile, and they begin digging just as furiously
2092380	2093820	as they did the first time.
2093820	2095500	Drew, can I speak to you for a minute?
2095500	2096500	Yeah.
2096500	2098940	You don't know nothing about, what kind of crime is this Duke involved in?
2098940	2100700	I think he's a drug dealer.
2100700	2104340	Alright, yeah, that's fair.
2104340	2105340	That's fair.
2105340	2107340	Uh, how dangerous do you think he is?
2107340	2109340	I mean, he just brought children.
2109340	2114540	I haven't told you this, but we've got about a dozen petty moor cousins watching us from
2114540	2115540	the trees right now.
2115540	2116540	What?
2116540	2117540	Yeah, man.
2117540	2118540	Overwatch.
2118540	2119540	Like...
2119540	2120540	I thought it was just me and you.
2120540	2121540	That takes so much stress off my shoulders.
2121540	2123100	I should have probably told you, yeah.
2123100	2124100	Oh my goodness.
2124100	2128260	But I don't see a fucking, I don't see any goons or muscle, just all these children.
2128260	2131900	And, you know, I don't want to take candy from a baby, but it seems like we could just
2131900	2135900	take the ten million dollars and all the cocaine.
2135900	2138380	What kind of retribution would that bring down upon us?
2138380	2140940	You want to fuck with a drug dealer from the city?
2140940	2141940	Maybe.
2141940	2146100	I'm just saying, it seems like the opportunity has presented itself.
2146100	2148500	But then we'd just have to sell the cocaine again.
2148500	2149500	This was really stressful.
2149500	2151060	I've been pooping all day.
2151060	2157140	Yeah, but imagine how easy you would poop from now on if you had ten million dollars.
2157140	2162660	I honestly don't see that much of a difference between five and ten million dollars, but...
2162660	2164860	It's twice, there's twice a difference.
2164860	2168500	Yeah, math was never my strong suit, but I just think...
2168500	2171300	I don't know, it's just a thought I had.
2171340	2173620	Maybe he's got somebody watching us, I don't know, but...
2173620	2174620	John?
2174620	2175620	Fuck, yeah?
2175620	2177780	I'm down with whatever you want to do.
2177780	2179260	Just give me a signal, okay?
2179260	2180540	Yell bubblegum tree.
2180540	2182060	What's that mean?
2182060	2183060	Just kidding.
2183060	2188980	Oh my god, I got so scared for a moment, and he like hits you on the chest with his hand
2188980	2189980	and he's like...
2189980	2193860	Oh man, you're so silly, I like doing this with you.
2193860	2195940	Me too Drew, you're a fun guy.
2195940	2201540	And the children are now taking the second pile of cocaine and loading it up into the
2201540	2204100	trailer behind this van.
2204100	2212500	And when they are finished, the Duke walks toward you and undoes the lock on the handcuffs
2212500	2216340	to the briefcase and hands you the briefcase.
2216340	2219780	Well this is just fucking great.
2219780	2223860	I love it when a deal goes off without a hitch.
2223860	2224860	Me too.
2224860	2227820	This went off far smoother than I expected it to.
2227820	2231100	I do have a couple questions though.
2231100	2235180	And I understand I might have to grease your palms to get you to talk, but you just gave
2235180	2236180	me a shitload of money.
2236180	2240780	It seems like I'm in a position to give a little bit back and I slip them like a grand.
2240780	2241780	What is this for?
2241780	2243520	That's a down payment for some information.
2243520	2249500	I wouldn't give me any money until you have the information you think this money is worth.
2249500	2254460	I think the information I'm looking for might be worth a little bit more than a grand.
2254460	2258140	You ask the question, I'll name the price, and we can figure it out.
2258140	2262220	What do you know about Marvin Glass?
2262220	2267340	Well, I don't fucking like him.
2267340	2271900	I would consider him my competition, I suppose.
2271900	2279660	Although he is also a customer, I guess it's a bit of a mixed bag, my relationship with
2279660	2280660	Marvin Glass.
2280660	2284020	A personal customer, or he buys in bulk from you?
2284020	2286740	That'll be one thousand dollars.
2286740	2287740	Done.
2287740	2289180	He buys in bulk.
2289180	2291300	Do you know anything about his boys?
2291300	2292300	Like his uh...
2292300	2293300	His two sons.
2293300	2294300	Oh, I don't know.
2294300	2300820	He has them, I don't know, he has them run muscle for them sometimes, he has them shake
2300820	2301820	people down.
2301820	2302820	I don't fucking know.
2302820	2306700	Neither one of them have ever been much of a threat to me.
2306700	2310140	What are y'all hearing in the city about what's been going down under contention?
2310140	2311500	Anything making the news up there?
2311500	2318460	Well, I have heard, uh, you know, it's a bit on the news that the contingent police department
2318460	2323780	is uh, doing a pretty fucking terrible job, and they're probably gonna get eroded real
2323780	2324780	soon.
2324780	2329500	So, you know, I don't know, seems like a bunch of death and murder, it's gotten a lot of
2329500	2332500	the fuzz off my back, I'll tell you that much.
2332500	2334940	The city fuzz is focusing their attention down here?
2334940	2340180	Well, I don't know, things have been pretty smooth for me recently, I'm not sure what
2340180	2341180	that's all about.
2341180	2343940	Hey, Mr. Duke, is there any significance to the rose you wear?
2343940	2348220	I like the way it smells.
2348220	2351060	I can't smell, I don't have the sense to smell, it's a joke.
2351060	2352060	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
2352060	2353860	I look fresh as fuck, don't you think?
2353860	2356940	You're pretty fly, I mean, it's a good thing you had all those kids to do that digging
2356940	2357940	with that white suit.
2357940	2359100	I absolutely agree.
2359100	2360500	These are all your kids?
2360500	2365300	And he turns around, Drew, it's good doing business with you, I think we're done here.
2365300	2369740	And he opens up the passenger door of the van.
2369740	2376580	And the children all load in with military precision before the Duke gives a quick bow,
2376580	2381900	hops into the white van with Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side, and begins
2381900	2388620	the wide turn necessary to head back down John's long gravel driveway.
2388620	2394700	The van drives away into darkness, and Drew looks at you with wide eyes.
2394700	2395700	Drew?
2395700	2396700	Yeah?
2397700	2399700	We're fucking millionaires, buddy.
2399700	2402700	Oh my god, we're fucking millionaires.
2402700	2405700	Oh my god.
2405700	2407700	This is incredible.
2407700	2410700	We just gotta get out of this town alive first.
2410700	2412700	Should we leave tomorrow?
2412700	2414700	I hadn't, I hadn't thought about it.
2414700	2418700	Drew, you wouldn't, would you leave the boys at a time like this?
2418700	2421700	Cause fuck it, man, now that you said it, I think I might.
2421700	2432700	Well, I definitely don't need the paycheck anymore, and honestly, you know, our relationship
2432700	2437700	has gotten stronger over the past couple days through all this.
2437700	2442700	You know, I like Clark, Keith can certainly kiss my piss.
2442700	2443700	Kiss my piss?
2443700	2445700	Kiss my piss.
2445700	2452700	He hands you, he hands you the firearm that he brought, and he's like, I honestly feel
2452700	2454700	really weird holding this.
2454700	2458700	Hey buddy though, listen, you're a cocaine millionaire now.
2458700	2459700	Hold onto it.
2459700	2461700	You might need it for protection.
2461700	2462700	Okay.
2462700	2465700	And he takes it back, and he's holding it correctly this time.
2465700	2468700	He actually checks and makes sure the safety is on.
2468700	2472700	John doesn't say anything, but like he wells up with pride just a little bit.
2472700	2477700	Jimmy whistles and calls the Pettymore cousins out of the woods.
2477700	2478700	Awesome.
2478700	2481700	I'm trying to remember your cousin's name that saw the oil.
2481700	2482700	Oh yeah.
2482700	2484700	I don't think I've invited him.
2484700	2485700	Jimmy.
2485700	2486700	Not him.
2486700	2487700	Not the shrooms guy?
2487700	2488700	No.
2488700	2489700	These are younger cousins.
2489700	2490700	Fair enough.
2490700	2492700	Like the youngest one is probably like 15.
2492700	2493700	Okay, yeah.
2493700	2494700	Oldest?
2494700	2495700	40.
2495700	2496700	Nice.
2496700	2498700	Okay, so they all come out of the woods.
2498700	2500700	Do you want to describe that?
2500700	2501700	Yeah.
2501700	2508260	So about eight very clearly Pettymores just step out from behind some trees in a circle
2508260	2515120	around everywhere, and the youngest is 15, the oldest is 40, but they all are unmistakably
2515120	2516500	of John's family.
2516500	2520700	Like the blood is strong and perhaps intertwined.
2520700	2522820	Oh yeah.
2522820	2523820	And yeah, John-
2523820	2525700	Nothing stronger than incest blood.
2525700	2526700	Nope.
2526700	2531380	John gives them each 10 grand out of his suitcase and says, good work boys.
2531380	2533020	I'll see you all at the reunion.
2533020	2534020	They all like-
2534020	2537340	Oh yeah, and I toss them a 24 pack of keystone light.
2537340	2538980	Hell yeah.
2538980	2544100	They all like do a jump in the air and like high five each other.
2544100	2545100	Yeah.
2545100	2548700	We all take our pistols out and fire them into the air.
2548700	2549700	Fuck yes.
2549700	2550700	Freeze frame.
2550700	2550700	
2561700	2566540	Clark, after you go to bed, you are having a little trouble sleeping.
2566540	2570860	This is the first time someone's slept in your house in a long time.
2570860	2579060	And you actually hear Keith open his door, walk out and you hear him open the front door
2579060	2583540	and then you hear him leave and you hear a car start up and then you hear the car back
2583540	2584540	out of the driveway.
2584540	2587220	I want to get up and go to the front door and lock it.
2587220	2588220	You do so?
2588220	2589220	And I'm going to go back to bed.
2589220	2590220	Okay, cool.
2590260	2598500	So as you go back to your bed, looking out the window, you see Coles Creek which runs
2598500	2605140	alongside your house and it flows down south from the lake at Centennial Park up north.
2605140	2611700	You see the whole thing is packed with animals and a fair few people have been out and about
2611700	2613460	looking for their pets.
2613460	2615480	There's maybe one or two people out there now.
2615480	2623520	But then you see another human and this one is in the creek hobbling down the frigid waterway
2623520	2625040	in your direction.
2625040	2630200	It's running, but it seems to be fighting through a limp and when he reaches the point
2630200	2636360	in the creek closest to your house, he leaps from the water and begins screaming and waving
2636360	2640000	his arms all while looking in your specific direction.
2640000	2642120	I need you to roll Sanity for me.
2642120	2648360	I pass 23 on a 29.
2648360	2649360	Okay, cool.
2649360	2655320	You're going to lose one Sanity and I don't know how you're going to rationalize this.
2655320	2662320	Your brain is like having a hard time processing this, but this man making his way toward your
2662320	2664920	house is you.
2664920	2667400	Oh shit.
2667400	2672320	All of a sudden you feel a warm pinch on the back of your neck and your vision tunnels
2672320	2674560	to a close.
2674560	2681360	You come to as a black bag is being snatched off your head.
2681360	2685920	You feel hung over and your chest feels weird and tight.
2685920	2692780	It smells damp and earthy and there's a haze around the torch above you shedding partial
2692780	2697580	light from the middle of this small stonewalled room.
2697580	2704420	You are sitting in a chair across a stone table from a man with grey hair under a white
2704420	2709260	hard hat in a charcoal suit with a bolo tie.
2709260	2714980	He looks relaxed as he tosses the black bag onto the table and begins to speak.
2714980	2721220	Okay, so after Richard III's coronation, he was visited by a seer from Leichster who
2721220	2723960	called himself the overseer.
2723960	2730360	The seer claimed that the now king was to hold some very important knowledge but would
2730360	2733500	need to have the restraint to not abuse this power.
2733500	2737860	See, Richard was given this knowledge, but he couldn't handle it.
2737860	2740740	He lost his mind and killed his two nephews.
2740740	2747580	The overseer, disappointed, eventually passed the same knowledge down to a Henry Tudor so
2747580	2751140	he could whoop Richard at Bosworth.
2751140	2757020	Henry VII held this power and eventually passed it down to a reliable and trusted confidant,
2757020	2759860	thankfully not his piece of shit son.
2759860	2765460	This knowledge was passed down repeatedly, abused and respected, respected and abused
2765460	2769800	until it made its way over the Atlantic to the colonies.
2769800	2777280	Eventually landing with a high order of masons, a select few held this information for generations.
2777280	2779960	But a grand purpose was never found.
2779960	2782020	Until Paul Simon.
2782020	2783960	The politician, not the singer.
2783960	2788840	Soon after being elected to the Senate, he was walking near his home when he came across
2788840	2792200	the first known xenonimatode.
2792200	2797720	He sought out Robert Byrd, the Senate minority leader at the time to share his newfound understanding
2797720	2799120	of the world.
2799120	2803800	Thankfully for the world, Byrd was among those carrying the knowledge of the overseer from
2803800	2806000	centuries before.
2806000	2812360	Together they formed a small circle of men to hold the weight of this realization.
2812360	2818260	Now today, we carry on their tradition by keeping the darkness out of this world.
2818260	2823320	We are the opaque rampart delaying the destruction of life as we know it.
2823320	2826120	Welcome to the circle of knowledge.
2826120	2828140	Now you have questions, I'm sure.
2828140	2832360	And I know this sounds hypocritical after that lengthy oration, but as my high school
2832360	2836840	English teacher would always say, show, don't tell.
2836840	2842120	And he immediately reaches under the table, and as he stands, he holds up an unspeakable
2842120	2846240	worm-like abomination with one hand away from his body.
2846240	2852560	The thing is two feet long and tube-like, covered in a squeamish black partially translucent
2852560	2853620	membrane.
2853620	2860720	Its body is segmented, and toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through
2860760	2863160	its thin looking exterior.
2863160	2866760	It has no identifiable eyes or nose.
2866760	2873560	Its cavernous circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked
2873560	2880560	teeth and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black.
2890720	2915720	How am I the only one trying to fool over How can you have enough drowning out of the
