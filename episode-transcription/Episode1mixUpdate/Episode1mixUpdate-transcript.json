{"text": " What's everybody do? Keep going. Oh boy. My name is Zach and this is pretending to be people We are a role-playing podcast and we are playing the game Delta green, but it's not really Delta green It's an amalgamation that we have come up with that is a mixture of the role-playing systems Delta green and pulp Cthulhu with all that nerdy shit out of the way for the rest of you listening This is a collaborative storytelling experience that you will be listening to over the coming weeks I am here with Joe. Hey, I'm Joe Luke. I'm Luke and Thomas I'm Thomas having heard many stories from other DMS GM's out there. I consider myself to be Extremely lucky with the group that I have been blessed with as a player same same same We have been playing together for three years now. This is our third campaign We ran two ten-month-long Delta green campaigns where we played weekly and we've kept the exact same group ever since I Am fully in love with this game Thomas. What's your experience with role-playing? I started with D&D like a lot of people and Wanted something a little more story based and less mechanics driven I didn't like sitting around for 30 minutes while the wizard took his turn. So Delta green was perfect for that It's all about character interaction and like solving this mystery together and combats are very like combat is very simple quick and rare and rare Yeah, and violently, you know, you're shooting guns at each other. It ends it gets over with quickly Like you said we've been playing together for the past few years. That's been the highlight of my week that whole time I'm Luke my role-playing experience in high school. I played Dungeons Dragons twice the group that I played with Didn't take it very seriously and our DM took it very seriously So we were not invited back to play and then after that the next time I played was Delta green with Zach and Thomas and a couple other people and yeah, I Loved it. I've pretty much constantly been playing it since I Started playing with this group Thomas actually texted me kind of out of the blue one day about wanting to do D&D game with some mutual friends of ours and I I think unbeknownst to him I had already been kind of wanting that I had been listening to podcasts and watching shows on Twitch and things like that So we did it It was it was awesome to have that all of a sudden pop up that group didn't last for very long But pretty quickly after that dissolved Thomas again asked if I wanted to join you guys and I said fuck Yeah, and you guys seem to like me so I stuck around we were big fans. You brought an element of seriousness to our table Much needed that had not existed there before I remember the Very first time that you role-played with us you were playing Taylor my wife's partner Yeah, you gave me a couple options for characters and I picked the FBI agent. Yeah, I'd seen X-Files And then we had one of our best sessions to date right then and there it was amazing I don't he brought the energy for sure. I'd never met Joe before I played with him now. I see him every week Hey, baby I hope that you guys become our best friends the way that I have become best friends with my role-playing group As we wiggle our way into your ear holes each week, please also invite us into your hearts and to your parties Yeah, invite us to your parties by a spear. We really like drinking drinking Marijuana. Yep, if you're offering are you offering are you offering? Hey internet listener? Are you holding PO box? I think it's worth mentioning that Zach created all of this stuff. We don't know anything that's happening We try to not talk about it too much outside of the game We really want to be surprised by each other and by Zach Yeah, and actually one of my favorite things about this group is as we've come to play together for longer periods of time We've kind of talked and you guys have given me full reign to fuck over your characters Which is a very fun thing to give your DM the right to do and I try to take full advantage of that There are a couple parts per episode where I will have written the description of a character or the description of a place But outside of that everything is improv. It is also a closed game. Oh, that's a really good point Luke So we play a closed game so anytime one of these characters goes off on their own the player also sits in the room with Just me and we go through what happens that way the players can keep secrets from each other It's like secrets and lies the name of the game that continues outside the podcast, too We try not to talk to each other about what's going on in the game too much It's Kind of scary. It's kind of violent. Oh, yeah, this is a horror mystery. Yeah, this is a horror mystery graphic content warning You may see there is an explicit tag on all of our episodes This isn't just because we use the fuck word It's also because a lot of the descriptions within the story are going to be gruesome and brutal with Hopefully a lot of comedy and come for the heart stay for the gore come on the heart stick it to the door Come on the door come on the heart to in the stink it gets a lot worse than just shooting people Yeah, it can be pretty icky icky, but don't worry. We bring enough warmth and humanity and humor and humor hopefully humor We hope you think it's funny So we got together and we created a small town together that this story would take place in Contention contention is the name of this fictional town in this fictional universe that is based Loosely on our own world people could easily relate this to x-files or Season 1 of true detective pretty much anything that has a creepy supernatural Ambiance to it, but we're also going to try like to keep it funny Like that case in point with awesome Twilight jokes just fucking constantly we're on the bleeding edge of cultural relevance We recorded this in 2011 Basically what we've done is we've set up a Story in which these three guys are playing police officers of this small town of contention We did this for a couple reasons It's an easy way to get them involved in a mystery within their small town and have the power and the free time To look into said mystery very excited to have our friend Justin involved in this podcast He will be the first voice that you hear as Justin is playing wolf the dog the a.m radio DJ in the town of contention who will be our narrator and Introduce each episode. He is also responsible for creating the original music that you will hear backing this Podcast Justin did all of our music except for the intro except for the intro which was done by kudzu a band from our Hometown of Springfield, Missouri kudzu. You look them up on bandcamp. Thank you kudzu. Thank you kudzu We also record it in the nude. You should know that Hot room hot room sweaty.

Oh, okay Okay, I'll get him on the phone. The day is closing up and it's probably around 5 p.m and drew Andrews this man with the gums and the Small teeth comes out from the back room and he's got a little cupcake and it's got one candle in it and the candles lit and he goes over and knocks on the door of the chief of police of contention chief Chief we got his fries for you. She comes on out. It's a small little birthday celebration for the chief Maggie cook She's a strong fit woman with a dark bob and intense eyes Always in uniform this woman you've never seen her not wearing her uniform He pulls out this little gift that's wrapped and she opens it and it is a new journal And you guys would know that she always has a blue journal with her like a notebook everywhere She goes and it's the specific brand that she likes. And so this one is yellow Oh, so now you have one of each color, isn't that it's neat. Thank you so much drew I really appreciate you doing that for me This is really this is really sweet kind of looks around the office at you guys Clark goes ahead and gets in his desk Kind of rummages for a second. He pulls out a little box of chocolates with a bow on it. Happy birthday, Maggie I should have seen this coming Clark. Yep. I know you like them. So I thought I'd do it do it again this year They're my favorite and she she opens the box immediately and pops one in her mouth. Mmm. Happy birthday to me Can I can I have one? Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course Clark. I grab one without asking I Go into my desk and I pull out like two-thirds of a bottle of cheap bourbon. Hey, here you go Maggie Happy birthday chief. She looks at it and she's kind of like oh, yeah This will go. No, it's not your brand. This will go nicely With the the three-quarters of a bottle that I have sitting on my bar cart from last year Yeah, well, you know, happy birthday, thank you very much John I appreciate that and then you all kind of look over at Keith who and I'm I'm Sweating because I had no idea that it was her birthday This is my I've been here for like like a couple months maybe when you are sweating She looks and there is a box that's sitting in the room. That's this white box with a black bow on it Oh Keith You wrap this present beautifully I thank you so much I had no idea that you would have even known it was my birthday Yeah, I I don't pride myself on giving the best gifts, but I do pride myself on Wrapping wrapping the best. She grabs it and she starts opening the bow and she opens the top of it. Oh, oh Oh my god, and she immediately walks back into her office and closes the door behind her What what did you get her Keith I didn't that was not mine I didn't even know it was her birthday you fucked up who Was that one of your guys's boxes or drew was that yours? I go look go over to the bat box and see if there's a tag or anything So she took the box in with her into the drew the office drew. Did you do you know where that box came from? No, I didn't see anything come in. That's really strange. It just it was just here I guess and it was probably right it might have been right and right about at that moment The chief comes walking out of her office and she is completely broken down Tears have clearly been streaming down her face. Her face is red. You've never seen her in this emotional state before Keith What the hell did you get her was not mine. She Immediately walks from her door out of the office Chief Doesn't even pay attention takes off and it's gone. Did she have the box in her hands? No, I Feel really bad. I'm gonna go into her office and see what was in that box. Yeah, you messed up this gift, buddy So when you walk into her office, it's neat. It's like a super office What a cool place. This is great. She keeps saying I want to be Very organized and you look inside this white box and there's no like wrapping or anything Inside of it. There's no paper or anything. I need a tag or anything on it. There's no tag on it There's just three items inside the box. It is a flower. It's a rose. It's a single rose There's a hard hat just like a straight-up normal white hard hat and a black silk bowtie. I want to plop that Hard hat on my head see if it fits it fits cool. I'm gonna put it back on the box Role-playing I'm gonna I'll go back out into the main room and tell them what I saw I come back out I I had the box in my hand I'm like does any of this mean anything to you and I asked the DM does any of that mean anything to me? I don't I don't think any of these things would particularly stick out to you as having any Intrinsical meaning that's a weird collection of things there The phone rings as you guys are talking and drew picks up in his same like nervous hurried voice again He's just like drew a contention PD working at me and he's talking in the background as you guys are talking I wonder what's up with those dogs. I go into the Her office and look in the box and I pick up the tie and I want to see if there's any like is it monogrammed In any way, is there anything on the tag any any sign of any no ownership? Nope Okay, just a very plain black silk bowtie. It's untied drew is on the phone He hangs up and he looks at you guys and he's like Um fellas Somebody found a body out at the junkyard I Think this is an actual emergency you guys I Don't I don't know they hung up immediately she it was a woman's voice and she said that there was a body at the junkyard and that we needed to come out and And look at it immediately and she was she's kind of slurring her words Did you get her name? She just said Julie and then stopped immediately Talking after that and just hung up I don't know what happened, but there was like a I heard something kind of not break But I heard something kind of there was a noise and then she like screamed a little bit after she said her name And and then and then she hung up immediately and you said this out at the junkyard. Yeah Go check it out. Okay, so you guys all have Individual police cars that you can take. Yeah, I can ride together. I think we should all take our own cars Just in case I'm with you I take a pull of my bourbon off the Chiefs desk before I go out. Yeah any complaints from the other two officers? I don't think they see that You do it sneaky. I don't know petty more well enough to reprimand him So I just kind of turn a blind eye to that and okay So the three you'd go ahead and grab that pull off the bottle before you head out and the three of you are going out It's a dark night. I'd say it's pretty nice It actually feels more like fall than it does winter at this point in December 1st But there's like a light mist coming down. So I would say it's real dark out You got the streetlights guiding your way the junkyard sits on the far Southeast corner of town and it's where the old mine was This is an old mining town back in the 1800s and the junkyard is out on top of where the the old mine was throwing junk down the shaft That's I mean honestly just filling it up Oh, yeah Yeah and so you guys are gonna drive from downtown out on a few country roads to get out there and So supposed to be anyone Throwing the junk down the shaft That's actually their the motto of the junkyard. It says that on the sign Shaft shaft rowers piston junkyard shaft throwers. We can do better Let's return to that So you guys are driving out there it's night as you're going out there There is a car coming from the other direction that is flying going Maybe double the speed limit. It's probably 45 out here and this car is going 80 90 miles an hour What is our order Clark's Clark's very first? Okay Well, I'll be second because you were busy taking a pull your bourbon before you hopped in the car. So it takes so long Yeah, drink. Yeah. Yeah, you've savors it Swash it around Jim this was a $13 Dollar B-mate is that the good stuff for John Lee anymore? Appreciate every sit tin high What's out there but $13 $13, okay So the three of you are driving down this road in this car flies by you as anyone pulling off Are you gonna get on the radio and say who's gonna take care of that? Yeah, I'll get that. Okay I want to see a dead body Go get him kid, so Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop Continue on to the junkyard and John Lee Pettymore Turns his car around and I immediately if the lights weren't on I assume that they are on now and you're in chase mode So go ahead and roll me a drive check Thomas to see if John Lee Pettymore can catch up and successfully pull over this car All right, John Lee Pettymore. What's your drive in his younger? He's got a pretty good drive 70 Oh nice, he used to drive World of Outlaw sprint cars. Hell yes plays a lot of Forza Oh 20 nice nice. So you just flip it around and immediately are on the tail of this car. It looks pretty cool It does the car is slightly swerving and also still going probably 80 miles an hour But she is about to hit more into the town and less of a country road You're gonna go ahead and want to pull her over as soon as possible. I do that nice So go ahead and roll luck for me. Yeah, what did I put those dice with? Let's keep those dice at least those percent. We're playing percentage dies. Oh Not only okay 55 on a 50. So this is a great way to describe how this game works So he had a 70% and drive drive being the skill and he rolled a 20 which is a success So you want to roll underneath your score if he rolled a 22 with the tens dice matching That would be a critical success And then if you roll above your skill, which just happened which just happened It's a failure because your luck is 50, right? Yep, and he rolled a 55 which the dice match and it's above Which means it is a real fail the car in front of you loses control and immediately Crashes into a telephone pole Smashes at 80 miles an hour into it. Oh fuck and you with that drive Can pull over however you want to so are you going alongside in front of behind like how are you pulling up on this? Her car just smashed into a telephone smashed into a telephone pole I pull off right in front of it and I run and make sure she's all right, but the driver is all right Whoo-hoo-hoo as you get there you see that the windshield is Completely smashed open and there's no one sitting in the driver's seat. Fuck. All right. Okay, I get out my flashlight Oh, I don't have to I don't have to have an accent when I'm describing my Pull out my flashlight I get out my flashlight. Yeah, I immediately start searching the area I'm looking for you know, it's it's very clear. She is like was she thrown She was thrown clear of the vehicle and she is alive You can actually hear her like screaming and moaning about 20 yards away Woof. Yeah. Yikes I'm glad I had some bourbon. It honestly sounds like an animal dying I call the county hospital immediately to get an ambulance out here. You can already hear the ambulance. I rush to These guys are good. They're very good at their job. I rush over to her and see what I can do Okay, roll medical check of some sort gonna have to be I've got no medicine skills and I have 10% first aid. Yeah That's a fail on the first day. Oh, yeah, she looks great No, I don't see anything wrong here. Why are you crying? Ma'am stop resisting Her Face is split wide open And she's bleeding profusely and you have absolutely no idea how to stop bleeding of the face sure as hell Don't cutting to the two of you who went out to the junkyard You guys pull up and the headlights are shining through an old rusty chain link fence and through the end of the fence You see at the end of the lights reach of your headlights The ground is splattered with blood and a lifeless body is crumpled on the moist dirt about 20 yards past the fence inside this junkyard is The gate locked to the gate is locked. Is there barbed wire? There is barbed wire Oh, I was gonna climb over but I got better since than that plus my big bridges if I get caught on the bar Bet you guys have some cutters Yeah, well, hey, shut up Thomas. You're not there. Can we can we get a hold of who owns this place? The Pistons this is the piston junkyard and the NBA team. Yep, the Detroit pistons. Hey Clark Junkyard and content. What's big boss pistons name? So you would know it's two brothers who run the piston family Leo and George and they are the piston brothers I think that Clark Bishop would know these two from back in the day Clark You got Leo or George's phone number, uh, you can probably get a hold of Leo sure do Okay, give him a call come have him unlock this I don't have to cut through if we don't need to but let him know it's a serious situation Yeah, I'll give him a call the phone rings like six times before there's a click and then you just hear this Leo hey Leo. Hey. Hey. Hey, it's it's Clark Clark. Hey We've got a situation up here at your yard Clark who? Bishop with the contingent PD, you know me Leo We've got kind of a thing going on up here at your yard We need to we need you to come down here and let us in in the pig farm. No your junkyard. Oh Okay. Well, uh I'm busy I'm bit Leah, you know, I wouldn't call you if it wasn't important. There's there's something there's uh, there's something real bad might happen Okay, I'll get my keys and I'll be down in a second. All right. Thanks, man. Okay So a old truck pulls up It's like a beat-to-death old truck probably from like the 50s and it seems like it was taken care of for a long time But hasn't been taken care of recently Rust is starting to grow on it He pulls up and a large man in overalls covered in pig shit gets out You know kind of waddling I guess is the right word towards you guys and he's got this big circle ring of Keys that he's already like in the darkness trying to thumb through trying to find the right one Clark I was busy, but you know, you're you I like to keep you guys I'll be down here any time that you need. I'm just like to be a good citizen We know Leo we know we we're not making fun of this guy's mental health are we no Definitely. This is what he sounds like This is a character voice that I have chosen for this man and just because he's not that smart and has a thick accent doesn't mean that he's not a fully fleshed out Character and a human being we love and we love and respect Hey Leo, do you? Leo when's the last time you were? Cut it at Thomas's mic when he's not in the room and Leo when's the last time you were here I had to come by to sweep up Two weeks ago, you haven't been here for two weeks.

Well if you can go ahead and open up this gate, I I don't know if you can't I don't know if you've noticed this but if you take a peek over there, I think you can see why it's such a serious situation Oh Is that it? Yeah Well, I didn't this wasn't me like I didn't I don't know you are the prime suspect right now He's so scared like looking in his eyes he is the scariest boy I Slap him on the shoulder.

He's trying to fumble with him and he's like, okay It's this one and he goes over and he unlocks the gate. Can I go home now? Yeah, okay Did he leave the could you leave that key here for us and we can get back to you tomorrow? Yeah He's very he's very quick with his fingers and he gets the key off the ring immediately and hands it to you and it's like Okay, I'm gonna go home now.

Okay, so We know one thing I'm gonna interrogate the body roll human with your vast Intelligence that Keith vignette my 50 intelligence you can tell this this body seemed to hit there's blood splattered in a circular Range around this body in every direction So it looks like this body was thrown here or dropped here Is there any footprints or anything around or does it look like it just became here it? Looking around though. The ground is wet a little bit. It's like the ground is the ground is moist and There there are no footprints in the area except for your own So it is it is since it's like damp or whatever it would I would be able to notice footprints if they yeah I think so. Okay, I return with the lights on the camera and I go ahead and set up some good floodlights on the area Yeah, and start just taking. Yeah, let's take some pictures before we move this body for Posterity isn't in front of the front door of their office. It's just in front It's like probably 10 yards away from the building and it's not centered on anything in particular It's just like there do I looking at the building? Do they have any security cameras set up? No Snap some pics and then I'm gonna is this face down or face up face down. I'm gonna roll him over That's him. Is it a can I tell or I'm gonna roll the body when you roll the body over cannot see its face But it does seem to be the body of a woman. Why can I not see its face? Well, okay, you can see her face, but the face is smashed completely Beyond recognition beyond all Recognition this is not a great night for faces. Oh, you know a lot of faces getting messed up in contention Can I can I see if there does she have teeth or finger fingers? It looks like she did probably have teeth at one point but not anymore. Nah, all right Would it would we be able to identify like fingerprints? It's like a black bloody mess and yes, there are fingers Okay, I go and get out my little 10 in case your 10 fingers in case you were wondering nice Look at these fingers, dude. These are great We can well, I don't know how many she started out with I hope she has committed a crime at some point. That way we can identify her in our database I do the I just take a my ink pad and grab a few. Yeah fingerprint fingerprints got him I'm right so other other than her face, which is smashed. Is there any other visible injuries? Smashing mostly it looks like she took smashing damage from the from all over or just the face I would say it looks like from where she hit the ground is where like all of Hit the ground I look at is there anything directly above us when you look up The sky is above you and that seems to be it. Wow, that's amazing. The sky is up there I want to go through the pockets when you go through the pockets There is a small piece of paper that is folded a handful of times and this piece of paper is a thick piece of white Parchment on it is written in this weird black thick ink and it says We is striking when the land gets darkness readying torches hesitate not You're looking at this body and it is wearing what seems to be really thick hand stitched clothing and leather boots and Besides that note in the pocket. That seems to be all you can really garner from it Is there style to the note? Is it written like a poem and does it have funky punctuation? It has punctuation it is we is striking when the land gets darkness period readying torches period hesitate not period Okay, but no it's not in stanza form. Yeah, it's not formatted in a weird way It's just written as it could fit on this piece of paper So that was folded up a couple times and put stuffed into her pocket So you're taking pictures that was the only thing in the pocket. That is the only thing in the pockets How big are the britches fitting nice? I I hike my big old britches up. I'm like man. Those are some nice pants I want to take a strand or two of hair and put it in an evidence bag. Absolutely cutting back to John Lee Pettymore is at the scene and the ambulances arrived. They are going to ask you what happened Well, I was in pursuit of this intoxicated young woman and she fucking smashed her car in that goddamn telephone and ripped her face open I've not seen that's anything like that in a while. Obviously, you know sprint car race and you see your fair share of smashed faces Okay, so they're done like as soon as they get that information. They're like, okay Well, we need to get her to the hospital. And so they start Yeah, the thing about racecar driving So they get out nerves a steal they get her on to a gurney of sorts and it's not a gurney barrel and Bamboo wood and cheesecloth and they get her in the back of this ambulance and falls right through the cheese She gets up and starts running. Yeah, so immediately draw my side Zombie So they take her they take her away and you can probably call Ray and have him take care of the cleanup crew and everything But what do you what do you do? I'm going to go get my car bourbon Oh, yeah, take a swig out of that to steady my nerves and then I'm gonna check her car out I'm gonna do a search probable cause out the ass Yeah, so yeah You're good to check the car when you're going through it in the back seat of the car is a it's a Polaroid Camera and it seems to be from early early Polaroid camera making days. You've never seen a camera like this It's got the normal like chunkiness to it But it's got some like weird glass tubes that go around it and on it is a light that is red and it has a viewfinder and a button to take pictures and Then a spot for the paper to go in and a spot for the paper to come out and then all these glass tubes Probably two or three that like loop around from like one into the other and stuff there any Polaroid sitting around other also Yeah, I forgot to mention there is a Polaroid sitting in the seat of the car In the shotgun seat. It is a Polaroid. It shows the base of a tall building and a group Crowding the entrance with fists raised Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black The entire picture is not fully like colorized It almost seems black and white but the the light from the torches is giving off some sort of like a yellowy Orangish tint would you say maybe perhaps a sepia? Yeah, almost a sepia tone on this picture Does that strike you as odd that strikes John is very odd and he goes and takes another fortify and swig off his bourbon Go ahead and roll a sanity check for me Hard fail, okay So you're gonna lose one sanity and you're gonna need to take that pull instead of just wanting to Off of the old whiskey. So yeah, this is really weird. Like you've never seen anything like this You've probably not messed with Polaroids too much in your life, but you definitely know that if It shouldn't look like this. Yeah, are there any blank? There's paper in the in the camera, okay I want to try to take a picture you click on the button and nothing happens you do notice that on this camera where the red light is coming from there is also a Unlit green light next to it. So the red light is illuminated. Yes. Gotcha Okay, do I see and like an attachment or anything? That's supposed to go into this or a place for that to go somewhere that might activate that green light No, okay does not look like it. Can I just push it push what the green light? It's not a button looks like this is not a button There are two lights side by side one has a red cover Basically one is colored red and the other one is colored green and the red light is shining The green light is not just want to move the camera around and point it at different things and see if that changes What light okay, John Lee Pettymore is standing on the side of the road as a light mist comes down in the darkness He's all alone and he is standing with a camera that is odd in his hands Aiming it at different things and looking at nothing in particular Wow, nothing happened, but it sounded horrifying Yeah, nothing changes, okay as you go through the rest of the car you get to the trunk and in the trunk are multiple gas cans and A bunch of lighters and matches classic firebug. Yes Oh and also inside the car I make a note of that inside the car was a bottle of Brandy bottle of cheap brandy about half gone. Do you take a swig? Not my brand my brand so cutting back to the two of you in the junkyard is special liver Where did we leave you guys? I guess we found that note and I got the fingerprints and a piece of her hair that I'm planning on running. What's the coroner's name here? This is the county Yeah, you can just call the county. Okay, let's give them a call. See if they can figure out I mean, I think I know what killed this person, but let's see what that what their professional opinion is What's your theory their faces smashed them to death? How do you think that happened? That's what that's what I want to find out doesn't sound like you have a theory then or know how this person got killed Oh, I know that they got killed because their faces smashed That's that's what I got cause of death being a face smash cause of death smashed face Yeah, I mean that'll do it for sure. Yeah, I certainly wouldn't want my face smash like this Yeah, I'm done with that. They call it call the corner in I'm gonna do a little search around like it And maybe like a 50-foot radius around this body and see if I can find anything of interest. Okay, cool I want to go into the office. That's right there. Okay, sounds good. First off you give me a search role I Do not pass you do not find anything and Joe Clark Bishop is walking up to the Building the front door of this building and it is unlocked. I go in it is a small room There's only one room There's a desk that is like literally covered in papers and garbage and a bunch of shit just everywhere There's a couple chairs in there that are also covered with shit and there's a bunch of filing cabinets This place is deeply disorganized and no one has been in here in a while I'm just looking to are there any Surveillance anythings any TVs that look like they were at least once surveillance. There is one camera It is in the corner of the room. Can I follow its cord to see where it goes? Yeah, and you would also see that it does point at the front door, which looks out the window Cool, but I mean I want to see where it's Oh where it's hooked up. Yeah. Yeah So I underneath the desk is like the CCTV I turn on the TV. Mm-hmm. Do I get a picture? Yes, is there a VCR anywhere nearby? Oh, yeah, it is connected. It's one of those TV VCR combos So this is Joe doesn't know this would a Police officer to look at the tape in that VCR. Would he take it back to the shop? You can do whatever you want. I guess I'll do I'll just leave it there. Whatever you like I'll look at it there. Okay, I rewind go ahead and roll luck to see if it was recording Baby it was not recording. Yeah, that would have really helped I pop in from my search and I say hey have you found where that camera leads to? Maybe I can do a roll and see if it was Talks about life in a really weird way No, that's how that's how life works cool So you guys at this point could you could have ray come out and watch this scene for the night? Also, I want to give the chief a ring. Okay. Yeah, you you phone the Chiefs. Do you call her? I guess her cell phone. Yeah, it goes straight to voicemail. No ring. I want to leave a voicemail. Hey Maggie, it's It's vigna wake up Maggie, I think I have something to say to you Yeah Right after you left we got a call. There's a dead body out at the junkyard I'd like to have your input on this. Give me a call back. Bye. I think that was good. Love you did great Thanks Keith did you just call the chief Maggie? Yeah, I did I mean it was a day so we were all saying I know I know this is I know work I know I'm new here. But uh, I don't know I like to have a friendly office space Clark friendly office space What do you call her chief if we're working well, she's not we're not at work She left We called her on her personal cell phone. Yeah, I'll keep a note of that. You just might want to keep that in mind Yeah, I'm gonna call her back Hey Keith, it goes straight to voicemail. Okay. Hey, man, I mean, hey chief Sorry about that last voicemail. Everything I said was true, but I want to We'll call you chief Okay Bye All right, that's good Okay, so we haven't seen John in a minute Let's I'm gonna radio him and see what is what's going on over there What did that note that you found say again? We is striking when the land? Sets darkness when the land sets darkness gets darkness Readings torches hesitate not okay. I want to radio John. Hey What what happened with that car you is that taken care of her? Oh, man Her face is all smashed to hell. Wait, this face is smashed to hell too. I think it's what it could be Well, how did her face get smashed? Poor driving was she drunk or what was it? Are you drunk? I never know these days vigna You should have seen this face. This is got me pretty shook. Well, do you need what are you doing right now? Do you need help? I'm just trying to make this camera work Okay, let's I'm gonna let's go see what he's up to So the three of you go back to the office the police department after Ray is gonna take care of cleaning up the car on the side of the road. That's been smashed He's gonna call a tow truck and let everybody know what needs to be taken care of there Well, it's about time he did something. Yeah, he's also gonna Go out to the junkyard and keep watch over the crime scene for the night, which you put up crime tape and all that Jazz, I wanted to express to Ray that we do want the coroner to like autopsy won't be one Of course yeah, and so I you'll get that report back in the morning and the three of you meet back up at the police department You're probably all out in the parking lot now is about when you would either I don't know Do you guys to have personal cars or do you take your your cruisers back to your homes Clark definitely takes his cruiser back? Yeah, I do. Yeah, so the three of you are all in your cruisers and you pull back into the police department's parking lot I walk in and talk to drew the Secretary hey, hey drew. Hey, you see the chief tonight. No, she hasn't come back in since she left abruptly She she call her anything. She did not call. Hmm. He like looks through his messages. She did not call All right Will you give her a ring and if you if you get a hold of her you gotta tell her we got some stuff going on here absolutely and then Clark goes to his desk and He starts doing whatever he can in the office with the fingerprints and so you can basically send that stuff in okay to County and Get results back later. I'm doing that Clark you you like to take those crime scene photos and things Mm-hmm. Can you have you ever seen a camera this queer? I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before it looks kind of old with the glass tubing like that I know they used to use that some of them old radio. Yeah, but this this ain't a radio Clark. Yeah This is a weird one this picture mean anything to you I look at the picture you look at the picture I want to look at the picture. The picture is a Polaroid of a base of a tall building There's a group of people crowding the entrance their fists are raised Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black But the only coloring that you see is from the torches and it's like an orange ish yellowish hue Everything else is black and white roll sanity Pass I pass. Okay, you both don't see anything out of the ordinary with from this picture Do I recognize the building by any chance a place? All right, where'd you get this picture and honestly you wouldn't be able to recognize the pic the base of the building anyways, because it's literally just like Like an out an exterior wall, what was the driver's name? I assume we looked at her wallet and stuff Yeah, yeah for sure. Her name is Julie Maxwell. She lives in town. I got this I got this from Julie Maxwell's car. Wait, does that the car you pulled over? Yeah, Julie was the one that called in about the body. Yeah, she's not gonna be doing many calls with that face anymore Is she do we know her? Is she at the hospital right now? She is she stable or she are we gonna be able to talk to her? You don't know I can call up there Okay. Yeah, let's find out also that note said something about torches. I read the note out loud. That's ominous Well, I chant the note This has got to be connected if Julie called in the body. She's got a picture of her Is she in the picture we found a note mentioning mentoring torches we found a picture of Torches one woman's face was smashed another woman's face was split entwined. What was Julie wearing? Did you see the body her not alive? Have you seen her by a live body? What was her are you asking me? Looking like What was her clothing looking like let me stop to recollect picture a single Middle-aged woman who is stuck in the 80s Now you remember your old friend Stacy and her mom. Mm-hmm. Wait. No Stacy's mom has got it going on Who's the one who still thinks it's 1985? She reminded me a lot of your friend's mom who still thinks it's 1985. Oh, yeah, Carol Yeah, she's got Carol hair Carol hair Carol clothes. All right, cuz our body it looked like homemade stuff. I kind of wondered if they were together It's got to be connected. Sure But maybe our Julie's a suspect here. It's getting pretty late at this point You guys might want to call it for the night and can I can I go ahead and call the hospital though? Just to see for sure. She's unconscious. Okay, she's but still alive. Yeah, like not gonna die. Hey, let me roll Oh god Oh, yeah, no, she's dead Julie Maxwell's She's a cop to severe blood loss. She's dead. She's just rolled a hundred She's dead. Hey, remember when you said let me roll. It would have been tight if you Know Julie Maxwell's dead. There was probably there was probably nothing more to gather from that thread. So yeah, I Think we can call this one case closed drive safely folks I'm gonna go home. All right, take it all Sleeper and think about what I've seen today This was my first dead body and I'm kind of creeped but also a little bit stoked. Oh, yeah Hey, go ahead and roll me a sanity for seeing that dead body. I forgot to have you roll that I got an 87 that should be good right? No, I don't think so. What's your sanity 50? yeah, so you're gonna want to head and lose one and Just a quick note for you guys. We're gonna run this as a sanity We'll run as like a humanity tracker to see how much you care about Humanity everything that you see that makes you doubt the like goodness and humanity will make you lose Sanity also anything that makes you think that maybe humanity isn't all that's here will make you lose sanity So that's how we'll be tracking it. I feel a little less like I give a shit about people. Yeah, I think so Hey Keith, who do you know in town? Like who are your friends? Who's your family? Do you have anyone? I've got well my parents. I grew up go ahead and eat that mic. Go ahead and get up on so Don't eat mine Yeah, I grew up here, but my parents both passed away. I don't really have Any like close family?
