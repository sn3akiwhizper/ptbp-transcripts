1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What's everybody do?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,000
Keep going. Oh boy. My name is Zach and this is pretending to be people

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,900
We are a role-playing podcast and we are playing the game Delta green, but it's not really Delta green

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:21,260
It's an amalgamation that we have come up with that is a mixture of the role-playing systems Delta green and pulp

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,600
Cthulhu with all that nerdy shit out of the way for the rest of you listening

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,920
This is a collaborative storytelling experience that you will be listening to over the coming weeks

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,760
I am here with Joe. Hey, I'm Joe Luke. I'm Luke and Thomas

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,240
I'm Thomas having heard many stories from other DMS GM's out there. I

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,520
consider myself to be

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,680
Extremely lucky with the group that I have been blessed with as a player same same same

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,160
We have been playing together for three years now. This is our third campaign

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,920
We ran two ten-month-long Delta green campaigns where we played weekly and we've kept the exact same group ever since I

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,760
Am fully in love with this game Thomas. What's your experience with role-playing?

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,680
I started with D&D like a lot of people and

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,880
Wanted something a little more story based and less mechanics driven

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,120
I didn't like sitting around for 30 minutes while the wizard took his turn. So Delta green was perfect for that

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:26,200
It's all about character interaction and like solving this mystery together and combats are very like combat is very simple quick and rare and rare

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,120
Yeah, and violently, you know, you're shooting guns at each other. It ends it gets over with quickly

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,760
Like you said we've been playing together for the past few years. That's been the highlight of my week that whole time

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm Luke my role-playing experience in high school. I played Dungeons Dragons twice the group that I played with

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,080
Didn't take it very seriously and our DM took it very seriously

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,480
So we were not invited back to play

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,760
and then after that the next time I played was Delta green with Zach and Thomas and a couple other people and yeah, I

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,080
Loved it. I've pretty much constantly been playing it since I

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,920
Started playing with this group Thomas actually texted me kind of out of the blue one day about wanting to do

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,200
D&D game with some mutual friends of ours and I I think unbeknownst to him

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,640
I had already been kind of wanting that I had been listening to podcasts and watching shows on Twitch and things like that

28
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,480
So we did it

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,880
It was it was awesome to have that all of a sudden pop up that group didn't last for very long

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,480
But pretty quickly after that dissolved Thomas again asked if I wanted to join you guys and I said fuck

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,520
Yeah, and you guys seem to like me so I stuck around we were big fans. You brought an element of

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
seriousness to our table

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,040
Much needed that had not existed there before I remember the

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,760
Very first time that you role-played with us you were playing Taylor my wife's partner

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,160
Yeah, you gave me a couple options for characters and I picked the FBI agent. Yeah, I'd seen X-Files

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,180
And then we had one of our best sessions to date right then and there it was amazing

37
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,960
I don't he brought the energy for sure. I'd never met Joe before I played with him now. I see him every week

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,640
Hey, baby

39
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,640
I hope that you guys become our best friends the way that I have become best friends with my role-playing group

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,440
As we wiggle our way into your ear holes each week, please also invite us into your hearts and to your parties

41
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,920
Yeah, invite us to your parties by a spear. We really like drinking drinking

42
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,600
Marijuana. Yep, if you're offering are you offering are you offering? Hey internet listener?

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,920
Are you holding PO box? I think it's worth mentioning that Zach created all of this stuff. We don't know anything that's happening

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,620
We try to not talk about it too much outside of the game

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,620
We really want to be surprised by each other and by Zach

46
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,560
Yeah, and actually one of my favorite things about this group is as we've come to play together for longer periods of time

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,880
We've kind of talked and you guys have given me full reign to fuck over your characters

48
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,000
Which is a very fun thing to give your DM the right to do and I try to take full advantage of that

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,640
There are a couple parts per episode where I will have written the description of a character or the description of a place

50
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,600
But outside of that everything is improv. It is also a closed game. Oh, that's a really good point Luke

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,160
So we play a closed game

52
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,600
so anytime one of these characters goes off on their own the player also sits in the room with

53
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,120
Just me and we go through what happens that way the players can keep secrets from each other

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,280
It's like secrets and lies the name of the game that continues outside the podcast, too

55
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,080
We try not to talk to each other about what's going on in the game too much

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,800
It's

57
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,520
Kind of scary. It's kind of violent. Oh, yeah, this is a horror mystery. Yeah, this is a horror mystery graphic content warning

58
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,100
You may see there is an explicit tag on all of our episodes

59
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,260
This isn't just because we use the fuck word

60
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:58,120
It's also because a lot of the descriptions within the story are going to be gruesome and brutal with

61
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,760
Hopefully a lot of comedy and come for the heart stay for the gore come on the heart stick it to the door

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,760
Come on the door come on the heart to in the stink it gets a lot worse than just shooting people

63
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:16,040
Yeah, it can be pretty icky icky, but don't worry. We bring enough warmth and humanity and humor and humor hopefully humor

64
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,080
We hope you think it's funny

65
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,460
So we got together and we created a small town together that this story would take place in

66
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,440
Contention contention is the name of this fictional town in this fictional universe that is based

67
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,180
Loosely on our own world people could easily relate this to x-files or

68
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,600
Season 1 of true detective pretty much anything that has a creepy supernatural

69
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,080
Ambiance to it, but we're also going to try like to keep it funny

70
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,920
Like that case in point with awesome Twilight jokes just fucking constantly we're on the bleeding edge of cultural relevance

71
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
We recorded this in

72
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
2011

73
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,680
Basically what we've done is we've set up a

74
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,720
Story in which these three guys are playing police officers of this small town of contention

75
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,080
We did this for a couple reasons

76
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,760
It's an easy way to get them involved in a mystery within their small town and have the power and the free time

77
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,200
To look into said mystery very excited to have our friend Justin involved in this podcast

78
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,840
He will be the first voice that you hear as Justin is playing wolf the dog the a.m

79
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,200
radio DJ in the town of contention who will be our narrator and

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:44,240
Introduce each episode. He is also responsible for creating the original music that you will hear backing this

81
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,080
Podcast Justin did all of our music except for the intro except for the intro which was done by kudzu a band from our

82
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,880
Hometown of Springfield, Missouri kudzu. You look them up on bandcamp. Thank you kudzu. Thank you kudzu

83
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,740
We also record it in the nude. You should know that

84
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,880
Hot room hot room sweaty. That's why we take our covered in molasses for sustenance

85
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,260
But we have a very very specific rule. You're not allowed to eat your own molasses. No only only your friends molasses

86
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:22,460
Yeah, we eat molasses. So thanks everyone for downloading and listening to our first episode of pretending to be people

87
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,500
We hope that you continue to listen now

88
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:31,660
Let's get that a.m. Dial in position to six nine four point two and hand it over to wolf the dog

89
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:39,860

90
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,620

91
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,780
Radio station some of you surrounding listeners might not know contention like we all do here

92
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,420
But it's a small quiet town about an hour west of the city

93
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,380
Now the date on this here calendar says it's December 1st. And let me tell you it's a warm one out there

94
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,180
Dogs are barking going crazy and I've been seeing a lot of homeless folks lately

95
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,260
But you know be kind to those throw a little change the way for your buddy wolf the dog

96
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,660
And I want all you listeners out there to wish police chief Maggie cook a very very happy

97
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,760

98

You heard it here first folks Jim Belushi not a good actor yeah hot takes so let's go ahead and talk

101
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:23,380
Characters before we begin here Joe you are playing I'm playing Clark Bishop

102
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,540
He's a 17 year vet

103
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,180
It hasn't risen up the ranks kind of cuz there's not a whole lot of rank upping to go

104
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,260
But he's a little bit sad about the fact that he's still where he is in life

105
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,980
But he also takes a lot of pride in his job and he's okay at it Luke what character you playing

106
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm playing Keith Vigna. I am a 29 year old police officer. I

107
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,960
grew up in contention and then I had a big aspirations moved to the city where I

108
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,740
Became a police officer was not that great at it and they kind of transferred me back to the town

109
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,300
Just to get rid of me bad cop. I'm not a bad cop. I'm just a

110
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,180
bad cop

111
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,660
So, yeah, I'm bad I'm bad at copping but I'm a I'm not a bad guy you're also kind of freshy too

117
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,140

118
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,980
That's just gives it shows you how huge these pants

119
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,980

Can you not afford nicer pants wouldn't I mean if you're big for your britches wouldn't your pants be very small. I

122
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,420
Think yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm too small. Hey

123
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500

124
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Hey, man, you should get some self-esteem

125
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,620
You really need to not be so down on yourself fucking fill out your britches, you know, Keith

126
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,040
I'm Keith fucking vigna and I can wear whatever size pants. I want Wow see and that's true confidence

127
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,500
Oh, man, somebody needs to tell Keith those pants stuff

128
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Is he wearing two belts?

129
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,580
two belts three pairs of suspenders and

130
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
They're super glued to my body

131
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,520
Thomas what character are you playing and what kind of pants does he wear?

132
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,420
I'm playing John Lee Pettymore. He is from contention. He's a local boy. He wears pants that are a little too tight. Okay

133
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,860
Probably how tight is a little too tight just enough noticeable. Mm-hmm bummer. Yeah

134
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,660
Not for the ladies of contention. Hey, oh some of his extended relatives are kind of nerdy Wells

135
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,180
He might not always see the rules as unbendable

136
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,300
He knows how they do things in contention more importantly in the haulers outside of contention

137
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,700
What do you guys what are you guys wanting to do with this thing? Have fun. You want to have some fun?

138
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,980
I want to have some fun has a phone. I don't want to get a little spooked. I want to get a little spooky

139
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,020
Yeah, I think hopefully it's gonna get spooky. I'm only interested in total iTunes chart domination. I

140
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,460
Want to be so spooked that my huge britches are plenty wet

141
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,820
Some big ol wet britches, I want to fill my coaches you got so much extra fabric

142
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
I can have a big ol load

143
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,260
Take a big old dump in my pants if I need to and nobody will know nobody I think of don't know

144
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,060
Oh, well, everybody will know but nobody will tell me pass an alertness check

145
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,620
These britches are ready to go. I'm ready to just jump on ready to jump on in. All right

146
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,700
Well, our story does begin on an unseasonably warm December 1st in a small town called contention

147
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,160
Thin mist can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road

148
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,200
the inside of the contention police department

149
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:18,160
However is cozy warm and bright a smiling man sits behind a large secretary desk littered with papers and snack wrappers

150
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,860
He has a round baby face and small teeth and he is wearing a sweater vest over a shirt and tie

151
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,680
This man's phone rings this guy by the way, he's the secretary in the office. He's like the office or his gums big or

152
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:38,240
Small that was an interesting detail. He's got small teeth, but he's got gums that stick out

153
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:44,020
I kind of picture him as like like small teeth, but very very healthy gums. Oh, those are some real

154
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:52,520
You can absolutely see a half to three-quarters of an inch of gum in between teeth on top lip

155
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:58,860
Yes, it's almost as if his top lip is receding. It's to come into the gum. It's a common occurrence exactly

156
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,140
Yeah, he's wearing a sweater vest over a shirt and tie and his phone rings

157
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,400
Which happens often in the office? We cannot be vaping on mic all the time

158
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,840
We're gonna sound like assholes. Yes. I was trying to get out of the range, but you weren't gonna work

159
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Yeah, sorry. Tell me if this works. I

160
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,280
Can't tell how much of that it was ambient now, I don't think it was in the headphones

161
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,560
This will be an edited podcast but not so tightly edited

162
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
the juice

163
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,120
Refrain from just going overboard quick technical question. Yeah, do you have each of our mics on a different channel?

164
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
I do have all your mics

165
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Absolutely

166
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
Every time I vape I'm just gonna do this and then I turn my mic off

167
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,800
He's in the middle of a sudden not only can I but I will do that

168

His phone rings and he picks it up before the first ring is finished drew Andrews

190
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:51,300
This is definitely an emergency this time the dogs over in the old neighborhood have been howling for over an hour straight

191
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,920
Do we need to send out multiple of you or just do you think everything's gonna just send ray? Oh, okay

192
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,380

193
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,780
and drew Andrews this man with the gums and the

194
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,460
Small teeth comes out from the back room and he's got a little cupcake

195
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:18,420
and it's got one candle in it and the candles lit and he goes over and knocks on the door of the chief of police of

196
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,940
contention chief

197
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:28,820
Chief we got his fries for you. She comes on out. It's a small little birthday celebration for the chief Maggie cook

198
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,300
She's a strong fit woman with a dark bob and intense eyes

199
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,380
Always in uniform this woman you've never seen her not wearing her uniform

200
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,040
He pulls out this little gift that's wrapped and she opens it and it is a new journal

201
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,300
And you guys would know that she always has a blue journal with her like a notebook everywhere

202
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,740
She goes and it's the specific brand that she likes. And so this one is yellow

203
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,980
Oh, so now you have one of each color, isn't that it's neat. Thank you so much drew

204
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,020
I really appreciate you doing that for me

205
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,820
This is really this is really sweet kind of looks around the office at you guys Clark goes ahead and gets in his desk

206
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:13,580
Kind of rummages for a second. He pulls out a little box of chocolates with a bow on it. Happy birthday, Maggie

207
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,700
I should have seen this coming Clark. Yep. I know you like them. So I thought I'd do it do it again this year

208
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:26,380
They're my favorite and she she opens the box immediately and pops one in her mouth. Mmm. Happy birthday to me

209
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,620
Can I can I have one? Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course Clark. I grab one without asking I

210
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,500
Go into my desk and I pull out like two-thirds of a bottle of cheap bourbon. Hey, here you go Maggie

211
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,960
Happy birthday chief. She looks at it and she's kind of like oh, yeah

212
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,400
This will go. No, it's not your brand. This will go nicely

213
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,840
With the the three-quarters of a bottle that I have sitting on my bar cart from last year

214
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,120
Yeah, well, you know, happy birthday, thank you very much John

215
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,500
I appreciate that and then you all kind of look over at Keith who and I'm I'm

216
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,200
Sweating because I had no idea that it was her birthday

217
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,640
This is my I've been here for like like a couple months maybe when you are sweating

218
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,640
She looks and there is a box that's sitting in the room. That's this white box with a black bow on it Oh Keith

219
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,920
You wrap this present beautifully I thank you so much I had no idea that you would have even known it was my birthday

220
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,520
Yeah, I I don't pride myself on giving the best gifts, but I do pride myself on

221
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:38,560
Wrapping wrapping the best. She grabs it and she starts opening the bow and she opens the top of it. Oh, oh

222
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,820
Oh my god, and she immediately walks back into her office and closes the door behind her

223
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,980
What what did you get her Keith I didn't that was not mine I didn't even know it was her birthday you fucked up who

224
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,380
Was that one of your guys's boxes or drew was that yours?

225
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,300
I go look go over to the bat box and see if there's a tag or anything

226
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,300
So she took the box in with her into the drew the office drew. Did you do you know where that box came from?

227
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,620
No, I didn't see anything come in. That's really strange. It just it was just here

228
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,940
I guess and it was probably right it might have been right and right about at that moment

229
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:21,060
The chief comes walking out of her office and she is completely broken down

230
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:28,100
Tears have clearly been streaming down her face. Her face is red. You've never seen her in this emotional state before Keith

231
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,860
What the hell did you get her was not mine. She

232
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,740
Immediately walks from her door out of the office

233
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,060
Chief

234
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,940
Doesn't even pay attention takes off and it's gone. Did she have the box in her hands? No, I

235
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,740
Feel really bad. I'm gonna go into her office and see what was in that box. Yeah, you messed up this gift, buddy

236
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,020
So when you walk into her office, it's neat. It's like a super

237
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,540
office

238
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,460
What a cool place. This is great. She keeps saying I want to be

239
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,820
Very organized and you look inside this white box and there's no like wrapping or anything

240
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,660
Inside of it. There's no paper or anything. I need a tag or anything on it. There's no tag on it

241
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,540
There's just three items inside the box. It is a flower. It's a rose. It's a single rose

242
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:25,000
There's a hard hat just like a straight-up normal white hard hat and a black silk bowtie. I want to plop that

243
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,220
Hard hat on my head see if it fits it fits cool. I'm gonna put it back on the box

244
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,340
Role-playing

245
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,780
I'm gonna I'll go back out into the main room and tell them what I saw I come back out

246
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,180
I I had the box in my hand

247
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,180
I'm like does any of this mean anything to you and I asked the DM does any of that mean anything to me?

248
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:52,700
I don't I don't think any of these things would particularly stick out to you as having any

249
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,460
Intrinsical meaning that's a weird collection of things there

250
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,300
The phone rings as you guys are talking and drew picks up in his same like nervous hurried voice again

251
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,620
He's just like drew a contention PD working at me and he's talking in the background as you guys are talking

252
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,060
I wonder what's up with those dogs. I go into the

253
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:18,220
Her office and look in the box and I pick up the tie and I want to see if there's any like is it monogrammed

254
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,880
In any way, is there anything on the tag any any sign of any no ownership? Nope

255
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,620
Okay, just a very plain black silk bowtie. It's untied drew is on the phone

256
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,000
He hangs up and he looks at you guys and he's like

257
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,500
Um fellas

258
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,780
Somebody found a body out at the junkyard

259
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,540
I

260
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,660
Think this is an actual emergency you guys I

261
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,540
Don't I don't know they hung up immediately

262
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:59,020
she it was a woman's voice and she said that there was a body at the junkyard and that we needed to come out and

263
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,660
And look at it immediately and she was she's kind of slurring her words

264
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,340
Did you get her name? She just said Julie and then stopped immediately

265
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,180
Talking after that and just hung up

266
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:17,700
I don't know what happened, but there was like a I heard something kind of not break

267
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:24,780
But I heard something kind of there was a noise and then she like screamed a little bit after she said her name

268
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,700
And and then and then she hung up immediately and you said this out at the junkyard. Yeah

269
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,300
Go check it out. Okay, so you guys all have

270
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,500
Individual police cars that you can take. Yeah, I can ride together. I think we should all take our own cars

271
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Just in case I'm with you

272
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,580
I take a pull of my bourbon off the Chiefs desk before I go out. Yeah any complaints from the other two officers?

273
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
I don't think they see that

274
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,680
You do it sneaky. I don't know petty more well enough to reprimand him

275
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,340
So I just kind of turn a blind eye to that and okay

276
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,340
So the three you'd go ahead and grab that pull off the bottle before you head out and the three of you are going out

277
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,940
It's a dark night. I'd say it's pretty nice

278
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,860
It actually feels more like fall than it does winter at this point in December 1st

279
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,700
But there's like a light mist coming down. So I would say it's real dark out

280
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,220
You got the streetlights guiding your way the junkyard sits on the far

281
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,220
Southeast corner of town and it's where the old mine was

282
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,560
This is an old mining town back in the

283
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:31,520
1800s and the junkyard is out on top of where the the old mine was throwing junk down the shaft

284
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,900
That's I mean honestly just filling it up

285
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,420
Oh, yeah

286
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:36,820
Yeah

287
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:42,980
and so you guys are gonna drive from downtown out on a few country roads to get out there and

288
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
So supposed to be anyone

289
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
Throwing the junk down the shaft

290
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,120
That's actually their the motto of the junkyard. It says that on the sign

291
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,820
Shaft shaft rowers piston junkyard shaft throwers. We can do better

292
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,380
Let's return to that

293
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,340
So you guys are driving out there it's night as you're going out there

294
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,700
There is a car coming from the other direction that is flying going

295
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,660
Maybe double the speed limit. It's probably 45 out here and this car is going 80 90 miles an hour

296
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,300
What is our order Clark's Clark's very first? Okay

297
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:28,300
Well, I'll be second because you were busy taking a pull your bourbon before you hopped in the car. So it takes so long

298
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,100
Yeah, drink. Yeah. Yeah, you've savors it

299
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,180
Swash it around

300
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,580
Jim this was a $13

301
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Dollar

302
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,560
B-mate is that the good stuff for John Lee anymore? Appreciate every sit tin high

303
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,580
What's out there but $13 $13, okay

304
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:56,100
So the three of you are driving down this road in this car flies by you as anyone pulling off

305
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,140
Are you gonna get on the radio and say who's gonna take care of that? Yeah, I'll get that. Okay

306
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
I want to see a dead body

307
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,860
Go get him kid, so Keith Vigna and

308
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,540
Clark Bishop

309
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,020
Continue on to the junkyard and John Lee Pettymore

310
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:17,740
Turns his car around and I immediately if the lights weren't on I assume that they are on now and you're in chase mode

311
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,320
So go ahead and roll me a drive check

312
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,940
Thomas to see if John Lee Pettymore can catch up and successfully pull over this car

313
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,440
All right, John Lee Pettymore. What's your drive in his younger? He's got a pretty good drive 70

314
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,240
Oh nice, he used to drive World of Outlaw sprint cars. Hell yes plays a lot of Forza Oh

315
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:48,560
20 nice nice. So you just flip it around and immediately are on the tail of this car. It looks pretty cool

316
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,760
It does the car is slightly swerving and also still going probably 80 miles an hour

317
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,000
But she is about to hit more into the town and less of a country road

318
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,040
You're gonna go ahead and want to pull her over as soon as possible. I do that nice

319
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,520
So go ahead and roll luck for me. Yeah, what did I put those dice with?

320
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,640
Let's keep those dice at least those percent. We're playing percentage dies. Oh

321
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,040
Not only okay 55 on a 50. So this is a great way to describe how this game works

322
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:26,800
So he had a 70% and drive drive being the skill and he rolled a 20 which is a success

323
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,120
So you want to roll underneath your score if he rolled a 22 with the tens dice matching

324
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,160
That would be a critical success

325
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:40,540
And then if you roll above your skill, which just happened which just happened

326
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:47,280
It's a failure because your luck is 50, right? Yep, and he rolled a 55 which the dice match and it's above

327
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:53,000
Which means it is a real fail the car in front of you loses control and immediately

328
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,760
Crashes into a telephone pole

329
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,840
Smashes at 80 miles an hour into it. Oh fuck and you with that drive

330
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:10,520
Can pull over however you want to so are you going alongside in front of behind like how are you pulling up on this?

331
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,440
Her car just smashed into a telephone smashed into a telephone pole

332
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,500
I pull off right in front of it and I run and make sure she's all right, but the driver is all right

333
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,580
Whoo-hoo-hoo as you get there you see that the windshield is

334
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,320
Completely smashed open and there's no one sitting in the driver's seat. Fuck. All right. Okay, I get out my flashlight

335
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,020
Oh, I don't have to I don't have to have an accent when I'm describing my

336
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,340
Pull out my flashlight I get out my flashlight. Yeah, I immediately start searching the area

337
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,740
I'm looking for you know, it's it's very clear. She is like was she thrown

338
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,820
She was thrown clear of the vehicle and she is alive

339
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,180
You can actually hear her like screaming and moaning about 20 yards away

340
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Woof. Yeah. Yikes

341
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,420
I'm glad I had some bourbon. It honestly sounds like an animal dying

342
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:10,900
I call the county hospital immediately to get an ambulance out here. You can already hear the ambulance. I rush to

343
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,880
These guys are good. They're very good at their job. I rush over to her and see what I can do

344
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,300
Okay, roll medical check of some sort gonna have to be

345
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,720
I've got no medicine skills and I have 10% first aid. Yeah

346
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,100
That's a fail on the first day. Oh, yeah, she looks great

347
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,860
No, I don't see anything wrong here. Why are you crying?

348
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,180
Ma'am stop resisting

349
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,180
Her

350
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Face is split wide open

351
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:55,940
And she's bleeding profusely and you have absolutely no idea how to stop bleeding of the face sure as hell

352
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,140
Don't cutting to the two of you who went out to the junkyard

353
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:05,900
You guys pull up and the headlights are shining through an old rusty chain link fence and through the end of the fence

354
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,240
You see at the end of the lights reach of your headlights

355
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:16,880
The ground is splattered with blood and a lifeless body is crumpled on the moist dirt about 20 yards past the fence

356
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,780
inside this junkyard is

357
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:23,320
The gate locked to the gate is locked. Is there barbed wire? There is barbed wire

358
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,360
Oh, I was gonna climb over but I got better since than that plus my big bridges if I get caught on the bar

359
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Bet you guys have some cutters

360
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,540
Yeah, well, hey, shut up Thomas. You're not there. Can we can we get a hold of who owns this place?

361
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:46,180
The Pistons this is the piston junkyard and the NBA team. Yep, the Detroit pistons. Hey Clark

362
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:53,100
Junkyard and content. What's big boss pistons name? So you would know it's two brothers who run the piston family

363
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,980
Leo and George and they are the piston brothers

364
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,940
I think that Clark Bishop would know these two from back in the day Clark

365
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:06,240
You got Leo or George's phone number, uh, you can probably get a hold of Leo sure do

366
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,080
Okay, give him a call come have him unlock this

367
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,840
I don't have to cut through if we don't need to but let him know it's a serious situation

368
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:19,680
Yeah, I'll give him a call the phone rings like six times before there's a click and then you just hear this

369
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,920
Leo hey Leo. Hey. Hey. Hey, it's it's Clark Clark. Hey

370
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,040
We've got a situation up here at your yard Clark who?

371
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,340
Bishop with the contingent PD, you know me Leo

372
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,800
We've got kind of a thing going on up here at your yard

373
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,680
We need to we need you to come down here and let us in in the pig farm. No your junkyard. Oh

374
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Okay. Well, uh

375
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
I'm busy

376
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm bit Leah, you know, I wouldn't call you if it wasn't important. There's there's something there's uh, there's something real bad might happen

377
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,680
Okay, I'll get my keys and I'll be down in a second. All right. Thanks, man. Okay

378
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,280
So a old truck pulls up

379
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,200
It's like a beat-to-death old truck probably from like the 50s and it seems like it was taken care of for a long time

380
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
But hasn't been taken care of recently

381
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,040
Rust is starting to grow on it

382
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:31,780
He pulls up and a large man in overalls covered in pig shit gets out

383
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,780
You know kind of

384
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,900
waddling I guess is the right word towards you guys and he's got this big circle ring of

385
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:46,340
Keys that he's already like in the darkness trying to thumb through trying to find the right one

386
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,860
Clark I was busy, but you know, you're you I like to keep you guys

387
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,860
I'll be down here any time that you need. I'm just like to be a good citizen

388
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,400
We know Leo we know we we're not making fun of this guy's mental health are we no

389
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Definitely. This is what he sounds like

390
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,940
This is a character voice that I have chosen for this man

391
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,980
and just because he's not that smart and has a thick accent doesn't mean that he's not a

392
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
fully fleshed out

393
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,420
Character and a human being we love and we love and respect

394
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,020
Hey Leo, do you?

395
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,980
Leo when's the last time you were?

396
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:45,220
Cut it at Thomas's mic when he's not in the room and Leo when's the last time you were here I had to come by to

397
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,220
sweep up

398
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,940
Two weeks ago, you haven't been here for two weeks. It's George was George here today

399
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,900
Nobody comes out of here ain't nobody jumps anything anymore. Is it just you and your brother who have keys to this here?

400
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,060
Yeah, Kathy, who's Kathy? No, it's a George's wife. You know, do you know? Okay. Oh Kathy, of course, of course

401
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,060
We know okay. I call her Katie

402
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,580
All right. Well if you can go ahead and open up this gate, I I don't know if you can't

403
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:17,260
I don't know if you've noticed this but if you take a peek over there, I think you can see why it's such a serious situation

404
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,220
Oh

405
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
Is that it? Yeah

406
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:28,200
Well, I didn't this wasn't me like I didn't I don't know you are the prime suspect right now

407
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,300
He's so scared like looking in his eyes he is the scariest boy I

408
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,340
Slap him on the shoulder. I said, I'm just kidding. You haven't been here in two weeks

409
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,260
He drops his keys and he's like picks him back up. He's trying to fumble with him and he's like, okay

410
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,300
It's this one and he goes over and he unlocks the gate. Can I go home now? Yeah, okay

411
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,100
Did he leave the could you leave that key here for us and we can get back to you tomorrow?

412
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,580
Yeah

413
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:06,220
He's very he's very quick with his fingers and he gets the key off the ring immediately and hands it to you and it's like

414
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:12,020
Okay, I'm gonna go home now. Yeah, I think we would have I'm not here, but I don't think we would have any further questions

415
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,640
No, yeah, I just have reason to detain this. Yeah. Well, I'm being sarcastic

416
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,480
Yeah, okay, yeah, hey Leo, we'll we'll get that key back to you tomorrow

417
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,460
But we probably will have a few questions once we return that to so just you know, nothing bad

418
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,640
Just be prepared to have a little conversation tomorrow

419
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:35,240
Okay, I will prepare to have a conversation with you tomorrow. Also don't mention this to George cuz

420
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,540
You know, I want you guys getting any funny ideas. Just kidding

421
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Nervously and leaves

422
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,360
Okay, let's open this and go take a peek at this body

423
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,320
So you guys get your poking sticks

424
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,480
So the the gate opens two of you walk in and you're looking around this junkyard. It is a massive junkyard

425
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,800
We're talking 10 acres of land

426
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,680
I mean this thing is massive and there's junk piled up every which direction right in front

427
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,840
Can I roll to see if I find anything cool? Uh, yeah roll so live in a dead body. What's your search 40?

428
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Okay, that's a 95

429
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
95 you see a day is gone

430
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,600
so seriously in front of you, there is a

431
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:32,520
crumpled up dead body with blood splattered all around it in every direction and it is sitting right in front of

432
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,520
They're basically the only building on this entire land

433
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,880
Mass that is kind of serves as like an office

434
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,800
It's a quickly put up almost like trailer

435
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,440
It's got one door one window kind of place and it's got the sign on it piston junkyard all that jazz

436
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,400
It's sitting the body is like right in front of it. Uh, I look over at Clark

437
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,500
I say I don't think we're gonna need an ambulance for this one

438
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,480
But uh, do you have that the camera equipment lights and stuff in your car? Is that in I do? Okay, you got it

439
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,040
What's that? Let's go ahead and get that set up. We gotta take some pictures of this but you go run into that

440
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,320
I'm gonna take a peek at it. Yeah, okay

441
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,320
So I want to go up and inspect see if I can see if I can see why

442
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
This is a dead body. Okay, so

443
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,320
We know one thing I'm gonna interrogate the body

444
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,240
roll human

445
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,720
with your vast

446
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:32,680
Intelligence that Keith vignette my 50 intelligence you can tell this this body seemed to hit there's blood

447
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
splattered in a circular

448
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,820
Range around this body in every direction

449
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,400
So it looks like this body was thrown here or dropped here

450
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,480
Is there any footprints or anything around or does it look like it just became here it?

451
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,680
Looking around though. The ground is wet a little bit. It's like the ground is the ground is moist and

452
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,000
There there are no footprints in the area except for your own

453
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,360
So it is it is since it's like damp or whatever it would I would be able to notice footprints if they yeah

454
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,400
I think so. Okay, I return with the lights on the camera and I go ahead and set up some good floodlights on the area

455
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,600
Yeah, and start just taking. Yeah, let's take some pictures before we move this body for

456
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,400
Posterity isn't in front of the front door of their office. It's just in front

457
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,480
It's like probably 10 yards away from the building and it's not centered on anything in particular

458
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,960
It's just like there do I looking at the building? Do they have any security cameras set up? No

459
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,360
Snap some pics and then I'm gonna is this face down or face up face down. I'm gonna roll him over

460
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:44,920
That's him. Is it a can I tell or I'm gonna roll the body when you roll the body over cannot see its face

461
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,520
But it does seem to be the body of a woman. Why can I not see its face?

462
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,940
Well, okay, you can see her face, but the face is smashed completely

463
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Beyond recognition beyond all

464
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,380
Recognition this is not a great night for faces. Oh, you know a lot of faces getting messed up in contention

465
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,780
Can I can I see if there does she have teeth or finger fingers?

466
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,700
It looks like she did probably have teeth at one point but not anymore. Nah, all right

467
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:18,140
Would it would we be able to identify like fingerprints? It's like a black bloody mess and yes, there are fingers

468
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:23,380
Okay, I go and get out my little 10 in case your 10 fingers in case you were wondering nice

469
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,580
Look at these fingers, dude. These are great

470
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,860
We can well, I don't know how many she started out with

471
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,900
I hope she has committed a crime at some point. That way we can identify her in our database

472
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,140
I do the I just take a my ink pad and grab a few. Yeah fingerprint fingerprints got him

473
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,200
I'm right so other other than her face, which is smashed. Is there any other visible injuries?

474
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,120
Smashing mostly it looks like she took smashing damage from the from all over or just the face

475
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:55,540
I would say it looks like from where she hit the ground is where like all of

476
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,520
Hit the ground I look at is there anything directly above us when you look up

477
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,760
The sky is above you and that seems to be it. Wow, that's amazing. The sky is up there

478
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,460
I want to go through the pockets when you go through the pockets

479
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:18,580
There is a small piece of paper that is folded a handful of times and this piece of paper is a thick piece of white

480
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:24,060
Parchment on it is written in this weird black thick ink and it says

481
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,300
We is striking when the land gets darkness

482
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,340
readying torches hesitate not

483
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:41,380
You're looking at this body and it is wearing what seems to be really thick hand stitched clothing and leather boots and

484
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:46,420
Besides that note in the pocket. That seems to be all you can really garner from it

485
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,700
Is there style to the note? Is it written like a poem and does it have funky punctuation?

486
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:58,540
It has punctuation it is we is striking when the land gets darkness period readying torches period hesitate not period

487
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,420
Okay, but no it's not in stanza form. Yeah, it's not formatted in a weird way

488
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,980
It's just written as it could fit on this piece of paper

489
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:09,960
So that was folded up a couple times and put stuffed into her pocket

490
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,680
So you're taking pictures that was the only thing in the pocket. That is the only thing in the pockets

491
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:21,680
How big are the britches fitting nice? I I hike my big old britches up. I'm like man. Those are some nice pants

492
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,680
I want to take a strand or two of hair and put it in an evidence bag. Absolutely cutting back to

493
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:35,960
John Lee Pettymore is at the scene and the ambulances arrived. They are going to ask you what happened

494
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:43,200
Well, I was in pursuit of this intoxicated young woman and she fucking smashed her car in that goddamn telephone and ripped her face open

495
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:49,840
I've not seen that's anything like that in a while. Obviously, you know sprint car race and you see your fair share of smashed faces

496
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,800
Okay, so they're done like as soon as they get that information. They're like, okay

497
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,400
Well, we need to get her to the hospital. And so they start

498
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,260
Yeah, the thing about racecar driving

499
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:09,620
So they get out nerves a steal they get her on to a gurney of sorts and it's not a gurney barrel and

500
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:20,940
Bamboo wood and cheesecloth and they get her in the back of this ambulance and falls right through the cheese

501
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,120
She gets up and starts running. Yeah, so immediately draw my side

502
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,020
Zombie

503
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,620
So they take her they take her away and you can probably call Ray and have him take care of the cleanup crew and everything

504
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,440
But what do you what do you do? I'm going to go get my car bourbon

505
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,500
Oh, yeah, take a swig out of that to steady my nerves and then I'm gonna check her car out

506
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,260
I'm gonna do a search probable cause out the ass

507
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,660
Yeah, so yeah

508
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:59,460
You're good to check the car when you're going through it in the back seat of the car is a it's a Polaroid

509
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:06,980
Camera and it seems to be from early early Polaroid camera making days. You've never seen a camera like this

510
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,900
It's got the normal like chunkiness to it

511
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:16,060
But it's got some like weird glass tubes that go around it and on it is a light

512
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,660
that is red and it has a viewfinder and a button to take pictures and

513
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,540
Then a spot for the paper to go in and a spot for the paper to come out and then all these glass tubes

514
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:34,940
Probably two or three that like loop around from like one into the other and stuff there any Polaroid sitting around other also

515
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,660
Yeah, I forgot to mention there is a Polaroid sitting in the seat of the car

516
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:46,020
In the shotgun seat. It is a Polaroid. It shows the base of a tall building and a group

517
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,860
Crowding the entrance with fists raised

518
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:56,940
Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black

519
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,500
The entire picture is not fully like colorized

520
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:08,140
It almost seems black and white but the the light from the torches is giving off some sort of like a yellowy

521
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:14,500
Orangish tint would you say maybe perhaps a sepia? Yeah, almost a sepia tone on this picture

522
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:21,540
Does that strike you as odd that strikes John is very odd and he goes and takes another fortify and swig off his bourbon

523
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,720
Go ahead and roll a sanity check for me

524
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,840
Hard fail, okay

525
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,920
So you're gonna lose one sanity and you're gonna need to take that pull instead of just wanting to

526
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:38,360
Off of the old whiskey. So yeah, this is really weird. Like you've never seen anything like this

527
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,480
You've probably not messed with Polaroids too much in your life, but you definitely know that if

528
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,600
It shouldn't look like this. Yeah, are there any blank? There's paper in the in the camera, okay

529
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,780
I want to try to take a picture you click on the button and nothing happens

530
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,200
you do notice that on this camera where the red light is coming from there is also a

531
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,480
Unlit green light next to it. So the red light is illuminated. Yes. Gotcha

532
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,880
Okay, do I see and like an attachment or anything?

533
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:13,040
That's supposed to go into this or a place for that to go somewhere that might activate that green light

534
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,560
No, okay does not look like it. Can I just push it push what the green light?

535
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,600
It's not a button looks like this is not a button

536
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,440
There are two lights side by side one has a red cover

537
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,760
Basically one is colored red and the other one is colored green and the red light is shining

538
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,460
The green light is not just want to move the camera around and point it at different things and see if that changes

539
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,960
What light okay, John Lee Pettymore is standing on the side of the road as a light mist comes down in the darkness

540
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,900
He's all alone and he is standing with a camera that is odd in his hands

541
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,820
Aiming it at different things and looking at nothing in particular

542
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,220
Wow, nothing happened, but it sounded horrifying

543
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:02,180
Yeah, nothing changes, okay as you go through the rest of the car you get to the trunk and in the trunk are

544
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,500
multiple gas cans and

545
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,360
A bunch of lighters and matches classic firebug. Yes

546
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,880
Oh and also inside the car I make a note of that inside the car was a bottle of

547
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,420
Brandy bottle of cheap brandy about half gone. Do you take a swig?

548
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,640
Not my brand my brand so cutting back to the two of you in the junkyard is special liver

549
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,360
Where did we leave you guys? I guess we found that note and

550
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:36,980
I got the fingerprints and a piece of her hair that I'm planning on running. What's the coroner's name here? This is the county

551
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,860
Yeah, you can just call the county. Okay, let's give them a call. See if they can figure out

552
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:46,980
I mean, I think I know what killed this person, but let's see what that what their professional opinion is

553
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:52,260
What's your theory their faces smashed them to death? How do you think that happened?

554
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:58,540
That's what that's what I want to find out doesn't sound like you have a theory then or know how this person got killed

555
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,740
Oh, I know that they got killed because their faces smashed

556
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:07,100
That's that's what I got cause of death being a face smash cause of death smashed face

557
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,820
Yeah, I mean that'll do it for sure. Yeah, I certainly wouldn't want my face smash like this

558
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,380
Yeah, I'm done with that. They call it call the corner in I'm gonna do a little search around like it

559
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:22,340
And maybe like a 50-foot radius around this body and see if I can find anything of interest. Okay, cool

560
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:28,260
I want to go into the office. That's right there. Okay, sounds good. First off you give me a

561
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,900
search role I

562
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:38,020
Do not pass you do not find anything and Joe Clark Bishop is walking up to the

563
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:46,180
Building the front door of this building and it is unlocked. I go in it is a small room

564
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,620
There's only one room

565
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:54,360
There's a desk that is like literally covered in papers and garbage and a bunch of shit just everywhere

566
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:58,740
There's a couple chairs in there that are also covered with shit and there's a bunch of filing cabinets

567
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,420
This place is deeply disorganized and no one has been in here in a while

568
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,060
I'm just looking to are there any

569
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:12,620
Surveillance anythings any TVs that look like they were at least once surveillance. There is one camera

570
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,860
It is in the corner of the room. Can I follow its cord to see where it goes?

571
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,800
Yeah, and you would also see that it does point at the front door, which looks out the window

572
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,520
Cool, but I mean I want to see where it's Oh where it's hooked up. Yeah. Yeah

573
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:33,540
So I underneath the desk is like the CCTV I turn on the TV. Mm-hmm. Do I get a picture?

574
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:40,440
Yes, is there a VCR anywhere nearby? Oh, yeah, it is connected. It's one of those TV VCR combos

575
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,840
So this is Joe doesn't know this would a

576
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,040
Police officer to look at the tape in that VCR. Would he take it back to the shop?

577
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,980
You can do whatever you want. I guess I'll do I'll just leave it there. Whatever you like

578
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:00,040
I'll look at it there. Okay, I rewind go ahead and roll luck to see if it was recording

579
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:11,220
Baby it was not recording. Yeah, that would have really helped

580
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:17,660
I pop in from my search and I say hey have you found where that camera leads to?

581
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,940
Maybe I can do a roll and see if it was

582
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,840
Talks about life in a really weird way

583
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,140
No, that's how that's how life works cool

584
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:37,100
So you guys at this point could you could have ray come out and watch this scene for the night?

00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,740

612
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,260
Well, how did her face get smashed?

613
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:58,780
Poor driving was she drunk or what was it? Are you drunk? I never know these days vigna

614
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,980
You should have seen this face. This is got me pretty shook. Well, do you need what are you doing right now?

615
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,740
Do you need help? I'm just trying to make this camera work

616
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,620
Okay, let's I'm gonna let's go see what he's up to

617
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,140
So the three of you go back to the office the police department after

618
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,900
Ray is gonna take care of cleaning up the car on the side of the road. That's been smashed

619
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,980
He's gonna call a tow truck and let everybody know what needs to be taken care of there

620
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,500
Well, it's about time he did something. Yeah, he's also gonna

621
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,380
Go out to the junkyard and keep watch over the crime scene for the night, which you put up crime tape and all that

622
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:35,900
Jazz, I wanted to express to Ray that we do want the coroner to like autopsy won't be one

623
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:44,380
Of course yeah, and so I you'll get that report back in the morning and the three of you meet back up at the police department

624
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,900
You're probably all out in the parking lot now is about when you would either

625
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,840
I don't know

626
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:55,560
Do you guys to have personal cars or do you take your your cruisers back to your homes Clark definitely takes his cruiser back?

627
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:01,420
Yeah, I do. Yeah, so the three of you are all in your cruisers and you pull back into the police department's parking lot

628
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,140
I walk in and talk to drew the

629
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:10,560
Secretary hey, hey drew. Hey, you see the chief tonight. No, she hasn't come back in since she left abruptly

630
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:16,820
She she call her anything. She did not call. Hmm. He like looks through his messages. She did not call

631
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,220
All right

632
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:22,700
Will you give her a ring and if you if you get a hold of her you gotta tell her we got some stuff going on

633
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,500
here absolutely and then Clark goes to his desk and

634
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:31,940
He starts doing whatever he can in the office with the fingerprints and so you can basically send that stuff in

635
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,740
okay to County and

636
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,300
Get results back later. I'm doing that Clark you you like to take those crime scene photos and things

637
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,580
Mm-hmm. Can you have you ever seen a camera this queer?

638
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:46,580
I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before it looks kind of old with the glass tubing like that

639
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:51,260
I know they used to use that some of them old radio. Yeah, but this this ain't a radio Clark. Yeah

640
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,740
This is a weird one this picture mean anything to you I look at the picture you look at the picture

641
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:02,260
I want to look at the picture. The picture is a Polaroid of a base of a tall building

642
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:06,300
There's a group of people crowding the entrance their fists are raised

643
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:13,940
Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black

644
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:19,860
But the only coloring that you see is from the torches and it's like an orange ish yellowish hue

645
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,860
Everything else is black and white roll sanity

646
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:29,540
Pass I pass. Okay, you both don't see anything out of the ordinary with from this picture

647
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,860
Do I recognize the building by any chance a place?

648
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:37,140
All right, where'd you get this picture and honestly you wouldn't be able to recognize the pic the base of the building

649
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,140
anyways, because it's literally just like

650
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:46,420
Like an out an exterior wall, what was the driver's name? I assume we looked at her wallet and stuff

651
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:50,580
Yeah, yeah for sure. Her name is Julie Maxwell. She lives in town. I got this

652
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,980
I got this from Julie Maxwell's car. Wait, does that the car you pulled over?

653
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:59,500
Yeah, Julie was the one that called in about the body. Yeah, she's not gonna be doing many calls with that face anymore

654
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,540
Is she do we know her? Is she at the hospital right now?

655
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:07,280
She is she stable or she are we gonna be able to talk to her? You don't know I can call up there

656
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:13,700
Okay. Yeah, let's find out also that note said something about torches. I read the note out loud. That's ominous

657
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,740
Well, I chant the note

658
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:25,060
This has got to be connected if Julie called in the body. She's got a picture of her

659
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:32,220
Is she in the picture we found a note mentioning mentoring torches we found a picture of

660
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:40,740
Torches one woman's face was smashed another woman's face was split entwined. What was Julie wearing?

661
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:45,380
Did you see the body her not alive? Have you seen her by a live body?

662
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,740
What was her are you asking me?

663
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,140
Looking like

664
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:54,460
What was her clothing looking like let me stop to recollect

665
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,300
picture a single

666
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,340
Middle-aged woman who is stuck in the 80s

667
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:06,580
Now you remember your old friend Stacy and her mom. Mm-hmm. Wait. No Stacy's mom has got it going on

668
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,380
Who's the one who still thinks it's 1985?

669
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:18,480
She reminded me a lot of your friend's mom who still thinks it's 1985. Oh, yeah, Carol

670
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,220
Yeah, she's got Carol hair

671
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:26,980
Carol hair Carol clothes. All right, cuz our body it looked like homemade stuff. I kind of wondered if they were together

672
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,100
It's got to be connected. Sure

673
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,540
But maybe our Julie's a suspect here. It's getting pretty late at this point

674
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:37,500
You guys might want to call it for the night and can I can I go ahead and call the hospital though?

675
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:43,300
Just to see for sure. She's unconscious. Okay, she's but still alive. Yeah, like not gonna die. Hey, let me roll

676
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,300
Oh god

677
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,300
Oh, yeah, no, she's dead Julie Maxwell's

678
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,860
She's a cop to severe blood loss. She's dead. She's just rolled a hundred

679
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:58,220
She's dead. Hey, remember when you said let me roll. It would have been tight if you

680
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:06,740
Know Julie Maxwell's dead. There was probably there was probably nothing more to gather from that thread. So yeah, I

681
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,540
Think we can call this one case closed drive safely folks

682
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,020
I'm gonna go home. All right, take it all

683
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,820
Sleeper and think about what I've seen today

684
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:22,940
This was my first dead body and I'm kind of creeped but also a little bit stoked. Oh, yeah

685
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,980
Hey, go ahead and roll me a sanity for seeing that dead body. I forgot to have you roll that

686
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:32,620
I got an 87 that should be good right? No, I don't think so. What's your sanity 50?

687
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,380
yeah, so you're gonna want to head and lose one and

688
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,900
Just a quick note for you guys. We're gonna run this as a sanity

689
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:46,580
We'll run as like a humanity tracker to see how much you care about

690
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:54,060
Humanity everything that you see that makes you doubt the like goodness and humanity will make you lose

691
00:57:54,300 --> 00:58:00,360
Sanity also anything that makes you think that maybe humanity isn't all that's here will make you lose sanity

692
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:07,400
So that's how we'll be tracking it. I feel a little less like I give a shit about people. Yeah, I think so

693
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,880
Hey Keith, who do you know in town? Like who are your friends? Who's your family? Do you have anyone?

694
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,320
I've got well my parents. I grew up go ahead and eat that mic. Go ahead and get up on so

695
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,640
Don't eat mine

696
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:27,360
Yeah, I grew up here, but my parents both passed away. I don't really have

697
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:34,800
Any like close family? I've only been here a couple months. So I haven't really made friends

698
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,040
I don't hang out with people really the only time I see other people is when I'm at work

699
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,800
What's your dog's name? My dog's name is bean. I

700
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:50,120
Didn't know if you knew this or not. But uh, it looks like I'm a I'm a distant relative of of those bean boys

701
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:56,940
What what the bean boys the bean boys bean pond stuff you you have?

702
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,040
Ancestral roots to the the one of the founders of this town, correct Amundo

703
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,160
Cornelius beans Cornelius beans was my

704
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:11,660
Ancestor grades grandpa is in your blood line. He's in my blood line between two and four grades

705
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:18,780
Depending on how quickly they fucked more kids out. I named my dog beans. You poop kids out you fuck them in

706
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,520
Oh, that's right. My bad. So your dog's name is beans

707
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,960
What kind of dog is it golden retriever and on a scale of how much you love it? It's a lot probably

708
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,000
It's probably like a 10. So when you get home that night

709
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,600
Being great to at the door. Oh, hell yeah. That's sheen bean. Hey bean

710
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,680
And that is the most genuine role-playing

711
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:49,900
I'll play I'll be being I he licks my face and I'm like

712
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,400
What's your like what's your nightly thing? Like what do you do when you I'm gonna cook dinner

713
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:06,080
Eat my dinner while I watch TV. Yeah, probably fall asleep in my lazy boy. Sounds good. What are you doing?

714
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:10,760
Clark doesn't have a lot in life. Yeah, but he's got his house. Mm-hmm

715
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:17,840
he comes home and he cooks his TV dinner in the microwave and he sits down with his TV tray and watches Wheel of Fortune and

716
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,300
he

717
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:24,920
Sometimes gets the puzzle before I was gonna say does he play along or does he just watch it for fun every now?

718
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,180
And then he gets a puzzle right before anybody else does nice

719
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,560
I was kind of thinking this guy's a real lonely sad guy for sure. No, that absolutely makes sense

720
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:39,540
We can he maybe maybe he has a connection with a checkout counter exactly

721
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,640
Yeah, a guy at the checkout at the grocery store

722
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:48,000
I love it just kind of they exchange pleasantries does he knows we know each other's names and we kind of know each other's hobbies

723
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,000
Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. No, that's perfect. That's absolutely perfect. So what are you doing with your night?

724
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,960
watching Wheel of Fortune beautiful and

725
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,600
John Lee Pettymore John stays back a little bit and he

726
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,560
Can't really shake this picture. Yeah, he's just kind of looking at it

727
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,200
And he probably stays in the station maybe half an hour 40 minutes after everybody leaves

728
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,760
Just trying to get his thoughts together. Mm-hmm. And then he goes he leaves

729
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:17,880
He leaves home and he hits up a local bar. Okay, Lee not leaves home leaves the station. Yeah in uniform

730
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:23,080
No, okay sit in my cities. Okay, he's wearing he's wearing tight wranglers a

731
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,840
Tucked in pearl snap. Yeah, and a pretty fucking sick leather jacket

732
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,560
TBH very cool. I'm not gonna say TBH again. I'll get listeners

733
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,400
So you go to clinkers the local bar

734
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,680
It's a small bar and all the windows on the outside are blacked out

735
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:51,160
But there are neon lights on the outside with different bush light Miller light Coors light signs neon signage

736
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,920
And on the inside it is a smoky small room

737
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:01,560
With three tables and a pool table and a bar Harry is behind the bar as per usual

738
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,680
Harry clinker owner of clinkers and

739
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,120
There's a couple regulars in there. Nobody too important to the town couple guys playing pool

740
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:15,240
I mean his night he's gonna he's gonna get him a little light and a slice of lime and he's gonna play ball by himself

741
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,880
all right, the next day you guys go into the office and

742
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,760
Immediately

743
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,760
Drew has a couple messages for you

744
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,400
One a city council members dog is missing

745
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:31,600
to there's a house on the south side of the old neighborhood where the doors swinging open and mail is piling up and

746
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,080
Three there is an oil spill out southeast of town on a country road last night

747
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,600
So it's three different calls that came in. Can you can you expand on that oil spill?

748
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,040
Yeah, let's see who called that in. Let me check my notes real quick

749
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:50,000
Jimmy Sanders called it in and you would know that Jimmy Sanders is an old buddy of yours

750
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
maybe even a relative not sure and

751
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,880
He is like kind of an old hippie and he is the manager of Subtropolis the sub shop downtown

752
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:04,280
Yeah, no Jimmy. Jimmy Sanders called that in at like 4 in the morning last night

753
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,920
And yeah, he said there was an oil spill out out there in the country red. Where's that house at?

754
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,920
What house the house?

755
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,520
It's on the south side of the old neighborhood which is in the southwest part of town

756
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:21,920
I'm gonna go check out that house anybody want to come with me or should we just all get this all taken care of separately?

757
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,880
Also, I think there were a few things you wanted to check when you when you

758
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,440
So you've got those three things that came in and then you know that Julie

759
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:35,180
Maxwell is gone. She's no longer with us has a chief come in today. I know she hasn't come in

760
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:40,520
I tried to call her a couple times. It went straight to voicemail. I think you really got her probably hit her home

761
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:45,380
Do you do you guys like that? I'm gonna be a constant character in this game and I sound like this

762
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,600
Well, you're better than right

763
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,680
What were you wanting to find out today?

764
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:57,840
I forgot if we got any hits on the fingerprints of the hair autopsy or anything or the autopsy. Yeah, okay

765
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:03,840
So we'll do this in order. Nothing came back on the fingerprints. This one is in no zero databases the hair

766
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,400
Also, nothing came back

767
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,320
DNA wise not in any databases the autopsy report came in and

768
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,720
She's dead. She is dead. She died from blunt trauma

769
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,800
Hell yeah, dude

770
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,840
Which is one way? Oh my god

771
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:30,080
Which is I was gonna say another way to say face smashing do you guys wanna smoke me?

772
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,240
Yes, it was blunt trauma and hell yeah, dude

773
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,240
Blunt trauma would actually be a pretty fucking great like stoner metal or

774
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:46,680
On the autopsy report. Yeah, she died from blunt trauma. Hell, yeah, but also

775
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,480
She had a brand on her back that her skin was

776
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,680
Branded and it said this is a fool in all capital letters

777
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,880
Clark Clark on the phone is like yikes

778
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:07,880
And they can see where some pictures if you want yeah, dude, was it a fresh brand it was a

779
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,500
relatively fresh brand like adidas

780
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,840
More fly than fresh so real quick. I'll give you the rundown one more time. Carrie pages called and said that her dog is missing

781
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,840
Mildred Mitchell called and

782
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:30,860
Said that there was a house on the south side of the old neighborhood where the door is swinging open and mail is piling up

783
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,920
and

784
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,920
Who was the last guy?

785
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,280
John Sullivan, did you say Jimmy Sanders?

786
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,760
So close Jimmy Sanders called about an oil spill out southeast of town on Country Road

787
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,160

790
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:57,080
Yeah, I'm gonna go check out the house cuz I don't know the councilwoman or or Jimmy

791
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:03,040
So I'm gonna go to the it would it would be best if we sent someone's pretty senior to the councilwoman

792
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,600
The only thing I was gonna say is that I think Clark would feel like a missing dog is way beneath him

793
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:13,840
I well that depends like in this town. Do we get a call from like a council member and like yeah, that's true

794

800

It's getting a little weird I feel like we might be dealing with some sort of cult here

801
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,340
It seems like we've got a hillbilly murder cult

802
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,800
Something's driving the dogs crazy and faces are hurt
