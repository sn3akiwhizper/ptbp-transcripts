00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
Greetings, my great greasy grandchildren.

00:04.080 --> 00:07.520
It's your grease keeper god, Wolf the Dog,

00:07.520 --> 00:09.960
and I'm here to recycle the grease.

00:09.960 --> 00:14.240
I will turn old, dead grease into new, alive grease

00:14.240 --> 00:17.840
once again by using the purifying properties

00:17.840 --> 00:19.680
of my fur hairs.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.720
I am the Greasier.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.400
I am born unto the grease,

00:24.400 --> 00:28.440
and I will return the world to grease once more.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.480
Also, I'm a radio host for 694.2 PTBP.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.480
Grease bless this mess.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.080
This week's Howlin' with Wolf was a bit strange.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.880
When I finally stopped greasin' up the joint

00:42.880 --> 00:44.320
and got behind the mic,

00:44.320 --> 00:48.080
I noticed an unfamiliar package on my desk,

00:48.080 --> 00:50.040
shaped like a cassette tape,

00:50.040 --> 00:52.960
and inside was a cassette tape,

00:52.960 --> 00:56.120
and that was titled in rainbow-colored marker,

00:56.120 --> 01:00.800
each letter a rotating, vibrant hue of Roy G. Biv,

01:00.800 --> 01:02.120
and it read,

01:02.120 --> 01:05.480
Something has been happenin' to you at night lately,

01:05.480 --> 01:08.840
by a lie remains a lie,

01:08.840 --> 01:12.520
and or at countless bats on Twitter.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.840
There is an eight-foot, hunchbacked, wolf-muscled man

01:15.840 --> 01:18.560
who opens your window quite gently at night,

01:18.560 --> 01:21.000
and he climbs in and crouches beside you

01:21.000 --> 01:22.480
in bed there to watch you.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.320
He touches your face with his thick-knuckled hands,

01:25.360 --> 01:26.640
and he opens your mouth,

01:26.640 --> 01:28.760
and he works out your teeth one by one

01:28.760 --> 01:31.200
to inspect them, replace them with new ones

01:31.200 --> 01:34.120
he's lovingly crafted with thick-knuckled hands.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.520
Terribly, slowly, his face is a factless intent,

01:37.520 --> 01:40.960
and you ask me why you don't remember this happening,

01:40.960 --> 01:42.720
and I tell you, you do.

01:44.040 --> 01:44.880
Oh, you do.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.760
Heh heh, uh heh heh, uh heh heh.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.640
Well, uh, thanks from whoever sent that.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.120
I definitely will be sleepin' just as soundly

01:56.120 --> 01:58.200
as I had previous to listenin'

01:58.200 --> 02:00.640
to that nice little piece of audio.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.600
It definitely didn't scare the piss out of me

02:03.600 --> 02:05.040
from sheer terror.

02:05.040 --> 02:08.520
It's a good thing I have my dog, Wolf, the dog,

02:08.520 --> 02:12.040
to keep me company and keeping the terror at bay

02:12.040 --> 02:14.160
for yet another night.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.760
If you wanna send in a strange package

02:16.760 --> 02:20.000
for Wolf to play on these slick airwaves,

02:20.040 --> 02:22.880
tag at PretendinPod on the internet,

02:22.880 --> 02:26.960
or write up a five-star review on the Apple Podcasts.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.800
I'm going to start readin' five-star reviews

02:29.800 --> 02:31.560
live on air here and there,

02:31.560 --> 02:35.400
so make them snappy, sloppy, and sweet, y'all.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.320
Now listen to me.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.720
I will click the links in the show notes.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.320
I will click the links in the show notes.

02:44.320 --> 02:48.920
I will click the links in the show notes.

02:48.920 --> 02:53.760
I will click the links in the show notes.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.760
Man, if we got old, wouldn't I know

02:56.760 --> 03:15.980
that we're with me today,

03:18.920 --> 03:23.200
Gigantumbropithecus.

03:23.200 --> 03:27.000
A Gigantumpropithecanth.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.800
An Umbagumgarbregrath.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.720
Whatever that thing was, it lost its balance

03:33.720 --> 03:36.600
when a clerk bishop blinded the big fucker

03:36.600 --> 03:39.080
with a bright flash of face light.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.720
And then the Don Jon AT-ST

03:41.720 --> 03:44.440
casted a wand-focused Devil Hands,

03:44.440 --> 03:48.560
which, overclocked by the sacrifice of Wheeler Fortjohn,

03:48.560 --> 03:51.360
demolished the large shadow ape.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.000
Planet Juggernaut gracefully turned

03:54.000 --> 03:56.320
and whipped itself up into the air

03:56.320 --> 03:58.280
like jumpin' out of a swing,

03:58.280 --> 04:02.440
if the swing warped and dissolved into nothingness

04:02.440 --> 04:04.920
as the booty achieved liftoff.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.320
And the overwhelmingly enormous champion of the scrap pit

04:09.320 --> 04:12.920
landed directly on top of M-A-R-Y,

04:12.920 --> 04:15.460
crushin' both her and her hopes

04:15.460 --> 04:18.520
to open this portal to Tildy B. Mitchell,

04:18.520 --> 04:20.920
where Silas Cole had trapped her,

04:20.920 --> 04:23.240
deep below Bean's pond.

04:23.240 --> 04:27.120
Taking us now to the sultry dulcet tones

04:27.120 --> 04:29.280
of Mick and Nick Nickles,

04:29.280 --> 04:34.280
is Draggin' In 3 with What Kinda World Are You Livin' In?

04:34.280 --> 04:39.280
["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]

05:04.280 --> 05:09.280
["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]

05:13.880 --> 05:17.080
Praise be to Planet Juggernaut,

05:17.080 --> 05:20.320
the lord and savior of all who have gathered here today,

05:20.320 --> 05:23.280
as well as those that exist in other variations

05:23.280 --> 05:25.360
of this plane of contention.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.600
Praise be, Nick Nickles!

05:27.600 --> 05:31.400
Praise be, my brother from the exactly same mother.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.980
Planet Juggernaut is here,

05:32.980 --> 05:36.920
for he is our savior no matter the time or place or space.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.760
Praise him!

05:37.760 --> 05:38.760
Praise him all!

05:38.760 --> 05:42.900
Hail Planet Juggernaut, born a virgin and very round.

05:42.900 --> 05:47.180
Rotund Planet Juggernaut is celibate, and that's okay.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.020
Hail him!

05:48.020 --> 05:49.620
Hail him now, you weak idiots!

05:49.620 --> 05:53.660
I personally will weep at the feet of Planet Juggernaut

05:53.660 --> 05:57.620
and clean his shiny metal foundation.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.660
I am already crying so many of my tears

06:00.660 --> 06:02.500
for our round mound of chrome.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.820
Let us use our tears to wipe away the blood

06:04.820 --> 06:07.700
of all of his enemies off his shiny shoes.

06:07.700 --> 06:12.700
I want his holiness, Planet Juggernaut, to come inside me.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.140
I have sinned so many times in this life,

06:15.140 --> 06:17.380
but Planet Juggernaut has forgiven all of them

06:17.380 --> 06:19.420
and cleansed the many dimensions.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.420
My sins are no longer an issue.

06:21.420 --> 06:23.420
Please do not look at my sins.

06:23.420 --> 06:24.820
Look at Planet Juggernaut.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.940
Let's get him now!

06:26.940 --> 06:30.860
Let's give him a quick talking to a post-game conference

06:30.860 --> 06:32.900
here with Planet Juggernaut.

06:32.900 --> 06:36.020
Planet Juggernaut, how are you feeling after today?

06:36.020 --> 06:39.260
No need to thank me, Mick and Nick.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.700
Just doing what I do best.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.140
That's being a fighter.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.840
Mick, I like your enthusiasm,

06:46.840 --> 06:48.660
but obviously I won't come in you.

06:48.660 --> 06:51.460
Planet Juggernaut, after a performance like today,

06:51.460 --> 06:53.940
what do you think is gonna happen next?

06:53.940 --> 06:56.380
What's next for Planet Juggernaut?

06:56.380 --> 07:01.380
I haven't really thought about it, Mick and Nick.

07:01.660 --> 07:04.020
Might just go for a little spin.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.780
Wow, what a humble hero.

07:06.780 --> 07:08.980
Hey, it's you guys who are the real heroes,

07:08.980 --> 07:10.700
you know what I mean?

07:10.700 --> 07:11.780
Catch you later.

07:11.780 --> 07:14.340
It's like he's the size and shape of an Earth

07:14.340 --> 07:16.100
and he's down to one.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.260
That's just incredible.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.740
I'm glad he finally pointed out

07:18.740 --> 07:20.540
that we're the true heroes here.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.380
This Planet Juggernaut, our Messiah,

07:23.380 --> 07:27.180
has delivered us from both the chaos of the Scrap Pit

07:27.180 --> 07:31.820
and the horrible, unsplikable monsters here in this,

07:31.820 --> 07:35.340
oh, nope, oh gosh, oh Mick.

07:35.340 --> 07:36.660
Oh, Planet Juggernaut.

07:36.660 --> 07:37.500
What's going on, my beautiful brother?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.620
Everybody needs to look up right now

07:39.620 --> 07:43.300
and see this ocean of motion of wormy worm times

07:43.300 --> 07:46.900
coming on down towards us slowly but surely.

07:46.900 --> 07:50.220
Oh, I do not wanna be squished by those bugs.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.500
I don't like looking at the worms, brother.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.020
I don't like looking at them either.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.540
Let's hold each other with our eyes closed.

07:59.060 --> 08:00.540
I'm giving you a big hug.

08:00.540 --> 08:01.380
I'm doing a hug.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.140
Make that sound Justin made, both of you together,

08:03.140 --> 08:04.780
like you're quivering and hugging.

08:10.380 --> 08:13.780
And from below, everyone can see the top half

08:13.780 --> 08:17.620
of Keith Beans up in the sky,

08:17.620 --> 08:21.300
continuing to wriggle as the worms make their way

08:21.300 --> 08:26.300
through his skull and attach themselves to his brain.

08:27.420 --> 08:31.180
Luke, I would like to speak to you.

08:31.180 --> 08:32.020
Alone?

08:32.020 --> 08:35.340
I think that seeing as how we're at the end here,

08:35.340 --> 08:37.820
they can sit in on it. Yeah, that's fine.

08:37.820 --> 08:42.820
Keith Vigna, you are standing at six o'clock

08:43.180 --> 08:47.940
on the face of a watch.

08:48.860 --> 08:52.580
It's a massive, massive watch face,

08:52.580 --> 08:55.380
surrounded on all sides

08:55.380 --> 08:59.780
by an unnaturally wriggling ocean of darkness.

09:00.780 --> 09:05.540
And as these worms begin to consume your brain,

09:05.540 --> 09:09.980
you are somehow unable to die

09:09.980 --> 09:14.220
and therefore your synapses are firing off

09:14.220 --> 09:18.380
and connecting simultaneously to the worms

09:18.380 --> 09:21.860
and across from this massive watch face

09:21.860 --> 09:24.420
that you're standing on at noon,

09:24.420 --> 09:27.940
floating in this endless void,

09:27.940 --> 09:31.460
you see Ferguson Beans, your brother.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.380
He's wearing a white suit.

09:33.380 --> 09:36.220
It fits him like a glove.

09:36.220 --> 09:40.380
It's got a red rose on his lapel.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.340
He looks dapper as he's ever looked.

09:44.780 --> 09:49.140
Aside from the bullet holes in his chest,

09:49.140 --> 09:52.020
blood pouring down,

09:52.020 --> 09:55.180
matching his flowery lapel,

09:55.180 --> 09:58.700
his corsage with the blood

09:58.700 --> 10:03.180
that is now leaking through his white suit.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.820
And when he sees you,

10:04.820 --> 10:06.940
he begins walking slowly

10:06.940 --> 10:11.620
across this massive watch face toward you.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.180
How close is he to me?

10:16.180 --> 10:18.900
Suddenly he's standing right before you

10:18.900 --> 10:21.660
and he falls to his knees, weeping.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.340
Keith.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.340
Keith, I'm so sorry.

10:31.340 --> 10:35.660
I'm sorry, why, what?

10:35.660 --> 10:37.460
Why are you sorry?

10:37.460 --> 10:40.620
They made me, they made me into who I am

10:40.620 --> 10:45.620
and I'm so sorry of the way I treated you.

10:45.980 --> 10:46.820
Who did?

10:46.820 --> 10:47.660
Bob and Dad.

10:47.660 --> 10:48.780
You were always kind of mean.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.740
They turned me against you at such a young age.

10:51.740 --> 10:52.780
Why did they?

10:52.780 --> 10:55.500
They were trying to make me into something,

10:55.500 --> 10:58.620
something that could handle what was going for all of us.

10:58.620 --> 11:02.780
Well, I'm sorry, but they chose the wrong son.

11:02.780 --> 11:06.540
I'm, I think I saved something.

11:07.420 --> 11:10.980
I'm sorry you had to die for it.

11:10.980 --> 11:15.300
You're kind of like a savior in your own right.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.140
Well, I feel,

11:18.100 --> 11:19.500
I feel like a martyr.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.740
Do martyrs know that they've done something wrong?

11:22.740 --> 11:24.140
Do they all deserve it?

11:29.620 --> 11:30.460
Yes.

11:34.180 --> 11:35.580
I don't know a lot.

11:35.580 --> 11:38.900
So is that the answer you wanted?

11:38.900 --> 11:40.500
And he's just crying.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.340
Keith doesn't know what martyr means.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.860
A murderer, you say?

11:47.860 --> 11:49.620
Is that the one that is half goat?

11:52.420 --> 11:55.460
I just, I never wanted to turn you against,

11:55.460 --> 11:58.340
I didn't know exactly what I was doing.

11:58.940 --> 12:01.500
Our relationship and how important I think it would be

12:01.500 --> 12:05.380
later in life to actually get to know you.

12:05.380 --> 12:07.380
I was just always jealous of you.

12:07.380 --> 12:10.340
And I still loved you.

12:10.340 --> 12:12.020
I do still love you.

12:12.020 --> 12:16.380
I was, I think about you.

12:16.380 --> 12:17.460
Why did you do it?

12:18.500 --> 12:21.340
To be completely honest, I don't know.

12:21.340 --> 12:25.100
There was some kind of hate in me from a young age

12:25.100 --> 12:26.220
that just lived there.

12:26.220 --> 12:30.620
And I, you know, I didn't realize how much was in me

12:30.620 --> 12:34.500
until an opportunity arose.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.220
Did you get it out?

12:36.220 --> 12:40.980
Did you at least, did you get it all out of your system?

12:40.980 --> 12:42.220
Are you okay now?

12:43.460 --> 12:44.580
I've been better.

12:48.540 --> 12:49.660
Did Fergie just ask him

12:49.660 --> 12:52.260
if he got his hatred out by killing him?

12:52.260 --> 12:53.100
Yeah.

12:53.100 --> 12:53.940
What a guy.

12:54.940 --> 12:59.940
Keith embraces Ferguson and weeps with him.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.420
As we turn away from that scene,

13:04.420 --> 13:05.660
here's what's about to happen.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.380
I am going to set the scene of what's all going on

13:08.380 --> 13:10.340
here in the aftermath of the defeat

13:10.340 --> 13:13.020
of the Gigantum Burpithecus and M-A-R-Y,

13:13.020 --> 13:14.980
as well as the closure of the portal,

13:14.980 --> 13:17.180
which removed the additional threat

13:17.180 --> 13:20.740
and all around rough time of dealing with Tildy B. Mitchell.

13:20.740 --> 13:23.660
And then after I describe what's going on

13:24.260 --> 13:26.060
with the NPCs that are here,

13:26.060 --> 13:31.060
you'll have one D-12 plus four minutes.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.820
I have a handy dandy timer here on the screen

13:34.820 --> 13:38.140
next to Justin's handsome little mug.

13:38.140 --> 13:39.580
Why did I say that?

13:39.580 --> 13:44.380
And when the one D-12 plus four minutes run out,

13:44.380 --> 13:48.380
this ocean made of unimaginably slippery

13:48.380 --> 13:52.140
little pulsating membranes with two sets of sharp teeth

13:52.140 --> 13:55.060
inside each adorable circular mouth

13:55.060 --> 13:57.180
will come crashing down.

13:57.180 --> 13:58.940
And these little guys will latch on

13:58.940 --> 14:01.500
to every last one of you.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.780
So you'll need to figure out how to deal with that

14:03.780 --> 14:05.660
in your allotted time.

14:05.660 --> 14:08.740
But also some people might feel the need to catch up.

14:08.740 --> 14:12.380
And if there's anything else you wanna do or grab or use,

14:12.380 --> 14:15.180
maybe the phone or the broken radio

14:15.180 --> 14:17.180
up at the top of the shadowy building,

14:17.180 --> 14:20.540
the grabbing or using would presumably need to happen

14:20.540 --> 14:25.100
before you each go into your own tiny worm dream hole

14:25.100 --> 14:29.100
for the foreseeable forever of your character.

14:29.100 --> 14:34.100
So let's roll a D-12.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.340
Who wants to do it?

14:36.340 --> 14:37.380
Joe. Joe.

14:37.380 --> 14:38.220
Joe.

14:38.220 --> 14:39.060
Joe.

14:39.060 --> 14:39.900
Joe.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.740
Joe.

14:41.740 --> 14:42.580
All right, sure.

14:42.580 --> 14:43.420
One D-12 plus four.

14:43.420 --> 14:44.460
Don't fuck this up, Joe.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.260
It's a 12.

14:47.260 --> 14:49.340
No, I don't think so.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.980
It's a three.

14:51.980 --> 14:53.020
Oh.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.500
So we got seven minutes.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.140
Fuck.

14:56.140 --> 14:56.980
Seven minutes.

14:56.980 --> 14:57.980
Thomas, did you just roll a one?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.300
Yeah, but I sure did.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.660
You're like, don't worry, I'll save us.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.820
Oh, I thought it was a D-12 plus a D-4.

15:06.820 --> 15:09.220
It's just one D-12 plus four.

15:09.220 --> 15:10.060
Yep.

15:10.060 --> 15:11.020
Thank, okay, cool.

15:11.020 --> 15:11.860
Thank you.

15:11.860 --> 15:12.780
What a kind DM.

15:12.780 --> 15:14.660
Seven minutes is a good amount of time.

15:14.660 --> 15:17.860
Well, let's just pair up and go into the closet.

15:17.860 --> 15:19.260
Oh.

15:20.140 --> 15:21.300
Nice.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.140
I got it.

15:22.140 --> 15:22.980
Time to go to heaven.

15:22.980 --> 15:23.820
Slowly.

15:23.820 --> 15:25.500
A room full of people who are not invited

15:25.500 --> 15:26.660
to play that game.

15:29.340 --> 15:31.980
Hey, yeah, same.

15:31.980 --> 15:33.940
So like, what happens in there?

15:37.220 --> 15:40.060
All right, I'm setting the timer now at seven minutes.

15:40.060 --> 15:44.300
I will click start when I tell you that I'm clicking start.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.780
Click pause really quick.

15:45.780 --> 15:46.940
No timer has happened yet.

15:46.940 --> 15:49.660
So I was a little confused about the order of events here.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.380
We can do whatever we want right now,

15:51.380 --> 15:52.940
and then the seven minutes starts.

15:52.940 --> 15:55.380
No, we can do whatever we want for seven minutes.

15:55.380 --> 15:56.700
Yep, I thought it was gonna be longer,

15:56.700 --> 15:59.660
but we'll have seven minutes out of character

15:59.660 --> 16:03.260
and in character, just seven minutes total

16:03.260 --> 16:05.100
before the worms come down.

16:05.100 --> 16:05.940
So, okay, you're like,

16:05.940 --> 16:07.500
there's a radio at the top of the tower.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.140
Did any of our characters discover that yet?

16:09.140 --> 16:09.980
Keith saw it.

16:09.980 --> 16:10.820
Keith saw it, okay.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.420
I saw what?

16:12.420 --> 16:14.820
Yeah, so, no.

16:14.820 --> 16:15.820
I didn't hear what you said.

16:15.820 --> 16:17.580
Oh, Don saw it.

16:17.580 --> 16:18.420
Yeah, Don saw it too.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.260
Yeah, what did I see?

16:20.260 --> 16:21.380
The radio.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.860
Oh yeah, I saw the radio and I used the phone,

16:23.860 --> 16:25.540
so I know it's there too.

16:25.540 --> 16:29.660
And I have been positively reinforced by the phone

16:29.660 --> 16:32.540
because I gotta make flurry.

16:35.660 --> 16:36.500
I'm back.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.340
Back in the New York groove.

16:37.340 --> 16:38.660
Now Thomas is gone.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.740
Back in the Maybound town.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.780
Pissing my pants downtown.

16:42.780 --> 16:45.100
Pissing fast, pants are down.

16:45.140 --> 16:47.140
Peeing in my little pants.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.380
Doo, doo, doo, pee in my little pants.

16:50.380 --> 16:53.140
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.220
I wanna piss my pants.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.060
Pants.

16:57.060 --> 17:00.380
I wanna piss my pants.

17:00.380 --> 17:04.060
Oh, I tell you something.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.900
I wanna piss your pants.

17:08.900 --> 17:11.100
Lie.

17:11.100 --> 17:16.100
All I want is, I wanna piss your pants.

17:16.180 --> 17:19.820
I wanna piss your pants.

17:19.820 --> 17:22.780
Are you peeing on someone else's pants in this?

17:22.780 --> 17:24.060
No, pissing in them.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.180
You don't wanna hold my pants.

17:25.180 --> 17:28.900
And when you piss them, I feel happy.

17:28.900 --> 17:32.540
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

17:32.540 --> 17:36.540
A warm feeling, let that stain.

17:36.580 --> 17:38.300
It can't hurt.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.980
It can't hurt.

17:39.980 --> 17:42.820
It can't hurt.

17:42.820 --> 17:46.460
What about Dave Matthews band, Piss?

17:46.460 --> 17:47.740
Piss into me.

17:47.740 --> 17:50.260
Piss into me.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.580
Hey, we do something with making my way downtown yet?

17:52.580 --> 17:53.420
Yeah.

17:53.420 --> 17:54.580
Are you ready?

17:54.580 --> 17:55.860
Oh, are you ready?

17:55.860 --> 17:57.780
Absolutely not, this is crazy.

17:57.780 --> 17:59.380
Yeah, I definitely thought this was happening

17:59.380 --> 18:00.220
tomorrow night.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.100
The Luminous Land Liturgy,

18:05.100 --> 18:08.420
which includes Drew Andrews, Councilwoman Carrie Pages,

18:08.420 --> 18:11.220
Gary Daley, Mildred Mitchell, Clara Blankenship,

18:11.220 --> 18:14.220
Casey Kristoff, Everett Pace, Jack Perlman,

18:14.220 --> 18:17.580
Greer Hilfintop, Kermonkernau, the saloon bartender

18:17.580 --> 18:20.220
and piano player, as well as a gambler named Thomas,

18:20.220 --> 18:22.220
along with myriad animals,

18:22.220 --> 18:24.700
either held, perched, or healing.

18:24.700 --> 18:29.500
Keith, you see, Bean is running happily, tongue akimbo,

18:29.500 --> 18:33.340
and this entire group continues to bob and weave

18:33.340 --> 18:35.780
in a ceaseless musical number

18:35.780 --> 18:39.780
at the unnatural direction of the overseer,

18:39.780 --> 18:44.220
though their voices quiet down to an eerie whisper

18:44.220 --> 18:48.260
as they dart around uncontrollably.

18:48.260 --> 18:51.780
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.

18:51.780 --> 18:55.260
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.700
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.

18:58.700 --> 19:01.740
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.

19:01.740 --> 19:05.820
The myriad begin to speak in unison.

19:05.820 --> 19:10.820
We appreciate the efforts of subject 1522518195518,

19:14.100 --> 19:19.060
your attempt to destroy the countless alternative timelines.

19:19.060 --> 19:21.780
It garners our respect.

19:21.780 --> 19:26.780
However, plane 1620216 still has far too many variants.

19:27.020 --> 19:29.180
It is unstable.

19:29.180 --> 19:33.140
We have decided it is best to just shut it down

19:33.140 --> 19:34.900
and try again.

19:34.900 --> 19:39.340
For your own safety, please stay here.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.540
We will repeat ourselves one more time,

19:42.540 --> 19:47.340
fearing you either did not listen or did not hear.

19:47.340 --> 19:52.340
For your own safety, please stay here.

19:53.020 --> 19:56.100
And with that, this myriad of lanky skin,

19:56.100 --> 19:59.380
thin, thin-skinned, thin-skinned creatures

19:59.380 --> 20:04.420
in black suits just pops out of this existence.

20:04.420 --> 20:08.100
You have seven minutes until the horrible ocean

20:08.100 --> 20:12.660
of little mouths and huge worms drowns everyone

20:12.660 --> 20:17.660
in the endless isolation of their own unsound minds,

20:18.020 --> 20:20.980
starting with the last one.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.980
Starting now.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.820
What was the number that the overseer,

20:25.820 --> 20:28.860
that the myriad referred to this plane as?

20:28.860 --> 20:31.020
I've translated it before, he's given it to us before.

20:31.020 --> 20:32.860
It's PTBP.

20:34.140 --> 20:35.060
Nice.

20:35.060 --> 20:37.020
Glad I didn't spend seven minutes on that.

20:37.020 --> 20:40.220
Overseer wants to yell to the masses,

20:40.220 --> 20:41.780
I think I can send you back.

20:41.780 --> 20:42.980
You don't have to stay here,

20:42.980 --> 20:45.300
but I can get you back to your own places.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.220
And he wants to try that.

20:47.220 --> 20:50.380
He wants to look at Clark, make eye contact with him

20:50.620 --> 20:52.060
and the plan is to create portals

20:52.060 --> 20:55.100
that send them back to their timelines, not to ours.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.260
The overseer.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.300
Okay.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.700
When you say theirs, not ours.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.700
Can you pause the time while you think?

21:03.380 --> 21:05.460
Those creatures just said that they can't stay in here

21:05.460 --> 21:06.660
because there's too many vectors.

21:06.660 --> 21:09.460
They can't stay in the PTBP plane or whatever.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.620
So I was gonna send them to other,

21:11.620 --> 21:13.300
where they got plucked from.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.540
So the Old West guys go back to the Old West.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.700
Go ahead and roll a natural real quick for the overseer.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.900
69.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.460
It's a 69.

21:24.460 --> 21:25.300
Wow.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.140
Fuck.

21:26.140 --> 21:27.420
It's a straight 69.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.620
That's the best 69 I could've rolled.

21:29.620 --> 21:30.460
Holy shit, really?

21:30.460 --> 21:31.300
I could've rolled.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.860
Amazing.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.340
It just keeps happening.

21:35.340 --> 21:36.740
Okay, so in this moment,

21:36.740 --> 21:39.860
you know that the plane 1620216

21:39.860 --> 21:41.660
that Myriad is talking about

21:41.660 --> 21:45.700
is the entire existence of your world.

21:45.700 --> 21:49.460
And so there are many different infinite variations

21:49.460 --> 21:51.700
on that world that are all considered

21:51.700 --> 21:55.860
to be plane 1620216.

21:55.860 --> 21:58.620
However, with a 69,

21:58.620 --> 22:03.500
I am going to change the entire idea

22:03.500 --> 22:06.460
that I had and allow the overseer

22:06.460 --> 22:09.580
who has dedicated his entire life

22:09.580 --> 22:12.140
to jumping between these little planes

22:12.140 --> 22:14.860
that exist all over 1620216.

22:14.900 --> 22:18.260
He has the ability now to send

22:18.260 --> 22:21.500
each of these Luminous Land Liturgy members

22:21.500 --> 22:23.900
to their respective existences

22:23.900 --> 22:25.500
wherever they happen to come from.

22:25.500 --> 22:29.180
However, based on what Myriad has told you,

22:29.180 --> 22:33.340
they plan to shut down that entire plane.

22:33.340 --> 22:35.540
So you can send those people

22:35.540 --> 22:40.260
to go end their lives wherever they belong,

22:40.260 --> 22:43.020
but that is essentially what you will be doing.

22:43.020 --> 22:46.180
I wish we hadn't started the seven minutes yet.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.340
We're like halfway.

22:49.420 --> 22:52.540
I could send everybody back

22:52.540 --> 22:54.820
and then take the fight to Myriad.

22:54.820 --> 22:59.820
Keith feels himself dying above him somehow.

23:00.340 --> 23:03.100
And he realizes he's like,

23:03.100 --> 23:05.060
I'm gonna die again.

23:05.060 --> 23:06.720
I'm gonna die here.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.940
And he looks around and he sees the people

23:08.940 --> 23:12.020
that he's gotten into this mess with

23:12.060 --> 23:13.320
and he just yells,

23:13.320 --> 23:14.740
Drew, Drew, Drew.

23:19.540 --> 23:20.580
Where's Drew at?

23:20.580 --> 23:22.620
He's chanting, he's whispering,

23:22.620 --> 23:23.700
Sha-ka-tay.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.660
But in the voice of Councilwoman Carrie Pages.

23:25.660 --> 23:27.940
Keith goes up and grabs Drew.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.740
Is the Councilwoman here too?

23:29.740 --> 23:31.900
The body of Councilwoman Carrie Pages

23:31.900 --> 23:33.900
has Drew Andrews inside of it

23:33.900 --> 23:37.300
and the body of Drew Pages,

23:37.300 --> 23:40.340
Drew Andrews has Councilwoman Carrie Pages inside of it.

23:40.340 --> 23:42.940
I could just go grab both of them.

23:42.940 --> 23:43.780
Follow me.

23:43.780 --> 23:45.700
They are very much,

23:45.700 --> 23:47.460
I grab them by the ears and pull them

23:47.460 --> 23:49.920
and run towards the castle thing.

23:49.920 --> 23:50.760
Okay.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.900
They are still chanting

23:51.900 --> 23:53.860
and desperately want to get away from you,

23:53.860 --> 23:55.460
but in that moment,

23:55.460 --> 23:58.140
the overseer has the option to release them

23:58.140 --> 23:59.260
from their bind.

23:59.260 --> 24:00.660
Clark.

24:00.660 --> 24:01.780
He drops,

24:02.660 --> 24:04.720
he knows that for them to get anywhere,

24:04.720 --> 24:06.820
we have to drop this spell.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.100
So yeah, he drops it.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.660
Okay, completely for everyone?

24:10.340 --> 24:13.140
Uh, no, just those two for now.

24:13.140 --> 24:15.620
He needs the power that he can keep.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.460
Yeah, okay.

24:16.460 --> 24:18.860
So then immediately you're getting like a,

24:18.860 --> 24:20.940
oh my God, oh my gosh.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.860
Why, what is going,

24:22.860 --> 24:23.940
what is going on here?

24:23.940 --> 24:24.760
Drew, Drew.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.600
No, I'm Carrie.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.260
Carrie, Drew and Carrie.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.100
Yes.

24:28.100 --> 24:28.940
We're gonna die.

24:28.940 --> 24:29.760
Drew here.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.600
We're gonna die.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.420
Yes.

24:31.420 --> 24:32.260
And if I'm gonna die,

24:32.260 --> 24:33.280
I wanna die with Drew and Drew's body.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.740
Let's get you switched.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.580
Okay.

24:35.580 --> 24:36.420
Follow me.

24:36.420 --> 24:37.240
Come on, run.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.080
And they run after you.

24:38.080 --> 24:38.900
We have 90 seconds left.

24:38.900 --> 24:39.740
So they're running.

24:39.980 --> 24:40.820
What are you, the other two doing?

24:40.820 --> 24:43.020
Can Clark, by time,

24:43.020 --> 24:46.300
can he try and do a spell that pushes the ceiling back?

24:46.300 --> 24:47.120
Yes.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.300
Go ahead and roll a natural.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.580
60.

24:53.580 --> 24:56.520
Passes both Clark and the Overseer.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.780
Give me some sort of a magical chance here.

24:59.780 --> 25:01.860
Both Clarks look up in the sky

25:01.860 --> 25:03.580
and because they're kind of linked now,

25:03.580 --> 25:04.940
they both know what's going on

25:04.940 --> 25:07.300
and they put both their hands up

25:07.300 --> 25:09.220
and they start chanting.

25:09.220 --> 25:12.900
R-S-T-L-N-E.

25:12.900 --> 25:17.900
R-S-T-L-N-E.

25:18.220 --> 25:19.060
Fuck yeah.

25:21.420 --> 25:26.420
And I am clicking pause on the timer at 30 seconds.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.380
They love goosebumps.

25:31.260 --> 25:32.100
Why aren't we paused?

25:32.100 --> 25:33.540
Because of the spell.

25:33.540 --> 25:34.860
You would be seeing how much we bought

25:34.860 --> 25:36.300
or is it just pause paused?

25:36.300 --> 25:41.120
Go ahead and roll another d12 by itself.

25:48.740 --> 25:49.580
Four.

25:49.580 --> 25:50.420
Four.

25:50.420 --> 25:51.240
Four more.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.340
Beautiful.

25:53.340 --> 25:57.580
Well now we have, it just seems like almost too much time.

26:01.580 --> 26:04.240
And with four minutes and 30 seconds left.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.640
Oh shit.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.880
So we've got a John and a Planet Juggernaut still in play.

26:11.880 --> 26:12.800
That is correct.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.620
So Planet Juggernaut just shoots up into the air

26:15.620 --> 26:17.560
and opens its giant Pac-Man mouth

26:17.560 --> 26:20.840
and starts eating Xenonibatodes like the fucking krill.

26:26.280 --> 26:29.160
And John is gonna pitch in and try to help the Overseer

26:29.160 --> 26:33.400
and he might even start throwing chunks of the muck world

26:33.400 --> 26:37.400
up as like flak pieces towards the Xenonibatodes

26:37.400 --> 26:40.040
trying to blast maybe even a hole

26:40.040 --> 26:42.320
just above us in the circle.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.140
Cool.

26:43.140 --> 26:43.980
Super dope.

26:43.980 --> 26:46.600
If it's not bottomless and endless forever and ever.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.440
Worms.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.360
Amen.

26:48.360 --> 26:51.700
Thomas, go ahead and roll a d100.

26:55.840 --> 26:56.720
91.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.960
Well, that's not gonna do it.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.520
He eats 91 Xenonibatodes.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.080
That's a good number.

27:02.080 --> 27:02.920
You do what?

27:03.360 --> 27:04.200
You gotta tell me what I'm rolling for

27:04.200 --> 27:05.680
so I can tent the dice.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.520
Yeah, he can pray.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.760
Go ahead and roll a natural for John.

27:13.620 --> 27:14.660
John Ball.

27:17.840 --> 27:18.840
That's a failure.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.520
That's an 85 on a 67.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.160
Oh no.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.040
Okay, unable.

27:23.040 --> 27:26.920
So cutting to the top of the tower, we've got a dark room.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.040
It is pitch black.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.040
Keith Vigna is running in with Councilwoman Kerry Pages

27:31.040 --> 27:34.600
and Drew Andrews and he makes it to this very,

27:34.600 --> 27:38.520
very dark room at the top of the shadowy tower.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.680
He starts to feel really calm.

27:46.680 --> 27:50.000
And he's getting real sleepy and warm.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.000
Yep.

27:55.860 --> 27:57.800
And he realizes what's happening to him

27:57.800 --> 27:59.640
and he looks at Drew.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.800
You gotta do it, buddy.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.200
And then he lays down on the ground.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.400
I gotta do what?

28:05.400 --> 28:06.240
I gotta do what?

28:06.240 --> 28:10.160
Bubblegum tree, bubblegum tree, what am I supposed to do?

28:10.160 --> 28:13.440
The radio, that's how the cat switched.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.720
I can't see anything.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.840
Yeah, I can't see anything in here either.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.560
Who do you think is at fault?

28:18.560 --> 28:19.920
That's super nice.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.640
And Drew Andrews and Kerry Pages

28:25.640 --> 28:27.920
are just arguing back and forth and confused.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.280
They begin to start feeling all over the room,

28:30.280 --> 28:32.960
trying to find anything in the room.

28:32.960 --> 28:36.280
And Drew immediately finds the radio.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.160
Kerry can't find anything, but Drew's like,

28:39.160 --> 28:40.280
I think I have it.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.440
I'm almost positive that I have it, sir.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.280
Do it.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.120
Do what?

28:44.120 --> 28:46.240
Press some buttons on it and get it working.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.120
I don't, I'm feeling around.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.240
The goo, get some goo or something.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.040
Get some goo?

28:52.040 --> 28:54.040
Or just lay down and chill.

28:54.880 --> 28:58.480
30 seconds.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.120
Okay, Keith, I roll a D100.

29:00.120 --> 29:02.880
If you can roll under 30,

29:02.880 --> 29:05.800
I'll let Drew get out of this room with this thing.

29:07.000 --> 29:07.840
32.

29:09.640 --> 29:10.480
Fuck.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.000
We just need to get out of here before the sea falls.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.400
So Overseer's just doing a giant portal

29:15.400 --> 29:16.760
under the ground of all of us

29:16.760 --> 29:18.560
and just dropping us into wherever.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.440
If that doesn't work,

29:21.440 --> 29:23.760
John asks the nematodes politely to stop.

29:24.040 --> 29:29.040
Okay.

29:29.160 --> 29:34.160
Okay, so I've paused it at one second left on this timer.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.240
He did hit it exactly when there was one second left

29:37.240 --> 29:38.080
on the timer.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.560
Which was right after Joe said he opened the portal,

29:39.560 --> 29:40.400
which was pretty dope.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.200
So let's go ahead and get that roll off time

29:43.200 --> 29:46.080
of dropping this world down.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.640
It's a pass, 52.

29:52.640 --> 29:53.760
Okay, roll a D12.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.000
Two.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.600
No!

30:00.600 --> 30:02.360
Two minutes starting, meow.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.800
And so the whole entire floor,

30:04.800 --> 30:09.800
this lit land all over everywhere that you can see just,

30:10.080 --> 30:11.280
oh, would it be cooler if,

30:11.280 --> 30:12.880
yeah, it'd be cooler if there were walls.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.000
It'd be cool if the two minutes start after

30:15.000 --> 30:18.200
you say all this shit. Shut the fuck up, dude.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.240
I hate it when you're right, it's stupid.

30:20.240 --> 30:23.880
You're like, hold on, give me a couple minutes

30:23.880 --> 30:24.720
to come up with a cool description.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.880
Hold on, guys, it's gonna be cooler.

30:26.880 --> 30:27.720
Two minutes.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.880
Do you want to describe what happens?

30:30.880 --> 30:33.080
I was just picturing that he encompassed

30:33.080 --> 30:35.720
every piece of land that is occupied by people now.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.840
So it includes the tower, I think.

30:37.840 --> 30:41.320
And then my chanters and wherever Juggernaut is

30:41.320 --> 30:44.320
and John Ball and Don.

30:44.320 --> 30:47.400
And it's a perfect circle around all of that

30:47.400 --> 30:51.440
that just drops down, leaving giant white walls

30:51.440 --> 30:53.480
all around us in a giant circle.

30:53.480 --> 30:54.960
It's so bright in here.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.520
Yeah, it's very bright in here.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.240
Is it bright in the room now?

31:00.240 --> 31:01.080
Yes.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.160
That's what I meant to do, for sure.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.120
Wake you up.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.160
And the timer starts now.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.680
Drew Andrews grabs onto the radio

31:10.680 --> 31:13.320
and the rest of you outside see him

31:13.320 --> 31:14.960
running out the front door.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.640
Councilwoman Carrie pages his body,

31:16.720 --> 31:19.320
sprinting out across the land toward you,

31:19.320 --> 31:20.920
holding this broken radio.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.720
And Keith, I'm following behind, running after him.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.160
And I'm going, fuck!

31:27.080 --> 31:29.160
I wanted to die in peace!

31:30.200 --> 31:31.040
Don.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.160
Don starts chanting,

31:33.160 --> 31:38.160
Vis-a-girl, Vis-a-girl, Vis-a-girl.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.440
And he's hoping to rewind some fucking time.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.720
Roll Unnatural for me, please.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.600
Oh no, I thought since it was cool,

31:47.600 --> 31:48.840
you'd just let me do it.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.320
52 on 70.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.160
Yeah.

31:53.160 --> 31:57.080
Yes, you look over and what do you see?

31:57.080 --> 31:59.840
You look over and where you had expected

31:59.840 --> 32:03.920
to maybe see your brother, nephew chanting with you

32:03.920 --> 32:05.440
and aiding you once again,

32:06.480 --> 32:11.480
you see a cartoonishly crisp black skeleton

32:12.480 --> 32:15.200
where this John Lee Kevin Moore used to be.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.560
And you can tell all of them went into that last spell

32:18.560 --> 32:20.680
that you cast against the Gigantopyrthicus.

32:20.680 --> 32:25.640
There is a charred one inch in diameter sphere

32:25.640 --> 32:28.920
sitting on the ground in between you

32:28.920 --> 32:30.280
and your brother and nephew.

32:31.400 --> 32:36.400
And you have all of the strength in this moment to just.

32:36.640 --> 32:40.640
Just purr-gossive, purr-gossive, purr-gossive.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.640
Push back time.

32:45.920 --> 32:50.480
I think you see tears coming down from Don's face

32:50.480 --> 32:52.280
whenever he sees the charred corpse.

32:52.280 --> 32:56.000
And then they start like, before they hit the ground,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.960
they start coming back into his tear ducts.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.080
That's so cool.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.520
That's fucking awesome.

33:06.960 --> 33:10.000
I'm gonna put seven minutes back on the clock.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.040
The original time that you had

33:12.040 --> 33:15.320
immediately after Myria disappeared.

33:15.320 --> 33:19.440
And you are reset exactly where you were.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.000
Everything moves in reverse.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.440
The floor moves all the way back up

33:24.440 --> 33:28.080
and becomes level with the ground around it.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.440
The tower is dark once again,

33:30.440 --> 33:33.280
but Keith runs backwards.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.680
Drew Andrews and Carrie.

33:35.080 --> 33:39.200
The chief leacher for the overseer.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.880
And begin whispering once again.

33:40.880 --> 33:44.840
And the seven minutes starts right now.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.040
Kevin Lee John Moore sees you guys

33:47.040 --> 33:49.240
back in your original places.

33:49.240 --> 33:54.240
He shouts, he shouts, overseer, floor, Keith, radio.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.560
And then he shouts, juggernaut, get him.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.840
And juggernaut wants to try to do it again.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.360
Yeah, while this is happening,

34:01.360 --> 34:03.680
Keith gets his phone out of his pocket,

34:03.680 --> 34:06.000
turns the light on and runs to the tower.

34:07.200 --> 34:08.920
And overseer's dropping the floor again.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.320
Just give us some light in this area.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.160
Okay.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.000
And more time again.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.120
Oh yeah, and I'll do the spell.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.040
I'll do both.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.880
Okay, go ahead and roll.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.620
Back to back on natural rolls.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.080
One of them doesn't work.

34:22.080 --> 34:22.920
Okay.

34:22.920 --> 34:23.920
The other one does.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.920
32, so I'm gonna do the floor.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.060
Okay, so you're able to drop the floor down.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.320
Go ahead and roll a D12.

34:31.640 --> 34:32.480
10.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.480
Oh!

34:33.480 --> 34:34.320
Nice!

34:34.320 --> 34:35.160
Nice!

34:35.160 --> 34:36.960
That's some juicy time!

34:36.960 --> 34:38.920
All right, and 16 minutes begins.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.600
Boom, the floor drops down once again,

34:41.600 --> 34:45.120
illuminating the entirety of this cylinder

34:45.120 --> 34:46.840
that you've trapped yourselves in,

34:46.840 --> 34:50.380
much like the cylinder that the Gigantum Rapithecus

34:50.380 --> 34:52.360
was trapped in when you arrived.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.520
The difference in the time that we just did,

34:55.520 --> 34:58.040
he drops it so much further down than he did last time.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.480
Yeah, oh my god.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.200
Literal tower of terror shit.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.040
Yeah.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.600
He created an elevator.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.000
Planet Juggernaut, please go ahead and roll

35:06.000 --> 35:08.480
some form of athletics or dexterity,

35:08.480 --> 35:11.320
which we'll call a 70%.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.400
93.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.240
Damn!

35:17.480 --> 35:18.840
93 worms down.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.440
Planet Juggernaut jumps up.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.920
That's two worse than the last time.

35:22.920 --> 35:26.360
Once again, and just like biting for the sky.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.400
The ground drops out from under your feet

35:28.400 --> 35:29.480
as you're trying to jump,

35:29.480 --> 35:31.920
and you just can't quite reach.

35:32.760 --> 35:37.760
And then you fall so far down into this long cylinder

35:37.760 --> 35:40.680
into the bottom, much like a can of beans

35:40.680 --> 35:44.000
that you're now one of these many, many baked fellas

35:44.000 --> 35:47.680
down at the bottom of this saucy, saucy barrel.

35:49.000 --> 35:49.880
Keith Vigna.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.360
He runs to the radio,

35:52.360 --> 35:54.400
and he wants to go grab the phone as well,

35:54.400 --> 35:57.200
and then run back to the Drew crowd.

35:57.200 --> 36:00.800
Okay, go ahead and roll strength or dexterity

36:00.800 --> 36:03.040
or athletics.

36:03.040 --> 36:07.680
Carrying a large old radio and a rotary phone

36:07.680 --> 36:08.920
is difficult business.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.400
I dropped the radio.

36:14.880 --> 36:15.920
You hold onto the phone?

36:15.920 --> 36:16.760
Yeah.

36:16.760 --> 36:17.600
Okay, you can choose.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.640
Well, I've got both in my hands,

36:19.640 --> 36:21.520
and as I like take off,

36:21.520 --> 36:25.200
I have the receiver of the phone in my hand,

36:25.200 --> 36:28.200
but like the base of it is still just sitting there,

36:28.200 --> 36:31.240
and I run and the cord jerks me,

36:31.240 --> 36:32.920
and I drop the radio,

36:32.920 --> 36:35.080
and it's like sitting busted on the ground,

36:35.080 --> 36:38.200
and I grab the base of the phone and start running

36:38.200 --> 36:41.000
and seeing if I can hear anything in the receiver.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.880
Hello, hello, hello.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.840
Hello, hello, hello.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.400
Hello, hello, hello.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.840
Shabababee, shabadoo, shababee.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.280
Go ahead and roll a natural.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.280
You have absolutely no idea.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.400
Oh, damn.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.240
How'd it connect?

36:59.240 --> 37:00.320
He rolled really high.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.000
89 or 89?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.840
I have a 79, so that sucks.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.920
Oh, damn.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.520
Yeah, I'm still running back to the crowd,

37:10.520 --> 37:12.520
just gibberishing into the...

37:12.520 --> 37:14.220
You have time to go back for the radio.

37:14.220 --> 37:15.720
We've got so much time now.

37:15.720 --> 37:19.420
Like, we could take real life poop breaks.

37:19.420 --> 37:22.260
Like...

37:22.260 --> 37:24.000
Shabababee, shabababee.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.040
And I'm, yeah, I'm just standing there,

37:26.240 --> 37:29.800
looking at the radio, talking gibberish into the phone,

37:29.800 --> 37:31.800
trying to think, what the fuck am I gonna do?

37:31.800 --> 37:35.640
Young Clark remembers that he had a vision a long time ago

37:35.640 --> 37:39.240
about the Overseer in a dark room lit by a candle,

37:39.240 --> 37:40.280
and he looks back at that tower

37:40.280 --> 37:42.280
and sees that that's what that was.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.440
And he yells up, do you know anything about the phone?

37:44.440 --> 37:45.600
Can we use that?

37:45.600 --> 37:48.520
And as you talk to yourself,

37:48.520 --> 37:53.160
you know that you've used the phone once or twice.

37:53.200 --> 37:56.400
However, each time that you've used it,

37:56.400 --> 38:01.000
they have found you on your next time

38:01.000 --> 38:05.180
going into a myriad different forms of existence

38:05.180 --> 38:07.280
that you're popping in to try to save

38:07.280 --> 38:09.640
each of these towns of contention.

38:09.640 --> 38:13.500
And an impossible task the Overseer has placed upon himself,

38:13.500 --> 38:16.940
but he does not like being chased,

38:16.940 --> 38:19.240
and every single time he is going

38:19.240 --> 38:20.940
and fucking with time and existence,

38:20.940 --> 38:24.620
he is being chased by these tall, gaunt men.

38:24.620 --> 38:26.580
I mean, I don't know, in character or out of character,

38:26.580 --> 38:28.460
the point is we have to get out of here.

38:28.460 --> 38:29.300
Once we get out of here,

38:29.300 --> 38:33.220
we might have more time out wherever we end up, right?

38:33.220 --> 38:34.820
It's just the sea that's collapsing on us

38:34.820 --> 38:36.620
that's giving this time requirement, right?

38:36.620 --> 38:40.700
Yeah, and just the words of myriad ring in your head,

38:40.700 --> 38:44.920
for your own safety, please stay here.

38:45.920 --> 38:50.700
And you know, in Clark's mind and the Overseer's mind,

38:50.700 --> 38:53.420
the Overseer has been able to make jumps

38:53.420 --> 38:56.820
into plane 1620216,

38:56.820 --> 39:00.060
a plane that he is from and familiar with.

39:00.060 --> 39:04.580
He has been unable or scared to jump to a different plane.

39:04.580 --> 39:08.460
Can I, quote unquote, Clark Young,

39:08.460 --> 39:09.860
help him and convince him?

39:09.860 --> 39:12.580
We gotta try, we gotta get somewhere else.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.900
You got more juice here than you've ever had before, right?

39:14.900 --> 39:16.220
This hasn't happened before.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.540
This has to be all new to you, and I'm here now.

39:18.540 --> 39:20.460
We can go to another one.

39:21.060 --> 39:22.420
We don't have to be in this one.

39:22.420 --> 39:26.860
Hey, could he send them to another one?

39:26.860 --> 39:28.500
And John points up.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.740
Clark, young Clark, wide-eyed, just looking at Overseer.

39:30.740 --> 39:33.600
Yeah, yeah, we already stopped him for a minute.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.580
We can do something to him.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.960
We can send them not here.

39:37.960 --> 39:41.220
The Overseer's wide-eyed begins nodding.

39:41.220 --> 39:43.020
Is it as easy as using that telephone?

39:43.020 --> 39:43.900
Wait, hang on though.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.640
The reason we were gonna get out of this plane

39:45.640 --> 39:47.540
was because they were gonna destroy it.

39:47.540 --> 39:49.220
They were saying it's gonna be purged

39:49.220 --> 39:50.300
or whatever they said.

39:50.980 --> 39:53.500
That's every existence that you have ever known

39:53.500 --> 39:56.860
in all of the different forms of you that have ever known.

39:56.860 --> 39:57.900
It's that whole plane.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.380
On PTBP plane.

39:59.380 --> 40:01.260
But that's, so my original thing was,

40:01.260 --> 40:02.460
let's go to a new plane.

40:02.460 --> 40:03.660
Yep, 100%.

40:03.660 --> 40:07.420
So let's get us out of here instead of the nematodes.

40:07.420 --> 40:09.140
Sure, yeah.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.120
Thought it would be nice to save our world.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.260
It's all homey.

40:13.260 --> 40:14.460
Yeah.

40:14.460 --> 40:18.020
But I guess it's better to save the 13 people here

40:18.020 --> 40:23.020
instead of our entire plane of existence.

40:24.260 --> 40:26.220
I mean, that's 100% a good point.

40:26.220 --> 40:28.580
Wait, but Myriad now is gonna destroy it.

40:28.580 --> 40:32.460
Anyway, this whole plane, everybody in it, not just us.

40:32.460 --> 40:33.540
All that.

40:33.540 --> 40:35.100
Keith, didn't you make Myriad?

40:36.980 --> 40:38.780
I can't hear you, I'm too far away.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.800
Keith is on the phone, he's like, fuck.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.560
And he just throws the phone down, grabs the radio

40:49.560 --> 40:50.840
and starts running back.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.960
Did he want to be say my name?

40:52.960 --> 40:54.960
Yeah, didn't you make Myriad?

40:57.120 --> 40:58.000
Probably.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.920
Well then make Myriad not do this.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.240
Stop!

41:02.240 --> 41:06.220
Just screaming futilely at the heavens.

41:06.220 --> 41:08.680
The wormy wormy heavens.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.480
I'm your dad.

41:10.480 --> 41:11.320
I made you.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.080
Stop!

41:14.920 --> 41:19.920
I get it Myriad, he is a shit father, a terrible creator.

41:20.840 --> 41:24.280
I hate him, I hate that he's my god and daddy,

41:24.280 --> 41:27.360
but he made me too.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.520
Why don't you just stop with all this foolishness

41:29.520 --> 41:32.240
and just come on back down to this plane here.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.080
Go to your room.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.680
And we've got roughly six minutes to talk about it

41:34.680 --> 41:36.680
before you have to destroy the place.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.200
Last time you were here, I think,

41:38.200 --> 41:40.080
actually we had a lot less time maybe

41:40.080 --> 41:41.800
and you just like, you were boogying,

41:41.800 --> 41:43.720
but we've got more time now.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.080
Brother, Myriad?

41:45.080 --> 41:46.000
Roll Persuade.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.360
47 on a 60.

41:52.360 --> 41:57.360
A single, tall, gaunt, translucent skinned creature

41:58.480 --> 42:02.320
appears in between you, Keith,

42:02.320 --> 42:05.240
and the phone that has fallen on the ground.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.640
I knew they'd listen to me.

42:11.880 --> 42:12.920
And which one are you?

42:12.960 --> 42:15.680
Hello, we are Myriad.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.320
What's your name though?

42:17.320 --> 42:18.200
You.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.520
I am Myriad.

42:19.520 --> 42:23.200
Myriad, could you not blow up, what was it?

42:23.200 --> 42:25.240
1620216.

42:25.240 --> 42:30.240
Plane 1020216 still has far too many variants.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.680
It is unstable.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.600
We'll take care of that, just give us some time.

42:34.600 --> 42:35.760
We can fix that.

42:35.760 --> 42:36.600
We're working on it.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.800
We're getting rid of some of the variants.

42:37.800 --> 42:39.720
You've been working against me all this time.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.240
We finally did what I needed to do,

42:41.240 --> 42:42.520
now we can work together.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.360
And if you destroy this plane, I would have never made you,

42:46.360 --> 42:48.360
and so you'll stop existing too.

42:48.360 --> 42:51.080
But then this plane will have never ceased to exist,

42:51.080 --> 42:53.200
and then you'll just have to do this all over again.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.800
It's gonna hurt to think about, so just don't do it.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.880
It's all timey-wimey, unless you don't destroy this shit.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.080
These are compelling arguments.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.760
And I'm your dad.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.520
And I'm your brother, ball.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.760
I guess I'm like an uncle, maybe?

43:08.760 --> 43:10.600
I don't know how it works for me, but.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.000
I think of you as an uncle.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.720
He's a very close family friend,

43:13.720 --> 43:16.120
and we've raised you to call him uncle.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.640
Keith is like talking with his hands,

43:19.640 --> 43:22.800
and he is slapping the radio

43:22.800 --> 43:24.960
while he was screaming at his sons.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.840
Yeah, and you see the ooze that's dripping

43:26.840 --> 43:28.600
from the John ball, and you think,

43:28.600 --> 43:29.840
oh, if I could get some of that,

43:29.840 --> 43:31.480
I could probably get this thing going.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.200
Oh shit, does that just need some ooze?

43:33.200 --> 43:35.000
Well, I need some radio juice.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.280
Some just shoots out of John's index finger

43:37.280 --> 43:38.280
straight into the.

43:38.280 --> 43:40.040
I'm so glad you said index finger.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.640
Which is what he calls his penis.

43:44.360 --> 43:47.320
And Keith has a bright idea,

43:47.320 --> 43:50.800
puts his hand on the shoulder of the myriad thing,

43:50.800 --> 43:53.200
and flips the switch on the radio.

43:54.480 --> 43:56.840
Oh my God.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.720
Oh fuck.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.040
Oh my God.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.160
You gonna pause that, Zach?

44:08.160 --> 44:09.840
Pause.

44:10.760 --> 44:11.600
Pause.

44:13.440 --> 44:18.440
An energy erupts as the brightest flash of light,

44:18.960 --> 44:22.160
it makes the surrounding bright walls

44:22.160 --> 44:25.920
of this cylinder that you've fallen into look dark,

44:25.920 --> 44:28.520
because the light that is flashing

44:28.520 --> 44:32.640
from this radio in this moment is so bright,

44:32.640 --> 44:36.480
you are all completely engulfed.

44:37.480 --> 44:41.200
And when the world kind of comes back

44:41.200 --> 44:43.480
and you can see what's happened,

44:44.920 --> 44:49.920
Keith Vigna has switched bodies with this creature.

44:50.920 --> 44:55.760
And Keith, you have this crazy fucking sense in your head,

44:55.760 --> 44:59.800
like you are tied into an entire network of individuals,

44:59.800 --> 45:03.640
creatures that all work on the same sort of.

45:03.640 --> 45:07.440
My dude, not individuals, not creatures, Keiths.

45:07.440 --> 45:08.280
Keiths.

45:08.280 --> 45:09.840
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck.

45:09.840 --> 45:12.320
It's a whole thing of Keiths.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.160
We're all fucked.

45:18.160 --> 45:21.040
I mean, the body of Keith Vigna is looking around

45:21.040 --> 45:21.880
and touching its skin.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.480
Yeah, a high find has just been thrown

45:23.480 --> 45:24.920
into the body of Keith.

45:24.920 --> 45:28.920
It's trying to understand its own singularity.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.840
It's like playing co-op.

45:32.840 --> 45:35.040
It's like walking like that.

45:38.200 --> 45:43.200
Keith, with the entire hive mind that watches over time

45:43.200 --> 45:46.920
and the universe at your disposal.

45:46.920 --> 45:48.600
The Keithers of the universe.

45:50.200 --> 45:52.040
The Keithers.

45:52.040 --> 45:55.240
Keiths shut their eyes and think real hard.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.400
Keiths shut eyes, think real hard.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.400
Fuck, I don't know what to do.

46:03.160 --> 46:04.640
I can do pretty much anything,

46:04.640 --> 46:06.000
cause I'm a myriad, right?

46:07.000 --> 46:08.280
Just like I expected.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.480
Let me read this long thing that I wrote.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.360
Or when you did this.

46:15.160 --> 46:19.000
Yeah, Keiths, he shuts their eyes for a second.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.880
Oh, I just won't do it.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.680
I just won't destroy the plane.

46:25.680 --> 46:26.520
What do you mean you won't?

46:26.520 --> 46:28.480
I just won't do what they were gonna do.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.200
You're, hold on.

46:30.680 --> 46:32.040
I'm probably, are you?

46:32.040 --> 46:33.000
It's Keith.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.360
What?

46:34.360 --> 46:35.960
We are Keith.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.600
Keiths just start popping up everywhere

46:38.600 --> 46:40.120
and just kind of waddling,

46:40.120 --> 46:43.320
like wandering over to me, Keith.

46:45.440 --> 46:48.520
And they're all talking at the same time.

46:48.520 --> 46:53.520
Yeah, I just won't destroy our existence.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.360
That was easy.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.640
Old Clark and young Clark are just looking back and forth

46:58.640 --> 47:02.680
between each other and this Keith creature talking.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.560
As the Keiths are popping in,

47:04.560 --> 47:07.200
one of the Keiths grabs the phone

47:07.200 --> 47:09.120
and brings it over to me, Keith.

47:09.120 --> 47:10.440
And I listen to it.

47:11.280 --> 47:13.840
You hear your internal thoughts.

47:13.840 --> 47:17.320
Okay, Ty, just making sure I was in control of this.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.440
How do we get out of here?

47:19.440 --> 47:22.880
So John has, like the ball has been speaking,

47:22.880 --> 47:25.040
just like Planet Juggernaut and the other balls

47:25.040 --> 47:27.800
seem to have this weird capability to speak,

47:27.840 --> 47:28.920
just as John.

47:28.920 --> 47:30.800
And he, when he kind of realizes

47:30.800 --> 47:32.840
that they have a moment to breathe

47:32.840 --> 47:34.720
and he is just this ball,

47:34.720 --> 47:37.720
he just starts like making a mud man of himself

47:37.720 --> 47:40.480
out of the muck, slapping it on himself,

47:40.480 --> 47:43.000
like a kid playing in a pile of mud.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.320
Every time you're reaching in

47:44.320 --> 47:47.120
and grabbing more of this luminous land below,

47:47.120 --> 47:49.840
it like turns into like this oozy muck

47:49.840 --> 47:51.320
as it's forming on you.

47:51.320 --> 47:54.840
But pretty soon it's not just this like clay creature thing.

47:55.080 --> 47:58.880
It's assumed the shape of the John you knew kinda,

47:58.880 --> 48:02.000
although it is entirely the black,

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
like shiny, continually shifting colors.

48:07.800 --> 48:09.560
It's metal Mario, but it's...

48:09.560 --> 48:10.400
Yeah.

48:12.400 --> 48:13.720
And as a final touch,

48:13.720 --> 48:17.200
he gets a little handful of the muck

48:17.200 --> 48:20.400
and you see him rolling it and he throws it on top

48:20.400 --> 48:23.040
and he's wearing a fucking sick cowboy hat.

48:24.840 --> 48:25.680
Yeah.

48:27.400 --> 48:28.640
Hell yes.

48:28.640 --> 48:31.240
In the meantime, you can see some of the myriad,

48:31.240 --> 48:33.800
Keith's like playing patty cake with each other

48:33.800 --> 48:35.960
and doing stuff like that.

48:35.960 --> 48:37.760
They're like looking at each other like...

48:37.760 --> 48:39.040
Some are fighting,

48:39.040 --> 48:40.640
some are very sensually looking at each other.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.040
Do I know you?

48:42.040 --> 48:43.040
And then laughing.

48:44.520 --> 48:47.080
Doing the Spider-Man point here and there.

48:47.080 --> 48:49.880
Doing the Spider-Man Mary Jane kiss with each other.

48:49.880 --> 48:50.840
During this whole time,

48:50.840 --> 48:53.720
are the worms still just slowly descending

48:54.000 --> 48:56.520
all this jovial stuff we're doing?

48:56.520 --> 48:58.760
We got it paused when myriad...

48:58.760 --> 49:01.680
Oh, that didn't have anything to do with the nematode.

49:01.680 --> 49:02.520
No, it didn't.

49:02.520 --> 49:05.320
But I paused it in this moment to just like

49:05.320 --> 49:09.800
let the gravitas hit of everything that's been happening.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.800
But I will go ahead and click start.

49:12.800 --> 49:13.640
Thank you, Justin.

49:13.640 --> 49:15.480
Thank you for reminding the teacher that there was a quiz.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.160
There was a quiz today.

49:18.720 --> 49:19.560
Thank you for reminding me.

49:19.560 --> 49:20.720
Timer has started.

49:20.720 --> 49:21.960
My favorite student.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.280
Two minutes, 50 seconds.

49:24.280 --> 49:27.640
As more myriad continue to pop into this plane,

49:27.640 --> 49:29.560
I close my eyes and think again

49:29.560 --> 49:31.920
and everybody just stops and closes their eyes.

49:34.000 --> 49:34.840
Okay.

49:34.840 --> 49:36.800
Like I unlock the part of the know-how

49:36.800 --> 49:38.200
of destroying the plane.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.040
And I'm like,

49:39.040 --> 49:43.120
maybe if I just condense it into just like a little bit

49:43.120 --> 49:46.160
and not the whole plane and just do it right above me,

49:46.160 --> 49:47.000
I'll do that.

49:47.000 --> 49:47.920
Roll a natural.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.160
Pass.

49:50.200 --> 49:54.520
Describe what happens as Myriad wipes

49:54.520 --> 49:59.520
this entire oceanous ceiling out of this world.

50:00.240 --> 50:03.520
Above everybody is just nothing.

50:04.600 --> 50:07.120
Pure nothing.

50:07.120 --> 50:08.200
Darkness.

50:08.200 --> 50:12.000
And all of Myriad lays down

50:12.000 --> 50:12.840
and starts like,

50:12.840 --> 50:13.680
oh yeah.

50:15.320 --> 50:17.600
So the ground is dark as well?

50:17.640 --> 50:21.240
There's like barely any light in this plane anymore.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.440
And they're just like,

50:27.640 --> 50:30.520
but it's like hundreds of voices saying that

50:30.520 --> 50:31.640
all at the same time.

50:33.640 --> 50:34.800
Nice.

50:34.800 --> 50:35.640
Yeah.

50:35.640 --> 50:36.480
Oh yeah.

50:36.480 --> 50:37.320
Nice.

50:37.320 --> 50:38.760
I'm going to pause the timer

50:38.760 --> 50:43.760
as the current threat of the xenonimitotion

50:44.640 --> 50:46.560
has been dispelled.

50:46.560 --> 50:49.920
Like a handful of little solitary nematodes

50:49.920 --> 50:51.360
are falling down onto the...

50:51.360 --> 50:52.400
In pure darkness?

50:52.400 --> 50:53.320
That's horrifying.

50:53.320 --> 50:54.160
Yeah.

50:54.160 --> 50:55.200
Just like a couple here and there.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.560
Cause I, you know,

50:56.560 --> 50:58.600
there's an inch or two that I didn't get.

51:00.360 --> 51:01.720
And you guys just hear this like,

51:01.720 --> 51:04.320
squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

51:04.320 --> 51:05.800
You just hear a few Keith saying,

51:05.800 --> 51:06.640
ouchie, ouchie.

51:06.640 --> 51:07.480
Ouchie.

51:10.440 --> 51:13.520
So, yeah.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.280
What now guys?

51:15.320 --> 51:17.400
You can just chill with me.

51:18.520 --> 51:19.360
It's pretty nice.

51:19.360 --> 51:20.760
In the total darkness,

51:20.760 --> 51:23.960
you see two lights blink on

51:23.960 --> 51:28.840
and it's Overseer and Young Clark's faces.

51:28.840 --> 51:31.200
They've got this light thing down

51:31.200 --> 51:34.000
and they're illuminating the area around them.

51:34.000 --> 51:34.840
Amazing.

51:34.840 --> 51:37.040
But they are also looking bewildered.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.200
Yeah, that makes sense.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.640
Oh, the Overseer's like,

51:42.640 --> 51:47.400
I fought those guys for centuries.

51:47.400 --> 51:48.240
I don't know.

51:48.240 --> 51:50.680
I've lost track of time doing what I've been doing

51:50.680 --> 51:54.040
and Keith just switched bodies with them.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.040
That was all it took.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.680
That's all I ever needed.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.280
Son of a bitch.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.560
Yeah, we could have done that from the start.

52:02.560 --> 52:05.680
Well, you know, I made them so...

52:05.680 --> 52:08.120
Of course you knew just what to do.

52:08.800 --> 52:13.800
Well, all's well that ends well.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.880
Let's go back home, boys.

52:16.880 --> 52:17.880
Oh, God.

52:17.880 --> 52:18.880
Oh, God.

52:18.880 --> 52:19.880
Oh, God.

52:19.880 --> 52:20.880
Oh, God.

52:20.880 --> 52:21.880
Oh, God.

52:38.120 --> 52:42.240
Bad girls on top of the water

52:42.240 --> 52:46.360
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

52:46.360 --> 52:50.520
Leaving my mind at your altar

52:50.520 --> 52:54.160
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

52:54.160 --> 53:00.160
Tell me what kind of world are you living in

53:00.160 --> 53:08.160
What kind of world are you living in

53:08.160 --> 53:28.160
What kind of world are you living in

53:28.160 --> 53:36.160
What kind of world are you living in

53:36.160 --> 53:42.160
What kind of world are you living in
