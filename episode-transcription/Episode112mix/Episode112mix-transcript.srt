1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Greetings, my great greasy grandchildren.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,520
It's your grease keeper god, Wolf the Dog,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,960
and I'm here to recycle the grease.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,240
I will turn old, dead grease into new, alive grease

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,840
once again by using the purifying properties

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
of my fur hairs.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,720
I am the Greasier.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,400
I am born unto the grease,

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,440
and I will return the world to grease once more.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,480
Also, I'm a radio host for 694.2 PTBP.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
Grease bless this mess.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,080
This week's Howlin' with Wolf was a bit strange.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,880
When I finally stopped greasin' up the joint

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,320
and got behind the mic,

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,080
I noticed an unfamiliar package on my desk,

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,040
shaped like a cassette tape,

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,960
and inside was a cassette tape,

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,120
and that was titled in rainbow-colored marker,

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,800
each letter a rotating, vibrant hue of Roy G. Biv,

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,120
and it read,

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,480
Something has been happenin' to you at night lately,

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,840
by a lie remains a lie,

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,520
and or at countless bats on Twitter.

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,840
There is an eight-foot, hunchbacked, wolf-muscled man

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,560
who opens your window quite gently at night,

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,000
and he climbs in and crouches beside you

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,480
in bed there to watch you.

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,320
He touches your face with his thick-knuckled hands,

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,640
and he opens your mouth,

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,760
and he works out your teeth one by one

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,200
to inspect them, replace them with new ones

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,120
he's lovingly crafted with thick-knuckled hands.

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,520
Terribly, slowly, his face is a factless intent,

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,960
and you ask me why you don't remember this happening,

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,720
and I tell you, you do.

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,880
Oh, you do.

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,760
Heh heh, uh heh heh, uh heh heh.

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,640
Well, uh, thanks from whoever sent that.

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,120
I definitely will be sleepin' just as soundly

40
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,200
as I had previous to listenin'

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,640
to that nice little piece of audio.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,600
It definitely didn't scare the piss out of me

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
from sheer terror.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,520
It's a good thing I have my dog, Wolf, the dog,

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,040
to keep me company and keeping the terror at bay

46
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,160
for yet another night.

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,760
If you wanna send in a strange package

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,000
for Wolf to play on these slick airwaves,

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,880
tag at PretendinPod on the internet,

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,960
or write up a five-star review on the Apple Podcasts.

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm going to start readin' five-star reviews

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,560
live on air here and there,

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,400
so make them snappy, sloppy, and sweet, y'all.

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,320
Now listen to me.

55
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,720
I will click the links in the show notes.

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,320
I will click the links in the show notes.

57
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,920
I will click the links in the show notes.

58
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,760
I will click the links in the show notes.

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,760
Man, if we got old, wouldn't I know

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:15,980
that we're with me today,

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,200
Gigantumbropithecus.

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,000
A Gigantumpropithecanth.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,800
An Umbagumgarbregrath.

64
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,720
Whatever that thing was, it lost its balance

65
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,600
when a clerk bishop blinded the big fucker

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,080
with a bright flash of face light.

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,720
And then the Don Jon AT-ST

68
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,440
casted a wand-focused Devil Hands,

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,560
which, overclocked by the sacrifice of Wheeler Fortjohn,

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,360
demolished the large shadow ape.

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
Planet Juggernaut gracefully turned

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,320
and whipped itself up into the air

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,280
like jumpin' out of a swing,

74
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,440
if the swing warped and dissolved into nothingness

75
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,920
as the booty achieved liftoff.

76
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,320
And the overwhelmingly enormous champion of the scrap pit

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,920
landed directly on top of M-A-R-Y,

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,460
crushin' both her and her hopes

79
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,520
to open this portal to Tildy B. Mitchell,

80
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,920
where Silas Cole had trapped her,

81
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,240
deep below Bean's pond.

82
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,120
Taking us now to the sultry dulcet tones

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
of Mick and Nick Nickles,

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,280
is Draggin' In 3 with What Kinda World Are You Livin' In?

85
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,280
["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,280
["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]

87
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,080
Praise be to Planet Juggernaut,

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,320
the lord and savior of all who have gathered here today,

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
as well as those that exist in other variations

90
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,360
of this plane of contention.

91
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
Praise be, Nick Nickles!

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,400
Praise be, my brother from the exactly same mother.

93
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,980
Planet Juggernaut is here,

94
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,920
for he is our savior no matter the time or place or space.

95
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,760
Praise him!

96
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Praise him all!

97
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,900
Hail Planet Juggernaut, born a virgin and very round.

98
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,180
Rotund Planet Juggernaut is celibate, and that's okay.

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,020
Hail him!

100
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,620
Hail him now, you weak idiots!

101
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,660
I personally will weep at the feet of Planet Juggernaut

102
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,620
and clean his shiny metal foundation.

103
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,660
I am already crying so many of my tears

104
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,500
for our round mound of chrome.

105
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,820
Let us use our tears to wipe away the blood

106
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,700
of all of his enemies off his shiny shoes.

107
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,700
I want his holiness, Planet Juggernaut, to come inside me.

108
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,140
I have sinned so many times in this life,

109
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,380
but Planet Juggernaut has forgiven all of them

110
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,420
and cleansed the many dimensions.

111
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,420
My sins are no longer an issue.

112
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,420
Please do not look at my sins.

113
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,820
Look at Planet Juggernaut.

114
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,940
Let's get him now!

115
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,860
Let's give him a quick talking to a post-game conference

116
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,900
here with Planet Juggernaut.

117
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,020
Planet Juggernaut, how are you feeling after today?

118
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,260
No need to thank me, Mick and Nick.

119
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,700
Just doing what I do best.

120
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,140
That's being a fighter.

121
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,840
Mick, I like your enthusiasm,

122
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,660
but obviously I won't come in you.

123
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,460
Planet Juggernaut, after a performance like today,

124
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,940
what do you think is gonna happen next?

125
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,380
What's next for Planet Juggernaut?

126
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,380
I haven't really thought about it, Mick and Nick.

127
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,020
Might just go for a little spin.

128
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,780
Wow, what a humble hero.

129
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,980
Hey, it's you guys who are the real heroes,

130
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,700
you know what I mean?

131
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,780
Catch you later.

132
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,340
It's like he's the size and shape of an Earth

133
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,100
and he's down to one.

134
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,260
That's just incredible.

135
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,740
I'm glad he finally pointed out

136
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,540
that we're the true heroes here.

137
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,380
This Planet Juggernaut, our Messiah,

138
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,180
has delivered us from both the chaos of the Scrap Pit

139
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,820
and the horrible, unsplikable monsters here in this,

140
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,340
oh, nope, oh gosh, oh Mick.

141
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,660
Oh, Planet Juggernaut.

142
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,500
What's going on, my beautiful brother?

143
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,620
Everybody needs to look up right now

144
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,300
and see this ocean of motion of wormy worm times

145
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,900
coming on down towards us slowly but surely.

146
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,220
Oh, I do not wanna be squished by those bugs.

147
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,500
I don't like looking at the worms, brother.

148
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,020
I don't like looking at them either.

149
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,540
Let's hold each other with our eyes closed.

150
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,540
I'm giving you a big hug.

151
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,380
I'm doing a hug.

152
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,140
Make that sound Justin made, both of you together,

153
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,780
like you're quivering and hugging.

154
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,780
And from below, everyone can see the top half

155
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,620
of Keith Beans up in the sky,

156
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,300
continuing to wriggle as the worms make their way

157
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,300
through his skull and attach themselves to his brain.

158
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,180
Luke, I would like to speak to you.

159
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,020
Alone?

160
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,340
I think that seeing as how we're at the end here,

161
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,820
they can sit in on it. Yeah, that's fine.

162
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Keith Vigna, you are standing at six o'clock

163
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,940
on the face of a watch.

164
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,580
It's a massive, massive watch face,

165
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,380
surrounded on all sides

166
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,780
by an unnaturally wriggling ocean of darkness.

167
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,540
And as these worms begin to consume your brain,

168
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,980
you are somehow unable to die

169
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,220
and therefore your synapses are firing off

170
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,380
and connecting simultaneously to the worms

171
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,860
and across from this massive watch face

172
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,420
that you're standing on at noon,

173
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,940
floating in this endless void,

174
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,460
you see Ferguson Beans, your brother.

175
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,380
He's wearing a white suit.

176
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,220
It fits him like a glove.

177
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,380
It's got a red rose on his lapel.

178
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,340
He looks dapper as he's ever looked.

179
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,140
Aside from the bullet holes in his chest,

180
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,020
blood pouring down,

181
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,180
matching his flowery lapel,

182
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,700
his corsage with the blood

183
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,180
that is now leaking through his white suit.

184
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,820
And when he sees you,

185
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,940
he begins walking slowly

186
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,620
across this massive watch face toward you.

187
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,180
How close is he to me?

188
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,900
Suddenly he's standing right before you

189
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,660
and he falls to his knees, weeping.

190
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,340
Keith.

191
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,340
Keith, I'm so sorry.

192
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,660
I'm sorry, why, what?

193
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,460
Why are you sorry?

194
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,620
They made me, they made me into who I am

195
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,620
and I'm so sorry of the way I treated you.

196
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
Who did?

197
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,660
Bob and Dad.

198
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,780
You were always kind of mean.

199
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,740
They turned me against you at such a young age.

200
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,780
Why did they?

201
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,500
They were trying to make me into something,

202
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,620
something that could handle what was going for all of us.

203
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,780
Well, I'm sorry, but they chose the wrong son.

204
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,540
I'm, I think I saved something.

205
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,980
I'm sorry you had to die for it.

206
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,300
You're kind of like a savior in your own right.

207
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,140
Well, I feel,

208
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,500
I feel like a martyr.

209
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,740
Do martyrs know that they've done something wrong?

210
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,140
Do they all deserve it?

211
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,460
Yes.

212
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,580
I don't know a lot.

213
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,900
So is that the answer you wanted?

214
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,500
And he's just crying.

215
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,340
Keith doesn't know what martyr means.

216
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,860
A murderer, you say?

217
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,620
Is that the one that is half goat?

218
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,460
I just, I never wanted to turn you against,

219
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,340
I didn't know exactly what I was doing.

220
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,500
Our relationship and how important I think it would be

221
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,380
later in life to actually get to know you.

222
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
I was just always jealous of you.

223
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,340
And I still loved you.

224
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,020
I do still love you.

225
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,380
I was, I think about you.

226
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,460
Why did you do it?

227
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,340
To be completely honest, I don't know.

228
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,100
There was some kind of hate in me from a young age

229
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,220
that just lived there.

230
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,620
And I, you know, I didn't realize how much was in me

231
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,500
until an opportunity arose.

232
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,220
Did you get it out?

233
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,980
Did you at least, did you get it all out of your system?

234
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,220
Are you okay now?

235
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,580
I've been better.

236
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,660
Did Fergie just ask him

237
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,260
if he got his hatred out by killing him?

238
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,100
Yeah.

239
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,940
What a guy.

240
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,940
Keith embraces Ferguson and weeps with him.

241
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,420
As we turn away from that scene,

242
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,660
here's what's about to happen.

243
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,380
I am going to set the scene of what's all going on

244
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,340
here in the aftermath of the defeat

245
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,020
of the Gigantum Burpithecus and M-A-R-Y,

246
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,980
as well as the closure of the portal,

247
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,180
which removed the additional threat

248
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,740
and all around rough time of dealing with Tildy B. Mitchell.

249
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,660
And then after I describe what's going on

250
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,060
with the NPCs that are here,

251
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,060
you'll have one D-12 plus four minutes.

252
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,820
I have a handy dandy timer here on the screen

253
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,140
next to Justin's handsome little mug.

254
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,580
Why did I say that?

255
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,380
And when the one D-12 plus four minutes run out,

256
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,380
this ocean made of unimaginably slippery

257
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,140
little pulsating membranes with two sets of sharp teeth

258
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,060
inside each adorable circular mouth

259
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,180
will come crashing down.

260
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,940
And these little guys will latch on

261
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,500
to every last one of you.

262
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,780
So you'll need to figure out how to deal with that

263
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,660
in your allotted time.

264
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,740
But also some people might feel the need to catch up.

265
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,380
And if there's anything else you wanna do or grab or use,

266
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,180
maybe the phone or the broken radio

267
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,180
up at the top of the shadowy building,

268
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,540
the grabbing or using would presumably need to happen

269
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,100
before you each go into your own tiny worm dream hole

270
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,100
for the foreseeable forever of your character.

271
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,100
So let's roll a D-12.

272
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,340
Who wants to do it?

273
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,380
Joe. Joe.

274
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,220
Joe.

275
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,060
Joe.

276
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,900
Joe.

277
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,740
Joe.

278
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,580
All right, sure.

279
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,420
One D-12 plus four.

280
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,460
Don't fuck this up, Joe.

281
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,260
It's a 12.

282
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,340
No, I don't think so.

283
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,980
It's a three.

284
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,020
Oh.

285
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,500
So we got seven minutes.

286
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,140
Fuck.

287
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,980
Seven minutes.

288
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,980
Thomas, did you just roll a one?

289
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,300
Yeah, but I sure did.

290
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,660
You're like, don't worry, I'll save us.

291
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,820
Oh, I thought it was a D-12 plus a D-4.

292
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,220
It's just one D-12 plus four.

293
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,060
Yep.

294
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,020
Thank, okay, cool.

295
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,860
Thank you.

296
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,780
What a kind DM.

297
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,660
Seven minutes is a good amount of time.

298
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,860
Well, let's just pair up and go into the closet.

299
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,260
Oh.

300
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,300
Nice.

301
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,140
I got it.

302
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,980
Time to go to heaven.

303
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,820
Slowly.

304
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,500
A room full of people who are not invited

305
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,660
to play that game.

306
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,980
Hey, yeah, same.

307
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,940
So like, what happens in there?

308
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,060
All right, I'm setting the timer now at seven minutes.

309
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,300
I will click start when I tell you that I'm clicking start.

310
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,780
Click pause really quick.

311
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,940
No timer has happened yet.

312
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,660
So I was a little confused about the order of events here.

313
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,380
We can do whatever we want right now,

314
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,940
and then the seven minutes starts.

315
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,380
No, we can do whatever we want for seven minutes.

316
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,700
Yep, I thought it was gonna be longer,

317
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,660
but we'll have seven minutes out of character

318
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,260
and in character, just seven minutes total

319
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,100
before the worms come down.

320
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,940
So, okay, you're like,

321
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,500
there's a radio at the top of the tower.

322
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,140
Did any of our characters discover that yet?

323
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,980
Keith saw it.

324
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,820
Keith saw it, okay.

325
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,420
I saw what?

326
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,820
Yeah, so, no.

327
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
I didn't hear what you said.

328
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,580
Oh, Don saw it.

329
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,420
Yeah, Don saw it too.

330
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,260
Yeah, what did I see?

331
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,380
The radio.

332
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,860
Oh yeah, I saw the radio and I used the phone,

333
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,540
so I know it's there too.

334
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,660
And I have been positively reinforced by the phone

335
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,540
because I gotta make flurry.

336
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,500
I'm back.

337
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,340
Back in the New York groove.

338
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,660
Now Thomas is gone.

339
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,740
Back in the Maybound town.

340
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,780
Pissing my pants downtown.

341
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,100
Pissing fast, pants are down.

342
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,140
Peeing in my little pants.

343
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,380
Doo, doo, doo, pee in my little pants.

344
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,140
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

345
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,220
I wanna piss my pants.

346
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,060
Pants.

347
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,380
I wanna piss my pants.

348
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,060
Oh, I tell you something.

349
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,900
I wanna piss your pants.

350
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,100
Lie.

351
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,100
All I want is, I wanna piss your pants.

352
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,820
I wanna piss your pants.

353
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,780
Are you peeing on someone else's pants in this?

354
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,060
No, pissing in them.

355
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,180
You don't wanna hold my pants.

356
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,900
And when you piss them, I feel happy.

357
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,540
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

358
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,540
A warm feeling, let that stain.

359
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,300
It can't hurt.

360
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,980
It can't hurt.

361
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,820
It can't hurt.

362
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,460
What about Dave Matthews band, Piss?

363
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,740
Piss into me.

364
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,260
Piss into me.

365
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,580
Hey, we do something with making my way downtown yet?

366
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,420
Yeah.

367
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,580
Are you ready?

368
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,860
Oh, are you ready?

369
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,780
Absolutely not, this is crazy.

370
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,380
Yeah, I definitely thought this was happening

371
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,220
tomorrow night.

372
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,100
The Luminous Land Liturgy,

373
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,420
which includes Drew Andrews, Councilwoman Carrie Pages,

374
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,220
Gary Daley, Mildred Mitchell, Clara Blankenship,

375
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,220
Casey Kristoff, Everett Pace, Jack Perlman,

376
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,580
Greer Hilfintop, Kermonkernau, the saloon bartender

377
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,220
and piano player, as well as a gambler named Thomas,

378
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,220
along with myriad animals,

379
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,700
either held, perched, or healing.

380
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,500
Keith, you see, Bean is running happily, tongue akimbo,

381
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,340
and this entire group continues to bob and weave

382
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,780
in a ceaseless musical number

383
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,780
at the unnatural direction of the overseer,

384
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,220
though their voices quiet down to an eerie whisper

385
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,260
as they dart around uncontrollably.

386
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,780
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.

387
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,260
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.

388
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,700
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.

389
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,740
Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.

390
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,820
The myriad begin to speak in unison.

391
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,820
We appreciate the efforts of subject 1522518195518,

392
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,060
your attempt to destroy the countless alternative timelines.

393
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,780
It garners our respect.

394
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,780
However, plane 1620216 still has far too many variants.

395
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,180
It is unstable.

396
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,140
We have decided it is best to just shut it down

397
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,900
and try again.

398
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,340
For your own safety, please stay here.

399
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,540
We will repeat ourselves one more time,

400
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,340
fearing you either did not listen or did not hear.

401
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,340
For your own safety, please stay here.

402
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,100
And with that, this myriad of lanky skin,

403
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,380
thin, thin-skinned, thin-skinned creatures

404
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,420
in black suits just pops out of this existence.

405
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,100
You have seven minutes until the horrible ocean

406
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,660
of little mouths and huge worms drowns everyone

407
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,660
in the endless isolation of their own unsound minds,

408
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,980
starting with the last one.

409
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,980
Starting now.

410
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,820
What was the number that the overseer,

411
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,860
that the myriad referred to this plane as?

412
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,020
I've translated it before, he's given it to us before.

413
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,860
It's PTBP.

414
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,060
Nice.

415
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,020
Glad I didn't spend seven minutes on that.

416
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,220
Overseer wants to yell to the masses,

417
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,780
I think I can send you back.

418
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,980
You don't have to stay here,

419
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,300
but I can get you back to your own places.

420
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,220
And he wants to try that.

421
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,380
He wants to look at Clark, make eye contact with him

422
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,060
and the plan is to create portals

423
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,100
that send them back to their timelines, not to ours.

424
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,260
The overseer.

425
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,300
Okay.

426
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,700
When you say theirs, not ours.

427
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Can you pause the time while you think?

428
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,460
Those creatures just said that they can't stay in here

429
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,660
because there's too many vectors.

430
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,460
They can't stay in the PTBP plane or whatever.

431
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,620
So I was gonna send them to other,

432
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,300
where they got plucked from.

433
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,540
So the Old West guys go back to the Old West.

434
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,700
Go ahead and roll a natural real quick for the overseer.

435
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,900
69.

436
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,460
It's a 69.

437
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,300
Wow.

438
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,140
Fuck.

439
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,420
It's a straight 69.

440
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,620
That's the best 69 I could've rolled.

441
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,460
Holy shit, really?

442
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,300
I could've rolled.

443
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,860
Amazing.

444
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,340
It just keeps happening.

445
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,740
Okay, so in this moment,

446
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,860
you know that the plane 1620216

447
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,660
that Myriad is talking about

448
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,700
is the entire existence of your world.

449
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,460
And so there are many different infinite variations

450
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,700
on that world that are all considered

451
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,860
to be plane 1620216.

452
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,620
However, with a 69,

453
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,500
I am going to change the entire idea

454
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,460
that I had and allow the overseer

455
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,580
who has dedicated his entire life

456
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,140
to jumping between these little planes

457
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,860
that exist all over 1620216.

458
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,260
He has the ability now to send

459
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,500
each of these Luminous Land Liturgy members

460
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,900
to their respective existences

461
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,500
wherever they happen to come from.

462
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,180
However, based on what Myriad has told you,

463
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,340
they plan to shut down that entire plane.

464
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,540
So you can send those people

465
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,260
to go end their lives wherever they belong,

466
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,020
but that is essentially what you will be doing.

467
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,180
I wish we hadn't started the seven minutes yet.

468
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,340
We're like halfway.

469
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,540
I could send everybody back

470
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,820
and then take the fight to Myriad.

471
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,820
Keith feels himself dying above him somehow.

472
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,100
And he realizes he's like,

473
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,060
I'm gonna die again.

474
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm gonna die here.

475
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,940
And he looks around and he sees the people

476
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,020
that he's gotten into this mess with

477
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,320
and he just yells,

478
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,740
Drew, Drew, Drew.

479
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,580
Where's Drew at?

480
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,620
He's chanting, he's whispering,

481
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,700
Sha-ka-tay.

482
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,660
But in the voice of Councilwoman Carrie Pages.

483
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,940
Keith goes up and grabs Drew.

484
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,740
Is the Councilwoman here too?

485
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,900
The body of Councilwoman Carrie Pages

486
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
has Drew Andrews inside of it

487
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,300
and the body of Drew Pages,

488
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,340
Drew Andrews has Councilwoman Carrie Pages inside of it.

489
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,940
I could just go grab both of them.

490
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,780
Follow me.

491
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,700
They are very much,

492
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,460
I grab them by the ears and pull them

493
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,920
and run towards the castle thing.

494
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,760
Okay.

495
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,900
They are still chanting

496
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,860
and desperately want to get away from you,

497
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,460
but in that moment,

498
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,140
the overseer has the option to release them

499
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,260
from their bind.

500
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,660
Clark.

501
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,780
He drops,

502
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,720
he knows that for them to get anywhere,

503
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,820
we have to drop this spell.

504
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,100
So yeah, he drops it.

505
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,660
Okay, completely for everyone?

506
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,140
Uh, no, just those two for now.

507
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,620
He needs the power that he can keep.

508
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,460
Yeah, okay.

509
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,860
So then immediately you're getting like a,

510
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,940
oh my God, oh my gosh.

511
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,860
Why, what is going,

512
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,940
what is going on here?

513
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,760
Drew, Drew.

514
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,600
No, I'm Carrie.

515
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,260
Carrie, Drew and Carrie.

516
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,100
Yes.

517
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,940
We're gonna die.

518
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,760
Drew here.

519
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,600
We're gonna die.

520
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,420
Yes.

521
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,260
And if I'm gonna die,

522
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,280
I wanna die with Drew and Drew's body.

523
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,740
Let's get you switched.

524
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,580
Okay.

525
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,420
Follow me.

526
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,240
Come on, run.

527
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,080
And they run after you.

528
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,900
We have 90 seconds left.

529
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,740
So they're running.

530
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,820
What are you, the other two doing?

531
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,020
Can Clark, by time,

532
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,300
can he try and do a spell that pushes the ceiling back?

533
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,120
Yes.

534
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,300
Go ahead and roll a natural.

535
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,580
60.

536
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,520
Passes both Clark and the Overseer.

537
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,780
Give me some sort of a magical chance here.

538
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,860
Both Clarks look up in the sky

539
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,580
and because they're kind of linked now,

540
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,940
they both know what's going on

541
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,300
and they put both their hands up

542
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,220
and they start chanting.

543
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,900
R-S-T-L-N-E.

544
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,900
R-S-T-L-N-E.

545
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,060
Fuck yeah.

546
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,420
And I am clicking pause on the timer at 30 seconds.

547
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,380
They love goosebumps.

548
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,100
Why aren't we paused?

549
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,540
Because of the spell.

550
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,860
You would be seeing how much we bought

551
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,300
or is it just pause paused?

552
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:41,120
Go ahead and roll another d12 by itself.

553
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,580
Four.

554
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,420
Four.

555
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,240
Four more.

556
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,340
Beautiful.

557
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,580
Well now we have, it just seems like almost too much time.

558
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,240
And with four minutes and 30 seconds left.

559
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,640
Oh shit.

560
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,880
So we've got a John and a Planet Juggernaut still in play.

561
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,800
That is correct.

562
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,620
So Planet Juggernaut just shoots up into the air

563
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,560
and opens its giant Pac-Man mouth

564
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,840
and starts eating Xenonibatodes like the fucking krill.

565
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,160
And John is gonna pitch in and try to help the Overseer

566
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,400
and he might even start throwing chunks of the muck world

567
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,400
up as like flak pieces towards the Xenonibatodes

568
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,040
trying to blast maybe even a hole

569
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,320
just above us in the circle.

570
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,140
Cool.

571
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,980
Super dope.

572
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,600
If it's not bottomless and endless forever and ever.

573
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,440
Worms.

574
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,360
Amen.

575
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,700
Thomas, go ahead and roll a d100.

576
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,720
91.

577
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,960
Well, that's not gonna do it.

578
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,520
He eats 91 Xenonibatodes.

579
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,080
That's a good number.

580
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,920
You do what?

581
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,200
You gotta tell me what I'm rolling for

582
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,680
so I can tent the dice.

583
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,520
Yeah, he can pray.

584
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,760
Go ahead and roll a natural for John.

585
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,660
John Ball.

586
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
That's a failure.

587
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,520
That's an 85 on a 67.

588
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,160
Oh no.

589
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,040
Okay, unable.

590
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,920
So cutting to the top of the tower, we've got a dark room.

591
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,040
It is pitch black.

592
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Keith Vigna is running in with Councilwoman Kerry Pages

593
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,600
and Drew Andrews and he makes it to this very,

594
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,520
very dark room at the top of the shadowy tower.

595
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,680
He starts to feel really calm.

596
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,000
And he's getting real sleepy and warm.

597
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,000
Yep.

598
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,800
And he realizes what's happening to him

599
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,640
and he looks at Drew.

600
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,800
You gotta do it, buddy.

601
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,200
And then he lays down on the ground.

602
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,400
I gotta do what?

603
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,240
I gotta do what?

604
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,160
Bubblegum tree, bubblegum tree, what am I supposed to do?

605
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,440
The radio, that's how the cat switched.

606
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
I can't see anything.

607
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,840
Yeah, I can't see anything in here either.

608
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,560
Who do you think is at fault?

609
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,920
That's super nice.

610
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,640
And Drew Andrews and Kerry Pages

611
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,920
are just arguing back and forth and confused.

612
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,280
They begin to start feeling all over the room,

613
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,960
trying to find anything in the room.

614
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,280
And Drew immediately finds the radio.

615
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,160
Kerry can't find anything, but Drew's like,

616
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,280
I think I have it.

617
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,440
I'm almost positive that I have it, sir.

618
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,280
Do it.

619
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,120
Do what?

620
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,240
Press some buttons on it and get it working.

621
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,120
I don't, I'm feeling around.

622
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,240
The goo, get some goo or something.

623
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,040
Get some goo?

624
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Or just lay down and chill.

625
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,480
30 seconds.

626
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,120
Okay, Keith, I roll a D100.

627
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,880
If you can roll under 30,

628
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,800
I'll let Drew get out of this room with this thing.

629
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,840
32.

630
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,480
Fuck.

631
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,000
We just need to get out of here before the sea falls.

632
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,400
So Overseer's just doing a giant portal

633
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,760
under the ground of all of us

634
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,560
and just dropping us into wherever.

635
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,440
If that doesn't work,

636
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,760
John asks the nematodes politely to stop.

637
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Okay.

638
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Okay, so I've paused it at one second left on this timer.

639
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,240
He did hit it exactly when there was one second left

640
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
on the timer.

641
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,560
Which was right after Joe said he opened the portal,

642
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,400
which was pretty dope.

643
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,200
So let's go ahead and get that roll off time

644
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,080
of dropping this world down.

645
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,640
It's a pass, 52.

646
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,760
Okay, roll a D12.

647
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,000
Two.

648
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,600
No!

649
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,360
Two minutes starting, meow.

650
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,800
And so the whole entire floor,

651
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,800
this lit land all over everywhere that you can see just,

652
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,280
oh, would it be cooler if,

653
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,880
yeah, it'd be cooler if there were walls.

654
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,000
It'd be cool if the two minutes start after

655
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,200
you say all this shit. Shut the fuck up, dude.

656
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,240
I hate it when you're right, it's stupid.

657
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,880
You're like, hold on, give me a couple minutes

658
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,720
to come up with a cool description.

659
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,880
Hold on, guys, it's gonna be cooler.

660
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
Two minutes.

661
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,880
Do you want to describe what happens?

662
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,080
I was just picturing that he encompassed

663
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,720
every piece of land that is occupied by people now.

664
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,840
So it includes the tower, I think.

665
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,320
And then my chanters and wherever Juggernaut is

666
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,320
and John Ball and Don.

667
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,400
And it's a perfect circle around all of that

668
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,440
that just drops down, leaving giant white walls

669
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,480
all around us in a giant circle.

670
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,960
It's so bright in here.

671
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,520
Yeah, it's very bright in here.

672
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,240
Is it bright in the room now?

673
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,080
Yes.

674
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
That's what I meant to do, for sure.

675
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,120
Wake you up.

676
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,160
And the timer starts now.

677
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,680
Drew Andrews grabs onto the radio

678
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,320
and the rest of you outside see him

679
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,960
running out the front door.

680
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,640
Councilwoman Carrie pages his body,

681
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,320
sprinting out across the land toward you,

682
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,920
holding this broken radio.

683
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,720
And Keith, I'm following behind, running after him.

684
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,160
And I'm going, fuck!

685
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,160
I wanted to die in peace!

686
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,040
Don.

687
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,160
Don starts chanting,

688
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Vis-a-girl, Vis-a-girl, Vis-a-girl.

689
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,440
And he's hoping to rewind some fucking time.

690
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,720
Roll Unnatural for me, please.

691
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,600
Oh no, I thought since it was cool,

692
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,840
you'd just let me do it.

693
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,320
52 on 70.

694
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,160
Yeah.

695
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,080
Yes, you look over and what do you see?

696
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,840
You look over and where you had expected

697
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,920
to maybe see your brother, nephew chanting with you

698
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,440
and aiding you once again,

699
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,480
you see a cartoonishly crisp black skeleton

700
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,200
where this John Lee Kevin Moore used to be.

701
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,560
And you can tell all of them went into that last spell

702
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,680
that you cast against the Gigantopyrthicus.

703
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,640
There is a charred one inch in diameter sphere

704
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,920
sitting on the ground in between you

705
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,280
and your brother and nephew.

706
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,400
And you have all of the strength in this moment to just.

707
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Just purr-gossive, purr-gossive, purr-gossive.

708
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,640
Push back time.

709
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,480
I think you see tears coming down from Don's face

710
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,280
whenever he sees the charred corpse.

711
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,000
And then they start like, before they hit the ground,

712
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,960
they start coming back into his tear ducts.

713
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,080
That's so cool.

714
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,520
That's fucking awesome.

715
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm gonna put seven minutes back on the clock.

716
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,040
The original time that you had

717
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,320
immediately after Myria disappeared.

718
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,440
And you are reset exactly where you were.

719
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,000
Everything moves in reverse.

720
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,440
The floor moves all the way back up

721
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,080
and becomes level with the ground around it.

722
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,440
The tower is dark once again,

723
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,280
but Keith runs backwards.

724
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,680
Drew Andrews and Carrie.

725
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,200
The chief leacher for the overseer.

726
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,880
And begin whispering once again.

727
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,840
And the seven minutes starts right now.

728
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,040
Kevin Lee John Moore sees you guys

729
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,240
back in your original places.

730
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,240
He shouts, he shouts, overseer, floor, Keith, radio.

731
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,560
And then he shouts, juggernaut, get him.

732
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,840
And juggernaut wants to try to do it again.

733
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,360
Yeah, while this is happening,

734
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,680
Keith gets his phone out of his pocket,

735
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,000
turns the light on and runs to the tower.

736
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,920
And overseer's dropping the floor again.

737
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,320
Just give us some light in this area.

738
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,160
Okay.

739
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,000
And more time again.

740
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,120
Oh yeah, and I'll do the spell.

741
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,040
I'll do both.

742
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,880
Okay, go ahead and roll.

743
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,620
Back to back on natural rolls.

744
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,080
One of them doesn't work.

745
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,920
Okay.

746
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
The other one does.

747
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
32, so I'm gonna do the floor.

748
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,060
Okay, so you're able to drop the floor down.

749
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,320
Go ahead and roll a D12.

750
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,480
10.

751
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Oh!

752
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,320
Nice!

753
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,160
Nice!

754
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,960
That's some juicy time!

755
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,920
All right, and 16 minutes begins.

756
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,600
Boom, the floor drops down once again,

757
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,120
illuminating the entirety of this cylinder

758
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,840
that you've trapped yourselves in,

759
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,380
much like the cylinder that the Gigantum Rapithecus

760
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,360
was trapped in when you arrived.

761
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,520
The difference in the time that we just did,

762
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,040
he drops it so much further down than he did last time.

763
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,480
Yeah, oh my god.

764
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,200
Literal tower of terror shit.

765
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,040
Yeah.

766
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,600
He created an elevator.

767
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,000
Planet Juggernaut, please go ahead and roll

768
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,480
some form of athletics or dexterity,

769
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,320
which we'll call a 70%.

770
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,400
93.

771
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,240
Damn!

772
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,840
93 worms down.

773
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,440
Planet Juggernaut jumps up.

774
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,920
That's two worse than the last time.

775
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,360
Once again, and just like biting for the sky.

776
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,400
The ground drops out from under your feet

777
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,480
as you're trying to jump,

778
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,920
and you just can't quite reach.

779
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,760
And then you fall so far down into this long cylinder

780
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,680
into the bottom, much like a can of beans

781
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,000
that you're now one of these many, many baked fellas

782
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,680
down at the bottom of this saucy, saucy barrel.

783
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,880
Keith Vigna.

784
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,360
He runs to the radio,

785
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,400
and he wants to go grab the phone as well,

786
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,200
and then run back to the Drew crowd.

787
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,800
Okay, go ahead and roll strength or dexterity

788
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,040
or athletics.

789
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,680
Carrying a large old radio and a rotary phone

790
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,920
is difficult business.

791
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,400
I dropped the radio.

792
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,920
You hold onto the phone?

793
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,760
Yeah.

794
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,600
Okay, you can choose.

795
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,640
Well, I've got both in my hands,

796
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,520
and as I like take off,

797
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,200
I have the receiver of the phone in my hand,

798
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,200
but like the base of it is still just sitting there,

799
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,240
and I run and the cord jerks me,

800
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,920
and I drop the radio,

801
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,080
and it's like sitting busted on the ground,

802
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,200
and I grab the base of the phone and start running

803
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,000
and seeing if I can hear anything in the receiver.

804
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,880
Hello, hello, hello.

805
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,840
Hello, hello, hello.

806
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,400
Hello, hello, hello.

807
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,840
Shabababee, shabadoo, shababee.

808
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,280
Go ahead and roll a natural.

809
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,280
You have absolutely no idea.

810
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,400
Oh, damn.

811
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,240
How'd it connect?

812
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,320
He rolled really high.

813
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,000
89 or 89?

814
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,840
I have a 79, so that sucks.

815
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,920
Oh, damn.

816
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,520
Yeah, I'm still running back to the crowd,

817
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
just gibberishing into the...

818
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,220
You have time to go back for the radio.

819
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,720
We've got so much time now.

820
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,420
Like, we could take real life poop breaks.

821
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,260
Like...

822
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,000
Shabababee, shabababee.

823
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,040
And I'm, yeah, I'm just standing there,

824
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,800
looking at the radio, talking gibberish into the phone,

825
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
trying to think, what the fuck am I gonna do?

826
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,640
Young Clark remembers that he had a vision a long time ago

827
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,240
about the Overseer in a dark room lit by a candle,

828
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,280
and he looks back at that tower

829
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
and sees that that's what that was.

830
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,440
And he yells up, do you know anything about the phone?

831
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,600
Can we use that?

832
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,520
And as you talk to yourself,

833
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,160
you know that you've used the phone once or twice.

834
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,400
However, each time that you've used it,

835
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,000
they have found you on your next time

836
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,180
going into a myriad different forms of existence

837
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,280
that you're popping in to try to save

838
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,640
each of these towns of contention.

839
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,500
And an impossible task the Overseer has placed upon himself,

840
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,940
but he does not like being chased,

841
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,240
and every single time he is going

842
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,940
and fucking with time and existence,

843
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,620
he is being chased by these tall, gaunt men.

844
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,580
I mean, I don't know, in character or out of character,

845
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,460
the point is we have to get out of here.

846
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,300
Once we get out of here,

847
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,220
we might have more time out wherever we end up, right?

848
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,820
It's just the sea that's collapsing on us

849
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,620
that's giving this time requirement, right?

850
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:40,700
Yeah, and just the words of myriad ring in your head,

851
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,920
for your own safety, please stay here.

852
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,700
And you know, in Clark's mind and the Overseer's mind,

853
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,420
the Overseer has been able to make jumps

854
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,820
into plane 1620216,

855
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,060
a plane that he is from and familiar with.

856
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,580
He has been unable or scared to jump to a different plane.

857
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,460
Can I, quote unquote, Clark Young,

858
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,860
help him and convince him?

859
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,580
We gotta try, we gotta get somewhere else.

860
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,900
You got more juice here than you've ever had before, right?

861
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,220
This hasn't happened before.

862
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,540
This has to be all new to you, and I'm here now.

863
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,460
We can go to another one.

864
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,420
We don't have to be in this one.

865
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,860
Hey, could he send them to another one?

866
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,500
And John points up.

867
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,740
Clark, young Clark, wide-eyed, just looking at Overseer.

868
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,600
Yeah, yeah, we already stopped him for a minute.

869
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,580
We can do something to him.

870
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,960
We can send them not here.

871
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,220
The Overseer's wide-eyed begins nodding.

872
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,020
Is it as easy as using that telephone?

873
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,900
Wait, hang on though.

874
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,640
The reason we were gonna get out of this plane

875
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,540
was because they were gonna destroy it.

876
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,220
They were saying it's gonna be purged

877
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,300
or whatever they said.

878
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,500
That's every existence that you have ever known

879
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,860
in all of the different forms of you that have ever known.

880
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,900
It's that whole plane.

881
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,380
On PTBP plane.

882
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,260
But that's, so my original thing was,

883
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,460
let's go to a new plane.

884
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,660
Yep, 100%.

885
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,420
So let's get us out of here instead of the nematodes.

886
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,140
Sure, yeah.

887
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,120
Thought it would be nice to save our world.

888
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,260
It's all homey.

889
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,460
Yeah.

890
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,020
But I guess it's better to save the 13 people here

891
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:23,020
instead of our entire plane of existence.

892
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,220
I mean, that's 100% a good point.

893
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,580
Wait, but Myriad now is gonna destroy it.

894
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,460
Anyway, this whole plane, everybody in it, not just us.

895
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,540
All that.

896
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,100
Keith, didn't you make Myriad?

897
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,780
I can't hear you, I'm too far away.

898
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,800
Keith is on the phone, he's like, fuck.

899
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,560
And he just throws the phone down, grabs the radio

900
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,840
and starts running back.

901
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,960
Did he want to be say my name?

902
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Yeah, didn't you make Myriad?

903
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,000
Probably.

904
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,920
Well then make Myriad not do this.

905
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,240
Stop!

906
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,220
Just screaming futilely at the heavens.

907
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,680
The wormy wormy heavens.

908
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,480
I'm your dad.

909
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,320
I made you.

910
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,080
Stop!

911
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,920
I get it Myriad, he is a shit father, a terrible creator.

912
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,280
I hate him, I hate that he's my god and daddy,

913
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,360
but he made me too.

914
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,520
Why don't you just stop with all this foolishness

915
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,240
and just come on back down to this plane here.

916
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,080
Go to your room.

917
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,680
And we've got roughly six minutes to talk about it

918
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,680
before you have to destroy the place.

919
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,200
Last time you were here, I think,

920
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,080
actually we had a lot less time maybe

921
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,800
and you just like, you were boogying,

922
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,720
but we've got more time now.

923
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,080
Brother, Myriad?

924
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,000
Roll Persuade.

925
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,360
47 on a 60.

926
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,360
A single, tall, gaunt, translucent skinned creature

927
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,320
appears in between you, Keith,

928
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,240
and the phone that has fallen on the ground.

929
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,640
I knew they'd listen to me.

930
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,920
And which one are you?

931
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,680
Hello, we are Myriad.

932
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,320
What's your name though?

933
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,200
You.

934
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,520
I am Myriad.

935
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,200
Myriad, could you not blow up, what was it?

936
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,240
1620216.

937
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Plane 1020216 still has far too many variants.

938
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,680
It is unstable.

939
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,600
We'll take care of that, just give us some time.

940
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,760
We can fix that.

941
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,600
We're working on it.

942
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,800
We're getting rid of some of the variants.

943
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,720
You've been working against me all this time.

944
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,240
We finally did what I needed to do,

945
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,520
now we can work together.

946
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,360
And if you destroy this plane, I would have never made you,

947
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,360
and so you'll stop existing too.

948
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,080
But then this plane will have never ceased to exist,

949
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,200
and then you'll just have to do this all over again.

950
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,800
It's gonna hurt to think about, so just don't do it.

951
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,880
It's all timey-wimey, unless you don't destroy this shit.

952
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,080
These are compelling arguments.

953
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,760
And I'm your dad.

954
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,520
And I'm your brother, ball.

955
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,760
I guess I'm like an uncle, maybe?

956
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,600
I don't know how it works for me, but.

957
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,000
I think of you as an uncle.

958
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,720
He's a very close family friend,

959
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,120
and we've raised you to call him uncle.

960
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,640
Keith is like talking with his hands,

961
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,800
and he is slapping the radio

962
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,960
while he was screaming at his sons.

963
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,840
Yeah, and you see the ooze that's dripping

964
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,600
from the John ball, and you think,

965
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,840
oh, if I could get some of that,

966
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,480
I could probably get this thing going.

967
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,200
Oh shit, does that just need some ooze?

968
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,000
Well, I need some radio juice.

969
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,280
Some just shoots out of John's index finger

970
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
straight into the.

971
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,040
I'm so glad you said index finger.

972
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,640
Which is what he calls his penis.

973
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,320
And Keith has a bright idea,

974
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,800
puts his hand on the shoulder of the myriad thing,

975
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
and flips the switch on the radio.

976
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,840
Oh my God.

977
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,720
Oh fuck.

978
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,040
Oh my God.

979
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,160
You gonna pause that, Zach?

980
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,840
Pause.

981
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,600
Pause.

982
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,440
An energy erupts as the brightest flash of light,

983
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,160
it makes the surrounding bright walls

984
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,920
of this cylinder that you've fallen into look dark,

985
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,520
because the light that is flashing

986
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,640
from this radio in this moment is so bright,

987
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,480
you are all completely engulfed.

988
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,200
And when the world kind of comes back

989
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,480
and you can see what's happened,

990
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,920
Keith Vigna has switched bodies with this creature.

991
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,760
And Keith, you have this crazy fucking sense in your head,

992
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,800
like you are tied into an entire network of individuals,

993
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,640
creatures that all work on the same sort of.

994
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,440
My dude, not individuals, not creatures, Keiths.

995
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,280
Keiths.

996
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,840
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck.

997
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,320
It's a whole thing of Keiths.

998
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,160
We're all fucked.

999
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,040
I mean, the body of Keith Vigna is looking around

1000
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,880
and touching its skin.

1001
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,480
Yeah, a high find has just been thrown

1002
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,920
into the body of Keith.

1003
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,920
It's trying to understand its own singularity.

1004
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,840
It's like playing co-op.

1005
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,040
It's like walking like that.

1006
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:43,200
Keith, with the entire hive mind that watches over time

1007
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,920
and the universe at your disposal.

1008
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,600
The Keithers of the universe.

1009
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,040
The Keithers.

1010
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,240
Keiths shut their eyes and think real hard.

1011
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,400
Keiths shut eyes, think real hard.

1012
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,400
Fuck, I don't know what to do.

1013
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,640
I can do pretty much anything,

1014
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,000
cause I'm a myriad, right?

1015
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,280
Just like I expected.

1016
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,480
Let me read this long thing that I wrote.

1017
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,360
Or when you did this.

1018
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, Keiths, he shuts their eyes for a second.

1019
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,880
Oh, I just won't do it.

1020
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,680
I just won't destroy the plane.

1021
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,520
What do you mean you won't?

1022
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,480
I just won't do what they were gonna do.

1023
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,200
You're, hold on.

1024
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,040
I'm probably, are you?

1025
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,000
It's Keith.

1026
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,360
What?

1027
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,960
We are Keith.

1028
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,600
Keiths just start popping up everywhere

1029
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,120
and just kind of waddling,

1030
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,320
like wandering over to me, Keith.

1031
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,520
And they're all talking at the same time.

1032
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,520
Yeah, I just won't destroy our existence.

1033
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,360
That was easy.

1034
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,640
Old Clark and young Clark are just looking back and forth

1035
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,680
between each other and this Keith creature talking.

1036
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,560
As the Keiths are popping in,

1037
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,200
one of the Keiths grabs the phone

1038
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,120
and brings it over to me, Keith.

1039
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,440
And I listen to it.

1040
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,840
You hear your internal thoughts.

1041
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,320
Okay, Ty, just making sure I was in control of this.

1042
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,440
How do we get out of here?

1043
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,880
So John has, like the ball has been speaking,

1044
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,040
just like Planet Juggernaut and the other balls

1045
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,800
seem to have this weird capability to speak,

1046
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,920
just as John.

1047
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,800
And he, when he kind of realizes

1048
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,840
that they have a moment to breathe

1049
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,720
and he is just this ball,

1050
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,720
he just starts like making a mud man of himself

1051
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,480
out of the muck, slapping it on himself,

1052
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,000
like a kid playing in a pile of mud.

1053
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,320
Every time you're reaching in

1054
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,120
and grabbing more of this luminous land below,

1055
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,840
it like turns into like this oozy muck

1056
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,320
as it's forming on you.

1057
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,840
But pretty soon it's not just this like clay creature thing.

1058
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,880
It's assumed the shape of the John you knew kinda,

1059
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,000
although it is entirely the black,

1060
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
like shiny, continually shifting colors.

1061
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,560
It's metal Mario, but it's...

1062
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,400
Yeah.

1063
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,720
And as a final touch,

1064
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,200
he gets a little handful of the muck

1065
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,400
and you see him rolling it and he throws it on top

1066
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,040
and he's wearing a fucking sick cowboy hat.

1067
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,680
Yeah.

1068
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,640
Hell yes.

1069
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,240
In the meantime, you can see some of the myriad,

1070
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,800
Keith's like playing patty cake with each other

1071
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,960
and doing stuff like that.

1072
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,760
They're like looking at each other like...

1073
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,040
Some are fighting,

1074
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,640
some are very sensually looking at each other.

1075
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,040
Do I know you?

1076
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,040
And then laughing.

1077
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,080
Doing the Spider-Man point here and there.

1078
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,880
Doing the Spider-Man Mary Jane kiss with each other.

1079
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,840
During this whole time,

1080
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,720
are the worms still just slowly descending

1081
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,520
all this jovial stuff we're doing?

1082
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,760
We got it paused when myriad...

1083
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,680
Oh, that didn't have anything to do with the nematode.

1084
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,520
No, it didn't.

1085
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,320
But I paused it in this moment to just like

1086
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,800
let the gravitas hit of everything that's been happening.

1087
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,800
But I will go ahead and click start.

1088
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,640
Thank you, Justin.

1089
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,480
Thank you for reminding the teacher that there was a quiz.

1090
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,160
There was a quiz today.

1091
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,560
Thank you for reminding me.

1092
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,720
Timer has started.

1093
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,960
My favorite student.

1094
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,280
Two minutes, 50 seconds.

1095
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,640
As more myriad continue to pop into this plane,

1096
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,560
I close my eyes and think again

1097
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,920
and everybody just stops and closes their eyes.

1098
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,840
Okay.

1099
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,800
Like I unlock the part of the know-how

1100
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,200
of destroying the plane.

1101
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,040
And I'm like,

1102
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,120
maybe if I just condense it into just like a little bit

1103
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,160
and not the whole plane and just do it right above me,

1104
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,000
I'll do that.

1105
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,920
Roll a natural.

1106
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,160
Pass.

1107
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,520
Describe what happens as Myriad wipes

1108
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,520
this entire oceanous ceiling out of this world.

1109
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,520
Above everybody is just nothing.

1110
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,120
Pure nothing.

1111
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,200
Darkness.

1112
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,000
And all of Myriad lays down

1113
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,840
and starts like,

1114
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,680
oh yeah.

1115
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,600
So the ground is dark as well?

1116
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,240
There's like barely any light in this plane anymore.

1117
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,440
And they're just like,

1118
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,520
but it's like hundreds of voices saying that

1119
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,640
all at the same time.

1120
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,800
Nice.

1121
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,640
Yeah.

1122
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,480
Oh yeah.

1123
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,320
Nice.

1124
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,760
I'm going to pause the timer

1125
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,760
as the current threat of the xenonimitotion

1126
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,560
has been dispelled.

1127
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,920
Like a handful of little solitary nematodes

1128
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,360
are falling down onto the...

1129
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,400
In pure darkness?

1130
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,320
That's horrifying.

1131
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,160
Yeah.

1132
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,200
Just like a couple here and there.

1133
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,560
Cause I, you know,

1134
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,600
there's an inch or two that I didn't get.

1135
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,720
And you guys just hear this like,

1136
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,320
squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

1137
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,800
You just hear a few Keith saying,

1138
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,640
ouchie, ouchie.

1139
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,480
Ouchie.

1140
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,520
So, yeah.

1141
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,280
What now guys?

1142
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,400
You can just chill with me.

1143
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,360
It's pretty nice.

1144
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,760
In the total darkness,

1145
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,960
you see two lights blink on

1146
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,840
and it's Overseer and Young Clark's faces.

1147
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,200
They've got this light thing down

1148
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,000
and they're illuminating the area around them.

1149
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,840
Amazing.

1150
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,040
But they are also looking bewildered.

1151
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,200
Yeah, that makes sense.

1152
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,640
Oh, the Overseer's like,

1153
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,400
I fought those guys for centuries.

1154
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,240
I don't know.

1155
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,680
I've lost track of time doing what I've been doing

1156
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,040
and Keith just switched bodies with them.

1157
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
That was all it took.

1158
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,680
That's all I ever needed.

1159
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,280
Son of a bitch.

1160
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,560
Yeah, we could have done that from the start.

1161
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,680
Well, you know, I made them so...

1162
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,120
Of course you knew just what to do.

1163
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,800
Well, all's well that ends well.

1164
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,880
Let's go back home, boys.

1165
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,880
Oh, God.

1166
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,880
Oh, God.

1167
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,880
Oh, God.

1168
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,880
Oh, God.

1169
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,880
Oh, God.

1170
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,240
Bad girls on top of the water

1171
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,360
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

1172
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,520
Leaving my mind at your altar

1173
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,160
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

1174
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,160
Tell me what kind of world are you living in

1175
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:08,160
What kind of world are you living in

1176
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:28,160
What kind of world are you living in

1177
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:36,160
What kind of world are you living in

1178
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,160
What kind of world are you living in
