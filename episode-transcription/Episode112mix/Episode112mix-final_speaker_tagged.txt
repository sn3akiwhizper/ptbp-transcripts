0.00 28.44 speaker0  Greetings, my great greasy grandchildren. It's your grease keeper god, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to recycle the grease. I will turn old, dead grease into new, alive grease once again by using the purifying properties of my fur hairs. I am the Greasier.
24.40 36.48 speaker1  and I will return the world to grease once more.
34.32 78.56 speaker0  Grease bless this mess. This week's Howlin' with Wolf was a bit strange. When I finally stopped greasin' up the joint and got behind the mic, I noticed an unfamiliar package on my desk, shaped like a cassette tape, and inside was a cassette tape, and that was titled in rainbow-colored marker, each letter a rotating, vibrant hue of Roy G. Biv, and it read, Something has been happenin' to you at night lately, by a lie remains a lie, and or at countless bats on Twitter. There is an eight-foot, hunchbacked, wolf-muscled man
75.84 112.64 speaker1  who opens your window quite gently at night, and he climbs in and crouches beside you in bed there to watch you. He touches your face with his thick-knuckled hands, and he opens your mouth, and he works out your teeth one by one to inspect them, replace them with new ones he's lovingly crafted with thick-knuckled hands. Terribly, slowly, his face is a factless intent, and you ask me why you don't remember this happening, and I tell you, you do. Oh, you do.
109.76 134.16 speaker0  Well, uh, thanks from whoever sent that. I definitely will be sleepin' just as soundly as I had previous to listenin' to that nice little piece of audio. It definitely didn't scare the piss out of me from sheer terror. It's a good thing I have my dog, Wolf, the dog, to keep me company and keeping the terror at bay
132.04 140.00 speaker1  for yet another night.
136.76 309.28 speaker0  for Wolf to play on these slick airwaves, I'm going to start readin' five-star reviews live on air here and there, so make them snappy, sloppy, and sweet, y'all. Now listen to me. I will click the links in the show notes. I will click the links in the show notes. I will click the links in the show notes. I will click the links in the show notes. Man, if we got old, wouldn't I know that we're with me today, Gigantumbropithecus. A Gigantumpropithecanth. An Umbagumgarbregrath. when a clerk bishop blinded the big fucker with a bright flash of face light. And then the Don Jon AT-ST casted a wand-focused Devil Hands, which, overclocked by the sacrifice of Wheeler Fortjohn, demolished the large shadow ape. Planet Juggernaut gracefully turned and whipped itself up into the air like jumpin' out of a swing, if the swing warped and dissolved into nothingness as the booty achieved liftoff. And the overwhelmingly enormous champion of the scrap pit landed directly on top of M-A-R-Y, crushin' both her and her hopes to open this portal to Tildy B. Mitchell, where Silas Cole had trapped her, deep below Bean's pond. of Mick and Nick Nickles, is Draggin' In 3 with What Kinda World Are You Livin' In? ["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]
304.28 338.76 speaker1  ["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"] Praise be to Planet Juggernaut, the lord and savior of all who have gathered here today, as well as those that exist in other variations of this plane of contention. Praise be, Nick Nickles! Planet Juggernaut is here, for he is our savior no matter the time or place or space.
337.76 347.18 speaker0  Praise him all!
342.90 404.14 speaker1  Rotund Planet Juggernaut is celibate, and that's okay. Hail him! Hail him now, you weak idiots! I personally will weep at the feet of Planet Juggernaut for our round mound of chrome. Let us use our tears to wipe away the blood of all of his enemies off his shiny shoes. I want his holiness, Planet Juggernaut, to come inside me. I have sinned so many times in this life, but Planet Juggernaut has forgiven all of them and cleansed the many dimensions. My sins are no longer an issue. Please do not look at my sins. Look at Planet Juggernaut. Let's get him now! here with Planet Juggernaut.
401.70 413.94 speaker0  That's being a fighter. Mick, I like your enthusiasm, but obviously I won't come in you.
411.46 424.02 speaker1  what do you think is gonna happen next?
421.66 426.78 speaker0  Might just go for a little spin.
425.02 431.78 speaker1  Wow, what a humble hero. Hey, it's you guys who are the real heroes,
430.70 436.10 speaker0  Catch you later.
434.34 463.30 speaker1  and he's down to one. That's just incredible. I'm glad he finally pointed out that we're the true heroes here. has delivered us from both the chaos of the Scrap Pit and the horrible, unsplikable monsters here in this, Oh, Planet Juggernaut. What's going on, my beautiful brother?
459.62 477.54 speaker2  and see this ocean of motion of wormy worm times coming on down towards us slowly but surely. Oh, I do not wanna be squished by those bugs. I don't like looking at the worms, brother.
475.02 480.54 speaker1  Let's hold each other with our eyes closed.
479.06 484.78 speaker0  I'm giving you a big hug. I'm doing a hug.
483.14 645.62 speaker2  like you're quivering and hugging. And from below, everyone can see the top half of Keith Beans up in the sky, continuing to wriggle as the worms make their way through his skull and attach themselves to his brain. Luke, I would like to speak to you. they can sit in on it. Yeah, that's fine. Keith Vigna, you are standing at six o'clock on the face of a watch. It's a massive, massive watch face, surrounded on all sides by an unnaturally wriggling ocean of darkness. And as these worms begin to consume your brain, you are somehow unable to die and therefore your synapses are firing off and connecting simultaneously to the worms that you're standing on at noon, floating in this endless void, you see Ferguson Beans, your brother. He's wearing a white suit. It fits him like a glove. It's got a red rose on his lapel. He looks dapper as he's ever looked. Aside from the bullet holes in his chest, blood pouring down, matching his flowery lapel, his corsage with the blood that is now leaking through his white suit. And when he sees you, he begins walking slowly Suddenly he's standing right before you and he falls to his knees, weeping.
640.62 679.50 speaker1  and I'm so sorry of the way I treated you. Who did? Bob and Dad. Why did they? They were trying to make me into something, something that could handle what was going for all of us. I'm sorry you had to die for it. Well, I feel,
678.10 698.90 speaker2  I feel like a martyr. Do martyrs know that they've done something wrong? Do they all deserve it? Yes.
695.58 730.34 speaker1  So is that the answer you wanted? I just, I never wanted to turn you against, I didn't know exactly what I was doing. Our relationship and how important I think it would be
727.38 745.10 speaker2  And I still loved you. Why did you do it?
741.34 760.98 speaker1  There was some kind of hate in me from a young age that just lived there. And I, you know, I didn't realize how much was in me until an opportunity arose.
756.22 887.26 speaker2  Did you at least, did you get it all out of your system? Did Fergie just ask him if he got his hatred out by killing him? Yeah. What a guy. here's what's about to happen. here in the aftermath of the defeat of the Gigantum Burpithecus and M-A-R-Y, as well as the closure of the portal, which removed the additional threat and all around rough time of dealing with Tildy B. Mitchell. And then after I describe what's going on with the NPCs that are here, you'll have one D-12 plus four minutes. I have a handy dandy timer here on the screen next to Justin's handsome little mug. Why did I say that? And when the one D-12 plus four minutes run out, this ocean made of unimaginably slippery little pulsating membranes with two sets of sharp teeth inside each adorable circular mouth will come crashing down. And these little guys will latch on in your allotted time. maybe the phone or the broken radio up at the top of the shadowy building, the grabbing or using would presumably need to happen before you each go into your own tiny worm dream hole for the foreseeable forever of your character. Who wants to do it? Joe. Joe. One D-12 plus four.
886.18 891.98 speaker0  It's a 12. No, I don't think so.
890.34 897.98 speaker1  It's a three. Oh. Fuck.
896.98 911.86 speaker2  Thomas, did you just roll a one? It's just one D-12 plus four. Yep. Thank, okay, cool.
911.02 921.30 speaker0  Thank you. What a kind DM.
920.14 922.98 speaker2  Nice.
922.14 926.66 speaker1  Time to go to heaven. Slowly.
925.50 933.94 speaker2  to play that game.
931.98 940.06 speaker1  So like, what happens in there?
937.22 945.78 speaker2  All right, I'm setting the timer now at seven minutes. I will click start when I tell you that I'm clicking start.
944.30 959.66 speaker1  Click pause really quick. No timer has happened yet. So I was a little confused about the order of events here. We can do whatever we want right now, and then the seven minutes starts.
956.70 967.50 speaker2  but we'll have seven minutes out of character and in character, just seven minutes total
965.94 969.98 speaker1  there's a radio at the top of the tower.
969.14 985.54 speaker2  Keith saw it.
983.86 1000.74 speaker1  so I know it's there too. And I have been positively reinforced by the phone because I gotta make flurry. I'm back. Back in the New York groove. Now Thomas is gone.
998.66 1007.14 speaker2  Back in the Maybound town.
1005.14 1072.58 speaker1  Peeing in my little pants. I wanna piss my pants. No, pissing in them. You don't wanna hold my pants. A warm feeling, let that stain. It can't hurt. It can't hurt. It can't hurt. Piss into me.
1070.26 1231.02 speaker2  Hey, we do something with making my way downtown yet? Yeah. Are you ready? Yeah, I definitely thought this was happening tomorrow night. The Luminous Land Liturgy, which includes Drew Andrews, Councilwoman Carrie Pages, Gary Daley, Mildred Mitchell, Clara Blankenship, Casey Kristoff, Everett Pace, Jack Perlman, Greer Hilfintop, Kermonkernau, the saloon bartender and piano player, as well as a gambler named Thomas, along with myriad animals, either held, perched, or healing. Keith, you see, Bean is running happily, tongue akimbo, and this entire group continues to bob and weave in a ceaseless musical number at the unnatural direction of the overseer, though their voices quiet down to an eerie whisper as they dart around uncontrollably. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer. your attempt to destroy the countless alternative timelines. It garners our respect. However, plane 1620216 still has far too many variants. It is unstable. For your own safety, please stay here. We will repeat ourselves one more time, For your own safety, please stay here. And with that, this myriad of lanky skin, thin, thin-skinned, thin-skinned creatures in black suits just pops out of this existence. You have seven minutes until the horrible ocean of little mouths and huge worms drowns everyone in the endless isolation of their own unsound minds, starting with the last one.
1228.86 1242.98 speaker1  I've translated it before, he's given it to us before. It's PTBP.
1241.78 1252.06 speaker0  You don't have to stay here,
1250.62 1258.30 speaker1  and the plan is to create portals that send them back to their timelines, not to ours. The overseer.
1257.46 1265.46 speaker2  Okay. When you say theirs, not ours.
1263.38 1282.90 speaker1  Those creatures just said that they can't stay in here because there's too many vectors. They can't stay in the PTBP plane or whatever.
1281.38 1285.30 speaker2  69.
1284.46 1290.46 speaker1  Wow.
1289.62 1291.30 speaker2  Holy shit, really?
1290.46 1295.34 speaker1  I could've rolled. Amazing.
1293.86 1374.82 speaker2  It just keeps happening. Okay, so in this moment, you know that the plane 1620216 that Myriad is talking about is the entire existence of your world. on that world that are all considered to be plane 1620216. However, with a 69, who has dedicated his entire life to jumping between these little planes that exist all over 1620216. He has the ability now to send each of these Luminous Land Liturgy members to their respective existences wherever they happen to come from. However, based on what Myriad has told you, they plan to shut down that entire plane. So you can send those people to go end their lives wherever they belong, but that is essentially what you will be doing.
1372.54 1403.70 speaker1  and then take the fight to Myriad. Keith feels himself dying above him somehow. And he realizes he's like, I'm gonna die again. I'm gonna die here. And he looks around and he sees the people that he's gotten into this mess with and he just yells, Drew, Drew, Drew. Where's Drew at?
1402.62 1407.94 speaker2  Sha-ka-tay. But in the voice of Councilwoman Carrie Pages.
1405.66 1413.90 speaker1  Keith goes up and grabs Drew. Is the Councilwoman here too?
1411.90 1430.76 speaker2  has Drew Andrews inside of it and the body of Drew Pages, Drew Andrews has Councilwoman Carrie Pages inside of it. I could just go grab both of them. Follow me. I grab them by the ears and pull them
1429.92 1431.90 speaker1  Okay.
1430.76 1440.66 speaker2  They are still chanting and desperately want to get away from you, but in that moment, the overseer has the option to release them from their bind.
1439.26 1449.66 speaker1  Clark. we have to drop this spell.
1448.10 1455.62 speaker2  Okay, completely for everyone?
1453.14 1458.86 speaker1  He needs the power that he can keep.
1456.46 1462.86 speaker2  So then immediately you're getting like a, oh my God, oh my gosh.
1460.94 1464.76 speaker1  Why, what is going, what is going on here?
1463.94 1468.10 speaker2  Drew, Drew. No, I'm Carrie.
1467.26 1478.08 speaker1  Yes. We're gonna die. Drew here. We're gonna die. Yes. And if I'm gonna die, I wanna die with Drew and Drew's body. Follow me.
1477.24 1483.02 speaker2  And they run after you. We have 90 seconds left. So they're running. What are you, the other two doing?
1480.82 1496.52 speaker1  Can Clark, by time, can he try and do a spell that pushes the ceiling back? Yes. 60.
1493.58 1503.58 speaker2  Passes both Clark and the Overseer. Give me some sort of a magical chance here.
1501.86 1564.24 speaker1  and because they're kind of linked now, they both know what's going on and they put both their hands up and they start chanting. Fuck yeah. Why aren't we paused? You would be seeing how much we bought or is it just pause paused? Four.
1561.58 1622.08 speaker2  And with four minutes and 30 seconds left. Oh shit. So we've got a John and a Planet Juggernaut still in play. That is correct. So Planet Juggernaut just shoots up into the air and he might even start throwing chunks of the muck world up as like flak pieces towards the Xenonibatodes trying to blast maybe even a hole just above us in the circle. Amen. Thomas, go ahead and roll a d100. 91. Well, that's not gonna do it.
1621.24 1624.20 speaker1  That's a good number.
1623.36 1642.16 speaker2  You gotta tell me what I'm rolling for so I can tent the dice. Go ahead and roll a natural for John. John Ball. That's an 85 on a 67.
1640.52 1646.92 speaker1  Oh no.
1643.04 1660.68 speaker2  So cutting to the top of the tower, we've got a dark room. It is pitch black. Keith Vigna is running in with Councilwoman Kerry Pages and Drew Andrews and he makes it to this very, very dark room at the top of the shadowy tower.
1658.52 1685.40 speaker1  He starts to feel really calm. And he's getting real sleepy and warm. Yep. And he realizes what's happening to him and he looks at Drew. You gotta do it, buddy.
1684.20 1699.92 speaker2  I gotta do what? I gotta do what?
1698.56 1707.92 speaker1  That's super nice.
1705.64 1728.12 speaker2  are just arguing back and forth and confused. They begin to start feeling all over the room, trying to find anything in the room. And Drew immediately finds the radio. Kerry can't find anything, but Drew's like, I think I have it. I'm almost positive that I have it, sir. Do it. Do what?
1726.24 1738.48 speaker1  I don't, I'm feeling around. Get some goo?
1734.88 1755.40 speaker2  30 seconds. Okay, Keith, I roll a D100. If you can roll under 30, I'll let Drew get out of this room with this thing. 32.
1753.00 1777.24 speaker1  So Overseer's just doing a giant portal under the ground of all of us and just dropping us into wherever.
1774.56 1778.08 speaker2  He did hit it exactly when there was one second left
1777.24 1780.40 speaker1  on the timer.
1779.56 1792.64 speaker2  which was pretty dope. So let's go ahead and get that roll off time of dropping this world down.
1791.00 1802.36 speaker1  It's a pass, 52.
1800.60 1824.72 speaker2  Two minutes starting, meow. And so the whole entire floor, this lit land all over everywhere that you can see just, oh, would it be cooler if, yeah, it'd be cooler if there were walls. It'd be cool if the two minutes start after you say all this shit. Shut the fuck up, dude. I hate it when you're right, it's stupid.
1823.88 1826.88 speaker0  to come up with a cool description.
1824.72 1830.88 speaker1  Hold on, guys, it's gonna be cooler. Two minutes.
1829.64 1835.72 speaker2  Do you want to describe what happens?
1833.08 1856.52 speaker1  every piece of land that is occupied by people now. So it includes the tower, I think. And then my chanters and wherever Juggernaut is and John Ball and Don. And it's a perfect circle around all of that that just drops down, leaving giant white walls all around us in a giant circle.
1854.96 1865.16 speaker2  Yeah, it's very bright in here.
1863.16 1868.16 speaker1  That's what I meant to do, for sure. Wake you up.
1866.12 1908.84 speaker2  And the timer starts now. Drew Andrews grabs onto the radio and the rest of you outside see him running out the front door. Councilwoman Carrie pages his body, sprinting out across the land toward you, holding this broken radio. Don starts chanting,
1907.60 1931.48 speaker1  you'd just let me do it. Yeah.
1926.48 1972.28 speaker2  you see a cartoonishly crisp black skeleton where this John Lee Kevin Moore used to be. And you can tell all of them went into that last spell There is a charred one inch in diameter sphere sitting on the ground in between you and your brother and nephew. And you have all of the strength in this moment to just.
1970.48 1981.08 speaker0  whenever he sees the charred corpse. And then they start like, before they hit the ground,
1979.96 1990.00 speaker1  That's so cool.
1986.96 2041.36 speaker2  I'm gonna put seven minutes back on the clock. The original time that you had immediately after Myria disappeared. And you are reset exactly where you were. Everything moves in reverse. The floor moves all the way back up and becomes level with the ground around it. The tower is dark once again, but Keith runs backwards. Drew Andrews and Carrie. And begin whispering once again. And the seven minutes starts right now.
2039.88 2056.88 speaker1  Yeah, while this is happening, Keith gets his phone out of his pocket, turns the light on and runs to the tower. Just give us some light in this area. Okay. And more time again.
2055.04 2062.92 speaker2  Okay, go ahead and roll. Back to back on natural rolls.
2062.08 2069.32 speaker1  Okay. The other one does. 32, so I'm gonna do the floor.
2068.06 2098.04 speaker2  Go ahead and roll a D12. 10. Boom, the floor drops down once again, illuminating the entirety of this cylinder that you've trapped yourselves in, much like the cylinder that the Gigantum Rapithecus was trapped in when you arrived.
2095.52 2108.48 speaker1  he drops it so much further down than he did last time. He created an elevator.
2106.00 2118.84 speaker2  some form of athletics or dexterity, which we'll call a 70%.
2117.48 2121.44 speaker1  93 worms down.
2119.96 2154.40 speaker2  Planet Juggernaut jumps up. Once again, and just like biting for the sky. The ground drops out from under your feet as you're trying to jump, and you just can't quite reach. into the bottom, much like a can of beans that you're now one of these many, many baked fellas down at the bottom of this saucy, saucy barrel.
2152.36 2163.04 speaker1  and he wants to go grab the phone as well, and then run back to the Drew crowd.
2160.80 2181.52 speaker2  or athletics. Carrying a large old radio and a rotary phone is difficult business. Yeah. Okay, you can choose.
2179.64 2204.84 speaker1  and as I like take off, I have the receiver of the phone in my hand, but like the base of it is still just sitting there, and I run and the cord jerks me, and I drop the radio, and it's like sitting busted on the ground, and I grab the base of the phone and start running and seeing if I can hear anything in the receiver.
2202.88 2225.84 speaker2  Hello, hello, hello. Hello, hello, hello. You have absolutely no idea. He rolled really high. 89 or 89?
2224.00 2235.72 speaker1  I have a 79, so that sucks. Oh, damn. just gibberishing into the...
2234.22 2244.00 speaker3  We've got so much time now. Like, we could take real life poop breaks. Like...
2242.26 2276.40 speaker1  Shabababee, shabababee. And I'm, yeah, I'm just standing there, looking at the radio, talking gibberish into the phone, trying to think, what the fuck am I gonna do? about the Overseer in a dark room lit by a candle, and he looks back at that tower and sees that that's what that was.
2273.20 2289.64 speaker2  However, each time that you've used it, they have found you on your next time going into a myriad different forms of existence that you're popping in to try to save
2287.28 2296.94 speaker3  each of these towns of contention.
2293.50 2306.58 speaker2  but he does not like being chased, and every single time he is going and fucking with time and existence,
2304.62 2324.92 speaker1  I mean, I don't know, in character or out of character, the point is we have to get out of here. Once we get out of here, we might have more time out wherever we end up, right? It's just the sea that's collapsing on us that's giving this time requirement, right?
2320.70 2352.58 speaker2  for your own safety, please stay here. And you know, in Clark's mind and the Overseer's mind, the Overseer has been able to make jumps into plane 1620216, a plane that he is from and familiar with. He has been unable or scared to jump to a different plane. Can I, quote unquote, Clark Young,
2349.86 2383.02 speaker1  We gotta try, we gotta get somewhere else. You got more juice here than you've ever had before, right? This hasn't happened before. This has to be all new to you, and I'm here now. We can go to another one. We don't have to be in this one. We can do something to him. We can send them not here.
2381.22 2387.54 speaker2  Is it as easy as using that telephone?
2385.64 2396.86 speaker1  was because they were gonna destroy it. They were saying it's gonna be purged or whatever they said.
2393.50 2403.66 speaker2  in all of the different forms of you that have ever known.
2402.46 2412.12 speaker1  Yep, 100%.
2409.14 2414.46 speaker3  Thought it would be nice to save our world. It's all homey.
2413.26 2418.02 speaker1  Yeah.
2414.46 2426.22 speaker3  But I guess it's better to save the 13 people here
2424.26 2432.46 speaker1  I mean, that's 100% a good point.
2428.58 2449.56 speaker3  Anyway, this whole plane, everybody in it, not just us. All that. Keith, didn't you make Myriad?
2446.80 2458.00 speaker1  And he just throws the phone down, grabs the radio and starts running back.
2457.12 2468.68 speaker3  Probably. Well then make Myriad not do this. Stop!
2466.22 2471.32 speaker2  The wormy wormy heavens.
2470.48 2484.28 speaker1  I made you.
2480.84 2522.32 speaker3  I hate him, I hate that he's my god and daddy, but he made me too. Why don't you just stop with all this foolishness and just come on back down to this plane here. Go to your room. before you have to destroy the place. Last time you were here, I think, actually we had a lot less time maybe and you just like, you were boogying, but we've got more time now. Brother, Myriad? Roll Persuade.
2518.48 2532.92 speaker2  appears in between you, Keith, and the phone that has fallen on the ground. I knew they'd listen to me.
2531.88 2539.52 speaker1  And which one are you?
2538.20 2555.76 speaker2  I am Myriad. Plane 1020216 still has far too many variants.
2554.60 2573.20 speaker1  We can fix that. We're working on it. We finally did what I needed to do, now we can work together. and so you'll stop existing too.
2571.08 2588.76 speaker3  and then you'll just have to do this all over again. It's gonna hurt to think about, so just don't do it. It's all timey-wimey, unless you don't destroy this shit.
2587.52 2596.12 speaker1  I guess I'm like an uncle, maybe?
2593.72 2602.80 speaker3  and we've raised you to call him uncle.
2599.64 2608.60 speaker1  and he is slapping the radio while he was screaming at his sons. Yeah, and you see the ooze that's dripping
2606.84 2617.28 speaker2  from the John ball, and you think, oh, if I could get some of that, I could probably get this thing going. Oh shit, does that just need some ooze?
2615.00 2627.32 speaker3  Some just shoots out of John's index finger straight into the. I'm so glad you said index finger.
2624.36 2636.84 speaker1  And Keith has a bright idea, puts his hand on the shoulder of the myriad thing, and flips the switch on the radio.
2634.48 2641.72 speaker0  Oh my God.
2640.04 2648.16 speaker1  Oh fuck.
2646.72 2658.44 speaker3  You gonna pause that, Zach? Pause.
2653.44 2708.28 speaker2  An energy erupts as the brightest flash of light, it makes the surrounding bright walls of this cylinder that you've fallen into look dark, because the light that is flashing from this radio in this moment is so bright, you are all completely engulfed. And when the world kind of comes back and you can see what's happened, Keith Vigna has switched bodies with this creature. like you are tied into an entire network of individuals, creatures that all work on the same sort of.
2707.44 2712.32 speaker3  Keiths.
2709.84 2724.92 speaker2  It's a whole thing of Keiths. We're all fucked. and touching its skin.
2723.48 2735.04 speaker3  into the body of Keith. It's trying to understand its own singularity.
2732.84 2766.00 speaker2  It's like walking like that. and the universe at your disposal.
2764.64 2792.04 speaker1  cause I'm a myriad, right? Just like I expected. I just won't destroy the plane.
2790.68 2800.12 speaker3  I'm probably, are you? It's Keith. What? We are Keith.
2798.60 2815.36 speaker1  and just kind of waddling, like wandering over to me, Keith. And they're all talking at the same time.
2814.36 2822.68 speaker3  That was easy.
2818.64 2842.88 speaker1  between each other and this Keith creature talking. As the Keiths are popping in, one of the Keiths grabs the phone and brings it over to me, Keith. And I listen to it.
2839.44 2867.12 speaker3  So John has, like the ball has been speaking, just like Planet Juggernaut and the other balls seem to have this weird capability to speak, just as John. And he, when he kind of realizes that they have a moment to breathe and he is just this ball, out of the muck, slapping it on himself, like a kid playing in a pile of mud.
2864.32 2878.88 speaker2  and grabbing more of this luminous land below, it like turns into like this oozy muck as it's forming on you.
2875.08 2908.64 speaker3  It's assumed the shape of the John you knew kinda, although it is entirely the black, Yeah. he gets a little handful of the muck and you see him rolling it and he throws it on top and he's wearing a fucking sick cowboy hat. Yeah.
2907.40 2917.76 speaker1  Hell yes. In the meantime, you can see some of the myriad, Keith's like playing patty cake with each other and doing stuff like that.
2915.96 2919.04 speaker3  They're like looking at each other like...
2917.76 2923.04 speaker1  Some are fighting, some are very sensually looking at each other. Do I know you?
2922.04 2945.32 speaker3  And then laughing. Doing the Spider-Man Mary Jane kiss with each other. We got it paused when myriad... Oh, that didn't have anything to do with the nematode.
2942.52 2957.16 speaker2  But I paused it in this moment to just like let the gravitas hit of everything that's been happening. Thank you, Justin. Thank you for reminding the teacher that there was a quiz.
2955.48 2959.56 speaker3  There was a quiz today.
2958.72 2960.72 speaker1  Thank you for reminding me.
2959.56 2961.96 speaker2  Timer has started.
2960.72 2969.56 speaker0  My favorite student.
2967.64 2999.52 speaker1  I close my eyes and think again and everybody just stops and closes their eyes. of destroying the plane. And I'm like, maybe if I just condense it into just like a little bit and not the whole plane and just do it right above me, I'll do that. Roll a natural.
2994.52 3007.12 speaker2  this entire oceanous ceiling out of this world.
3004.60 3037.32 speaker1  Pure nothing. Darkness. And all of Myriad lays down and starts like, oh yeah. There's like barely any light in this plane anymore. And they're just like, all at the same time. Nice.
3036.48 3049.92 speaker2  Nice. I'm going to pause the timer as the current threat of the xenonimitotion
3046.56 3053.32 speaker1  Like a handful of little solitary nematodes are falling down onto the...
3052.40 3056.56 speaker2  That's horrifying. Yeah. Just like a couple here and there.
3055.20 3064.32 speaker1  Cause I, you know, there's an inch or two that I didn't get.
3061.72 3066.64 speaker2  squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.
3065.80 3073.52 speaker3  ouchie, ouchie. Ouchie.
3070.44 3080.76 speaker1  So, yeah. It's pretty nice.
3079.36 3088.84 speaker3  In the total darkness,
3083.96 3136.88 speaker1  and it's Overseer and Young Clark's faces. They've got this light thing down and they're illuminating the area around them. Oh, the Overseer's like, I fought those guys for centuries. I don't know. I've lost track of time doing what I've been doing and Keith just switched bodies with them. That was all it took. Son of a bitch. Well, you know, I made them so... Of course you knew just what to do.
3135.12 3170.52 speaker3  Let's go back home, boys. Oh, God.
3166.36 3174.16 speaker0  Leaving my mind at your altar Crossing the double line, doing it every time What kind of world are you living in
