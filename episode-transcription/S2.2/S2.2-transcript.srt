00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What's good, the internet. It is your web-savvy zaddy, Wolf the Dog. Net.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And we're coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station powered by Geocities.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, speaking of the World Wide Web and all of the beauty contained within,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Gary in Scarborough, England,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
which is a thing you are also more than welcome to do.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Gary writes,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Howdy, Wolf.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's your brother and long-time listener from across the pond.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I hope this finds you well and know that you should come here to Scarborough, Wolfie.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's if you don't mind fighting off mutant-sized seagulls up at the castle

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
for that extra tasty grease you love oh so much.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I hear it will make you howl so hard you taste colors.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Anyway, I love the podcast that you, Zach, and the boys are providing for us folks.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Keep up the great work and a big shout-out to my girlfriend, Mel, and my buddy, Paul.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, hello, Brother Gary. You talkin' about castle slop?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And all I gotta do is beat some seagull ass to get a taste?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sign me up, Brother Gary.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I hope I'm not being too sea-gullible here by accepting this travel invitation.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If you want to write up something for your Web 2.0 Wolf to Howl,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
or write a five-star review and send us that screenshot.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Word of mouth through social media has been instrumental in getting this podcast to where it is today.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you, too, have these feelings, you may find a nice community to join in our Discord or subreddit.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And if you want to give us money so we don't stop making this show,

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
you can do that on Patreon or our merch shop.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The links are in the show notes.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now, it's time to catch up, but don't get confused.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wolf don't work for Can, but it's time for the news.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Last time, we were introduced to Julius Summers,

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the fresh-faced, thick-legged field producer who was just hired by his uncle, Typh Rayland,

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
the executive producer for the City Action News.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Julius picked up the former lead anchor of Can, Cal Colorado,

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
an elderly statesman of news in the city,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
as well as their Hawaiian shirt-rocking cameraman, Beck Wilder.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The three put together a segment about the Godel Company,

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
top of the agricultural food chain,

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
buying up all the farmland just outside the city,

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
taking us now to that story as it unfolds.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's All My Fault.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No one knows what it's like

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
behind these eyes.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Welcome to episode two of Pretending to Be People.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I had the Kelly Clarkson Hazel Eyes song stuck in my head.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you remember that Guitar Hero 2 song that was like,

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you got radium eyes, never listened to it since.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No, but do you know about the radium girls?

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, what are the radium girls?

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I do know about them.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So radium, before people really knew about how dangerous radioactive was,

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
it was kind of a craze to put radium in shit, including makeup.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
At least the radium girls I know of, it was watches.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And they would lick the brushes as they put the dots on.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, and that's why their jaws fell off.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They're all fine though?

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, they would be dead. This happened.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They would be dead anyway, but they would not be fine.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No matter what, they would not be fine right now.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But they were not fine while they were still alive

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
because their fucking jaws fell off

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
because of the radium paint and the watch dials, right?

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, it was probably the noon, three, six, and nine.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But they would dip the brushes in radium

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and to get a fine point on the brush.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't know about fetishized, but they were looked up upon

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
because they kind of glowed.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
They called the radium girls, they were like angels.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Talk about unachievable beauty standards, you know what I mean?

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That radium glow?

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Truly, truly unattainable.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I photoshop all my porn to be slightly for life.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry, you photoshop your what?

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
My porn?

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, you photoshop it?

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, to have a radium glow.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So you put in work ahead of time or during?

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
During.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, okay. Ask the answer.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's just a filter pass, that's easy.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There's a book called The Radium Girls,

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The Dark Story of America's Shining Women.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Is it erotica?

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It is for me.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But there was also a movie that I think flopped

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
but it had an early Joey King in it.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who?

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In 2018.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The guy from Kingaroo Jack, I think.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Kingaroo Jack.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go around and talk about these characters.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I want physical descriptions to remind us of who these people are

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and what they wear on a day to day basis

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and just like the vibe they give off.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's start with Joe.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Beck, he's got a closet full of Hawaiian shirts,

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
patterned shirts but mostly Hawaiian shirts.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Beck Wilder.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Beck Wilder.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Beck Wilder.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He's a little bit slovenly.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sometimes buttons are mismatched on his shirts.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He obviously doesn't care a whole lot about his appearance.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He often just throws a baseball cap over his messy hair.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
His outward appearance is almost buffoonery.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, you had mentioned his shorts as well.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, yeah.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's got confident shorts.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's got the cargoiest of shorts.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, he's got a craftsman's shorts.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We're talking loops.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We're talking pockets.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So many pockets, dude.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, my God.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He's lost things in there before.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We're talking carabiners with all kinds of weird attachments.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He's thought about going full pants just to have more space for pockets,

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
but he just loves the breeze on his calves.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He needs to look into those zip-offs.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, he does.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He should have zip-offs.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But he might leave the things in the zip-offed pockets somewhere by accident.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wow.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's the thing that Beck would definitely do.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's forward thinking.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Know yourself, Beck Wilder.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey, Slacker, is he canonically kin to Van Wilder?

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No.

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I hadn't thought about that, but that's good.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That was a sharp no.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A hard no.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A hard no.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Sorry, listeners, because Joe just shut off the National Lampoon's Wilder world.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Write that down for us.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah, no Van Wilder.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Right, but our ride, he does call Van Wilder.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's what Beck calls it.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's what he calls his sweet Krieger van that he has.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Beck, who's the person that you interact with most?

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Who's the person that you text most, call most, the person you see most?

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
His mom.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And what's her name?

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Boy.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Her name's Boy Wilder?

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yep.

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It sure does seem like a thing I should have thought of.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I like Boy Wilder.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Not really.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think Boy Wilder is your mom's name, man.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Zach just kind of sprung that on you after saying we wouldn't be using bonds, so.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I didn't mean that your characters wouldn't know people.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You said we are loners and don't know us little person.

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, we're weird.

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No bonds.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No friends.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No gods.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No family.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No kings.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
In our former lives, we were only friends with each other, and so we haven't gotten to

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that point yet.

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, we haven't gotten to us describing our characters, but I do think for Cal, his legitimate

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
answer is Beck.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Ah, interesting.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Kim.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Kim Wilder is Beck's mom.

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Cool.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What was wrong with Boy?

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Just a different three-letter name.

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Kim Wilder is your mom, and what kind of relationship do you have with Kim?

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Pretty iffy.

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We're close as far as we probably talk to each other every day, but it's a weird relationship.

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He doesn't like his mom a whole lot.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Joe, my God.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Joe, my God.

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Joe.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He did not silence his phone.

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My phone was not on silent.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's true.

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're kicked out of the Alamo draft house.

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I got the ticket thing.

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's exceedingly decent here.

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
20 bucks, movie every day.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, no.

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That actually, that shit.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's so sick.

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a really good deal.

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's a movie pass type deal, and I hope it doesn't mean that Alamo is about to go under

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
grade.

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It is.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The second they weren't making that delicious cold brew anymore, I knew that it was...

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Man, their menu is so parsed down now.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Luke can't get his Italian sodas.

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I can't get my fucking cream soda.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will say, dude, past two times I've been, horrible service.

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, bummer.

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Dude, I literally, I went and saw Top Gun.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It took an hour and a half to get my food.

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh, shit.

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Like almost the end of the night.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, that sucks.

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's awful.

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Cold fried cauliflower.

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Counterpoint, I had great service the last time I went.

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, they've added that button, which I feel like now I get immediate service.

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, the thing is Luke didn't press the button for an hour and a half.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, I literally got there early, ordered it, and then...

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, you got there too early.

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No, I got there, I was probably one of the last people to do that.

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Luke, we're pretty sure this is something you did.

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We are really trying to turn this around on you, aren't you?

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hey, Luke, I'm sorry that happened to you.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey, here's what I'll say.

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It was a full, I didn't, I wasn't even that mad because it was a full theater, two servers

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
for the whole thing.

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, yeah, that's hard.

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That is hard.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Well, but you're the guy I know who's been there the most, so probably you just suck

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
at going there.

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're probably just bad at it.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You don't know what you're doing.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll have to look up tips and tricks, I guess.

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Tips and tricks.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Did you not Google Alamo Drafthouse tips and tricks Reddit before you went?

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Usually I do like FAQ or like a walkthrough, so that I don't have to buy the book at Walmart.

228
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Beck Wilder has an iffy relationship with his mother, Kim Wilder.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's talk a little bit about Julia Summers.

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Wait, real quick.

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What does your mom look like?

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, yeah.

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hit us with that mom look.

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
She's a...

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Make her hot.

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No, she's a...

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Make her so hot.

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
She's a far side woman with the beehive and the cat eye glasses.

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And you said you weren't going to make her hot?

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I was going to say, I think we convinced him.

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Does she have a fat lip?

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Fat lip.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Far side.

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
When's the last time you saw a far side comic?

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And, uh, Julia Summers.

246
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Wait, what is the fat lip reference?

247
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So, The Far Side, which is a rap group, hip-hop.

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Uh, with a C-Y.

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, The Far Side, F-P-H-A-R-C-Y-D-E.

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Not the classic single panel cartoon by Gary Lawson.

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Fat lip.

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Nice.

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Julia Summers.

254
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Julia is walking into the party like his name is...

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't know that.

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is that a far side reference?

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No, it's a fat lip reference.

258
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Some 41.

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Plus 44?

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No, some 41.

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Quick rundown on Julia Summers.

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You look at him at a glance.

263
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
5'6".

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Monochromatic suit.

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Depending on the day of the week, tan, black, grey, blue.

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Short king.

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Short king, big thighs.

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
How tall is he?

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
5'6".

270
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Is that short?

271
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Sorry.

272
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's about how tall I am.

273
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's a poor one.

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No, you're like...

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm like 5'7", maybe.

276
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Short king.

277
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We need to re-measure you.

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't think you're that much shorter.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I think you're taller than me too.

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, I think you're taller than that.

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, guys, I'm 6'5".

282
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Go back, if you're new to listening to this, go back on our social media.

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Check at PretendingPod on Instagram.

284
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You will see that I tower over these guys.

285
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We post tons of pictures of us just like hanging out and doing our own shit.

286
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
A lot of us standing side by side so that you can compare how tall I am to these guys.

287
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, see if you can figure out which one Luke is based on this conversation.

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You should definitely check out our lineup shot if you really want to get some inside

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
of this.

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We have all of our mug shots on there.

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah.

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Anyway.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Julie Summers, monochromatic suits.

294
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Lives in the suburbs outside of the city with his roommate.

295
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Suburbs.

296
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's who he spends the most time with.

297
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, sick.

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Who's his roommate?

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
He moved to this house.

300
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He just bought this house, but he needs a roommate to afford it.

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And it's a lady that he found on Craigslist.

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Cool.

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What's her name?

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Her name?

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He hasn't found it out yet.

306
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Named her yet.

307
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He just moved in.

308
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh, or did she introduce herself and you just don't remember?

309
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That is what happened.

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Julie Summers, producer.

311
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Not good with names.

312
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Nephew of my uncle.

313
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm not great with names either, and I just want to say it's fucked up that names are

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the first thing we say instead of the last when we're meeting people.

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I always say, I've been Joe Terry.

316
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This has been Joe Terry.

317
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It was a pleasure meeting me.

318
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You've been enjoying the sonic sounds of Joe Terry.

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hey, what's your name?

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

321
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let me describe what I look like first.

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Getting a little fresh here, huh?

323
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't you want to know about my outfits and bonds?

324
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Julia Summers is here because of nepotism.

325
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
His uncle, Tife Rayland.

326
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Rayland.

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Tife Rayland.

328
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Tife Rayland is your uncle and he is the executive producer of the City Action News.

329
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He is, how would you describe him?

330
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'd say darn good at his job.

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Demanding, but rewarding.

332
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You know, he is also my uncle's.

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't think I can say anything bad.

334
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, he's my whole, he's my whole uncle.

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He asked you to do something.

336
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Go to the farm.

337
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And then he also asked you to do one more thing.

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I think he said it twice and he said, you definitely need to remember to do this.

339
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't think you ever said you definitely need to remember to do this.

340
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Maybe not in those words.

341
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hold on, Zach.

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This is not in my notes, which doesn't mean anything on its own.

343
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But Joe made a face at that.

344
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And it's not in his notes, which means.

345
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Someone's lying.

346
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Someone didn't say what they were supposed to say.

347
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He changed his tone and said, no, I'm real serious this time.

348
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay.

349
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You have to make it 90 seconds.

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's really, I grasped onto 90 seconds and then I didn't really do that.

351
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You did.

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And but then every interaction you were like, this needs to be 90 seconds instead of just the whole segment.

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But that's Luke trying to remember.

354
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Sure.

355
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me there.

356
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Not even Joe remembers.

357
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is so rude.

358
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, I don't got it, but.

359
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Here's the deal.

360
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Whatever I rolled, I think.

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This is a horror podcast.

362
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Are you scared?

363
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What was I rolling on?

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I think you failed.

365
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's a 98, but you know, just making sure.

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Julius doesn't have a 99 intelligence, does he?

367
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No.

368
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
All right, Julius, I guess you'll find out in character.

369
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's go to Cal, Colorado.

370
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Remind me of what you look like, sir.

371
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Cal, Colorado is in his late fifties, but he's tall and handsome for his age.

372
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Handsome at any age.

373
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's why he's on TV.

374
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He wears, um, Julius mentioned that a lot of his suits he inherited from his dad and they have nineties cuts.

375
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Cal has the exact same cuts.

376
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Do you guys match?

377
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Wait, how tall are you?

378
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think he's like 6'3".

379
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Go huge.

380
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He's 6'3".

381
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm 6'7".

382
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I am 9 feet tall and 400 pounds.

383
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I lean down to interview you.

384
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
My voice shakes the glass when I speak.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
All right, so just like a normal height.

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, 6'3", average height.

387
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm not as tall, like as short as Luke, but that hurts.

388
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The average height is generally around 6'6".

389
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He was reading that off of his phone for those of you listening at home.

390
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And now he's showing me his phone from too far away to read to fact check.

391
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Average height in the NBA.

392
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Auto-correct, I guess.

393
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Well, I mean, that's an important point.

394
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Cal was great on his college basketball team, but he didn't have the stuff to go pro.

395
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He always thought if he had three extra inches, he might have been able to do that.

396
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But he was pretty happy with his career until now.

397
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Did he go to City State U?

398
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No, actually he went to the Missouri.

399
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He went to the University of Missouri School of Journalism.

400
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, very nice.

401
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I went to that for a year.

402
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Really?

403
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The journalism school?

404
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Hell yeah.

405
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Who is Cal Colorado's closest human contact?

406
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So yeah, currently, as far as like most frequent contact, it's Beck.

407
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Julius just got here, but we've been out on these segments for a few months now, I think.

408
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Cool.

409
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
As far as the person he's closest to in life, that's his daughter, Carol Colorado.

410
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Carol Colorado.

411
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We talked about this a little in Session Zero, and it may manifest itself more organically,

412
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
but just to throw it out there, I think that we said that you and I get along pretty well.

413
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Like, even though I'm kind of the opposite of everything you are.

414
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So one thing that Cal does not have is any kind of technology skills.

415
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He was a handsome dude on TV all through like the 80s and 90s, and he did not have to learn how to use computers.

416
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So he really appreciates the tech guys who get shit done.

417
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Sure.

418
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Does he consider Beck like a magician?

419
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, kind of. He's like, anything you need, I know Beck can do.

420
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He does consider Beck a magician when he's like, hey Beck, can you fix my phone for me?

421
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Fix my phone for me.

422
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You had it locked in portrait mode. Here you go.

423
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
There was just a hair on your screen.

424
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do I have games on this?

425
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What's your relationship like with your daughter?

426
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's strained, and we'll leave it at that.

427
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay. Does she live in the city?

428
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
No. She lives in a city, but she lives many states away.

429
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
In a city?

430
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah.

431
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You live in the city.

432
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The city.

433
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, we live in the city.

434
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Beck lives with his mom, and he's going to hear it that he didn't say bye to her when he left this morning.

435
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Awesome.

436
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Does he hang dong around his mom?

437
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, yeah. Did we get a reading on Beck's dong?

438
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, it was hanging out of his pants.

439
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Spilling. I think this is spilling.

440
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We're tighty-whities.

441
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You're an excellent interviewer.

442
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Kravitsian.

443
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Thank you.

444
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
How was Julius's dong? We said that was average, right?

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No, you couldn't-

446
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Not visible from behind.

447
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Correct.

448
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, right.

449
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No thigh gap.

450
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But only because he has those crazy thighs.

451
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Right. So, TBD.

452
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Wait. Yeah.

453
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Mm-hmm.

454
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
To be dick-sized.

455
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
With a hyphen.

456
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Cal, Colorado has a huge hog.

457
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm cutting all this.

458
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Okay, then my penis is so small.

459
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Beck doesn't have one.

460
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's fine.

461
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
His mom said, either put some pants on or-

462
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm taking it off.

463
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Get that thing off of it.

464
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Well, Cal, Colorado has a huge hog.

465
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And he wears out-of-date suits.

466
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Zach, once we left off, we had just finished wrapping up at the farm,

467
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and it sounded like we had what we needed.

468
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah, it sounds like it was time to turn our segment into the studio.

469
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think it's time to turn the segment into the studio.

470
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

472
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You guys are-

473
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio?

474
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
In character, please.

475
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

476
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Mine wasn't in character. I didn't-

477
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Okay, one more again. In character. Joe?

478
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

479
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

480
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

481
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And with that, you guys pull up to City Action News.

482
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What's a building look like?

483
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What's a building look like?

484
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Cool.

485
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's like marble and glass.

486
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Ooh, very cool.

487
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Marble columns, glass walls.

488
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah.

489
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah.

490
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Marble countertops.

491
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Literally marble and glass.

492
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Marble floors.

493
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Ooh.

494
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We are hemorrhaging money.

495
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We spent way too much money on this building.

496
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And kind of as a tongue-in-cheek thing,

497
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
the walkway to the door is kind of like a winding thing with marbles in it.

498
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We are currently jackhammering that out

499
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
because we've already had so many slip and falls and threats of library.

500
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Well, they're not loose marbles.

501
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I know, but marbles sticking out.

502
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
They're shiny.

503
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They're round, smooth.

504
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah.

505
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Humps.

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You can slip on shiny things.

507
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You can slip on anything.

508
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, but especially shiny things.

509
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Julius shakes his head and reminisces about his time.

510
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
How good it looked for him.

511
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
His time as a young boy trying to pick the marbles out of the walkway.

512
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
As one pops loose, it hits your feet as you guys are entering into the station.

513
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Pick it up.

514
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
A sentimental tear starts to well up in his eye,

515
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and he picks it up, and he puts it in the little pocket in his pants.

516
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You know the little pocket?

517
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yo, I'm aware of the little pocket.

518
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
He flicks a marble in somebody's eye in like 40 episodes.

519
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Sentimentally.

520
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
In parentheses.

521
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
All right, cool.

522
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Let's dive on into...

523
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Dive on in.

524
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's not a dive.

525
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Luke, you're the producer.

526
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You're in charge here.

527
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You know that this segment needs to go into the editing bay,

528
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and the executive producer, your uncle, Tyfe,

529
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
is likely in his office where he normally is,

530
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and you would imagine that the standard CAN news crew,

531
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
which is the anchor weather person and sports segment host.

532
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The SSH.

533
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
They're likely on set rehearsing for the show's evening news.

534
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hey Peck, do you have the tape?

535
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I mean, it's not tape these days, old man, but yeah.

536
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I got the footage.

537
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You knew what I meant.

538
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
How old are you guys? Sorry.

539
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm 29.

540
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I was mid-30s.

541
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Awesome.

542
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's not tape, boomer.

543
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Julius says, you know what I meant,

544
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
but Julius totally was thinking of like a VHS tape.

545
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Let's go to the bay.

546
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah, I'll get it loaded up.

547
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And then I don't move, and I'm kind of waiting for him to like

548
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
hopefully go to where the bay is because I don't know where it is.

549
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Beck's heading there, and this is almost a pseudo office of his.

550
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah.

551
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
He's here a lot.

552
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Absolutely.

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And yeah, you pop in, and the editor is hard at work,

554
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
pouring over multiple monitors, computer in front of her,

555
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and she's just like overwhelmed completely with stuff,

556
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and she's like, hey, you got the farmer segment coming in?

557
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What's her name?

558
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You're going to want to see this.

559
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Her name is...

560
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Vivica.

561
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Her name?

562
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh, her name?

563
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Her name?

564
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, you're asking me?

565
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Her name?

566
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
An NPC.

567
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Vivica Johnston, obviously.

568
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
There you go.

569
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Vivica.

570
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hey, Viv, got that footage for you.

571
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh, thank you, thank you.

572
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, my goodness.

573
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Okay, let's get going, let's get going.

574
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay, what do we got?

575
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Do we need to cut a bunch, or is it mostly good to go?

576
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Beck, at this point, this is something that you probably,

577
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
you guys have seen, the audience hasn't seen,

578
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
that he kind of almost flips a switch at this point

579
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and is almost robotic and able to relay to her

580
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
at three minutes and 33 seconds.

581
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We've got a footage of the corn at four minutes and 56 seconds

582
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
is when the interview starts.

583
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It ends at 593.

584
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
He's just running down a list from memory

585
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
of what he shot in a time stamp.

586
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Here's where the star wipe should go.

587
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Julius, don't forget the crabs.

588
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh, and the crabs.

589
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Wait, Julius?

590
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Julius says is what I meant.

591
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Nailed that.

592
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Absolutely nailed it.

593
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Like a man slipping on a floor covered in marbles.

594
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And then landing perfectly on his feet.

595
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Julius' mind is mostly in his pocket and in that walkway.

596
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, wow.

597
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I mean, yeah, dude, you're probably deep in some nostalgia here.

598
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's weird.

599
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I know that feeling.

600
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The smell.

601
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The marble floors of your youth.

602
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Ooh.

603
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Smell that marble.

604
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Ooh, that smell.

605
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Very cool.

606
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Vivica gets going and is just at the exact pace of your notes.

607
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's cracking the fuck out of this edit.

608
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
She is on like seven monitors at the same time.

609
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We do the thing from NCIS where we're both typing on the same keyboard.

610
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yes.

611
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Dude, we've got some really talented professionals here at Cannes.

612
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh, absolutely.

613
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Cannes is city action news.

614
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Julius is admiring in the very center of this room

615
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
the see-through dry erase board

616
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
that you can totally get right on both sides of.

617
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, my God.

618
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Nice.

619
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Traffic, sports, weather, news.

620
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Cannes, Cannes.

621
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And then you see in the lineup is the farmer segment

622
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
is lined up in that three-quarter slot.

623
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's not right at the top, but it's safely nuzzled in.

624
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
There are a couple commercial breaks from the beginning

625
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
like stay tuned for the farm thing.

626
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh, yeah.

627
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Absolutely.

628
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Coming up, a look at the Godel farm acquisition program.

629
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
She turns back to you and she says,

630
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
okay, do we want to keep any of this passion and bleep it

631
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
or are we just cutting all that?

632
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We're going to keep and bleep

633
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and put obviously explicit warning before we air the segment.

634
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh, that's good.

635
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And she pulls up this like dong dong music

636
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
that's like really intense with this.

637
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
There's some image that's like blurred in the background that looks tense,

638
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
some sort of discordant scene happening behind words

639
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
that ominously say viewer discretion is advised.

640
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Hey, make sure on the promos we need to have the crab man.

641
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
For real? Like really?

642
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
If you were watching the news and you saw a crab man,

643
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
aren't you going to stay tuned until you see what the crab man is?

644
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Wow.

645
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I guess that's why they hired you as the producer,

646
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
she says, is she's just like click clacking away.

647
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I got some good footage of him at 1205.

648
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Fucking rad.

649
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We just put this thing together and then we are ready to go.

650
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
When you show the end result to Cal Colorado,

651
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
you call him into the room to be like, hey, we've got the 90 seconds up.

652
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Can I make one thing?

653
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I do want Julius to ensure that there is at least one good clip of Cal in this segment.

654
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Cal.

655
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah, Cal comes in and he watches the segment

656
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and he sees that shot that didn't really have to be there.

657
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
He's kind of quiet and he's just like, good work, good work, team.

658
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm sorry, I need to use the restroom.

659
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And he kind of runs out crying.

660
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And if you look out the door, you see the rest of the news team,

661
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
the anchor and the sports person and the weather person,

662
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
all kind of laughing in a huddle.

663
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh, no, man.

664
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Julius sees all of that happen and looks over at Beck,

665
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
90% angry and 10% a little just sad.

666
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Beck did the last segment producer typically cut out all of Cal's screen time.

667
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, unfortunately.

668
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Oof.

669
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And it sucks because he's good at what he does.

670
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Vivica is like, wow, I think you're building a strong team.

671
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
She says to the producer and holds out her hand.

672
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
She says, Vivica Johnston.

673
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Julius shakes her hand and says, I don't plan on being sick much,

674
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
but if I'm not here, there's always a shot at Cal.

675
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Good to know.

676
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Thank you.

677
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I think Beck swells with a little bit of pride to hear that.

678
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He's happy to hear that.

679
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And then Julius says, where's my uncle?

680
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Isn't it nap time?

681
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You see a PA who's like running around like a...

682
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
A chicken with its head cut off?

683
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Man, I really didn't want to say that, huh?

684
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Trigger warning if you're a chicken.

685
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Trigger warning animal cruelty.

686
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Sorry, running around like a person with their head cut off.

687
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That's right.

688
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
There's a young man with his head cut off running around outside,

689
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
screaming, wait, how?

690
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Out of the hole above his shoulders?

691
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
That is legitimately terrifying.

692
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This is where the horror starts.

693
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Such a good horror podcast.

694
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Oops, not yet.

695
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
The blood is squirting out of his jugular and reaching the top of the building.

696
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Beck wants to investigate the headless man?

697
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I would too.

698
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
He can't because there's a segment producer yelling at that headless man for getting blood.

699
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Jeremy, the window cleaners just came.

700
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You're running around like a chicken with your head cut off.

701
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Jeremy pops in and he's like,

702
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Hey guys, I'm just trying to find Cal.

703
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Type what's Cal.

704
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And you guys too, if you want to go on up there.

705
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
He's in the restroom, dude. We'll get him there though.

706
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Okay, yeah, he's really weighing on you guys.

707
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So if you want to get up there fast, do you guys need anything?

708
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Coffee's busted.

709
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Julius is going to test this out.

710
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Oat milk latte?

711
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Oat milk latte?

712
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, there's a place about four blocks down.

713
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Sure.

714
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Iced hot.

715
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Okay, iced hot.

716
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Iced hot.

717
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Gross.

718
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Beck wants two energy drinks, but we're going to wait until we get sponsored by one before I name one.

719
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
That's smart.

720
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But it's two of the same energy drink.

721
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I think we can comfortably punch in Monster now.

722
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Man, I love energy drink.

723
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Truly, I pop one open in the morning, bam, I'm ready to go.

724
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Well, my favorite thing is how good and healthy for you energy drink is.

725
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Right, the ingredients list, have you looked at it?

726
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That's just my opinion, that claim has not been approved by the FDA.

727
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You're a doctor.

728
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh, no, I was lying to you, Zach.

729
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh.

730
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Wait.

731
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So, yeah, listeners, Zach, Joe, Luke, I lied about my credentials to get on this podcast.

732
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I am not a doctor.

733
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So when you said your name is Dr. Cox and that you were a urologist, and I did, and you, that was a lie?

734
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah, wasn't it weird that I made you examine my penis?

735
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You're a great teacher.

736
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
All right.

737
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Where are those rails?

738
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Let's find them.

739
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah, they're right in front of you.

740
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I know, let's get back to them.

741
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
No, no, no, I love like walking alongside them.

742
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's an enjoyable.

743
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Fair enough, let's walk alongside them.

744
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Stand by me-ing.

745
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I do want to see a dead body.

746
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Well, let's get to it.

747
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Zach's like, I've got a really spooky segment for you guys.

748
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
The bathroom is on the way to Ty's office, so Beck just kind of taps on the door.

749
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Hey, Cal, we're being called to the big man's office.

750
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Oh, okay, well, just give me a minute.

751
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I got some coffee on my tie.

752
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
If you need a tissue to get the coffee out, I mean, uh, I got one.

753
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
A hand just pops out from like the door.

754
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
He does, in one of his cargo shorts, have a little travel thing of tissues.

755
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You just hear...

756
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
as he blows his nose.

757
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
All right, see you in there, man.

758
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Well, there's like a deep, deep sigh as he collects himself,

759
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and then a smiling, beautiful Cal Colorado pops out,

760
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and you might notice his eyes are a little red, but probably not.

761
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Probably not. It looks like maybe he applied some makeup in there.

762
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Cal, uh, heavy lunch?

763
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Are you calling me fat?

764
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
He runs back into the bathroom.

765
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Julius thinks, I just didn't want to call him a crybaby.

766
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You gotta learn how to deal with the talent, man.

767
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Julius is looking at Beck like, I mean, what do we do?

768
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Beck is kind of giving you an open arm shrug.

769
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
He's a complicated guy. Sometimes you just gotta give him some space.

770
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
He, like, elbows Beck.

771
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He's just, you know, so talented.

772
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't know why he's, he's, uh, just, he's gotta pee so much, apparently.

773
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And then I look at Beck, like, shaking my head, like, was that good?

774
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah, Cal hears all that and, like, flushes the toilet,

775
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
but then immediately comes out.

776
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
As soon as you pop out, Vivica Johnston, the editor,

777
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
pops her head out of the bay and looks out to you and says, Cal!

778
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
She points at Julius.

779
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You got a really good one. He's not a Marvin, alright?

780
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Cal's head is clearly elsewhere, but he, he kind of blinks and collects himself

781
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and looks over at her and, like, gives her a thumbs up and, and pats Julius on the back.

782
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Julius really appreciates that, because he's grown up knowing who Marvin is,

783
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
and he knows that as his last act, he had the marbles torn up from the walkway.

784
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Marvin is the only person, Marvin slipped.

785
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah, he's the only person that had managed to slip on the marbles.

786
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
After, after, like, 15 years at the station, he slips on his last day.

787
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Everybody thought it was pretty suspicious.

788
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But Marvin is suing the studio and the network because of those fucking marbles.

789
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Holy shit.

790
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Hearing that I'm not like him is awesome, but Julius already knew it.

791
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Before you can even, like, look back, Vivica is, uh, very much headphones on, back to click clacking.

792
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Vivica is a professional.

793
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Julius didn't know where the editing bay was, but he definitely knows where his uncle's office is,

794
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
because he's been gone there for a long time.

795
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Awesome. Well, but also the fun thing is that now he does know.

796
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That's true. He's learning.

797
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
He learned today.

798
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
On the job training.

799
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So as you guys are making your way up there, uh, you do pass.

800
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You're making our way up there.

801
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Walking past.

802
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Walking past the anchor weather person in the sports guy.

803
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
This is my uncle.

804
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We're gonna talk to him.

805
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Alright, and they're, uh, they're chilling at Crafty.

806
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
They're, uh, they're hanging out and just shooting the shit over some bagels.

807
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
At Crafty?

808
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
At the Craft Service.

809
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Craft Services, bruh.

810
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah, I knew what he meant.

811
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's locks, but it's not smoked.

812
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
We're hanging out at K-Town.

813
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Craft Services is provided by Craft.

814
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's sponsored by Craft.

815
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
There's a vat of macaroni and cheese.

816
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Little smokies wrapped in singles.

817
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Little smokies and mac and cheese.

818
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
There's one of those big wooden planks, like you would put a really nice charcuterie board on,

819
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
but it's just got a shitload of Craft singles on it.

820
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Listen, I don't know what you guys have, you know, have planned for my next birthday.

821
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Do you want to go to the Springfield Underground to look at the cheese?

822
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And eat a charcuterie board of Craft?

823
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes, I do.

824
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
As you, uh, are gonna pass them, they, uh, are kind of snickering and whispering.

825
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You hear Isabella Kaya, who's the head anchor now at Cannes, who took over for Cal Colorado, and she...

826
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
We were co-anchors for...

827
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Oh!

828
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Two and a half years.

829
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Nice.

830
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I mean, bummer, but nice.

831
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And now there's not another co-anchor.

832
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
She is just the lead.

833
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Nope, she has got it.

834
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And...

835
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Fool!

836
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yeah.

837
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
She really reminded Cal of his daughter, Carol.

838
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
He thought he had taken her under his wing and really, like, mentored this person.

839
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah.

840
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And it wasn't her decision to swap out the anchor spots, but Cal lost a lot.

841
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
On her first day as a solo anchor, she said, well, now over to me.

842
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And then did the next story.

843
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And as you guys are walking up the stairs on the way to Taif Raylan's office, she calls up after you.

844
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh, Cal!

845
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I heard you did a wonderful job on your farmer segment.

846
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Well, not only did I do a wonderful job, but my team here did a wonderful job.

847
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
As you look at your team, you're kind of, like, beaming with pride.

848
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
As you look back, her back is turned, and she is talking with the others.

849
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It doesn't really go with his methods or preferences, but the viewer discretion, like, stab, then...

850
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Julius.

851
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Julius added.

852
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:27,000
He's pretty confident that she's going to open her soda when she sees that.

853
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh, she's going to open her soda, all right.

854
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Can you cut that into something?

855
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Should I say it all again?

856
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:44,000
He may not like the sensationalism, but he knows that Julius' crab people stab and content warning is definitely going to, like, get some eyes.

857
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Classic crab stab.

858
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
He just says, yeah, you have a good one too, Isabella.

859
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
When Beck sees that her back is already turned, he's flipping her off.

860
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But you made sure to wait until she was all the way turned around.

861
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Cal is like, Beck.

862
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Sorry, man.

863
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But fuck her, dude.

864
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Cal is like, I may have to go to HR after my meeting with Typh.

865
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I think he said he wanted to butt fuck her.

866
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
That is not appropriate.

867
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Jesus fucking Christ.

868
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You guys head up the stairs to Typh Raylan's office.

869
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It is double-doored and Typh's door is closed.

870
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You knock on the thick oak doors that have glass on both sides of them so you can actually see, like, fully into his office.

871
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But these huge wooden doors are installed so that you understand what kind of office you're about to walk into.

872
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
What was that knock?

873
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And is that the secret family knock?

874
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Oh, is that the Raylan knock?

875
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Will you cut this out later and send it to me so that I can say yes and know what it is?

876
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
What is it?

877
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Hold on.

878
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
What's happening?

879
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
That's it, yeah.

880
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Is it State Farm?

881
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Not quite that.

882
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Anyway.

883
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah, it's exactly that.

884
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You can switch it up to, we are farmers.

885
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Oh, that's what we're thinking of.

886
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
State Farm.

887
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
We are State Farm. Liberty, Liberty, Liberty.

888
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

889
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Affleck.

890
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Dude, Affleck doesn't cob knock.

891
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You just start pounding on his door and screaming, insurance, insurance.

892
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
He knows the knock.

893
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It was all of that.

894
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It was all of that.

895
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Oh, no.

896
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You heard from the other side of the door him singing along.

897
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Holy shit.

898
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And once you heard Affleck, you hear him go, Affleck.

899
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You may enter.

900
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:34,000
As soon as I hear him kind of respond from inside, first thing, hey, uncle, from now on, how about you'll just know it's me?

901
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
What do you mean?

902
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Like, just maybe one of like, and then it's me?

903
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh, come on.

904
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You don't do the whole knock.

905
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You're not a real Rayland.

906
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That's what we say, right?

907
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And you want to be a real Rayland and he's literally putting his fingers in your gut and like poking you.

908
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Mr. Rayland, could I just say that your nephew here has just performed.

909
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yeah, come on, come on.

910
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Sit down, sit down.

911
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Hey, come on.

912
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm so glad that you're here, Cal.

913
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Yeah, come on.

914
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Sit down.

915
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Thank you.

916
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You were saying?

917
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I was saying that your nephew has performed admirably on his first assignment and that,

918
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
you know, honestly, the whole office is talking about this.

919
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Since you can see us through the glass, do we need these crazy knocks?

920
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
He thinks about it.

921
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
He's beaming with pride while he's staring at Julius and he's like, do we need the crazy knocks?

922
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't know.

923
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Do I need to give my little nephew a hug?

924
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yes, I do.

925
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Come here, baby.

926
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Happily, Julius.

927
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You did a good job.

928
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
He goes from very sad thinking about the last name situation and then gives his uncle a big ol' hug.

929
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Wait, it's the last name situation that you don't have the same last name?

930
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Summers.

931
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
That is correct.

932
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Julius Summers.

933
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I mean, you're a nephew.

934
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Couldn't you just be his sister's son?

935
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I am his sister's son.

936
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Whoa.

937
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Mystery solved.

938
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You already used luck, so that should get a point back.

939
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
You nailed it.

940
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah, I'm sorry, but did I not just deduce the fuck out of that?

941
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
He just deduced the fuck out of that.

942
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
He forgot Luke's character's last name.

943
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Oh, you must be his sister's son.

944
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah, it's not weird that I have a different last name.

945
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's just the fact that I do have a different last name.

946
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
He lifts Julius off the ground and he's like, I'm so proud of you.

947
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
On your second day, you're getting big ups from the great cow Colorado.

948
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
He gives you knocks, Beck.

949
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Beck is kind of getting stoked just off of his stokedness.

950
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah.

951
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
He enthusiastically knuckles back.

952
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Now, I got something, ooh, I got something weird.

953
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I got something weird, okay?

954
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's not normal, yeah, it's not normal, okay, but it's for Cal.

955
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hmm, how do I say this?

956
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:39,000
A woman called in, yeah, and she said that she's got a hot heater of a story.

957
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah, all right, okay?

958
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
But she won't talk to anyone, no one, except Cal Colorado.

959
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So we got to send you out.

960
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And she said it's urgent, so we have to go right now.

961
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Before the broadcast even starts, yeah?

962
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Typh, I know it's been a while since I've been in the anchor chair,

963
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
but typically, these are just women looking to sexually harass me.

964
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Hmm, so I'm sorry to hear that, but in this situation,

965
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
she really seems like she's got something.

966
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
She said she had a hot story just for Cal.

967
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Okay, what she said was that she can't call the cops,

968
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and that if we can get in there and get the story first, you see,

969
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
then maybe we can run it before anybody else.

970
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
What do you guys think about this?

971
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
We go, if the story's true, we get good content.

972
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
If it's false, we spin it into exposing the perverts of the city.

973
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Ooh, my man's got a mind on him, yeah, my man's got a good brain.

974
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I mean, we'd be kind of like using Cal as bait in that case,

975
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
but it sounds like a story to me.

976
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I've never seen such good-looking bait in my life, look at him!

977
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Oh, he's perfect, yeah?

978
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
If you didn't have those beautiful blue eyes, I wouldn't even suggest it.

979
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And I look at Bag like, is it working, is it working?

980
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Turn the thing down, put it in reverse.

981
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Gentlemen, this is not journalism.

982
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's almost something more than that.

983
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I got chills, I got chills, I got spinglies in the back of my tingle.

984
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Cal got chills too, but in a bad way.

985
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh, come on, let's go. Let's go, Cal, what do you want?

986
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
What do you want? What can I do for you?

987
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
He's looking confused at Julius and he's like,

988
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
what more is there than journalism?

989
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's the human condition.

990
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, you can get a story out of anything if you're smart enough like my man here.

991
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Is the story true?

992
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
There's only one way to find out.

993
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And if it's not, like Julius said, that's the story.

994
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You know, what this makes me think of is you see these and he gestures to his thighs.

995
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Sometimes I squeeze watermelons and I squeeze them so hard

996
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
that the juice comes out of every part of that watermelon down to the last drop.

997
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And what we need to do is be my thighs and squeeze a story out of this phone call.

998
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I feel like the risk-reward here is pretty high.

999
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If she does have something juicy, we need a good story.

1000
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
So either she has something juicy or I'm the something juicy.

1001
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It sounded like she was in a real situation, okay?

1002
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Ty, if you told me when I switched from news desk to field reporter

1003
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
that if I did things well, points would be earned.

1004
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah.

1005
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Points that would maybe get me back to my desk.

1006
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah, 100. This is a lot of points.

1007
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
If you hold up your end of the bargain, I will do this thing for you.

1008
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
He reaches out his hand.

1009
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Is he going for a fist bump or a handshake?

1010
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Oh, it's definitely a fist bump.

1011
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Cal reaches out for a handshake and then awkwardly goes for a fist bump.

1012
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
As he awkwardly goes for a handshake on your fist.

1013
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And no hands are shook and no deal is actually made.

1014
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
He grabs your fist and is like, yeah, now we're talking.

1015
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Okay, boys.

1016
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Bec grabs both their hands.

1017
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Get your hand in here, Julius.

1018
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Get your hand in here.

1019
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
He's like texting with one hand and touching the hand.

1020
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can.

1021
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Whoa.

1022
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Becca's jumping up and down.

1023
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yeah, do you feel it?

1024
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Okay, let's go.

1025
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And he slams a piece of paper down on the desk which has an address on it.

1026
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Cal salutes you and says, can, can.

1027
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Skrrr.

1028
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
We see the can van slide out of its parking spot in the can parking lot.

1029
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And you see we have all ran to the can van.

1030
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
The, the can van peels out of the parking lot with no one in it.

1031
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
As you guys chase after it.

1032
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What?

1033
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Uh, I, okay, now we've got a mystery for season two.

1034
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Yeah.

1035
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Can I ask, uh, in character, does Cal know why he was demoted to field anchor?

1036
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yes.

1037
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Okay.

1038
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And then out of character, do you have something already?

1039
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Yes.

1040
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Cool.

1041
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And how long has it been since that?

1042
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Six months.

1043
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I didn't mean to derail us.

1044
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You were on a mission there getting us to an end place.

1045
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
You're so good at that Joe.

1046
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I just was curious.

1047
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You're the one, you're always the one doing it.

1048
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's not, it's not me or Luke.

1049
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It's you.

1050
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It's you.

1051
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's you.

1052
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I want to have a baby with you.

1053
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I want to have a baby with you.

1054
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I want to get pregnant.

1055
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I want to get pregnant with you.

1056
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Jesus Christ.

1057
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Oh man.

1058
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
All right.

1059
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Call him.

1060
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
What were we talking about?

1061
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
That's all it was.

1062
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Cause I wondered if there was a chance that Cal didn't even know, but he's been told that

1063
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
he's done now on a good point system to get back.

1064
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I didn't know if that was something that you didn't know what you were trying to redeem

1065
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
yourself for yet or not.

1066
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
No, he knows what he's redeeming himself for.

1067
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I think the point system is probably pretty amorphous and fluid.

1068
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Sure.

1069
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Um, and is just a scam.

1070
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh, you're maybe not real.

1071
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Exactly.

1072
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah.

1073
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Like would he take this unscrupulous job to get back to his dream job?

1074
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yeah.

1075
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
He's never seen any part of working at can as unscrupulous and he's not, maybe it's just

1076
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
been so long since he's been in the field, but he didn't even realize how like down and

1077
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
dirty, maybe typhon is his field boys were getting.

1078
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Oh yeah.

1079
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Then pulls out onto one of the perfectly gridlocked, perfectly perpendicular roads of the city.

1080
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And immediately you're stuck in traffic.

1081
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
You get a text from typh.

1082
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It just says, I ain't seen no tick tock yet.

1083
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Oh fuck.

1084
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
That's what it was.

1085
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That is wow.

1086
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Like, God damn it.

1087
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You totally did say that.

1088
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You said that?

1089
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Cal hasn't read that text yet, but Thomas's heart just sank.

1090
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Really good timing to bring it up.

1091
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
How do you break it to Cal who is clearly playing candy crush on his phone and hasn't

1092
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
seen the text?

1093
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Well, since we're stuck here in traffic, uh, we might as well do some man on the street.

1094
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Sorry that you were going to say tick tock for tick tock.

1095
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Do you hand your phone to Beck?

1096
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yes.

1097
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's already logged in.

1098
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I'm logged into the can talk.

1099
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm talking to Cal.

1100
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
This, this thing that they've been trying out here, it's like to get younger viewers

1101
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
engaged more or something.

1102
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Like I'm not big on it myself, but I understand it.

1103
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Have you ever like, um, popped and locked?

1104
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'm sorry.

1105
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Are you asking me if I've committed a robbery?

1106
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
No.

1107
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Um, and he turns to Julius, if he like patted his head and rubbed his belly, is that like

1108
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
a challenge?

1109
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You know?

1110
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I love everything we've done so far.

1111
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
This is not like any role playing we've ever done before.

1112
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I think it's good.

1113
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Um, yeah.

1114
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I like it.

1115
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Me too.

1116
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
You guys are like supporting each other and shit.

1117
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's wild.

1118
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
The hardest part of waking up is deciding what to wear.

1119
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But today I woke up missing me and it's been downhill from there.

1120
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
One, two, three, four!

1121
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Why don't you tell me what you think of me?

1122
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Cause I don't really think of you.

1123
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I don't recognize myself.

1124
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
What you did was a stinky thing to do.

1125
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
No cure for being freaking stupid.

1126
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So take it or leave it.

1127
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Cause it's not getting any better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better!

1128
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
This is my coming of age.

1129
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
This train don't have no brakes.

1130
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
That's too bad.

1131
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That's my least favorite time.

1132
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Have a happy birthday old friend.

1133
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I hope this isn't the end but if it is, it'll be alright.

1134
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

1135
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

1136
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I don't need you to apologize.

1137
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I just need you to fix it.

1138
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I'm sick of waiting on someone to wait on me.

1139
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Cause last time I missed it.

1140
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
If you tell me to get over it.

1141
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's not your business.

1142
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'll skip away into the sunset and whistle to the tune of it.

1143
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
This is my coming of age.

1144
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
This train don't have no brakes.

1145
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Have a happy birthday old friend.

1146
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I hope this isn't the end.

1147
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It'll finally be alright.

1148
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

1149
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

1150
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

1151
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Today I woke up missing me.

1152
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I forgot her yesterday.

1153
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Where I left my made up enemies and this song was not a thing.

1154
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And the truth is this is 100% real.

1155
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Cause my life is wonderful and I blame it on me.
