00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
What's good, the internet. It is your web-savvy zaddy, Wolf the Dog. Net.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
And we're coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station powered by Geocities.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now, speaking of the World Wide Web and all of the beauty contained within,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Gary in Scarborough, England,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
which is a thing you are also more than welcome to do.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Gary writes,

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Howdy, Wolf.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
It's your brother and long-time listener from across the pond.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
I hope this finds you well and know that you should come here to Scarborough, Wolfie.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
That's if you don't mind fighting off mutant-sized seagulls up at the castle

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
for that extra tasty grease you love oh so much.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
I hear it will make you howl so hard you taste colors.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Anyway, I love the podcast that you, Zach, and the boys are providing for us folks.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Keep up the great work and a big shout-out to my girlfriend, Mel, and my buddy, Paul.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Well, hello, Brother Gary. You talkin' about castle slop?

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
And all I gotta do is beat some seagull ass to get a taste?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Sign me up, Brother Gary.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
I hope I'm not being too sea-gullible here by accepting this travel invitation.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
If you want to write up something for your Web 2.0 Wolf to Howl,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
or write a five-star review and send us that screenshot.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Word of mouth through social media has been instrumental in getting this podcast to where it is today.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
And I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
If you, too, have these feelings, you may find a nice community to join in our Discord or subreddit.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
And if you want to give us money so we don't stop making this show,

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
you can do that on Patreon or our merch shop.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
The links are in the show notes.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Now, it's time to catch up, but don't get confused.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Wolf don't work for Can, but it's time for the news.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Last time, we were introduced to Julius Summers,

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
the fresh-faced, thick-legged field producer who was just hired by his uncle, Typh Rayland,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
the executive producer for the City Action News.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Julius picked up the former lead anchor of Can, Cal Colorado,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
an elderly statesman of news in the city,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
as well as their Hawaiian shirt-rocking cameraman, Beck Wilder.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
The three put together a segment about the Godel Company,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
top of the agricultural food chain,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
buying up all the farmland just outside the city,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
taking us now to that story as it unfolds.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
It's All My Fault.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
No one knows what it's like

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
behind these eyes.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Welcome to episode two of Pretending to Be People.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I had the Kelly Clarkson Hazel Eyes song stuck in my head.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Do you remember that Guitar Hero 2 song that was like,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
you got radium eyes, never listened to it since.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
No, but do you know about the radium girls?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
No, what are the radium girls?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I do know about them.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
So radium, before people really knew about how dangerous radioactive was,

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
it was kind of a craze to put radium in shit, including makeup.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
At least the radium girls I know of, it was watches.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
And they would lick the brushes as they put the dots on.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Yes, and that's why their jaws fell off.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
They're all fine though?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Well, they would be dead. This happened.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
They would be dead anyway, but they would not be fine.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
No matter what, they would not be fine right now.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
But they were not fine while they were still alive

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
because their fucking jaws fell off

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
because of the radium paint and the watch dials, right?

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, it was probably the noon, three, six, and nine.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
But they would dip the brushes in radium

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
and to get a fine point on the brush.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't know about fetishized, but they were looked up upon

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
because they kind of glowed.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
They called the radium girls, they were like angels.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Talk about unachievable beauty standards, you know what I mean?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
That radium glow?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Truly, truly unattainable.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I photoshop all my porn to be slightly for life.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I'm sorry, you photoshop your what?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
My porn?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah, you photoshop it?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah, to have a radium glow.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
So you put in work ahead of time or during?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
During.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Oh, okay. Ask the answer.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
That's just a filter pass, that's easy.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
There's a book called The Radium Girls,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
The Dark Story of America's Shining Women.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Is it erotica?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It is for me.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
But there was also a movie that I think flopped

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
but it had an early Joey King in it.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Who?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
In 2018.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
The guy from Kingaroo Jack, I think.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Kingaroo Jack.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Let's go around and talk about these characters.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
I want physical descriptions to remind us of who these people are

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
and what they wear on a day to day basis

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
and just like the vibe they give off.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Let's start with Joe.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Beck, he's got a closet full of Hawaiian shirts,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
patterned shirts but mostly Hawaiian shirts.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Beck Wilder.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Beck Wilder.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Beck Wilder.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
He's a little bit slovenly.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Sometimes buttons are mismatched on his shirts.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
He obviously doesn't care a whole lot about his appearance.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
He often just throws a baseball cap over his messy hair.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
His outward appearance is almost buffoonery.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Oh, you had mentioned his shorts as well.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Oh, yeah.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
He's got confident shorts.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
He's got the cargoiest of shorts.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, he's got a craftsman's shorts.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
We're talking loops.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
We're talking pockets.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
So many pockets, dude.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Oh, my God.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
He's lost things in there before.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
We're talking carabiners with all kinds of weird attachments.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
He's thought about going full pants just to have more space for pockets,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
but he just loves the breeze on his calves.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
He needs to look into those zip-offs.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh, he does.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
He should have zip-offs.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
But he might leave the things in the zip-offed pockets somewhere by accident.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Wow.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
That's the thing that Beck would definitely do.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
That's forward thinking.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Know yourself, Beck Wilder.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
Hey, Slacker, is he canonically kin to Van Wilder?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
No.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I hadn't thought about that, but that's good.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
That was a sharp no.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
A hard no.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
A hard no.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Sorry, listeners, because Joe just shut off the National Lampoon's Wilder world.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Write that down for us.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah, no Van Wilder.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
Right, but our ride, he does call Van Wilder.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
That's what Beck calls it.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
That's what he calls his sweet Krieger van that he has.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Beck, who's the person that you interact with most?

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Who's the person that you text most, call most, the person you see most?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
His mom.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
And what's her name?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Boy.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Her name's Boy Wilder?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yep.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
It sure does seem like a thing I should have thought of.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I like Boy Wilder.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Not really.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I think Boy Wilder is your mom's name, man.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Zach just kind of sprung that on you after saying we wouldn't be using bonds, so.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
I didn't mean that your characters wouldn't know people.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
You said we are loners and don't know us little person.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah, we're weird.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
No bonds.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
No friends.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
No gods.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
No family.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
No kings.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
In our former lives, we were only friends with each other, and so we haven't gotten to

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
that point yet.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Well, we haven't gotten to us describing our characters, but I do think for Cal, his legitimate

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
answer is Beck.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Ah, interesting.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Kim.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Kim Wilder is Beck's mom.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Cool.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
What was wrong with Boy?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Just a different three-letter name.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Kim Wilder is your mom, and what kind of relationship do you have with Kim?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Pretty iffy.

08:38.000 --> 08:47.000
We're close as far as we probably talk to each other every day, but it's a weird relationship.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
He doesn't like his mom a whole lot.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Joe, my God.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Joe, my God.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Joe.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
He did not silence his phone.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
My phone was not on silent.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
That's true.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
You're kicked out of the Alamo draft house.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I got the ticket thing.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
It's exceedingly decent here.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
20 bucks, movie every day.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Oh, no.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
That actually, that shit.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
It's so sick.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
It's a really good deal.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
It's a movie pass type deal, and I hope it doesn't mean that Alamo is about to go under

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
grade.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
It is.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
The second they weren't making that delicious cold brew anymore, I knew that it was...

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Man, their menu is so parsed down now.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Luke can't get his Italian sodas.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
I can't get my fucking cream soda.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
I will say, dude, past two times I've been, horrible service.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Oh, bummer.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Dude, I literally, I went and saw Top Gun.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It took an hour and a half to get my food.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Oh, shit.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Like almost the end of the night.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh, that sucks.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
That's awful.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Cold fried cauliflower.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Counterpoint, I had great service the last time I went.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Well, they've added that button, which I feel like now I get immediate service.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
Oh, the thing is Luke didn't press the button for an hour and a half.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
No, I literally got there early, ordered it, and then...

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Oh, you got there too early.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
No, I got there, I was probably one of the last people to do that.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Luke, we're pretty sure this is something you did.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
We are really trying to turn this around on you, aren't you?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Hey, Luke, I'm sorry that happened to you.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Hey, here's what I'll say.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
It was a full, I didn't, I wasn't even that mad because it was a full theater, two servers

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
for the whole thing.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Oh, yeah, that's hard.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
That is hard.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Well, but you're the guy I know who's been there the most, so probably you just suck

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
at going there.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
You're probably just bad at it.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
You don't know what you're doing.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I'll have to look up tips and tricks, I guess.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Tips and tricks.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Did you not Google Alamo Drafthouse tips and tricks Reddit before you went?

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
Usually I do like FAQ or like a walkthrough, so that I don't have to buy the book at Walmart.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Beck Wilder has an iffy relationship with his mother, Kim Wilder.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's talk a little bit about Julia Summers.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Wait, real quick.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
What does your mom look like?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Oh, yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Hit us with that mom look.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
She's a...

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Make her hot.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
No, she's a...

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Make her so hot.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
She's a far side woman with the beehive and the cat eye glasses.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
And you said you weren't going to make her hot?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I was going to say, I think we convinced him.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Does she have a fat lip?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Fat lip.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Far side.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
When's the last time you saw a far side comic?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
And, uh, Julia Summers.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Wait, what is the fat lip reference?

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
So, The Far Side, which is a rap group, hip-hop.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Uh, with a C-Y.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah, The Far Side, F-P-H-A-R-C-Y-D-E.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Not the classic single panel cartoon by Gary Lawson.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Fat lip.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Nice.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Julia Summers.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Julia is walking into the party like his name is...

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
I don't know that.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Is that a far side reference?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
No, it's a fat lip reference.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Some 41.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Plus 44?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
No, some 41.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Quick rundown on Julia Summers.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
You look at him at a glance.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
5'6".

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Monochromatic suit.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Depending on the day of the week, tan, black, grey, blue.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Short king.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Short king, big thighs.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
How tall is he?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
5'6".

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Is that short?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Sorry.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
That's about how tall I am.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
It's a poor one.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
No, you're like...

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I'm like 5'7", maybe.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Short king.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
We need to re-measure you.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I don't think you're that much shorter.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I think you're taller than me too.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Yeah, I think you're taller than that.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Yeah, guys, I'm 6'5".

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Go back, if you're new to listening to this, go back on our social media.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Check at PretendingPod on Instagram.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
You will see that I tower over these guys.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
We post tons of pictures of us just like hanging out and doing our own shit.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
A lot of us standing side by side so that you can compare how tall I am to these guys.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah, see if you can figure out which one Luke is based on this conversation.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
You should definitely check out our lineup shot if you really want to get some inside

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
of this.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
We have all of our mug shots on there.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Anyway.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Julie Summers, monochromatic suits.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Lives in the suburbs outside of the city with his roommate.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Suburbs.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
That's who he spends the most time with.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, sick.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Who's his roommate?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
He moved to this house.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
He just bought this house, but he needs a roommate to afford it.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And it's a lady that he found on Craigslist.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Cool.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
What's her name?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Her name?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
He hasn't found it out yet.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Named her yet.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
He just moved in.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Oh, or did she introduce herself and you just don't remember?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
That is what happened.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Julie Summers, producer.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Not good with names.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Nephew of my uncle.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
I'm not great with names either, and I just want to say it's fucked up that names are

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
the first thing we say instead of the last when we're meeting people.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
I always say, I've been Joe Terry.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
This has been Joe Terry.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
It was a pleasure meeting me.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
You've been enjoying the sonic sounds of Joe Terry.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Hey, what's your name?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Let me describe what I look like first.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Getting a little fresh here, huh?

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Don't you want to know about my outfits and bonds?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Julia Summers is here because of nepotism.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
His uncle, Tife Rayland.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Rayland.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Tife Rayland.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
Tife Rayland is your uncle and he is the executive producer of the City Action News.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
He is, how would you describe him?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I'd say darn good at his job.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Demanding, but rewarding.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
You know, he is also my uncle's.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I don't think I can say anything bad.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Well, he's my whole, he's my whole uncle.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
He asked you to do something.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Go to the farm.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
And then he also asked you to do one more thing.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
I think he said it twice and he said, you definitely need to remember to do this.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
I don't think you ever said you definitely need to remember to do this.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Maybe not in those words.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Hold on, Zach.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
This is not in my notes, which doesn't mean anything on its own.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
But Joe made a face at that.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
And it's not in his notes, which means.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Someone's lying.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Someone didn't say what they were supposed to say.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
He changed his tone and said, no, I'm real serious this time.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Okay.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
You have to make it 90 seconds.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
That's really, I grasped onto 90 seconds and then I didn't really do that.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
You did.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
And but then every interaction you were like, this needs to be 90 seconds instead of just the whole segment.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
But that's Luke trying to remember.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Sure.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me there.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Not even Joe remembers.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
This is so rude.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Yeah, I don't got it, but.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Here's the deal.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Whatever I rolled, I think.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
This is a horror podcast.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Are you scared?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
What was I rolling on?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I think you failed.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
It's a 98, but you know, just making sure.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Julius doesn't have a 99 intelligence, does he?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
No.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
All right, Julius, I guess you'll find out in character.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Let's go to Cal, Colorado.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Remind me of what you look like, sir.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
Cal, Colorado is in his late fifties, but he's tall and handsome for his age.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Handsome at any age.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
That's why he's on TV.

16:21.000 --> 16:28.000
He wears, um, Julius mentioned that a lot of his suits he inherited from his dad and they have nineties cuts.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Cal has the exact same cuts.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Do you guys match?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Wait, how tall are you?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I think he's like 6'3".

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Go huge.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
He's 6'3".

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I'm 6'7".

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
I am 9 feet tall and 400 pounds.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I lean down to interview you.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
My voice shakes the glass when I speak.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
All right, so just like a normal height.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah, 6'3", average height.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I'm not as tall, like as short as Luke, but that hurts.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
The average height is generally around 6'6".

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
He was reading that off of his phone for those of you listening at home.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
And now he's showing me his phone from too far away to read to fact check.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Average height in the NBA.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Auto-correct, I guess.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Well, I mean, that's an important point.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
Cal was great on his college basketball team, but he didn't have the stuff to go pro.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
He always thought if he had three extra inches, he might have been able to do that.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
But he was pretty happy with his career until now.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Did he go to City State U?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
No, actually he went to the Missouri.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
He went to the University of Missouri School of Journalism.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Oh, very nice.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I went to that for a year.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Really?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
The journalism school?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Hell yeah.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Who is Cal Colorado's closest human contact?

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
So yeah, currently, as far as like most frequent contact, it's Beck.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
Julius just got here, but we've been out on these segments for a few months now, I think.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Cool.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
As far as the person he's closest to in life, that's his daughter, Carol Colorado.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Carol Colorado.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
We talked about this a little in Session Zero, and it may manifest itself more organically,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
but just to throw it out there, I think that we said that you and I get along pretty well.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Like, even though I'm kind of the opposite of everything you are.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
So one thing that Cal does not have is any kind of technology skills.

18:19.000 --> 18:27.000
He was a handsome dude on TV all through like the 80s and 90s, and he did not have to learn how to use computers.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
So he really appreciates the tech guys who get shit done.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Sure.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Does he consider Beck like a magician?

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
Well, kind of. He's like, anything you need, I know Beck can do.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
He does consider Beck a magician when he's like, hey Beck, can you fix my phone for me?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Fix my phone for me.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
You had it locked in portrait mode. Here you go.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
There was just a hair on your screen.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Do I have games on this?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
What's your relationship like with your daughter?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It's strained, and we'll leave it at that.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Okay. Does she live in the city?

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
No. She lives in a city, but she lives many states away.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
In a city?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
You live in the city.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
The city.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah, we live in the city.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
Beck lives with his mom, and he's going to hear it that he didn't say bye to her when he left this morning.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Awesome.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Does he hang dong around his mom?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Oh, yeah. Did we get a reading on Beck's dong?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Oh, it was hanging out of his pants.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Spilling. I think this is spilling.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
We're tighty-whities.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
You're an excellent interviewer.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Kravitsian.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Thank you.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
How was Julius's dong? We said that was average, right?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
No, you couldn't-

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Not visible from behind.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Correct.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Oh, right.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
No thigh gap.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
But only because he has those crazy thighs.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Right. So, TBD.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Wait. Yeah.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Mm-hmm.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
To be dick-sized.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
With a hyphen.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Cal, Colorado has a huge hog.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I'm cutting all this.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Okay, then my penis is so small.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Beck doesn't have one.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
That's fine.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
His mom said, either put some pants on or-

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
I'm taking it off.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Get that thing off of it.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Well, Cal, Colorado has a huge hog.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
And he wears out-of-date suits.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Zach, once we left off, we had just finished wrapping up at the farm,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
and it sounded like we had what we needed.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah, it sounds like it was time to turn our segment into the studio.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I think it's time to turn the segment into the studio.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
You guys are-

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
In character, please.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Mine wasn't in character. I didn't-

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Okay, one more again. In character. Joe?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
It's time to turn the segment into the studio.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
And with that, you guys pull up to City Action News.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
What's a building look like?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
What's a building look like?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Cool.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's like marble and glass.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Ooh, very cool.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Marble columns, glass walls.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Yeah.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Marble countertops.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Literally marble and glass.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Marble floors.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Ooh.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
We are hemorrhaging money.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
We spent way too much money on this building.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
And kind of as a tongue-in-cheek thing,

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
the walkway to the door is kind of like a winding thing with marbles in it.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
We are currently jackhammering that out

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
because we've already had so many slip and falls and threats of library.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Well, they're not loose marbles.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I know, but marbles sticking out.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
They're shiny.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
They're round, smooth.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Humps.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
You can slip on shiny things.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
You can slip on anything.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah, but especially shiny things.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Julius shakes his head and reminisces about his time.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
How good it looked for him.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
His time as a young boy trying to pick the marbles out of the walkway.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
As one pops loose, it hits your feet as you guys are entering into the station.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Pick it up.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
A sentimental tear starts to well up in his eye,

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
and he picks it up, and he puts it in the little pocket in his pants.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
You know the little pocket?

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Yo, I'm aware of the little pocket.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
He flicks a marble in somebody's eye in like 40 episodes.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Sentimentally.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
In parentheses.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
All right, cool.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Let's dive on into...

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Dive on in.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
That's not a dive.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Luke, you're the producer.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
You're in charge here.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
You know that this segment needs to go into the editing bay,

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
and the executive producer, your uncle, Tyfe,

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
is likely in his office where he normally is,

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
and you would imagine that the standard CAN news crew,

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
which is the anchor weather person and sports segment host.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
The SSH.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
They're likely on set rehearsing for the show's evening news.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Hey Peck, do you have the tape?

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
I mean, it's not tape these days, old man, but yeah.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I got the footage.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
You knew what I meant.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
How old are you guys? Sorry.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm 29.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I was mid-30s.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Awesome.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
It's not tape, boomer.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Julius says, you know what I meant,

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
but Julius totally was thinking of like a VHS tape.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Let's go to the bay.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Yeah, I'll get it loaded up.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
And then I don't move, and I'm kind of waiting for him to like

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
hopefully go to where the bay is because I don't know where it is.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
Beck's heading there, and this is almost a pseudo office of his.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Yeah.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
He's here a lot.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Absolutely.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
And yeah, you pop in, and the editor is hard at work,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
pouring over multiple monitors, computer in front of her,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
and she's just like overwhelmed completely with stuff,

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
and she's like, hey, you got the farmer segment coming in?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
What's her name?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
You're going to want to see this.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Her name is...

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Vivica.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Her name?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Oh, her name?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Her name?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Oh, you're asking me?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Her name?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
An NPC.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Vivica Johnston, obviously.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
There you go.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Vivica.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Hey, Viv, got that footage for you.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Oh, thank you, thank you.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Oh, my goodness.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Okay, let's get going, let's get going.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Okay, what do we got?

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Do we need to cut a bunch, or is it mostly good to go?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Beck, at this point, this is something that you probably,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
you guys have seen, the audience hasn't seen,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
that he kind of almost flips a switch at this point

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
and is almost robotic and able to relay to her

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
at three minutes and 33 seconds.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
We've got a footage of the corn at four minutes and 56 seconds

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
is when the interview starts.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
It ends at 593.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
He's just running down a list from memory

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
of what he shot in a time stamp.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Here's where the star wipe should go.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Julius, don't forget the crabs.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Oh, and the crabs.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Wait, Julius?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Julius says is what I meant.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Nailed that.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Absolutely nailed it.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
Like a man slipping on a floor covered in marbles.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
And then landing perfectly on his feet.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Julius' mind is mostly in his pocket and in that walkway.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Oh, wow.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
I mean, yeah, dude, you're probably deep in some nostalgia here.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
It's weird.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
I know that feeling.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
The smell.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
The marble floors of your youth.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Ooh.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Smell that marble.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Ooh, that smell.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Very cool.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
Vivica gets going and is just at the exact pace of your notes.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
It's cracking the fuck out of this edit.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
She is on like seven monitors at the same time.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
We do the thing from NCIS where we're both typing on the same keyboard.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Yes.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Dude, we've got some really talented professionals here at Cannes.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Oh, absolutely.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Cannes is city action news.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Julius is admiring in the very center of this room

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
the see-through dry erase board

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
that you can totally get right on both sides of.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Oh, my God.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Nice.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Traffic, sports, weather, news.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Cannes, Cannes.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
And then you see in the lineup is the farmer segment

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
is lined up in that three-quarter slot.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
It's not right at the top, but it's safely nuzzled in.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
There are a couple commercial breaks from the beginning

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
like stay tuned for the farm thing.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Oh, yeah.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Absolutely.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Coming up, a look at the Godel farm acquisition program.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
She turns back to you and she says,

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
okay, do we want to keep any of this passion and bleep it

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
or are we just cutting all that?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
We're going to keep and bleep

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
and put obviously explicit warning before we air the segment.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Oh, that's good.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
And she pulls up this like dong dong music

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
that's like really intense with this.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
There's some image that's like blurred in the background that looks tense,

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
some sort of discordant scene happening behind words

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
that ominously say viewer discretion is advised.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
Hey, make sure on the promos we need to have the crab man.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
For real? Like really?

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
If you were watching the news and you saw a crab man,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
aren't you going to stay tuned until you see what the crab man is?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Wow.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
I guess that's why they hired you as the producer,

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
she says, is she's just like click clacking away.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I got some good footage of him at 1205.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Fucking rad.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
We just put this thing together and then we are ready to go.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
When you show the end result to Cal Colorado,

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
you call him into the room to be like, hey, we've got the 90 seconds up.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Can I make one thing?

27:57.000 --> 28:05.000
I do want Julius to ensure that there is at least one good clip of Cal in this segment.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Cal.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah, Cal comes in and he watches the segment

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
and he sees that shot that didn't really have to be there.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
He's kind of quiet and he's just like, good work, good work, team.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
I'm sorry, I need to use the restroom.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
And he kind of runs out crying.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
And if you look out the door, you see the rest of the news team,

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
the anchor and the sports person and the weather person,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
all kind of laughing in a huddle.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh, no, man.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
Julius sees all of that happen and looks over at Beck,

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
90% angry and 10% a little just sad.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
Beck did the last segment producer typically cut out all of Cal's screen time.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Yeah, unfortunately.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Oof.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
And it sucks because he's good at what he does.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
Vivica is like, wow, I think you're building a strong team.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
She says to the producer and holds out her hand.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
She says, Vivica Johnston.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
Julius shakes her hand and says, I don't plan on being sick much,

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
but if I'm not here, there's always a shot at Cal.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Good to know.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Thank you.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I think Beck swells with a little bit of pride to hear that.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
He's happy to hear that.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
And then Julius says, where's my uncle?

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
Isn't it nap time?

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
You see a PA who's like running around like a...

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
A chicken with its head cut off?

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Man, I really didn't want to say that, huh?

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
Trigger warning if you're a chicken.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
Trigger warning animal cruelty.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Sorry, running around like a person with their head cut off.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
That's right.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
There's a young man with his head cut off running around outside,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
screaming, wait, how?

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
Out of the hole above his shoulders?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
That is legitimately terrifying.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
This is where the horror starts.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Such a good horror podcast.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Oops, not yet.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
The blood is squirting out of his jugular and reaching the top of the building.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Beck wants to investigate the headless man?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
I would too.

30:15.000 --> 30:22.000
He can't because there's a segment producer yelling at that headless man for getting blood.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
Jeremy, the window cleaners just came.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
You're running around like a chicken with your head cut off.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Jeremy pops in and he's like,

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
Hey guys, I'm just trying to find Cal.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Type what's Cal.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
And you guys too, if you want to go on up there.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
He's in the restroom, dude. We'll get him there though.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Okay, yeah, he's really weighing on you guys.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
So if you want to get up there fast, do you guys need anything?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Coffee's busted.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Julius is going to test this out.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Oat milk latte?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Oat milk latte?

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, there's a place about four blocks down.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Sure.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Iced hot.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Okay, iced hot.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Iced hot.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Gross.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
Beck wants two energy drinks, but we're going to wait until we get sponsored by one before I name one.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
That's smart.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
But it's two of the same energy drink.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
I think we can comfortably punch in Monster now.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Man, I love energy drink.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
Truly, I pop one open in the morning, bam, I'm ready to go.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Well, my favorite thing is how good and healthy for you energy drink is.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Right, the ingredients list, have you looked at it?

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
That's just my opinion, that claim has not been approved by the FDA.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
You're a doctor.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Oh, no, I was lying to you, Zach.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Oh.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Wait.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
So, yeah, listeners, Zach, Joe, Luke, I lied about my credentials to get on this podcast.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
I am not a doctor.

31:46.000 --> 31:52.000
So when you said your name is Dr. Cox and that you were a urologist, and I did, and you, that was a lie?

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
Yeah, wasn't it weird that I made you examine my penis?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
You're a great teacher.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
All right.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Where are those rails?

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Let's find them.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Yeah, they're right in front of you.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
I know, let's get back to them.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
No, no, no, I love like walking alongside them.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
It's an enjoyable.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Fair enough, let's walk alongside them.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Stand by me-ing.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I do want to see a dead body.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Well, let's get to it.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Zach's like, I've got a really spooky segment for you guys.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
The bathroom is on the way to Ty's office, so Beck just kind of taps on the door.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
Hey, Cal, we're being called to the big man's office.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
Oh, okay, well, just give me a minute.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
I got some coffee on my tie.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
If you need a tissue to get the coffee out, I mean, uh, I got one.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
A hand just pops out from like the door.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
He does, in one of his cargo shorts, have a little travel thing of tissues.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
You just hear...

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
as he blows his nose.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
All right, see you in there, man.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Well, there's like a deep, deep sigh as he collects himself,

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
and then a smiling, beautiful Cal Colorado pops out,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
and you might notice his eyes are a little red, but probably not.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Probably not. It looks like maybe he applied some makeup in there.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Cal, uh, heavy lunch?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Are you calling me fat?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
He runs back into the bathroom.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
Julius thinks, I just didn't want to call him a crybaby.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
You gotta learn how to deal with the talent, man.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Julius is looking at Beck like, I mean, what do we do?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Beck is kind of giving you an open arm shrug.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
He's a complicated guy. Sometimes you just gotta give him some space.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
He, like, elbows Beck.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
He's just, you know, so talented.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
I don't know why he's, he's, uh, just, he's gotta pee so much, apparently.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
And then I look at Beck, like, shaking my head, like, was that good?

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah, Cal hears all that and, like, flushes the toilet,

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
but then immediately comes out.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
As soon as you pop out, Vivica Johnston, the editor,

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
pops her head out of the bay and looks out to you and says, Cal!

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
She points at Julius.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
You got a really good one. He's not a Marvin, alright?

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
Cal's head is clearly elsewhere, but he, he kind of blinks and collects himself

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
and looks over at her and, like, gives her a thumbs up and, and pats Julius on the back.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
Julius really appreciates that, because he's grown up knowing who Marvin is,

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
and he knows that as his last act, he had the marbles torn up from the walkway.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
Marvin is the only person, Marvin slipped.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Yeah, he's the only person that had managed to slip on the marbles.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
After, after, like, 15 years at the station, he slips on his last day.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
Everybody thought it was pretty suspicious.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
But Marvin is suing the studio and the network because of those fucking marbles.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Holy shit.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
Hearing that I'm not like him is awesome, but Julius already knew it.

35:16.000 --> 35:23.000
Before you can even, like, look back, Vivica is, uh, very much headphones on, back to click clacking.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Vivica is a professional.

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
Julius didn't know where the editing bay was, but he definitely knows where his uncle's office is,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
because he's been gone there for a long time.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Awesome. Well, but also the fun thing is that now he does know.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
That's true. He's learning.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
He learned today.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
On the job training.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
So as you guys are making your way up there, uh, you do pass.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
You're making our way up there.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Walking past.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
Walking past the anchor weather person in the sports guy.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
This is my uncle.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
We're gonna talk to him.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Alright, and they're, uh, they're chilling at Crafty.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
They're, uh, they're hanging out and just shooting the shit over some bagels.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
At Crafty?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
At the Craft Service.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Craft Services, bruh.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Yeah, I knew what he meant.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
It's locks, but it's not smoked.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
We're hanging out at K-Town.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Craft Services is provided by Craft.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
It's sponsored by Craft.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
There's a vat of macaroni and cheese.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Little smokies wrapped in singles.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Little smokies and mac and cheese.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
There's one of those big wooden planks, like you would put a really nice charcuterie board on,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
but it's just got a shitload of Craft singles on it.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
Listen, I don't know what you guys have, you know, have planned for my next birthday.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Do you want to go to the Springfield Underground to look at the cheese?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
And eat a charcuterie board of Craft?

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
Yes, I do.

36:47.000 --> 36:53.000
As you, uh, are gonna pass them, they, uh, are kind of snickering and whispering.

36:53.000 --> 37:01.000
You hear Isabella Kaya, who's the head anchor now at Cannes, who took over for Cal Colorado, and she...

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
We were co-anchors for...

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Oh!

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Two and a half years.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Nice.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I mean, bummer, but nice.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
And now there's not another co-anchor.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
She is just the lead.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Nope, she has got it.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
And...

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Fool!

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Yeah.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
She really reminded Cal of his daughter, Carol.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
He thought he had taken her under his wing and really, like, mentored this person.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Yeah.

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
And it wasn't her decision to swap out the anchor spots, but Cal lost a lot.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
On her first day as a solo anchor, she said, well, now over to me.

37:35.000 --> 37:41.000
And then did the next story.

37:41.000 --> 37:49.000
And as you guys are walking up the stairs on the way to Taif Raylan's office, she calls up after you.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Oh, Cal!

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
I heard you did a wonderful job on your farmer segment.

37:53.000 --> 37:58.000
Well, not only did I do a wonderful job, but my team here did a wonderful job.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
As you look at your team, you're kind of, like, beaming with pride.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
As you look back, her back is turned, and she is talking with the others.

38:06.000 --> 38:15.000
It doesn't really go with his methods or preferences, but the viewer discretion, like, stab, then...

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Julius.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Julius added.

38:17.000 --> 38:27.000
He's pretty confident that she's going to open her soda when she sees that.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
Oh, she's going to open her soda, all right.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Can you cut that into something?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Should I say it all again?

38:34.000 --> 38:44.000
He may not like the sensationalism, but he knows that Julius' crab people stab and content warning is definitely going to, like, get some eyes.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Classic crab stab.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
He just says, yeah, you have a good one too, Isabella.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
When Beck sees that her back is already turned, he's flipping her off.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
But you made sure to wait until she was all the way turned around.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Cal is like, Beck.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Sorry, man.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
But fuck her, dude.

39:01.000 --> 39:07.000
Cal is like, I may have to go to HR after my meeting with Typh.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
I think he said he wanted to butt fuck her.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
That is not appropriate.

39:15.000 --> 39:22.000
Jesus fucking Christ.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
You guys head up the stairs to Typh Raylan's office.

39:27.000 --> 39:34.000
It is double-doored and Typh's door is closed.

39:34.000 --> 39:44.000
You knock on the thick oak doors that have glass on both sides of them so you can actually see, like, fully into his office.

39:44.000 --> 39:52.000
But these huge wooden doors are installed so that you understand what kind of office you're about to walk into.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
What was that knock?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
And is that the secret family knock?

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
Oh, is that the Raylan knock?

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
Will you cut this out later and send it to me so that I can say yes and know what it is?

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
What is it?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Hold on.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
What's happening?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
That's it, yeah.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Is it State Farm?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Not quite that.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
Anyway.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
Yeah, it's exactly that.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
You can switch it up to, we are farmers.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
Oh, that's what we're thinking of.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
State Farm.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
We are State Farm. Liberty, Liberty, Liberty.

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Affleck.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
Dude, Affleck doesn't cob knock.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
You just start pounding on his door and screaming, insurance, insurance.

40:57.000 --> 41:03.000
He knows the knock.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
It was all of that.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
It was all of that.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Oh, no.

41:09.000 --> 41:15.000
You heard from the other side of the door him singing along.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Holy shit.

41:16.000 --> 41:22.000
And once you heard Affleck, you hear him go, Affleck.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
You may enter.

41:24.000 --> 41:34.000
As soon as I hear him kind of respond from inside, first thing, hey, uncle, from now on, how about you'll just know it's me?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
What do you mean?

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Like, just maybe one of like, and then it's me?

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Oh, come on.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
You don't do the whole knock.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
You're not a real Rayland.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
That's what we say, right?

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
And you want to be a real Rayland and he's literally putting his fingers in your gut and like poking you.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
Mr. Rayland, could I just say that your nephew here has just performed.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Yeah, come on, come on.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Sit down, sit down.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Hey, come on.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
I'm so glad that you're here, Cal.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah, come on.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Sit down.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Thank you.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
You were saying?

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
I was saying that your nephew has performed admirably on his first assignment and that,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
you know, honestly, the whole office is talking about this.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
Since you can see us through the glass, do we need these crazy knocks?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
He thinks about it.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
He's beaming with pride while he's staring at Julius and he's like, do we need the crazy knocks?

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
I don't know.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Do I need to give my little nephew a hug?

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Yes, I do.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Come here, baby.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Happily, Julius.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
You did a good job.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
He goes from very sad thinking about the last name situation and then gives his uncle a big ol' hug.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
Wait, it's the last name situation that you don't have the same last name?

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Summers.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
That is correct.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Julius Summers.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
I mean, you're a nephew.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Couldn't you just be his sister's son?

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I am his sister's son.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Whoa.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Mystery solved.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
You already used luck, so that should get a point back.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
You nailed it.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
Yeah, I'm sorry, but did I not just deduce the fuck out of that?

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
He just deduced the fuck out of that.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
He forgot Luke's character's last name.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
Oh, you must be his sister's son.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Yeah, it's not weird that I have a different last name.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
It's just the fact that I do have a different last name.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
He lifts Julius off the ground and he's like, I'm so proud of you.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
On your second day, you're getting big ups from the great cow Colorado.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
He gives you knocks, Beck.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Beck is kind of getting stoked just off of his stokedness.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Yeah.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
He enthusiastically knuckles back.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
Now, I got something, ooh, I got something weird.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I got something weird, okay?

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
It's not normal, yeah, it's not normal, okay, but it's for Cal.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Hmm, how do I say this?

43:31.000 --> 43:39.000
A woman called in, yeah, and she said that she's got a hot heater of a story.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Yeah, all right, okay?

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
But she won't talk to anyone, no one, except Cal Colorado.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
So we got to send you out.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
And she said it's urgent, so we have to go right now.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Before the broadcast even starts, yeah?

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
Typh, I know it's been a while since I've been in the anchor chair,

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
but typically, these are just women looking to sexually harass me.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
Hmm, so I'm sorry to hear that, but in this situation,

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
she really seems like she's got something.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
She said she had a hot story just for Cal.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
Okay, what she said was that she can't call the cops,

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
and that if we can get in there and get the story first, you see,

44:20.000 --> 44:25.000
then maybe we can run it before anybody else.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
What do you guys think about this?

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
We go, if the story's true, we get good content.

44:30.000 --> 44:36.000
If it's false, we spin it into exposing the perverts of the city.

44:36.000 --> 44:41.000
Ooh, my man's got a mind on him, yeah, my man's got a good brain.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
I mean, we'd be kind of like using Cal as bait in that case,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
but it sounds like a story to me.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
I've never seen such good-looking bait in my life, look at him!

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Oh, he's perfect, yeah?

44:52.000 --> 44:57.000
If you didn't have those beautiful blue eyes, I wouldn't even suggest it.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
And I look at Bag like, is it working, is it working?

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
Turn the thing down, put it in reverse.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Gentlemen, this is not journalism.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
It's almost something more than that.

45:18.000 --> 45:23.000
I got chills, I got chills, I got spinglies in the back of my tingle.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
Cal got chills too, but in a bad way.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
Oh, come on, let's go. Let's go, Cal, what do you want?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
What do you want? What can I do for you?

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
He's looking confused at Julius and he's like,

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
what more is there than journalism?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
It's the human condition.

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
Yeah, you can get a story out of anything if you're smart enough like my man here.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Is the story true?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
There's only one way to find out.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
And if it's not, like Julius said, that's the story.

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
You know, what this makes me think of is you see these and he gestures to his thighs.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
Sometimes I squeeze watermelons and I squeeze them so hard

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
that the juice comes out of every part of that watermelon down to the last drop.

46:09.000 --> 46:15.000
And what we need to do is be my thighs and squeeze a story out of this phone call.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
I feel like the risk-reward here is pretty high.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
If she does have something juicy, we need a good story.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
So either she has something juicy or I'm the something juicy.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
It sounded like she was in a real situation, okay?

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
Ty, if you told me when I switched from news desk to field reporter

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
that if I did things well, points would be earned.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Yeah.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
Points that would maybe get me back to my desk.

46:52.000 --> 46:57.000
Yeah, 100. This is a lot of points.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
If you hold up your end of the bargain, I will do this thing for you.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
He reaches out his hand.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Is he going for a fist bump or a handshake?

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Oh, it's definitely a fist bump.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
Cal reaches out for a handshake and then awkwardly goes for a fist bump.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
As he awkwardly goes for a handshake on your fist.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And no hands are shook and no deal is actually made.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
He grabs your fist and is like, yeah, now we're talking.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Okay, boys.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Bec grabs both their hands.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Get your hand in here, Julius.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Get your hand in here.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
He's like texting with one hand and touching the hand.

47:29.000 --> 47:35.000
Can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Whoa.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Becca's jumping up and down.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Yeah, do you feel it?

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Okay, let's go.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
And he slams a piece of paper down on the desk which has an address on it.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
Cal salutes you and says, can, can.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Skrrr.

47:48.000 --> 47:54.000
We see the can van slide out of its parking spot in the can parking lot.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
And you see we have all ran to the can van.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
The, the can van peels out of the parking lot with no one in it.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
As you guys chase after it.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
What?

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Uh, I, okay, now we've got a mystery for season two.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Yeah.

48:15.000 --> 48:22.000
Can I ask, uh, in character, does Cal know why he was demoted to field anchor?

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Yes.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Okay.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
And then out of character, do you have something already?

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Yes.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Cool.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
And how long has it been since that?

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Six months.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
I didn't mean to derail us.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
You were on a mission there getting us to an end place.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
You're so good at that Joe.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
I just was curious.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
You're the one, you're always the one doing it.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
It's not, it's not me or Luke.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
It's you.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
It's you.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
It's you.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I want to have a baby with you.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
I want to have a baby with you.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I want to get pregnant.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I want to get pregnant with you.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Jesus Christ.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Oh man.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
All right.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Call him.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
What were we talking about?

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
That's all it was.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
Cause I wondered if there was a chance that Cal didn't even know, but he's been told that

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
he's done now on a good point system to get back.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
I didn't know if that was something that you didn't know what you were trying to redeem

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
yourself for yet or not.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
No, he knows what he's redeeming himself for.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
I think the point system is probably pretty amorphous and fluid.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Sure.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Um, and is just a scam.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Oh, you're maybe not real.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Exactly.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
Yeah.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
Like would he take this unscrupulous job to get back to his dream job?

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Yeah.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
He's never seen any part of working at can as unscrupulous and he's not, maybe it's just

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
been so long since he's been in the field, but he didn't even realize how like down and

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
dirty, maybe typhon is his field boys were getting.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Oh yeah.

49:43.000 --> 49:52.000
Then pulls out onto one of the perfectly gridlocked, perfectly perpendicular roads of the city.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
And immediately you're stuck in traffic.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
You get a text from typh.

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
It just says, I ain't seen no tick tock yet.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Oh fuck.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
That's what it was.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
That is wow.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Like, God damn it.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
You totally did say that.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
You said that?

50:11.000 --> 50:17.000
Cal hasn't read that text yet, but Thomas's heart just sank.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Really good timing to bring it up.

50:19.000 --> 50:25.000
How do you break it to Cal who is clearly playing candy crush on his phone and hasn't

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
seen the text?

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
Well, since we're stuck here in traffic, uh, we might as well do some man on the street.

50:31.000 --> 50:41.000
Sorry that you were going to say tick tock for tick tock.

50:42.000 --> 50:49.000
Do you hand your phone to Beck?

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Yes.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
It's already logged in.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
I'm logged into the can talk.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I'm talking to Cal.

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
This, this thing that they've been trying out here, it's like to get younger viewers

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
engaged more or something.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
Like I'm not big on it myself, but I understand it.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
Have you ever like, um, popped and locked?

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
I'm sorry.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Are you asking me if I've committed a robbery?

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
No.

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
Um, and he turns to Julius, if he like patted his head and rubbed his belly, is that like

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
a challenge?

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
You know?

51:38.000 --> 51:50.000
I love everything we've done so far.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
This is not like any role playing we've ever done before.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
I think it's good.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Um, yeah.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
I like it.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
Me too.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
You guys are like supporting each other and shit.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
It's wild.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
The hardest part of waking up is deciding what to wear.

52:08.000 --> 52:14.000
But today I woke up missing me and it's been downhill from there.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
One, two, three, four!

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
Why don't you tell me what you think of me?

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
Cause I don't really think of you.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I don't recognize myself.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
What you did was a stinky thing to do.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
No cure for being freaking stupid.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
So take it or leave it.

52:43.000 --> 52:49.000
Cause it's not getting any better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better!

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
This is my coming of age.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
This train don't have no brakes.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
That's too bad.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
That's my least favorite time.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Have a happy birthday old friend.

53:01.000 --> 53:08.000
I hope this isn't the end but if it is, it'll be alright.

53:08.000 --> 53:17.000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

53:17.000 --> 53:26.000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

53:27.000 --> 53:36.000
I don't need you to apologize.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
I just need you to fix it.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
I'm sick of waiting on someone to wait on me.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Cause last time I missed it.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
If you tell me to get over it.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
It's not your business.

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
I'll skip away into the sunset and whistle to the tune of it.

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
This is my coming of age.

54:00.000 --> 54:06.000
This train don't have no brakes.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
Have a happy birthday old friend.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
I hope this isn't the end.

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
It'll finally be alright.

54:18.000 --> 54:27.000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

54:27.000 --> 54:41.000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

54:41.000 --> 54:50.000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
Today I woke up missing me.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
I forgot her yesterday.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
Where I left my made up enemies and this song was not a thing.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
And the truth is this is 100% real.

55:18.000 --> 55:25.000
Cause my life is wonderful and I blame it on me.
