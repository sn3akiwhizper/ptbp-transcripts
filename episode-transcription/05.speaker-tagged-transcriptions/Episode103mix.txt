I shall eat Mark Zuckerberg's eyes so that he may see the dark void for all eternity. Smash that like button. This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach. But not the one you know. From occupied Piscataway and Anacostian land known as Washington, DC who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. A very productive use of 15 seconds. He writes, I have a little love song for a very special something in my life. My baby takes the morning train. As shelter from the rising sun, she will return to me again to finally waitin' for her. My baby's eyes can see through time. She sings to me what must be done. The life I had's no longer mine. The world is waitin' for her. The only songs I write cannot be interpreted by human ears.

And picture whatever it is you think I look like the next time you're about to bust a whole nut. Then you'll inevitably want to have a little snooze, but keep it up. It's time for the news. Last time, Clark ran away from the site of the shimmering silver sea and into Dr. Marie Jacobs and Salem the cat in Doug Jacobs' body. He kept fleeing, but the next door brought him through the same threshold he had just crossed. and the two stumbled forward to greet the witch doctor and her cat man familiar. Down the ladder, Keith lied to the boat's hosts, Don D. Pettymore and Jack Russell. He told them he knew where the door Jack searched for was located. From this sea level view, Keith saw a rope bridge on the adjacent wall to the ladder he had just used that led to a second stilted bunker above this shiny sterling surf. Back in the room that wasn't filled with junk and a helpless Leo piston, Clark and John yucked Dr. Marie Jacobs yum for a while, and then John found solace in his quantumly colorful orifice ooze. Speaking of, take a moment. Check out Bandcamp or Spotify or MySpace studio where I find the hottest new tracks with the coolest album art.
317.04 362.80 speaker2  oh, thanks for doing that, but that's worthless to me now. Now's a new moment. Yeah, that was a week ago. Yeah, right? Or thumbs on a human. in conversation with Marie Jacobs, so why don't you just go on over to those other boys? Joe.
362.08 446.88 speaker0  Hello, Rosanne. And behind him, Keith Vigna, who's looking up and just said, nice view. in the room you're about to walk up into. And then where the rope bridge is that is seemingly not attached to a door that you could see in this bunker-like room that you were in before. This bunk yard, junker bunker, junker junk yard bunker, piston junk yard bunker yard. We got here different ways. How'd you get here? I kind of floated in. Floated? Yeah. No, I mean, what got you before you fell up? Goo? Where are you from, boy? What about you?
444.56 453.92 speaker2  I'm from Contention too, but... Well, not you, this other guy.
452.48 466.80 speaker0  No, I'm from Contention.
463.60 474.48 speaker2  It's very distinct from one side of Contention to the other.
473.52 481.76 speaker0  How old are you? I don't even know.
480.72 503.60 speaker2  Where are we? No fucking clue, but we're looking for the door out.
497.60 525.04 speaker0  where you do hear the crying sounds of Leo Piston as he is just in tortured pain. Jack Russell turns around, helps you finish up the ladder trek, does the same for Don D. Pettymore. Leo, I feel awful bad. It hurts too bad.
523.84 535.04 speaker2  Do you think you're gonna make it? Are you gonna be better or is this the rest of your life?
532.40 537.76 speaker0  If you find a way out, I guess come get me.
536.80 550.88 speaker2  Will do, will do. I'm sure that I will not forget about you. The kid, you, yeah. That's Leo Piston. Ligma?
549.84 560.80 speaker0  No, but you.
558.56 589.68 speaker2  Oh, I thought you said Ligma Piston.
584.80 595.52 speaker0  He got here because he jumped through, I don't even fucking believe him. I took a step in a, in a bag.
594.32 612.72 speaker1  And I got here. Where'd you get it? I've always had it.
610.88 614.64 speaker2  It's, I, I use the bag.
613.76 617.60 speaker1  Do I still have it? Yeah.
616.48 635.84 speaker2  That's how I got in here. So we're in your bag? Where the bag opens up.
634.08 639.60 speaker0  At Comb Comfy Campground.
637.44 644.56 speaker2  Like, you gotta talk better, man.
643.92 654.48 speaker1  That's right.
652.40 666.16 speaker0  where you just walked into this room. He clears this wall, there's no hatch.
665.12 699.68 speaker2  Did you forget their names? Clark and John. Jesus Christ. I had a total brain fart there. You guys, well, after you, I guess. I mean, what, you got any other ideas?
698.88 743.60 speaker0  What do I see? Clark and John, their backs as they are standing in a empty room that does not have a ceiling on it, or maybe it does. And they are talking to Dr. Marie Jacobs and Doug Jacobs who are laying on the ground. Dr. Marie Jacobs. anymore. And you looked at the security footage and saw them being picked up and slammed into And then they disappeared as if you had never seen them.
741.68 758.96 speaker2  That was just normal goings on.
751.84 775.04 speaker0  And as you turn around, you see that Keith Vigna, Keith Beans, has arrived into this room along with Don D. Pettymore and this man wearing the beanie and the overalls that are made of corduroy.
774.16 801.20 speaker2  Or under control. What? Now what the hell are you boys doing under your boat? I thought that was the boat that would take us out of here eventually.
792.80 815.68 speaker1  is kind of frozen a little bit, seeing what appears to be his brother, but with kind of a different sounding voice.
809.28 838.16 speaker0  gotten used to seeing that everything's made out of this inky black substance that is also super colorful and is also the sky, but also like objects are kind of that color or texture too. and nose and mouth and ears.
836.96 846.24 speaker2  Ever been better, Keith? You look crazy right now.
840.56 851.28 speaker1  Do you not see what's happened to touch your face? Can you feel it?
849.92 859.52 speaker2  It does look cool.
858.96 863.44 speaker1  That's right.
863.12 870.40 speaker0  Boo!
868.80 888.32 speaker2  I'm your brother, asshole. Something seems off about him.
887.52 895.04 speaker0  I rolled a two.
892.56 908.64 speaker2  Sorry, my other D10 fell on the floor. That's a 22 on a 60 crit success. Hell yeah. All right, nice.
907.36 936.40 speaker0  So this is your brother. It's been a while since you've seen him, huh? So I mean, God, it's been years and then it's been however long you've been in here.
934.32 971.12 speaker2  Violently stabbing his eyes to the side. Hold on one minute. Big brother, little brother. That's why I said that. Big brother, I'll be gone for just a second to talk to these fellows, but I do need to confer with my associates for just a second. But then we'll catch up. Clark, Keith. And then he's really stabbing his eyes to the side.
969.12 981.12 speaker0  and you can go back in through this hatch. And he kind of opens up the hatch that's open. Oh, he opens it more back into the Leo piston bunker junkyard.
979.20 986.40 speaker2  Nobody asked you, British guy. But while y'all are in here, do not fuck that cat. We'll be right back.
985.68 990.08 speaker0  Puts out his hand.
987.44 999.28 speaker2  John reluctantly shakes it as he's trying to walk back. And he's like, again, no one asked. We will be right back. This won't take long.
998.88 1004.48 speaker1  Huh.
1003.12 1008.48 speaker0  because Thomas doesn't want you here.
1005.28 1065.36 speaker2  Goodbye. Justin, the person knows exactly what this conversation is about. Might've been a little too subtle. I don't my pappy did because I'm in the body of my pappy. That's my uncle. So why are you, do you just not want to frighten him by telling him who you are? Is that my uncle or is that the goo manifest in some kind of trader could be either way. It might behoove us to have some kind of advantage over him.
1062.88 1080.80 speaker1  John, what was your relationship with this guy? Is he a, is he a good uncle? Is he, was it a strained relationship? Did you, did you know him very well or?
1079.92 1098.96 speaker2  out in the hard car. That's nice of him. That puts him in the top quarter for sure of my uncles. But at the same time, he's a vicious criminal. Uh, he's a mean son of a bitch and I don't really recall all my past lives, but I believe I owe him money.
1097.84 1106.80 speaker1  Yeah, it is.
1101.52 1132.64 speaker2  So it, I just, perhaps while I have this physical form, I'm my daddy. That's my only strategy here. I don't have steps ahead to this thing that it just felt it's an instinctual move. Yeah. in there and tell him who I am?
1131.52 1137.84 speaker1  leg up on them already.
1136.40 1192.40 speaker2  Yeah, shut the fuck up, Leo. You're not a part of this. So don't try to be part of the cool. You're not part of the quick, but solving the mystery. Yeah, we know. Cope, Leo Cope. We got to go talk to important people in that other room. Just fucking try not to make too much noise while you're in here. God damn. I was, I was thinking you guys remember those pictures that the camera took of the people and the, it was basically just complete blackness.
1191.52 1196.72 speaker1  Where the hell are we? Where the hell are we?
1195.92 1206.00 speaker2  You're from what?
1205.04 1217.68 speaker0  I'm Keith.
1214.48 1264.96 speaker2  kind of ceased to cease to interest me as I spend more time. all the time at the same time. And when, when John just said that he's from here, that didn't ring any bells for him. That didn't ping any, any alarms for me. You should go listen to that. Let's go lie to my uncle. You'll honestly get as much a chance to talk to her as we would.
1264.40 1280.80 speaker1  remember. Exactly. Right.
1273.84 1344.48 speaker2  Cause she's all like, Oh, isn't it just normal for a person to just be like hanging out with their cat and then other stuff. And you're like, well, what does other stuff mean? And she's like, how dare you say what other stuff means, you know? And it's like, she's fucking her cat. But we, I think we need to get some information out of that cat fucker. And I agree that can, that can wait until after it. So she's another one. and we're not about to arrest you for fucking your cat man. Also, there's just a question of jurisdiction. It doesn't seem quite practical here, but we will get to the bottom of all of this.
1338.16 1361.84 speaker0  basically four walls in this piston bunker junkyard and two of the walls that are parallel with each other have hatches on them. But then one of the walls has been cleared of junk. So you can clearly see that junk has been moved. So you can see three walls now, two with hatches, one without.
1360.40 1367.20 speaker1  You've been, you've been cleaning up?
1366.64 1374.08 speaker0  hatch here?
1372.48 1528.48 speaker2  Jack Russell cleared it out. I would assume. a door. Listen to the episode. talk to Jack and Don. Don said he got in, got here from a bag. He has a Nike bag. He got in it and that's how he got here. Clark gasps. Yeah, he's, we're, he's in the bag, which means we're in the bag, which in that room in there, there didn't seem to be a ceiling on that room. And so I was thinking maybe that is the, how we got to climb up out of the bag or something. Well, the bag's probably open. this very ocean. Was that Marie? That was me. That, oh, hey bud. Yeah. Two now, I guess. And John looks kind of proud. He slicks his hair back. Sorry. My headphones just like stopped working, but now they're back. So I didn't hear anything you said. Thank you. a lake creature too.
1526.40 1557.36 speaker1  We got sucked up by a wave of ooze. around once. And she wasn't, she wasn't between here and there. Does she ever talk to you?
1556.24 1564.88 speaker2  She's coming and going. Hmm. When's the last time she left? Um, two minutes ago.
1564.40 1587.60 speaker0  Two minutes? Like days, weeks, forever? It was forever ago. They could be anywhere. I'm right here.
1586.24 1629.92 speaker2  How do you feel about that? That blow your little gourd? Well, you know, I probably should. That was mean. That was mean. I tried to feel superior to you because I'm not lying here, mortally wounded on my back, just rolling around for eternity. I mean, yeah, that's, that's the goal. Remember, I promise not to forget you, Leo. And I, I am glad, you know, you don't got to keep reminding us. We'll find you.
1624.16 1638.64 speaker0  Well, if you promise to not forget me, then I'll remind you that you said something about a bridge being on the other side of this wall, but there ain't no hash out.
1635.04 1641.92 speaker2  That's why we were looking for the height of the hatch for the bridge.
1641.04 1643.12 speaker1  That is that a fact?
1642.88 1664.72 speaker2  Yeah. It's, uh, if you were to Google Terabithia red sand forts, it would remind you of that.
1663.28 1676.96 speaker0  No, I believe that's where we are. Yeah.
1676.08 1684.16 speaker2  inside. Is that the accepted theory? Yes.
1682.64 1687.28 speaker1  Is that how they knew it was there?
1684.16 1703.28 speaker2  I saw it when I was down the ladder. I saw it.
1698.64 1714.24 speaker1  He just wants to walk up to it kind of slowly, both arms outstretched and just kind of feel it. Is there anything there?
1712.48 1729.92 speaker0  just kind of like presses into it. And it's a little wet and cold, uh, but then it's not at all. It's just normal wall.
1729.36 1738.40 speaker1  Of course.
1736.88 1794.80 speaker2  Does my hand behave the same way? Describe. You can see bad-ass like black ooze coming from John's fingernails and dripping down his hand. And as he touches the wall, the ooze from his fingernails kind of reaches out and little tendrils and the wall reaches out and little tendrils back and they emerge and then his hand just passes through. And John just kind of like whips open an opening because it's, it's just him. It's the same thing.
1789.04 1833.04 speaker0  As the other hatch opens, Jack Russell and Don D. Pettymore walk into this room as John Lee moves his hands into this wall and makes an opening and you can see out there is a looks like a rope bridge, but it's made out of the same texture that makes up the wall and the sky and everything around you. And it's a rope bridge that leads to a second bunker stilted above about 10 yards. This shimmering silver sea.
1827.76 1871.04 speaker1  Keith, careful that, uh, we don't know where, uh, uh, Leo told us that Julie's ball now and it sounds like maybe a mean ball. I don't know if it's a good ball, like John here, or if it's a mean ball. Like we've like a spine ripping ball. She could, she could be anywhere. You mean you ball. I didn't mean anything by it. Uh, you know, you know how I feel about you and what we're doing now. I just mean there's, there's you type of balls and there's Julie Maxwell type of balls.
1868.88 1879.44 speaker2  You don't know a goddamn thing about that ball. You're just assuming that ball is going to rip your spine out.
1877.12 1883.60 speaker1  Leo said it came down and ripped her spine out.
1882.16 1904.08 speaker2  So do you have a problem with that?
1900.32 1922.72 speaker0  Talk about ripping out the spine of his brother. Thomas has forgotten who's in the room.
1921.92 1936.56 speaker2  Walk through it. I didn't think so.
1935.12 1946.24 speaker1  What he thought was his brother. John, John, little John, not the rapper. Don't make a joke about the rapper.
1945.60 1954.72 speaker3  What? What? Okay.
1953.68 1976.00 speaker1  I said little John. Oh no. Is that you boy?
1972.08 2022.80 speaker2  Well, so what happened is, but y'all know I'm ball. You know I'm ball. What the hell is ball? But at the time he was kind of a semi brainwashed, you know, super soldier, half robot for an evil crime Lord in the city. You know, more or less my ball took over his body. That is your brother's body. I'm your nephew.
2017.04 2044.32 speaker1  Like just then you just said things like landed in and became, but you ripped out the spine of a person and put yourself into their place. That's just a little more violent than I'd ever been picturing before, but I guess you haven't done it to me.
2040.08 2076.56 speaker2  And he thinks at first that he's looking like the eye, but then he realizes he's looking right at his neck. And I never will. the thick neck of Keith.
2075.92 2085.92 speaker0  Turtle.
2083.68 2102.56 speaker2  That's about it's about, yeah. That's about beans. That's about your dinger. Let's go across this bridge. What I've been saying, but y'all wanted to know about spies.
2099.52 2109.92 speaker1  We don't know the motives of this Julie ball. Just keep an eye out. Just keep, keep a head on a swivel.
2108.64 2143.28 speaker2  When y'all are saying ball. That we don't, oh, let's stay in these two, two rooms forever with the weird lady who fucks her cat man. Because like maybe something's out there that might wish us ill and like the last five days of our lives. Come on, man. only other structure we can see?
2141.92 2153.04 speaker1  You had to have, you got a boat. Let's just go back there.
2150.00 2164.64 speaker0  I've been looking for the door out of here, right? Don here came for another reason. He's not trying to get out. How'd you come? Don, you're not trying to leave this place?
2160.48 2168.32 speaker1  I came purposefully to this place to, uh, to find something.
2166.24 2177.20 speaker2  What, your goddamn sense of decency? So you could go back and spend more money on my race car buckle?
2175.60 2188.88 speaker3  That is such a bird.
2186.08 2213.12 speaker2  What purpose does he have in a mystical world of goo? Like what quest do you seek? You, I thought you to be frankly, a very shallow piece of shit individual. So I just wonder what greater purpose you might be out here for. You know I raised you.
2211.28 2227.04 speaker1  I had big things I had to do. I had important jobs to do in contention for very powerful people. And I'm here to undo some of the harm that I've done. Okay.
2225.28 2234.48 speaker2  Why don't you expand on that? How the fuck is anything you're doing here in this goo world turning things right?
2232.24 2238.00 speaker1  John, I had, I used that bag. Yeah.
2236.64 2248.08 speaker2  Where'd you get the bag? Let's just, where'd you get the bag? We knew that bag is agent Victor's bag.
2246.64 2262.72 speaker1  We had it in fact, for a little bit. I am agent Victor. The other one, much more important.
2261.28 2267.28 speaker2  Do you know K cell?
2264.16 2286.80 speaker1  Primarily worked alone, getting rid of items. That's what the bag is for. It's to get rid of things and make sure they don't ever come back to where we are, where we were.
2284.96 2291.84 speaker2  than just this fucking bag.
2288.64 2304.88 speaker1  Cause I've been talking to Jack Russell for, I don't know. God, I don't fucking know how long.
2303.52 2314.56 speaker2  John, I did some bad things.
2310.96 2341.12 speaker1  this business is I put a person in the bag. It was only objects for a long time, but who did you put in? Their name was, was, was Thomas, Thomas Lewis. I believe they were an activist and they started coming down with some disease. The organization I work for told me they'd seen this before and they needed to get rid of it. Right then and there. Just following orders.
2337.20 2374.88 speaker2  Uncle, in my experience, people named Thomas are decent and good. And you should have given them more of a shot. So you think we're all in the bag right now? I don't know. But if you want to know why I'm here. Yeah, let him keep talking.
2373.76 2380.08 speaker0  Who was he? What was he like? What did he do?
2378.56 2420.32 speaker2  And now I'm talking like this. All right. Nobody asked you about fucking Thomas. We just said, treat Thomas as nicer. I asked you, did you jump in the bag and do you think we're in here? And then Jack was like, yeah, tell him more about Thomas. That's not what I asked. So can we just. I just. This is the bag? Whatever you want. Yeah, reestablish. I know it's confusing.
2418.32 2431.52 speaker0  It's confusing to all of us, mate. It's confusing to everyone. We don't fucking. Look at that sky.
2430.08 2438.48 speaker2  Is it Yanny or Laurel?
2436.96 2444.16 speaker3  John, why are you talking like that? It's some strange effect of this world.
2443.04 2458.40 speaker2  Corn flakes.
2454.96 2466.48 speaker1  John, you asked him why he got in the bag and he said, well, to explain that, I'll have to go back farther and started telling us about Thomas Lewis. So let's just let him catch up to why he got into the bag by telling the story of Thomas Lewis. Thank you.
2466.08 2472.24 speaker0  All right. All right.
2471.68 2492.72 speaker3  All right. All right. You just want to get your last little bit in there? All right. Yeah.
2488.88 2514.64 speaker2  I just said I don't want to hear another goddamn word out of that British feller. And Jack Russell? If that is your fucking name, I'd like you to respect that for a second. I'm talking to my uncle. Now, Don. Please continue.
2511.12 2534.16 speaker1  Some kind of tech genius or some billionaire. I don't know.
2533.52 2543.76 speaker0  First of all. He's a very famous man.
2542.00 2552.40 speaker2  You don't even know who Steve Jobs is. Does he exist in this world?
2551.76 2557.28 speaker3  Holy shit.
2556.64 2596.00 speaker1  They were young. It was the first time I'd been ordered to put a person into the bag. The bag is supposed to be for items, not for people. I put them in here. Who knows what happened? They may have drowned in that metal sea. I don't know, but that, that didn't even where it all ends. The madness virus, it seemed to be stopped at that point. But it was, I was never quite the same. One of the items I ended up having to put in later. You're not going to believe it. Like a road. Have you, have y'all seen a rotary phone around here?
2594.48 2607.36 speaker2  You're Jan Z. We're Gen Z. We don't know what that is.
2605.52 2656.32 speaker1  They told me to get rid of this phone. But after I put that phone in the bag, I knew I made the world a worse place by putting that phone in there. And I, and I thought to myself, could I help Thomas if I, if I had that phone? Maybe I could have prevented all this and maybe I could heal the world. Maybe I can, maybe I can use it to heal us right now. Even get us out of here. I don't know, but I know I need to find it.
2655.20 2670.40 speaker2  Have you even tried? Yeah, I do. Why don't we just give it a call? Let's see who answers.
2666.64 2677.44 speaker0  Keith, you got, uh, you still got, you still got yours on you?
2674.96 2726.96 speaker2  Beep, beep, beep, boop, beep, bop, boop, boop. Please don't, please don't say boop. Hey Siri, beep, beep, boop, boop. He just does that every time. We're friends.
2719.76 2748.16 speaker0  junkyard bunker, seemingly coming from inside the stilted bunker across the way. You hear a woman's voice going bring, bring
2747.28 2782.16 speaker3  The phone's over there.
2781.44 2790.96 speaker2  God damn it.
2790.08 2806.56 speaker1  Wait, who did you answer? Oh yeah.
2802.24 2813.04 speaker2  John has pushed an arm back real quick, like holding Clark back and he's like, why don't we just see what happens with these fellers?
2810.48 2819.92 speaker1  He wasn't even jumping at the bit to get out that door. No, I'll go.
2815.84 2866.56 speaker0  So it'll go Keith, then Don, then Jack. And the three of them run out onto the rope bridge. I assume that John and Clark are peeking their head out of this John made hole. And you all see, not the Bay boat that Don and Jack arrived on, but a new boat. Also made of this inky colorful darkness. And this boat has been written on with this shimmering sea. Numbers cover the entire hull of the boat. And it says one, five, two, two, five, one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight. Which you know to mean oversea.
2864.32 2875.12 speaker2  God damn it, Clark. It's one of your things.
2872.08 2945.60 speaker0  Do you guys know what the figurehead of a boat is? Yes. Is it like the naked lady? It is. But in this case, it's a young man with curly black hair and you all see Don's face shine with recognition. Because even without his glasses, Don recognizes Thomas Lewis, the activist who is anti-William Beans, still technically alive. His mouth is completely steeled shut with the melting silver shimmering sea. His silver mouth is closed. His bottom half is in the water. Continuously melting as he cries in absolutely horrendous pain. They are children.
2944.08 2962.88 speaker3  And kids.
2954.32 3029.92 speaker0  on, are standing at the front of this boat and behind them is Julie Maxwell wearing a hospital gown. She has a massive gash running down her forehead in between her eyes. Her nose seems to be missing and she smiles at you all with no teeth or lips on one full side of her face. That side has an eye, but her other orbital socket is oozing with the dark substance. And suddenly the body begins to crumple into the boat as a metallic ball rises above with these silvery shining limbs reaching out, one of which holds up the body of Julie Maxwell away from the steel shimmering water below this boat. And the other tendril reaches out and rips at the bridge that Dawn, Keith, and Jack are currently standing on.
3026.56 3062.80 speaker2  of when we were well across it, because you fellas just get inside. Let's all just come back inside. We'll be fine. Hey, I'm trying to hide my face from those kids and Clark, you should too, so they don't recognize us.
3053.76 3063.76 speaker3  I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing it every time. What kind of world are you living in?
