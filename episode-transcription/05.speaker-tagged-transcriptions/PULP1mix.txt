0.00 54.18 speaker0  Well, here we are once again, folks. For the first time. Again, it's your favorite radio DJ from inner and outer space, Wolf the Dog. And where and when the fuck am I? Hold on. It smells like East Coast. Let me check my local dimension time. It's 1937 and New Year's Eve. It's as if I have no control over what happens to me. Like someone is forcing me to play into the sick fantasy that's broadcast to all the world. But yeah, I guess we got a new Howlin' with Wolf or whatever. If these are even real.

Thank you to everyone who contributed Also, this episode right here kicks off the five episode guest run featuring Scott Dorward And call me Mrs. Liam Neeson and A New Age of Wonders deserves something full of pain and sorrow. It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow. before its blood ran cold. I didn't know that the wind could sew through tissue and faggot bones. Hollow when you said you were hollow. I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything. Oh, actually I'm peaking a bit. Let me just drop my gain. If your name is Scott Dorward, drop your gain to the floor.
286.26 302.82 speaker1  Nice. How'd you feel? I feel warm inside.
300.14 338.02 speaker0  Welcome everyone to Pretending to Be People. We are here with a special guest today who is not only one of the good friends of Jackson Elias, not only the man at the helm of multiple games throughout the internet, but currently including running the Pulp Cthulhu campaign two-headed serpent for the podcast How We Roll, and just the all around incredible writer, tabletop master, wizard extraordinaire on the internet. Man with the golden voice. but haven't told him that to his face,
336.74 349.10 speaker1  it's Scott Dorward! I'm never going to live up to that now. You know that.
347.42 393.10 speaker0  Well, Scott, you've already lived up to it because we had you on a while ago. Was it last year? Wow. Was it really? It was at the end of 2020, I think. Oh my God. And you ran Bleak Prospect for us, which is a Call of Cthulhu scenario that was written by a very talented writer for Call of Cthulhu. Who was that? Who was that? Oh, I forget. Well, you silly goose, it was written by you. Okay. I don't know why I've been so weird.
391.78 406.30 speaker2  I can't remember doing that. It might as well have been someone else.
404.02 411.02 speaker0  role-playing experiences of my life.
408.02 414.98 speaker2  and listen to repeatedly just to hear it all again.
412.94 439.98 speaker0  about the numbers, that it's just Joe. Yeah. So if you're listening to this and you haven't listened to that, Scott does an incredible job running Bleak Prospect for the four of us. And that was actually, that was a really wild time because Scott is in Europe and we are in North America, but at the time I was in Asia, so we were recording across three continents.
438.30 453.78 speaker2  Yeah, that was like five minutes a day when we were all in sync, wasn't it?
450.06 463.18 speaker0  Yeah, well, we're the international role-playing podcast. That's what everyone knows that. The Springfield, Missouri podcast is the international.
460.42 479.14 speaker2  We have a pretty big blip on the map of listeners in like South America. So recording in Asia, North America and Europe, having people in South America listen to it. We just got to get some of those researchers. Exactly, we got to get hit Antarctica.
476.58 492.42 speaker0  But today we're not playing Call of Cthulhu and today we are not playing Delta Green. And today we are playing.
490.30 496.50 speaker2  That was fun when Dungeons and Daddies did it. Oh, that was tight.
493.26 509.74 speaker3  But we're not doing that and we probably never will. Sorry, I haven't been talking much. I've just been trying to pretend like I wasn't working on my character sheet.
507.62 544.50 speaker0  I believe it's the first time that I personally have filled out a PC character sheet Pulp Cthulhu. I was able to run Waiting for the Hurricane from the back of the book, which was written by another good friend of Jackson Elias, Matt Sanderson. Yes. Is that right? And of course we are wishing a speedy recovery to Matt.
542.74 553.82 speaker1  It's been a scary month with Matt, but happily he's back home and on the road to recovery now.
552.04 558.16 speaker2  you had like a tooth issue. Oh fuck, yeah.
557.32 564.98 speaker1  Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah, I ended up having to have emergency surgery in part of my jaw removed.
563.82 568.46 speaker2  Oh man.
567.62 573.50 speaker1  No.
572.30 579.76 speaker2  after the surgery and stuff though?
578.94 582.98 speaker1  Yeah.
580.82 589.26 speaker2  Did they let you keep the part that they pulled?
586.34 594.86 speaker1  I absolutely would have kept it in a jar at my desk.
594.02 603.66 speaker2  Let's do it. Okay.
599.26 615.02 speaker1  and it's published in issue three of the Blasphemous Tome, which is the fanzine that we do for the Patreon backers of the Good Friends of Jackson Elias.
612.18 631.54 speaker0  am a patron of the Good Friends of Jackson Elias and the rewards that I reap are worth every fucking penny. Well, thank you, Zach.
629.94 644.66 speaker2  Every eight dollars counts.
640.94 719.50 speaker1  So this scenario takes place in 1937, particularly New Year's Eve, 1937. The player characters have all been invited, or at least they have managed to get themselves on the invitation list too, what promises to be the New Year's Eve party of the year. Or at least that's the way that the host has pitched it. The host is a man called Cicero Mordant. He comes from a moneyed background and his family is incredibly wealthy, but he himself has gone off in a somewhat different direction. He is an inventor, or at least a would be inventor. I mean, those of you who've kept up with his career know that he's enthusiastic, he's good at self-promotion, perhaps, and he certainly has the money to bring his inventions to the market. But really, fundamentally, he's a bit shit. that he's put out over the years are things like this self-playing violin, which promises to bring chamber music to every household, but it really just plays the same four bars over and over again, and goes out of tune in about five minutes.
717.98 727.50 speaker2  There was the electric hairnet,
724.22 797.14 speaker1  And there've been a number of unfortunate fires and the lawsuits are still in the courts at the moment. that he has got a magnificent new invention that he wants to show off to the world. And the launch of this invention is going to be this New Year's party at his family estate, The Mount, in rural Vermont. So let's, I'd say, introduce the player characters at this stage, and then we can just, I think, get you on the road to The Mount. So do you want to go round one by one to say who you're playing,
792.14 812.22 speaker3  and high profile people for my cult, The Last Branch.
808.58 865.06 speaker0  Elden Ring is my given name by myself. My given name for my family is none of my business, nor anyone else's. my dear Checkers to this wonderful New Year's Eve party and just helping him bring people to The Last Branch. Our goal is to get as many of the rich and powerful and Checkers' deep and utter charisma. There are things at work in this world, forces beyond our control, and we look to control those forces.
863.86 868.70 speaker1  in the world than money?
867.62 877.74 speaker2  True love.
876.70 903.22 speaker3  would like to get to know. Are there any more forces in the universe more powerful than love or money? And he studies that in depth. He's a scientist. Does he sound like that when he studies it? He doesn't. Yep. He's gonna be showing up to this party in disguise. Why? Dressed as a turtle? Because he is a professional,
900.42 909.22 speaker2  yeah, he's gonna be dressed as a turtle.
906.98 962.38 speaker3  and he wants to get a look at this invention, but he was not invited because he's on Mordent's shit list. I'm here to make sure nobody gets too close He hired me. I'm gonna protect him. I told you, Harvey, tonight, it's, it's, oh shit, what was the cover name?
961.54 971.46 speaker2  James Dean.
970.62 984.18 speaker3  and I think I'm gonna go too much into copying your accent, Scott.
982.18 987.62 speaker2  Do it, Scott, at Scott.
985.82 1007.34 speaker3  Maybe after a couple sessions. Sessions. After this episode.
1004.90 1021.06 speaker1  to somehow get hold of invitations to this New Year's Eve party, and you know that there has been transportation played on. All you have to do is get yourself to Montpellier in Vermont. There is a station there.
1020.06 1031.86 speaker2  I'm so sorry. It's Montpelier.
1029.18 1039.70 speaker0  and when I learned how to pronounce it, it was in Missouri, and we said Montpelier, Vermont.
1038.30 1051.90 speaker1  Montpelier, Montpelier. Montpelier, yeah.
1048.74 1058.86 speaker3  I bet Honeycutt does say Montpelier.
1055.18 1065.78 speaker0  I've got a beautiful 1932 bottle of Montpelier.
1063.06 1084.94 speaker1  Right, so yes, you know all you have to do is get yourself to Montpelier in rural Vermont, and then there will be transportation at the station that is laid on for you. And sure enough, when the train pulls in at the station,
1082.70 1092.98 speaker4  of well-dressed people
1087.98 1149.94 speaker1  Men in full evening dress with heavy overcoats on, women in gowns, again, with furs over them to keep themselves warm, because it is cold. It's been snowing fairly heavily. There's storm clouds up in the sky, and you can see that the snow is falling already. a few of them holding up signs announcing that they're to take people to the mount. And after the usual moment's hesitation, people start flocking towards those vehicles. Shall we say, I mean, if you're happy with this, shall we say that the group of the four of you
1147.70 1178.58 speaker4  four passengers in the back. And there are enough people, guests who have arrived to the party, that they're pretty much filling up all the cars. One of the chauffeurs ushers the four of you Gentlemen, you are going to the mount, right?
1175.46 1190.58 speaker1  Mr. Mordant has arranged for transportation
1188.30 1204.38 speaker3  He's a big, strong, strong dude. And so he's wearing a tuxedo, but it's a little tight in all the right places. It's a little bit stretched almost, but he's pulling it off pretty okay.
1202.50 1209.38 speaker1  just creaks as you get in. Yeah, exactly.
1205.82 1226.08 speaker2  Checkers is wearing like a cashmere three-piece suit. He's got like a full beard. Definitely trying to look older than he is, but he's dressed very fancifully.
1221.98 1267.54 speaker0  black pair of trousers and a white cotton shirt that is buttoned down, buttoned all the way to the top. And it has like a granddad collar, like an old school non-collar. like asks if I'm cold or need a fur or whatever, you know,
1264.04 1321.90 speaker3  that is as tailored as Harvey's is not. He, I mean, he looks fantastic. He looks like a 30s or 40s movie star and he's got this perfect like pencil thin mustache and a really dashing long tail coat, not a tail coat, but a long coat, it's winter in Vermont Quickly improvise a coat, He's carrying a very, very bulky briefcase. It's almost like a suitcase. It's way too large to be bringing to a New Year's Eve party, but he's got it tucked tightly under his arm and he's kind of looking suspiciously at the two people we've been paired up with. And he's like, Harvey, I don't like the look of these chaps.
1318.54 1324.14 speaker2  Upon hearing that Harvey is going to just mean mug
1321.90 1328.34 speaker3  these other two guys in the car with us.
1324.14 1343.38 speaker2  Yeah, I look at, you forgot my name? Elden Ring, yeah. Checkers looks at Elden. Did he really just say that out loud? Looking-
1341.78 1345.06 speaker3  I said it so you couldn't hear.
1343.38 1349.38 speaker2  We're all in a car together. You have to get in a car.
1348.54 1350.46 speaker3  You've got headphones on.
1349.38 1356.94 speaker0  I have headphones on.
1354.54 1366.58 speaker2  Do you think they'd be interested in our pitch?
1363.74 1384.62 speaker0  that is now like completely covering his face, he goes in with both hands and kind of makes a window for his eyes in between with a full middle part of this super long hair and just lets off the most unattractive smile at these two gentlemen.
1383.78 1392.30 speaker2  Yeah.
1388.74 1422.38 speaker3  Lafayette is like sitting across from Elden and he's got his like very long, like elegant legs, like one folded over the other and you can see his foot is tapping just very, very anxiously and annoyedly, sort of half glaring, half just studying this creature that just sat down in front of him and parted its weird, greasy hair.
1420.98 1425.90 speaker0  Yeah, sorry.
1423.58 1466.10 speaker2  Yeah, let's start that again. Hello, Checkers, this is Elden, gentlemen. and hand it over to Harley. I don't like your presence in my town. None savory element. Well, maybe we'll just leave each other to what we like to do and we won't discuss this in the car.
1463.62 1467.66 speaker3  if we left your hokum here at the station.
1466.10 1479.78 speaker2  Checkers takes no offense to that because he does not believe in what he's selling at all. So he's just kind of like, fair enough.
1477.22 1492.78 speaker1  And this is why your cult only has two people in it.
1491.58 1537.10 speaker3  He gets a kind of ride. He said he didn't want to hear about it. Yes, it is quite a big world. Elden, did you say your name was? in ways I don't think either of you two would comprehend. Oh, right. I like it, I like it, it feels right.
1536.26 1548.30 speaker2  It feels right. If that's the case, then you really should read this. And I offer the pamphlet for my cult again. Right.
1544.98 1561.62 speaker3  He's suddenly like got a panic look and he's like,
1560.78 1562.46 speaker2  Right.
1561.62 1563.90 speaker5  Are you rich?
1562.46 1568.78 speaker3  Yeah, yeah.
1566.82 1572.22 speaker5  but we'll talk about it when we get to the point.
1570.50 1578.70 speaker0  when you're dealing in eternity.
1577.34 1583.50 speaker2  He hands it over to him.
1580.22 1588.86 speaker3  He like reaches out with a handkerchief and grabs it.
1586.22 1592.18 speaker2  What is this stain on?
1590.58 1594.74 speaker3  What is this stain?
1593.90 1602.38 speaker0  Thank you.
1599.82 1606.70 speaker5  It's magic.
1605.02 1645.58 speaker3  boy, that was a close one, Harvey. We're to, you know, one up old Mordent and unveil my invention and he pats the big box. Did you, we're saying this to each other in confidence. Billy actor's like, name a woman. Just like, Janine Garofalo.
1643.74 1665.98 speaker1  while you're having this conversation, supposedly in private, I mean, it's a small cab and I'd like to think the other two can just overhear every single fucking thing you're saying.
1664.74 1690.06 speaker2  How'd you get invited? I'm a prominent socialite. And I'm his friend. Fair enough. This is my man.
1686.38 1710.50 speaker1  the car is passing, first of all, through the town itself, which doesn't take very long. It's not a big town. And then heads off into, first of all, some country roads. You're moving through some fairly light woodland and then slightly thicker forest.
1708.10 1756.86 speaker4  one of the big peaks around here. Those of you who know the area or who've looked at a map beforehand might realize that it's Mount Ellen. And you do seem to be moving towards the base of it. And at some point you move off onto a private road, which is much, much smaller. And the driver's having to slow down a fair bit at this stage because the snow's getting quite heavy. Not heavy enough that he's losing control of the vehicle, but visibility's suffering a little bit. But more importantly, he's obviously fighting a bit with traction on the road. But as you get closer, you can start to see... Well, first of all, have any of you been to the mount before or is this your first visit?
1756.02 1764.98 speaker2  Same.
1762.38 1775.18 speaker3  Lafayette had been and was kicked out. Oh yeah. Of course. at New Year's Eve, like 1933.
1774.34 1784.22 speaker0  that same night? I did. And what was that? What kind of jacket are you wearing?
1783.38 1811.94 speaker2  and that was his invention. That would be exactly, yeah. you should invent a self-fucking you.
1809.70 1817.66 speaker0  So that's what you've been working on ever since?
1816.46 1847.14 speaker3  You don't know what he's been working on and then he packed the box again. Yeah, for Morden, when he sees how fucking cool it is.
1844.78 1875.98 speaker2  The kind that supply a party. That's what the rich do. Glassware? You are almost there.
1873.90 1915.70 speaker4  style mansion that is the mount with all its outbuildings around here. Before you get to it, though, you do pass by an odd-looking structure, which Nathaiad doesn't recognize as having been here the last time that you visited the mount. And it looks fairly incongruous. maybe the kind of lookout tower that you might get in the forest. Like on the forest moon of Indor?
1913.78 1928.50 speaker1  Sorry, am I lagging again?
1924.38 1963.30 speaker4  on the edge of the property that looks a bit like a tower, maybe a lookout tower that, you know, firefighters might use in a forest or forest rangers, rather. Like on the forest moon of Indor? if you want to give me a spot, hit and roll just to see what they can make out anymore. Oh boy.
1962.18 1969.86 speaker0  That is a hard success.
1969.02 1976.22 speaker2  On a? On a 40.
1974.78 1982.62 speaker1  We'll get to you in a moment.
1978.70 1988.10 speaker0  So if it's over double your skill, it's a fumble?
1986.94 1999.62 speaker4  If your skill is over 50, you have to roll a double zero for it to be a fumble.
1998.54 2004.42 speaker0  This is poor Cthulhu after all.
2001.26 2010.14 speaker1  So yeah, you do notice that there are some things
2006.74 2019.30 speaker4  that look maybe like radio aerials. Yeah, I mean, there are all sorts of spiky protrusions coming out.
2017.04 2030.66 speaker0  coming out the top of that lookout tower?
2028.26 2035.62 speaker1  then that's the point at which the car goes
2033.46 2046.58 speaker4  through all the magnificent pros that you've just written. Oh, man.
2043.14 2050.90 speaker2  Yeah, my pencil I was using pokes me in the eye
2049.62 2075.98 speaker0  Are you okay, Master? while still giving personal space to his favorite Checkers.
2073.42 2155.10 speaker4  that are parked there already. A few guests have got out and some of them are just going into the main entrance, there are lights on in most of the rooms, but the main activity seems to be coming from a room over on the left-hand side where you can see that there's a lot of bright light coming out from the windows, there's the sound of swing music playing rather loudly in there and through the windows, you can see activity going on. the front window of that room just sticking out of the wall and some fairly thick cables coming down from it. what is your scientific specialization?
2153.70 2165.90 speaker3  Engineering is his focus and mechanical, electrical, and computers.
2162.18 2175.06 speaker4  to see whether you can make sense of this at all.
2172.54 2181.06 speaker1  and I mean, there's something weird about it.
2177.62 2214.38 speaker4  It doesn't look like an old radio aerial. There's a bit of a dish behind it and it looks like, I don't know, maybe it's designed to focus something, but yeah, there's something about it
2212.42 2231.06 speaker0  and he just like whispers in your ear and I'm like a foot shorter than you would have elbowed towards.
2229.06 2235.54 speaker3  Yeah, he's a tall wisp.
2232.74 2242.42 speaker0  I'm like an absolute waif of a man.
2240.18 2247.66 speaker2  into like protect mode and he grabs you
2245.90 2255.22 speaker0  And as you do, he's just like, but it's nothing compared to the mind. I just want you to keep your distance
2253.78 2258.70 speaker3  from here on out, you understand?
2257.86 2262.90 speaker5  don't be touching him.
2261.06 2269.98 speaker2  My man is having a conversation with your man
2269.14 2276.90 speaker5  Deal.
2274.06 2309.66 speaker0  and Elden's feet are twiddling back and forth and he is staring directly into Harvey's eyes and making a choice. And then his eyes kind of soften. I don't wanna hurt you.
2306.78 2332.38 speaker3  Also probably people don't talk back to Harvey much at all.
2328.10 2342.98 speaker0  before grabbing the invitations out of his trouser pocket.
2339.58 2392.72 speaker4  You can see that the chauffeurs, having dropped people off, are running over to one of the outbuildings where it looks like they've got their own party in progress, just on the other side of the courtyard. and there's a maid there. Oh, in fact, there are a few maids there who seem to be ushering guests in in shifts and taking their coats. And yeah, there's a uniformed maid who comes up and looks around at the bunch of you and says,
2388.28 2400.68 speaker2  and then grabs a bunch of pamphlets out of the pocket as he's handing it over, puts them in his pocket.
2397.44 2410.88 speaker0  as Checkers hands over his coat and is like, do not misplace the master's coat.
2407.12 2414.28 speaker5  It was expensive, so put it in a special place.
2412.96 2426.76 speaker1  is standing there looking at the bunch of you wishing to get a word in edgeways. over to the ballroom, and she points out
2424.32 2442.28 speaker4  that are open just over on your left. because of course the fuck he is.
2439.84 2457.40 speaker1  from his previous visits to the mount
2453.84 2481.56 speaker4  but he has no eye for how things go together. The decor is generally tacky for people who've got genuine taste.
2480.60 2487.72 speaker2  I'd do it up like this.
2486.36 2490.68 speaker3  Thank you for watching after me. If you think this is luxurious,
2489.20 2499.48 speaker5  you should see our joint.
2495.24 2511.40 speaker3  We are moving, why are you still right next to us? Yes, Eldon, so please, please go mingle.
2508.32 2532.96 speaker5  but his friend, he seems like somebody we could get. about the last branch and all the good that we're doing.
2530.88 2534.88 speaker0  Harvey dutifully just follows Lafayette.
2534.04 2548.60 speaker5  Chandeliers. I know her name, but do you remember it?
2546.24 2564.52 speaker0  Yes, her name is Candace Germain. Correct, let's find her.
2562.68 2575.28 speaker2  Yes, Harvey, you may have one drink.
2574.16 2625.12 speaker4  in a few different directions. You can see that there are other sets of double doors around here that are obviously going into other rooms that may be off limits to you. There's a staircase going up to the upstairs, obviously, in it at the moment because it is a ballroom. It's got a few side tables set up with snacks and drinks and there are uniform staff wandering around with trays,
2621.64 2629.76 speaker1  It's quite a large ballroom and maybe the guest list
2627.24 2679.48 speaker4  just plain haven't turned up. There is a stage that is set up One, the most obvious thing is there is a live band and some bulky shapes, boxy shapes that are covered by sheets or a tarpaulin. that it roughly corresponds to where you saw the cable
2677.16 2694.88 speaker1  But yeah, as I said, there are a few dozen people
2693.24 2717.76 speaker3  When we walk in the room, just kind of clock it, see if there's anything that could maybe pose a threat to him.
2714.60 2727.52 speaker4  I mean, if you can think of a way of escalating the situation and potentially putting yourself at risk while assessing threats, I'd be open to that.
2725.88 2743.64 speaker5  if you're on the chandelier. Yeah.
2741.60 2782.56 speaker1  up to the side that you could go on. Like I say, there is a full swing band up there Okay, yeah, I think if you fail the push here, There are a few people who are obviously moneyed.
2780.60 2790.28 speaker4  that, yeah, there are definitely a few movers and shakers here.
2786.36 2802.28 speaker3  like he followed Harvey very poorly, kind of like crouched down behind him, He pokes out behind him on the stage and he's like, oh, I see some of my cousins here, this is...
2801.08 2817.84 speaker1  You can see a few other people
2814.68 2863.04 speaker4  that makes you think that they're probably academics. Then there are a few other people who just don't seem to fit in. the others mentioning Candace Germaine earlier, but I mean, you certainly do spot her in the crowd and you may have seen some of her films. She seems to be in deep conversation at the moment with a fairly good looking man in clerical garb wearing a black shirt and a dog collar, who, you know, the two of them are in very animated conversation.
2861.68 2896.16 speaker3  We got the real money, we got the guys who are more like you, the thinkers, and it looks like there's a, That's Candace Germaine right there. and you're crouched down behind me.
2892.60 2909.88 speaker1  in between the guitarist and the bassist of the swing band and the two of them are just stepping around you
2908.52 2926.76 speaker2  because there's something very strange
2924.60 2932.68 speaker0  that they were pointing and talking about, talking to the cleric man.
2930.56 2944.20 speaker5  and I just kind of nod at him. Bring her to me.
2940.40 2955.28 speaker4  or whatever he is and she walks over and starts talking to someone else.
2953.16 2964.20 speaker0  or good looking one to start the conversation. We kind of have a thing where if we can isolate someone, we can slowly work them down into joining us.
2962.48 2973.12 speaker1  So is it Checkers who's going over?
2970.60 3012.76 speaker4  looks like he's probably in his late 50s, dressed in a three piece suit. He's fairly jowdy. He's got red features, a few broken veins across his face and ruby eyes to see what they can recognize who the man is. who's seen as Charlton Billings. He's a Senator from Vermont.
3009.40 3032.20 speaker5  My name is, you can just call me Checkers. And I reach my hand out to shake his hand. Well, he gives you a warm handshake We're all friends here.
3029.12 3038.40 speaker4  I hope I can count on your vote next year.
3034.84 3048.92 speaker5  who may not be so inclined to vote for you, but maybe you could go convince him. And I gesture at Eldon.
3047.12 3059.44 speaker0  like away from the crowd. And he's just staring through his parted hair across the party.
3057.76 3069.40 speaker5  Senator things.
3065.64 3090.92 speaker1  kind of looks him up and down and looks back at you. He says, are you sure he votes?
3088.00 3102.96 speaker5  And he's got strong feelings. And then I wink at him and I want to roll charm.
3099.84 3124.44 speaker1  He says, well, a voter's a voter, I suppose.
3122.92 3132.64 speaker4  The party hasn't been going for that long, but it looks like she's quite drunk already. Does she have a drink in her hand? Oh, absolutely, yeah.
3130.76 3144.40 speaker5  It's, I'll hold it for you. And I grab the like martini and I just like drink the rest of it
3141.68 3166.88 speaker1  Oh, it's all right, I can get another. No, no, no, she says, it's all right, it's all right. Give me a moment. I'll pay a visit to the ladies room
3165.68 3168.84 speaker5  Perfect, well.
3166.88 3181.08 speaker1  You're welcome to join me if you want.
3179.20 3202.92 speaker3  Our perfect record is untouched. If Eldon or Checkers had looked up at any point in that time, they would have seen Lafayette and Harvey slipping out of the main ballroom, trying to follow some of these wires and some of the weird mechanical things that he's seeing here.
3201.32 3209.20 speaker4  to where that aerial was.
3206.12 3219.68 speaker5  he's like grabbing like champagne off the waiters, like things and just like downing it because he's actually never done drugs and he's very nervous.
3218.56 3231.96 speaker3  Oh yeah, huge. Also you're 19. I'm underage drinking. The movie star just asked you to go to the bathroom to get cocaine, which is pretty cool.
3229.88 3248.92 speaker2  is she like a late twenties actress or is she like established? It's 1937.
3244.20 3257.24 speaker4  and just makes a bit of small talk and says, do you manage to get here all right? because you're here, aren't you?
3254.76 3266.64 speaker1  Sorry, I don't know where my head is today
3264.12 3278.88 speaker5  and then he looks at the lines of coke on the bathroom counter
3277.44 3282.00 speaker3  to make sure you don't die.
3280.16 3284.72 speaker0  where when you actually do drugs in the game, you have to do drugs as the player.
3283.60 3292.68 speaker2  We're method playing.
3287.68 3298.56 speaker3  while we go find some cocaine and we'll be right back.
3296.28 3314.92 speaker1  the last three lines single-handedly and says, oh my, aren't you a hungry little boy?
3313.28 3318.60 speaker2  I've got a big personality.
3317.16 3329.36 speaker1  it's good enough for you. Exactly.
3326.32 3337.48 speaker5  about our last conversation about last branch and maybe be in the face of it? Yes, yes.
3334.56 3348.28 speaker1  I think I may have other commitments now.
3345.88 3355.72 speaker5  You know, you could, it could just be something you mentioned when you do everything else that you do.
3354.04 3367.52 speaker4  It's got to change the world, you know. What is his invention?
3365.84 3377.32 speaker5  Maybe you could introduce me to him. I haven't met him yet either.
3375.12 3385.08 speaker1  and that was the last of the cocaine.
3383.80 3397.16 speaker5  I'll look around. In the meantime, he pulls out a piece of paper and you can tell it's like a crudely drawn up contract. And he...
3394.72 3415.96 speaker3  It's like stick figures and it's like, just him giving her the paper and the paper says your soul.
3414.04 3419.52 speaker5  just sign this at the bottom here.
3418.56 3424.48 speaker1  and send it back to you. Oh, we don't need, I studied,
3423.64 3431.72 speaker5  She laughs.
3428.40 3441.72 speaker1  and says, after all the things that happened with the MGM, my lawyer told me never to sign anything again
3439.40 3451.48 speaker5  but he had to take his chance anyway. So he grabs the contract back, folds it up and he's like, okay, well, I'll talk to you when I find more.
3449.32 3456.32 speaker1  But don't forget cocaine.
3453.88 3474.48 speaker5  And he leaves the bathroom and it's in his mind, but it really, he isn't gonna actively be looking for drugs.
3473.16 3483.76 speaker3  And in like 20 minutes, he's gonna be looking for more cocaine. Yes, absolutely.
3480.56 3489.96 speaker1  Okay, well, let's cut back to Lafayette
3488.16 3524.20 speaker4  And now without your coats, In fact, it's like a bunch of cables that have been bound together that are going up to this aerial.
3522.80 3528.60 speaker2  Oh, God.
3525.80 3538.40 speaker1  to see whether your tongue ends up frozen to the cables?
3536.88 3541.36 speaker3  Pass, 17 on a 55. Okay, yeah.
3539.40 3555.20 speaker1  I mean, you pull it away just in time so you can feel the ice crystals falling across.
3553.64 3572.48 speaker0  Everyone's looking at me weird.
3570.08 3627.44 speaker4  In fact, it looks like it's designed to carry quite a lot of power, but it's just going up to this aerial contraption, which doesn't really make a lot of sense to you. that the aerial is pointing in the direction of that wooden tower that you saw across on the outskirts of the compound. but this is like industrial cabling. If you're going to try to sabotage it like that, it would require, yeah, for a start, tools, a bit of time. You probably need a ladder to get up there. I mean, it's not impossible. It's just under the circumstances a bit tricky.
3624.68 3644.08 speaker3  He's honestly trying to unplug it. But when he realizes it's going nowhere, he sets it down and he's like, only joking, Harvey, we don't want to win that way.
3643.24 3684.36 speaker4  I do. Okay, you made your engineering role earlier. Yeah, you don't know entirely for sure. You'd have to go and take a look at what's in that tower at the back of your brain. You're thinking of some of the wilder designs
3681.60 3690.00 speaker3  Harvey, you fool. There's nothing to learn from that, but that it tastes of cold.
3688.76 3693.12 speaker2  That's exactly what I was going to say. It tastes like cold.
3692.04 3700.16 speaker3  Harvey, please listen. This is terribly important. Again, this is not normal science.
3699.12 3747.72 speaker2  How are we talking?
3742.72 3754.20 speaker6  I thought you might be starving. So I gave you everything. rattling my jaw.
