0.00 81.36 speaker0  This is yet another introduction to the show known as PTBP. The good numbers follow, 694.2. I'm Wolf the dog, the dog father, the dog mother, the dog puppy. Many more nicknames follow. I'm glad you can be here with us today, whatever today is, whenever today is. And speaking of today, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Dean in the UK. Dean writes, Hello Mr. Wolf. What's the time, Mr. Wolf? It's time for more sickly sweet dumps to dive in. Anyway, enough about my weekend. I just wanted to give a big shout out to the fine fellas from Contention doing their absolute best to keep us safe and sane. You, yes you too, Mr. Wolf, have brought such joy, delight, and revulsion into my life. And I couldn't be happier. Just a shout out to my wife, Ellen, for trusting in me and listening to the show. Two avid listeners from the UK. Much love, y'all. Signed, Dean, a fool.
77.04 94.96 speaker1  Well, hello Dean, if that is your real name.
87.68 224.88 speaker0  And do us all a favor and keep converting more and more people to be disciples of the wolf, the dog. If you want to write up something for your dog mother to howl, please submit your memorandum as a five-star review on Apple Podcasts. And I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP. Either way, I got some news for you. It's time for the news. In the early morning of March 22nd, Daniel M. White, an active Delta Green agent and the former partner of Arvon Chilton, Neighbors in his apartment complex reported they heard shouting, then weeping, He had been stabbed 25 times and his eyes had been meticulously cut out. Last time, I said Brian Bolger, bowl like a bowl of slop and grr like an upset dog. But I have since realized his name is Brian Bolger, bowl like load one up and grr like the prefix to cough. So go ahead, load a bowl and jerk off. It's Brian Bolger with Bad in a Good Way.
218.64 273.36 speaker1  And the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind. I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face. I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face. Alexander Duchene looks at Agent Sparrow. He is 79 years of age. He is clothed in old often mended clothing and a pork pie hat.
266.32 306.16 speaker2  It's clear that he drinks due to the large nose with burst capillaries, just filling this big, almost like pulsating thing on the tip of his nose. And he moves slowly, seemingly with great pain, And as he says that, a massive thunderclap hits and rain starts to begin pouring down outside
303.28 319.68 speaker0  Can I do an intelligence check about what As You Like It's about? Sure, yeah.
317.92 337.68 speaker2  Shit, amazing. Before anybody clarifies what it is, Agent Sparrow, Sparrow Agnew, and have you read it? Did you find it to be fitting?
336.32 344.16 speaker1  I haven't had time.
342.72 352.16 speaker2  Do you know what he found? Did he clarify? Why do you think he found it fitting? I don't know.
348.64 365.20 speaker1  People who are into that kind of thing, you know, they're nerds.
364.40 381.20 speaker2  I've read them all. All? All of Shakespeare. Yeah.

419.20 426.16 speaker1  Did he have a key to your apartment? Yes. Yes.
422.72 436.80 speaker2  Maybe we should look around to see if he hid anything in here.
434.80 441.04 speaker1  hid anything in my apartment.
438.08 481.92 speaker2  So if you don't mind, my associates are going to start looking around. Oh, uh, yes. Who's your favorite team? The New York. The new one. That's right. Who didn't? Yes. Were you good? Hey, you look at this like five foot seven, 210 pound man. And he's just like, no.
478.08 492.16 speaker1  I was a bit of a ball magnet crowd, the plate and hope they hit me. Cause I wasn't much of a contact hitter.
486.96 508.64 speaker2  I find that they take away from value funds that could be applied to youth academics. He rolls his eyes at Elwood. Not getting it.
508.32 522.88 speaker1  Okay. Well, you guys should go on out and, um, you know, take, take your call, talk to whoever
521.28 525.30 speaker2  Do we clock that or is that Zach? He will human.
524.80 535.12 speaker1  Okay.
531.76 558.64 speaker2  Oh yeah. There's clearly something wrong with this old man.
557.76 576.32 speaker1  They come in. It makes me talk weird. I know. I'm sorry.
574.40 578.32 speaker2  It sounds like it's kind of come over you.
577.36 604.64 speaker1  It's it's still here. This is when I'm like really trying to hold back a cough. And I just don't like wearing them. The diapers.
603.04 640.40 speaker2  The bandages smell. And if I did like a medicine roll, do you think I could determine maybe what caused his scar? Okay. How'd you get that scar, Mr. Duchesne?
639.44 670.96 speaker1  A horse. I fell off a horse. Of course. On two. I fell. that they wear. Tack, yeah. Yeah. as I fell off.
670.16 683.20 speaker2  One. This is a lie. Why are you lying to me, Mr. Duchesne? His face gets super serious. As you look into his eyes, he looks past you.
682.56 689.92 speaker1  Who are you? Why are you in my house?
687.92 698.96 speaker2  Special agent Clarissa Sparrow. And he's like, get out.

709.60 723.44 speaker2  Pass. He's fucking with you. You can drop the act, Mr. Duchesne. Something about my line of questioning has made you uncomfortable.
721.76 727.28 speaker1  And I kind of make eyes at Kevin.
724.40 742.96 speaker2  Kevin puts his hand on Duchesne's shoulder. Not like to hurt him, but like it is shoulders.
740.80 745.20 speaker1  My memory is so good.
744.80 750.80 speaker2  It is. Mr. Duchesne.
747.92 756.34 speaker1  I want to tell you that I don't know.
755.84 790.24 speaker2  Yeah. He does not remember how he got this scar. Mr. Duchesne, you have some problems with your memory. plop one in her mouth and just throws it behind her back.
789.92 793.68 speaker1  All right.
792.48 824.48 speaker2  Thank you very much for that. Have a good day. Thank you for your spread. And you guys head back to the Ocean City Police Department. Yeah, that's a good question. That is a good question. Okay, cool. So definitely childhood or early childhood. Okay.
824.24 827.12 speaker0  All right.
826.00 830.40 speaker1  So back at the PD. Going back to the police department.
828.40 833.92 speaker2  We've got to meet the Newark Police Department.
831.44 835.52 speaker1  Detective Mara Quinlan.
833.92 864.72 speaker2  And she's PD, not. She is PD. Yeah. where Quinlan is set up in a smaller room than the FBI. The FBI guy was set up in this big conference room with an entire conference table, And Mara Quinlan is in a closet.
861.36 867.04 speaker1  No, she's from Newark, but she's been brought in because
864.72 918.42 speaker2  part of the case took place in her jurisdiction. So there's some cross lines. Her hair is done very, very neatly. Her makeup is done very neatly. Her nails are done very neatly. She's just a very well put together person and professionally addresses you when you enter the room. Sparrow's very quickly like, Pleasure to meet you, Detective Quinlan. Pleasure's on my agent. Agent Clarissa Sparrow. These are my associates. Sparrow. Agent Boyd. Hi, Kevin. Yeah.
917.92 929.12 speaker1  That's her.
923.76 960.48 speaker2  She laughs and she's like, Yeah, you know, he seems like a nice guy. Like his whole idea that it's a kidnapping thing. I'm not for that. I think that this is a crime of passion clearly committed by Chilton. Eileen McCarty is the body who died in her own home. Her husband is the body that died in his own home. She rolls her eyes real big and says, Uncle Jimmy.
959.28 964.96 speaker1  He's a good guy.
963.76 998.96 speaker2  I just disagree with him. You've seen the crime scene photos. one and pulls up. I'll be damned if I know what's going on. There's just there's anomalies all over the place. In this case, it's wild. In my experience, all anomalies and mysteries can be solved with rational, sensible answers.
998.00 1011.20 speaker1  It could be magic.
1006.24 1012.32 speaker2  He just kind of like, if you speak out of turn one more time on my task force.
1011.20 1026.32 speaker1  Or you'll do what?
1022.16 1072.16 speaker2  shoulder and he just does a light double squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. When she saw the awkwardness happening, she immediately turned around and started fiddling with files on this desk. I fully believe that that body is Eileen McCarty, but you know, three witnesses the day after time of death is strange for sure. Yes. So this is in addition to the witnesses who saw her on the day of the gas station crimes. Yeah.
1071.44 1075.92 speaker1  Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
1074.08 1132.64 speaker2  The day after they saw her in New York. Yeah, she was seen at the gas station where that murder, that horrible, horrible murder She shudders. One of her hands begins to like grip the desk and her knuckles turn white. I don't know. Well, if it, if it helps at all in my role as a profiler criminal psychologist, you learn a lot about how regular people act too. Sometimes they just shut down with the fear and they can't, they can't think of doing the right thing. Oh yeah. She's just nodding her head and eating it up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's why we do the job we do. You signed up to do something. Exactly. That's, that's what your service to this community is.
1130.64 1140.88 speaker1  I've given you everything I have.
1138.00 1145.52 speaker2  I know you probably saw uncle Jimmy. All of our copies of those are, well, disgusting. Yeah.
1145.20 1150.80 speaker1  Yeah. So I I've, I've got some on, on a thumb drive here if you want them.
1149.92 1151.12 speaker2  I take the phone drive.
1150.80 1160.00 speaker1  Yeah.
1157.68 1163.28 speaker2  over at Elwood and then tosses it to him.
1162.08 1174.48 speaker1  It sticks to his hand.

1277.44 1319.36 speaker2  Oh, that looks good. Right? Yeah. It's like an old house. It does. It looks like an old house, like an old three-story house. And there's a nice green awning on the outside that says ocean city cafe, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and there's some nice patio tables, like four or five tables outside with umbrellas. No one's sitting outside cause it's fucking coming down cats and dogs.

And, uh, as an embarrassed server might do turns and, uh, wanting that good tip later is just like, no, no, no, my bad. And goes to the back. You're so fucked there because you can bring out both things separately, but you still brought out one thing you were not supposed to bring. is just like, did I mean to do this? I do. a few minutes later with a coffee and two chocolate milks filled with the brim with ice cubes. Now I just wanted to do one more check on that butter, no toast. Was that butter, no toast or toast, no butter? What do you think? That's a, that's a very good, that's a very good point, ma'am. Sorry to bother you. And she walks back. Still not a hundred percent.
1505.76 1520.08 speaker1  She's definitely bringing you butter.
1514.00 1526.08 speaker2  I think at least now agent Sparrow is like really deep in these crime scene photos.
1524.16 1528.48 speaker3  Yeah, fuck yeah, you can have a computer.
1527.76 1533.60 speaker1  I'm pulling it up.

1563.36 1577.12 speaker1  That's right. Yeah.
1575.04 1595.20 speaker2  Oh, nice pass 32. I fail. Okay. So, uh, you are going to lose three sanity. Elwood Boyd loses three sanity.
1591.68 1602.08 speaker3  so that you guys can see it, but he doesn't want it in his field of view at all.
1600.40 1613.12 speaker2  through this file like system. She's been given reports like this before and she's just like tabbing through and she's like, yeah, okay. No eyes, no eyes.
1610.80 1623.04 speaker3  So do you think the book is a clue?
1617.92 1631.68 speaker2  character, he holds his wrists limp and then one over the other. We'll post a picture. Yeah.
1629.52 1684.32 speaker3  That's the sort of the picture of my brain. You're right. The E was important.
1683.76 1693.92 speaker1  Oh, okay. It'll get you something different.
1692.24 1708.88 speaker2  46 on a 60 medicine. Okay.
1704.48 1710.96 speaker1  here except sand loss, especially because you passed that sanity check. Oh yeah, you did just say that.
1709.92 1742.32 speaker2  You can dive in. Yeah, I did. Eileen. You can match it up enough to where like the corpse. Yeah, anyone who thinks that this is not Eileen is really grasping at straws to make a case that they want. Now I think I know what's going on as Thomas, but Agent Sparrow doesn't.
1738.48 1749.28 speaker1  Agent Sparrow definitely would because she doesn't know the scenario is called control
1742.32 1770.64 speaker2  copy or that this podcast is called pretending to be people and like that's part. She does. She does like take a note of the fact that this is certainly Eileen's corpse unless she These witnesses were sorely mistaken.
1769.28 1782.88 speaker3  Oh, I'm glad you brought that up.
1780.32 1785.76 speaker2  Y'all are just friendlies right now, right? Is that what they call you?
1783.52 1800.64 speaker3  We're friends with each other for a long time. Right, right. No, we're full-fledged these days. We've done a couple of these now.
1799.20 1807.60 speaker2  talking to civilians. Well, you know, it's a police officer, but you can't be talking to the uninitiated about
1805.36 1809.28 speaker3  the supernatural and the otherworldly.
1808.48 1950.48 speaker2  You're right, bud. That is probably magic, but we can't be saying that to detectives from Newark. Do you know what I mean? She slowly sits down a plate of butter. And you can tell she's really deep and lot like she got she's on a trail and she just kind of absentmindedly like spoons butter into her mouth. And like it looks she makes an unpleasant face, but doesn't, you know, spit it out or really clock that that's what she's just done. It looks like it's so scary. Dark brown. Yeah, yeah. Agent Sparrow's like stomach sinks. And she kind of like holds him on her forearm like a server might as she's like, yeah, this thing.
1948.16 1966.08 speaker1  like a pentagram, but it's not a bear. It's like a person.
1964.32 1971.92 speaker3  Is it like the rotruvian man? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1971.44 2015.36 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, yeah. then I thought. And she points to the menu. She says, I will take the skinned and pinned. earlier. I think you could tell. I was trying to listen to you guys too.
2010.80 2026.32 speaker1  You know, I dropped out, but I'm going to get that big break and I'm going to write the story that puts my name on the map. Do you know?
2023.28 2036.88 speaker2  degree and going into some kind of criminal enforcement. That's the only way I really see to make a difference. But because that's what we did do, it's our job to scoop around, figure that out. That's not that's not yours.
2035.52 2038.64 speaker3  And do you have any pie?
2037.12 2053.92 speaker2  Why don't you butt out and get us some pie? And one spin and pinned extra crispy. Completely turned off by this situation. She's not going to try to make any more chitchat with you guys.
2052.48 2055.44 speaker1  are finishing up the pie.
2054.64 2084.48 speaker2  Blueberry. Thank you very much. Agent Sparrow leaves a not great, but sensible and not insulting tip. It's probably like 17.
2082.80 2090.24 speaker3  whatever is left of the pad of butter. Do I see that?
2089.92 2102.40 speaker2  Sure.
2098.32 2125.52 speaker3  mouth from doubling down this plate and then butter also. Jesus. It's horrible.
2124.00 2148.88 speaker1  Alien abortion. Alien abortion. Alien abortion. Alien abortion. Get this beast out of my belly. How does Kevin do push-ups?
2147.36 2154.56 speaker3  It's how he keeps in shape.
2154.24 2158.00 speaker2  a minute. Can we talk for a second?
2157.44 2162.00 speaker3  Sure.
2159.92 2170.32 speaker2  What's the nature of your...
2168.64 2183.76 speaker3  That's kind of the way I like to think of him. Yeah, I mean, look at me. I wouldn't do anything in a fight and I do run my mouth from time to time and I feel like I should have some muscle there. He's always been by my side. I keep him around.
2183.20 2187.22 speaker2  Yeah. Would you say you're friends?
2186.72 2199.52 speaker3  Yeah.
2195.44 2230.32 speaker2  She's just like, can't. All right. Can't think about that necessarily right now. Yeah, you look down at the ground to get away from that thought. Do you know what gets dark brown when it dries?
2228.56 2235.68 speaker3  Oh, oh.
2233.52 2248.24 speaker2  I'm going to go take a look at this graffiti. Could you keep him here doing pushups? Do you think you could handle the side of that if you knew what it was?
2244.72 2259.92 speaker3  Like he clocked that guy in the back of the head in my pre-story. Yeah, like I don't think he's immune to violence.
2257.76 2282.64 speaker2  He whacked him so good, dude. He said he's in his boxers on the floor. Whacked him so good that he's down for five hours. Western style. I don't know. If it's a big crusty cum stain on the wall, he could handle it. This is blood.
2281.44 2318.08 speaker3  He didn't whack him. Whack him. He whacked him. And at this time you hear Kevin go, and a punch. And then he just gets up and walks over. He has.
2313.44 2363.12 speaker2  She's like, all right, let's go investigate this graffiti. Yeah. It's not that you're speaking quietly. It's just that I fully had to parse it for a second in my language center. you would be able to see this vandalism.
2362.08 2368.88 speaker3  Probably blood graffiti.
2368.40 2390.00 speaker2  Oh yeah. It's as Agent Sparrow, like, shakily walks up to the wall and does a medicine roll to examine it. Yeah. 69. Nice. Whoa. Okay.
2389.20 2402.32 speaker1  69. Hmm. I know the blood type. I was trying to think of a way that I could tell you who's blood it is.
2400.72 2409.36 speaker3  They wrote the name above here. Right.
2407.92 2419.84 speaker2  Is there any cool meaning I might be... Like, I was trying to see if it was blood, but do I grasp maybe the significance of this picture? Yeah.
2415.04 2427.84 speaker1  With the 69, I will tell you that that is an occult symbol.
2425.36 2523.76 speaker2  Is that, like, even something I might have heard of before? you know, people might be talking about Aklo, These are the kind of people who talk about Testament of the New Flesh. Yeah, yeah. but he died on my first mission with this organization, but he spoke of things like this. He was interested in this group, he called it the Testament of New Flesh, and this is one of, it was crude, he didn't have a good drawing of it, but he showed me this symbol. Unknown number. It's 2016. It's 2016. I already don't want to answer phone calls that I get when I don't know the number at this point in time, but this is my work phone, so I do. Yeah, hello.
2520.16 2546.64 speaker1  Agent, Agent, Agent, uh, Sparrow, right? DeShane, yes, I, I am so scared. I just got, I got a voicemail, I got a voicemail from Chilton. It says I'm next, he's gonna kill me.
2543.36 2567.76 speaker2  Elwood, you call 911, you tell them to get RAT to his address, and then I directly call the detective. He says it's from Chilton. He says Chilton threatened him next. We gotta get there immediately, and I think we need all the help we can get.
2564.24 2575.84 speaker3  I worry that we should keep this in-house for the time being. What if he shows up and does our kind of thing?
2574.64 2586.40 speaker2  We could save this man's life.
2580.56 2590.56 speaker3  We're supposed to keep the unnatural threat from civilian eyes.
2587.92 2608.00 speaker2  Well, she's gonna try to persuade you. We know this unnatural threat is after his civilian eyes. They dig out the eyeballs. You can give me a big disadvantage on that. That's not a good argument, but it's a funny argument.
2606.08 2621.84 speaker3  How do you combat a persuade?
2621.04 2648.00 speaker2  Who failed higher? Mine's an eighty-two. That'll do it. So you're not convinced, but you're... Play ball. and she can just see you don't buy it. and you don't buy that either, but you can tell that she's gonna go try to save him.
2647.52 2653.28 speaker3  Yeah.
2649.52 2661.04 speaker2  I was gonna call the detective, but I was hoping you could call actual dispatch and just start the process of getting, you know, cop cars. Sure. While I'm gonna specifically call some of these, like, people.
2660.80 2679.52 speaker3  Yeah. Yeah. He says, hey, it's Agent Boyd, and we have reason to believe that the landlord Duchesne life is in jeopardy or something like that. Absolutely.
2677.12 2697.68 speaker1  she can talk to Garza as well either way. I don't talk to Garza. Quinlan will tell you that when you tell her what happened, she says, let me check the phone records.
2692.40 2722.24 speaker2  And yeah, they got a ping that Arvin Chilton's phone called Alexander Duchesne's phone. Cool. Detective Quinlan, I need you to gather anyone you have here with you from Newark, any of your associates. We haven't met Gambeson yet. Please get them involved. but he'll be back later. Ping it? Yeah.
2720.80 2750.64 speaker3  Put it in a triangle. You said put it in a triangle. Have they been able to triangulate the signal? Like on Netflix.
2750.16 2762.32 speaker1  What? Our jaguar.
2758.08 2765.28 speaker2  Solve Delta Green and kill scary monsters.
2762.32 2766.64 speaker1  And get there in the back of our jaguar.
2766.32 2787.44 speaker2  Cool. Dragula? I think you would know. You don't know that song? I like it. Wow. We'll play it for you later. Okay.
2785.76 2790.48 speaker3  They're all dancing in a club to that song. Oh, for real? Really?
2788.64 2803.52 speaker2  I haven't seen the matrix in a long ass time. Yep. That's such a, that's so bizarre. That's kind of what it is. Like the late nineties.
2800.80 2805.44 speaker3  It's like industrial enough that that song can hit the masses.
2803.52 2811.28 speaker2  Oh, it's where he goes down the rabbit hole. Yeah. Follows the white rat. Yeah, he follows the rabbit. Gotcha.
2810.56 2827.12 speaker1  That's right.
2821.84 2843.20 speaker2  You see that the door is open and there are a couple officers already speaking to Mr. Duchesne who waves his hands at the three of you when he sees you arrive. Kevin waves back at him in Kevin's mind. He's like trying to put on the FBI character and he gets out of the car and goes up.
2841.36 2900.08 speaker1  Oh, you're a big fella, aren't you? Hey. Uh-huh. Big guy in the FBI. But when you turn back and look, one of them's on the other one's shoulders and they're like, where'd that guy? Wow.
2899.44 2942.16 speaker2  These Kev. All right. And so you guys go... Who never did a thing wrong in his life. Diligent public employees like Keith Vigna. I need to speak with Mr. Duchenne alone for a moment, but can you brief me on what you found here in the time you've been on the scene? He leans in real close.
2940.56 2948.16 speaker1  spells really bad. Like this apartment spells horrible and so does he.
2945.28 3015.12 speaker2  Did you determine anything about the nature of the threat? Oh, I listened to the voicemail. Do you want to hear it? Yes, please. We just established it. That is the voicemail. I would be alarmed too, Mr. Duchenne.
3013.92 3042.48 speaker1  That's his voice. Did you make him mad? But what did you... You gotta do something. I didn't.
3038.48 3049.22 speaker2  You said he was giving it to you one to two days before he disappeared? That's right. That would be a very short amount of time to expect a book back.
3048.72 3053.60 speaker1  Do you?
3050.56 3069.84 speaker2  As a criminal profiler, I have to tell you that what murderers consider worth murder is not what you and I would expect.
3068.24 3077.12 speaker1  I couldn't hear my phone.
3076.72 3089.12 speaker2  Okay. And basically she's just gonna relay that if you can coordinate with the local cops to give him round-the-clock protection for at least the next few days while we're in town.
3088.40 3093.52 speaker3  Well, you... Hey, big guy.
3092.16 3111.38 speaker1  Well, you stay with me. These guys, they got guns. They got whatever. They're cops, you know. They have guns, but you, you're a big guy. I think you could definitely protect me.
3110.88 3117.60 speaker2  Uh-huh.
3113.76 3122.00 speaker1  You could both stay upstairs or you could stay in here anywhere, please. I just feel so scared.
3120.72 3130.72 speaker2  It's getting later now.
3128.00 3132.88 speaker3  It'd be like staking out the place all night.
3131.60 3180.00 speaker2  She pulls you aside. She's like, yeah, that was, that was my thinking as well. And we've seen what whatever's out there can do to people. Now, let's let him get some sleep, the big fella. You take first watch. I'm going to start reading as you like it. We've still got the uniform police here. Why don't we encourage Kevin to take a little nap, sleep off those burgers. I've got his copy of as you like it. I've just sent you a link to a free digital open source copy of as you like it. Why don't you read along and we can see if we can.
3178.08 3188.16 speaker3  It's, it's a thrilling tale.
3183.36 3202.08 speaker2  If you read it again with me and I will be looking for maybe some overarching themes, but perhaps with your familiarity with the text, you could pick out some details that that might might've missed that might be relevant. He's here.
3201.68 3218.88 speaker1  He's here. I am with Duchenne.
3216.56 3226.88 speaker3  Did you call him back and ask him why?
3224.48 3238.80 speaker1  He's like, I called agent Sparrow.
3236.96 3268.10 speaker2  Yeah, that is a pretty good, yeah. Everybody quiet down. Mr. Duchenne, please, please redial that number. His finger shakes. Zach's rolling to see if his finger falls off.
3267.60 3280.08 speaker3  Yep. Second number. Oh, got it wrong.
3274.56 3290.64 speaker2  Until Zach rolls heads seven times in a row, he's going to be getting one number wrong. And we just got to sit here and play that out because sometimes that's what we're playing.
3289.92 3304.16 speaker3  Please.
3297.60 3324.80 speaker2  And agent Sparrow, Kevin Gelato, Elwood Boyd, as well as these two police officers
3324.24 3346.72 speaker3  Oh no.
3343.04 3368.32 speaker2  expressions on their face, but he matches their expression quickly.
3367.52 3456.88 speaker1  right. I can go there now that I've stared death in the face. I'll be all right. Doesn't it always seem like the villain pulling the strings is a regular guy. You and me have gone bad in a good way. I promise. Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish. I'll be all right. I can go there now that I've stared death in the face. I'll be all right. I can go there now that I've stared death in the face. I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
