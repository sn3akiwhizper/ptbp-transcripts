198.66 260.46 speaker1  peanuts and jelly. I think we nailed it. Question mark? All right, welcome to pretending to be people. I feel bad now. We've got Thomas here as well. Hi. And things are a bit off the rails here, part of this show, so we're going to see what happens. It's been nearly six months since we've recorded an actual session of us playing.
259.46 281.22 speaker2  27? 27, 28 was the Q&A. Gotcha, yeah. We're getting back in the swing of things. This is the first time you'll hear an episode that we recorded recently. Yeah, so hopefully our- It's all the Red Dead Redemption talk in the last episode.
277.46 287.34 speaker1  Yeah, hopefully our references are more up to date from here on out.
285.92 289.94 speaker2  It's made our knees weak. Yeah.
288.34 361.66 speaker1  Justin, has it made your knees weak? No but. I think we're at a pretty intense situation right now, so let's dive into it. John Lee Pettymore IV. This massive room reeks of blood and piss and other bodily fluids. The pervasive music as well as the thunderous jeering and overall debaucherous crowd noises have died off, leaving only silence in this cavernous chamber. Looking down, you see the limp, lifeless body of Keith Vigna. His jaw is broken off and hanging loosely below a shattered cheekbone that has allowed one of his eyes to dangle gently off the side of his expressionless face, almost reaching the blood-soaked concrete floor.
354.78 377.74 speaker2  says, Keith, I know we had our differences, but you didn't deserve to have your jaw ripped off in your eye, took out, no matter what you did to my smokies.
372.02 401.80 speaker1  Across the room, you see an inert Clark Bishop slumped halfway out of his broken metal cage. One of the bars seems to have snapped off into Clark's sternum, and it's a real chest-specific Phineas Gage situation, what with the bar going in one side and clear out the other. The bar is kind of propping up Clark's corpse, which is staring across the room at you, cold and unblinking.
399.76 412.50 speaker2  I'm sorry, friend.
406.32 429.32 speaker1  on the same wall as the bar, but you see the last two bloodthirsty patrons trying to stealthily exit the room by creeping together along the wall.
427.00 444.32 speaker0  like the penguin suit kind of thing going on. Absolutely. And what did you say, like an ascot? Is that like the necktie thing? Ascot seems good, yeah. Yeah, like an ascot and a really ill-fitting suit that's like, everything's just a little too tight. It looks very uncomfortable.
441.84 452.36 speaker2  Does it fit poorly or does it fit ill? Both. Oh, that's an ill-fitting suit, dude.
451.36 467.14 speaker0  Bro.
459.84 506.16 speaker1  And next to that guy is a man dressed very, very similarly who looks very similar, but the colors that he's wearing are inverted of yours. That's the way to do it. That's how twins do it. That's how twins do it. And we both have blood just pouring down our mouths onto our cheeks. Delicious. We're like looking at it as we're like sliding around the wall, like trying to get away, trying to just sneak past this one standing person.
505.16 523.80 speaker0  Oh my.
522.12 525.94 speaker1  We're just trying to leave.
524.80 546.52 speaker2  What the hell is going on here? Now, one good cop and one other man is dead. And I want some fucking answers. Why are we here? Why were you drinking our blood?
542.46 549.56 speaker0  Oh, how could you not be partaking in this delicious juice?
548.56 560.08 speaker1  Come right down. There's plenty on the floor for all.
558.70 572.68 speaker2  I want answers. You best start talking immediately.
571.68 596.72 speaker0  Why wouldn't you? It's delightful life-giving powers.
588.08 618.60 speaker2  Now listen, John Lee Pettymore is a sexually awake creature and he understands that the spectrum of human pleasure is broad. But the second it becomes a problem is when you, without consent, start drinking, minding my partner's blood. It seemed like you were a willing participant.
617.60 622.76 speaker0  Now who's kink-shaming?
620.52 628.24 speaker1  Yes, we would quite enjoy it.
626.24 638.32 speaker2  I don't think I could pee. Yeah.
634.32 676.86 speaker1  How are you so blissfully unaware of everything that's happening here in the city? Oh, he's not from here. He's not from here. Rich. our names are. All right, what are your names?
674.82 682.70 speaker2  My name is none of your goddamn business.
681.70 719.22 speaker0  Contention. That's a- Well, we don't hear stories of contention. What have you heard? Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
718.22 723.06 speaker1  We didn't know.
720.22 730.34 speaker2  Well, okay, so I've- I mean, like, I found the drugs, right? I just found them sitting there, so I sold them. That's Finders Keepers. I don't know why he can be so mad about that.
729.34 733.42 speaker1  Are they his drugs?
732.42 748.34 speaker2  I don't follow. Also, it's drugs, man.
741.06 757.54 speaker0  I'm very curious about this Finders Keepers rule you bring up.
755.76 759.54 speaker1  If you keep it, it's yours.
758.54 765.26 speaker2  I sold it. That's why Marvin's so mad. Keith, my dead friend, see the eyeball dude over there?
763.70 769.26 speaker1  Oh, it's delectable. Oh my.
768.26 773.26 speaker2  Okay, I conk him. Can we go now, please?
772.26 786.86 speaker1  No.
778.58 793.94 speaker2  Okay, I see- I can see you like that, so- listen, what the- what do you two do in the city? Oh, we're security advisors. In fact-
792.94 814.54 speaker1  The best of the best. So much that the greatest man in the city, Marvin Glass, hired us to create the security for this entire denizen.
809.82 818.50 speaker2  and the prisoners, me, have escaped, it doesn't seem like you are the best of the best. Also, you're being held at gunpoint right now.
817.10 821.74 speaker1  Yeah, that's a fair point. That's a good point. He makes a good point.
820.54 843.06 speaker2  How secure is this place? Please? Listen.
837.02 876.26 speaker0  And we may love watching death, but we are, how do you say, not into dying. But I do wish so.
871.46 885.82 speaker2  You're dressed like millionaires with a bunch of other rich people literally lapping up And you're telling me you don't have money?
883.10 893.42 speaker1  It's tied up, it's not liquid.
891.06 905.42 speaker2  I might understand more than you think. Interesting.
902.78 912.10 speaker1  pay us lots of money? No. Hmmmm.
911.10 913.90 speaker2  I propose-
912.10 917.34 speaker0  I think we know exactly what's going on here.
916.34 919.34 speaker2  To not kill you.
918.34 928.90 speaker1  Oh. No, go ahead. I don't care. Do you want to get out of here alive? We have the ability to make that happen.
923.86 969.50 speaker2  It's not a strong negotiating tactic to give up what you want, so I think I don't care Okay. I'm gonna shoot you in the knee now. And then I shoot you in the knee.
964.82 976.10 speaker1  But we still can help you out of here if you're willing to part with some of your apparent money.
972.82 979.50 speaker2  I'd help you guys not die though, if you pay me. That's pretty much my offer. Okay, sounds good.
978.10 998.14 speaker1  We'll give it to you later. Gentlemen's cake.
994.98 1020.84 speaker2  Now we've sworn the old-fashioned way.
1016.50 1062.52 speaker1  wearing an old tattered robe with a hood that covers his face. As it reaches its hands into the light, the hood is drawn back, and this old man rips an unnaturally bright light out of his familiar face. A much older Clark Bishop takes his beaming hands and reaches deep into the chest of the Clark Bishop you've known before yanking out the bar and throwing his younger self's body
1059.08 1087.44 speaker0  over his shoulder.
1086.44 1117.92 speaker1  Whoo! You are going down.
1115.20 1153.20 speaker2  man can just both sneak out of here. That they did. Dog shit at your jobs, guys. The security here is non-existent. What you been hearing about Contention?
1146.48 1176.88 speaker1  He was a, god, he was such a lush, he came in, he was trying to get into the VIP section here one night. I mean, he was like balding and round and I believe, Kevin, what was his name? I can't remember. Anyway, he said that he worked for the government.
1174.80 1187.60 speaker0  That is always my dear brother.
1181.96 1209.00 speaker1  And he starts talking about how he's been in a coma, whoop-de-doo for him. And we were like, why does that mean that you should be in the VIP section? And he said that he was having visions while he was in this coma.
1208.00 1222.36 speaker2  Completely agreed.
1221.36 1228.00 speaker0  It's so absurd.
1226.84 1233.44 speaker1  he kept saying? Agent Victor, I believe? Victor, I think it was.
1231.88 1243.24 speaker0  It was so odd.
1237.92 1248.28 speaker1  the mind probing device that apparently ISIS is using now to give people vision. So he said, claimed he was now like in the know. Hold on.
1247.28 1249.28 speaker2  ISIS?
1248.28 1264.36 speaker1  Yeah, ISIS. Sure. Whatever. I'm not much for current events. ISIS has mind control technology. Isn't that the worst news you've heard today? I just don't believe it. I don't know.
1261.96 1267.88 speaker2  I understand why you didn't let John Peters in your place.
1266.88 1270.36 speaker1  Yeah. Everyone from contention is.
1269.36 1290.40 speaker2  Okay.
1286.96 1327.96 speaker1  That's a conkin. That's a conkin. That's a conkin. Otherwise I, the security will be here any moment and we need to go through these double doors. It's the only way out.
1324.92 1346.28 speaker2  So you can get me past the security here. Uh, let's, let's get moving, but I want to find some place, some things out about this place first.
1340.40 1364.64 speaker1  The floor, ceiling and walls are made out of black marble, making depth perception difficult. Your eyes take a second to adjust and you see at the end of the hallway is an elevator door. There are also two doors about 10 yards away from you, one on each side of the hallway above the elevator is a dial that is slowly moving from the left to the right side.
1363.64 1367.64 speaker2  Oh my. Oh God.
1366.64 1402.70 speaker1  It's coming down here. It's coming down here. Someone's on their way. This can't be good, brother. Okay. Okay. Let's um, you're, you're Richard, right? I'm Richard. And you're Dick. Yes.
1398.90 1423.82 speaker2  And uh, unfortunately I shot him in the knee to prove a point, but that just slowed him down. Uh, so that's why I had to shoot him just now. If you'd like to take a moment and lap up his blood before you run through one of these
1421.94 1425.82 speaker0  I start lapping that bad boy up.
1424.82 1427.82 speaker2  Okay. All right.
1426.82 1430.74 speaker0  That's while sobbing uncontrollably. That's enough.
1429.74 1442.26 speaker1  Go. We got to go. All right.
1441.26 1443.26 speaker2  Dick.
1442.26 1446.26 speaker1  Are you ready? Like a blood fountain?
1445.26 1447.26 speaker2  Yeah.
1446.26 1451.42 speaker1  Like a blood Capri Sun.
1450.42 1463.94 speaker0  Exactly.
1459.94 1472.78 speaker2  So I'm going to take the price down to 2.5 fair is fair and uh, let's get the fuck out of here.
1467.82 1482.98 speaker0  I'm still holding like the blood up to like the little spurt up to my mouth a little bit.
1481.62 1486.98 speaker1  Do you go left or right? Left. All right.
1485.98 1493.50 speaker0  Sorry. I'm not super familiar with the map, but I'd say left is probably good.
1492.50 1509.34 speaker2  God damn it. Let's go.
1508.34 1544.46 speaker1  here. I don't remember properly. You walk into a small empty foyer that leads to four more doors and the door closes behind you. You've got one door on your left, two ahead of you, and one on your right. They are labeled Kevin, Francis, Charles, Rosemary.
1543.06 1554.38 speaker2  I can help with that.
1550.62 1563.58 speaker0  to do this door, but I'm doing this in his honor.
1556.72 1574.58 speaker1  This room contains three things, a bed, a popcorn machine, and a television screen the size of an entire wall that is currently playing an episode of Happy Days. That figures.
1572.10 1579.34 speaker2  I'll take a moment to reflect on that.
1577.98 1587.14 speaker0  I don't think so.
1585.50 1600.58 speaker2  Make them fight for bloodsport. Yes. All right. These guys seem to be really into blood. Could I drink some blood for willpower?
1596.54 1605.86 speaker1  They really are talking up it's healing powers.
1602.38 1626.86 speaker2  Well, we left the source in the hallway with a guard. Oh, yeah. I know you were going to like it, Rich. I know.
1620.18 1630.86 speaker1  And as he's wiggling, he moves the pillow on the bed and under it, there's a picture.
1629.86 1633.86 speaker2  Yeah. Is it Marvin Glass's boy? It is.
1632.86 1635.86 speaker1  Mm-hmm. It absolutely is.
1634.86 1643.50 speaker2  Yeah.
1636.86 1664.90 speaker1  Rosemary has a picture of a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt and black tactical pants. He has tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down his hands and fingertips. This guy seems cool. There's a sharpied heart around this man's face, which is stoic, almost blank. And she has written Rosemary Glass all over it.
1662.90 1694.48 speaker2  Rosemary. Yeah. If we all get out of this, I do hope you find the love you seek someday, Rosemary. I'm going to give you 10 luck for calling that. Oh, thank you. That puts me to 55. Congratulations. And we talked about how we haven't recorded since September. I've been thinking about that for the next ... I'm like, oh shit, I think I know why she sent us for the gun.
1693.48 1703.44 speaker1  Thank you. Thank you, Fonz. Exactly.
1698.76 1707.68 speaker2  Rich, have you watched Barry on HBO with Henry Winkler?
1706.68 1712.92 speaker0  It's excellent.
1708.68 1740.56 speaker2  He does a great job as Gene Cusinow, the head of the acting theater. John Lee Pettymore IV endorses Barry on HBO. Go check it out. Always behind. Always. All right. I want to go into Kevin's room now. Did y'all hire Kevin? Do you know much about Kevin?
1737.72 1751.08 speaker1  He's always been Marvin Glass's number two security. Yeah. He's like his right-hand man basically.
1748.48 1763.84 speaker0  Oh, I've known Kevin for quite a while. He was always Marvin's number two.
1762.84 1792.36 speaker2  in any way? Or, well, I guess it was Keith's brother who might have raised all those mutant children. Anyway, did you make Rosemary immortal? Or do you know that she might be? I can't say we had any part in that.
1791.12 1807.64 speaker1  of minimalism. There is a full-sized bed neatly made in the corner. There's a chest of drawers against the wall. And the only other thing in the room is a desk with a chair. You're just stumbling around.
1806.64 1813.88 speaker2  What's in here? You've got blood. It's just smearing.
1809.88 1828.72 speaker1  Also, you're still in your underwear from the fighting that took place. You got your underwear in the cages. You're welcome, listeners. And then you were in the cage with Keith, and then you fell out, and you've been fighting, and there's blood everywhere.
1825.64 1830.80 speaker2  I've got the goo of the guy that I landed on probably.
1829.80 1881.08 speaker1  You've got toenails. Yeah. So you're slip-sliding around all over this place, and when you check the desk, you grab onto it, and you do notice that there is a different texture underneath the desk than there is on top of it. I'd like to feel around under the desk. desk. And as you get under it, you see that the phrase, not Kevin, has been carved into the bottom of the desk over and over and over and on top of itself repeatedly.
1878.72 1883.08 speaker2  You sure that's what it says? Check again.
1882.08 1899.00 speaker0  I'm looking at it. It's very unsettling.
1897.76 1931.64 speaker2  I'd like to pop under the bed. Rich, look under the bed. As you wish. Well, I'm just leaning against the wall. Bending hurts right now, so. That makes sense. Oh, yeah. I slides it.
1928.60 1948.78 speaker1  She just says, I'm so sorry. He's just so beautiful. You don't have to do this. We can leave. On every page of the notepad.
1947.78 1984.54 speaker2  that. John Lee Peddingmore. Okay, where did he hear that? It was in your dream. Oh, right. And I recognized him. Okay. So John Lee Peddingmore recognizes the words on the page from his dream, and a chill runs down his spine. Just a sickening recognition, but it shouldn't be there.
1978.64 1996.70 speaker1  And he sees that there's carving underneath this drawer as well. Rich, what's it say? It says, Mary in the woods, over and over and over. Mary in the woods.
1994.50 1997.70 speaker2  Kevin's a real focused guy, you know?
1996.70 2004.98 speaker1  Yeah, he seems to write.
2003.98 2006.98 speaker0  It's interesting.
2005.98 2021.38 speaker2  You know, it's a choice. I wouldn't make it, but you gotta, you know, you gotta explore your own artistic avenues.
2019.94 2039.10 speaker1  and over again. Mary in the woods. To the point to where, like, the wood is thin.
2034.68 2065.94 speaker0  know about him.
2064.02 2078.78 speaker2  As you wish, sir. Let's go into Charles' room. As you wish, sir.
2073.82 2144.46 speaker1  Everything is beautiful, but it smells like someone spilled a vat of Everclear in here. There is a well-stocked bar, and the closet is full of different uniforms and disguises. There is a computer, and there are a shitload of tabs open. They are all about the town of contention, different businesses, and maps to Hotel Motel, John Peters' house, and the Piston Pig Farm. So there's actually nothing in his inbox, but there is one email still in the drafts folder. The email details that Rosemary and I, Charles, found the gun that turned Alfred mad in the possession of a young girl. A chase ensued, and she got away. they should try to collect them all. Interesting.
2141.98 2158.14 speaker2  No wonder she didn't trust us. Plus, fuck the police.
2157.14 2173.64 speaker3  Richie. Wouldn't you like to know?
2169.14 2198.86 speaker1  Clothes have been tossed onto every surface, the bed, the floor, the armoire, everywhere. The walls are made out of whiteboard that is filled with equations. There's a single drawing of a sphere, one inch in diameter. This person seems smart.
2197.86 2218.66 speaker2  Okay. I mean, I didn't typically apply myself in school, but I did have a head for figures, and I was an AP Calculus. This is... Last name. Really inspired me. You know, I was a pretty rough... You know what? You don't care about this, but...
2216.66 2228.66 speaker0  I'm always interested to hear a good story.
2225.50 2251.08 speaker2  Yeah, that's unfortunately why Mrs. Lastname got fired. All right, I'm rolling... Oh, an intelligence roll to see if I can figure out... Add a negative 20.
2249.74 2268.06 speaker1  world. She is coming up with solutions that do not make sense with the math that you know to be absolutely true. Go ahead and roll sanity for me. Three. I passed.
2267.06 2276.62 speaker2  I don't know. So this makes sense to you.
2272.50 2287.38 speaker1  everything that you've seen in this world that the math that you grew up with is not the math that actually exists in this reality. Richard, this... Hold on.
2286.38 2292.24 speaker3  Okay. Five.
2289.54 2295.50 speaker2  These dice are all over the place.
2294.50 2328.26 speaker1  So when you... Looking through the room, you start moving some of the clothes out of the way, and underneath a shirt or something, there's a picture. There's a picture of Frances with a man and a woman who are older than her. It looks like a family picture, like it's her parents, and her father, the Duke, has his eyes crossed out with X's from a Sharpie. Teen angst. We have.
2325.52 2331.86 speaker2  Really turned me around.
2330.86 2332.86 speaker3  Yeah.
2331.86 2345.90 speaker2  Uh-huh. to me.
2343.18 2382.54 speaker1  You've now gone into all four rooms in this quadrant. The only door is back into the hallway. All right, Richard. Follow me. Peek your head out there. them, and each of them are wearing full brown jumpsuits, and they have a large scythe strapped to their backs, and the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fishhook.
2380.70 2393.34 speaker0  You might want to take a look at this, friend. I peek my head out.
2387.46 2400.30 speaker1  is the body of Keith Vigna, and they walk into the elevator, and the elevator door closes behind them.
2398.70 2405.34 speaker0  Hmm.
2402.54 2421.06 speaker2  Could I just think about a person I want to see in this building? Mayhaps. Where would she be? Where's, like, security control?
2420.06 2431.22 speaker0  Let's go.
2426.38 2462.14 speaker1  of you guys running across the hall to the other door that looks the exact same, using Sure. Yeah. and inside this door, you walk into a small, empty foyer that leads to two doors, one on Oh, good.
2460.78 2465.70 speaker2  I think labels are generally harmful.
2464.70 2470.98 speaker1  You guys have so much in common. Alright, let's not.
2469.74 2477.14 speaker0  Rich, no. You could fill in a little bit here for...
2476.14 2484.94 speaker1  Oh, yeah, sorry. When you guys walked out into the hallway, they saw you, and... No, Richard...
2482.94 2507.58 speaker3  And they killed both of you.
2502.94 2576.04 speaker1  Each wall is made entirely of deep, tall file cabinets. Above you is only fluorescent lighting. On the far end of the room is a table. It looks like a desk but is four feet off the ground and has no accompanying chair. There is a file open on the standing desk or super wide podium or whatever. I go to read it. It's a file that says John Lee Pettymore the Fourth on it. It shows you as a cocaine supplier, number one, and a contention police officer, number two. There's a lot of stuff about the Pettymore family. Different troubles that cousins and uncles and aunts have all gotten into. And then there's a manila envelope. When you open the manila envelope, it's adoption papers. From Cole's Orphanage, New School Under Modern Etiquette, and the name of the adopted child
2575.04 2598.66 speaker2  How old was Kevin?
2592.14 2660.04 speaker1  Three members of an unknown organization who go by Kyle, Karen, and Kevin. Kyle is listed as unknown. There's a blurry picture attached of a man. The picture is from a security camera. Karen is listed as Anne Love. There is a mug shot of a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes. Kevin is listed as unknown. There is a picture attached. He's missing the surgical scars and is so much younger and happier than Kevin, the man you saw earlier, who is now only a hollow shell of the man in this picture, the man you immediately recognize as your father, John Lee Pettymore the Third.
2658.16 2716.88 speaker3  you ain't dead.
2707.72 2725.04 speaker1  either of you are willing to give up any information on your associate who stole my property, I
2723.24 2730.72 speaker0  You and your kind can eat my ass.
2728.84 2766.44 speaker3  Kyle, I swear I'm not doing this. What are you?
2760.44 2804.00 speaker2  I guess this mystery is a lot older than December 3rd. What is this? Yeah. Sorry, man. who I thought had died and abandoned me. He's alive. Did you know anything?
2799.52 2807.96 speaker0  No, I can't say I was around whenever this was.
2806.96 2808.96 speaker2  It's not.
2807.96 2815.92 speaker1  It's all over the place. Do you want to go ahead and roll a search for me, though? Yeah. I've got one thing for you if you roll.
2813.32 2821.80 speaker2  Sorry, it's a zero and a two. Fuck yeah.
2817.16 2882.76 speaker1  You quickly just rifling through trying to find anything interesting. There's a bunch of files that are itemized by like number and letter coding, stuff that doesn't make any sense, but there's one that's just called Satan. I'd like to read this file called Satan. It's just a picture and it's of a woman with shoulder length curly hair and a mouth that not only takes up half of her face, but it's showing an amount of unbridled pleasure you The same age as Taylor Swift.
2880.84 2885.76 speaker2  Fuck, I just missed it. No, no, I passed.
2884.76 2897.36 speaker1  Yeah, you passed. You hear the elevator door ding.
2896.36 2913.20 speaker2  me.
2906.04 2956.40 speaker1  in open, and then you hear someone right on the other side of the door of this room that you are now in, and the door opens, and Kevin is standing there, dressed in all black, average build, six feet tall, light brown hair, mustache with a dead stare and scars on his forehead and neck. The scars look medical in nature, and he is all gussied up with an assault rifle, a shotgun, a pistol. He's wearing body armor. Body armor that you recognize. with you.
2952.68 2985.84 speaker2  Nature versus nursery right there, you know what I'm saying? Woo! I just motion to Rich, don't make a fucking move, and I'm just hoping he's just firing blindly. I don't want to make a move right now.
2981.28 3011.64 speaker1  He loads in another clip, and he starts firing again. Woo! And as he's firing, you start feeling this podium chip away. A few bullets actually whiz through near your heads right in between the two of you. Okay.
3007.44 3044.24 speaker2  I'm going to kick Richard out into the open. And I'm not saying anything, I'm just hoping maybe he just recognizes one of the guests and will...
3040.16 3071.08 speaker1  It's shredded through with lead flying all the way through it. I would say roughly 18 shots go through the body of Rich Nichols, and he is flopping about on the ground. He shits his pants, he starts throwing up everywhere and gurgling blood.
3068.24 3083.14 speaker3  Earn this.
3080.24 3094.96 speaker2  and take some shots with the noisy cricket. Roll firearms. 25.
3093.20 3107.68 speaker1  Roll 2d10 for damage. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck indeed, that's a noisy cricket, my dude. Add up the numbers?
3106.68 3116.28 speaker2  A zero is a 10. Oh, yeah, that's a one. Right. That's what I'm...
3115.28 3177.50 speaker1  Yeah. All right. Or a 71. rips away and underneath it you see some sort of, it's not bone, it's some sort of shiny material underneath his shoulder and he stands firm and begins firing at you as you are firing at him. 11 points of damage. I need you to roll a constitution check to stay conscious.
3176.50 3178.50 speaker2  Yes.
3177.50 3229.26 speaker1  Okay, so I fail. Kevin turns a sort of sickly black for you. The camera pans out and sees Kevin walk over to the body of John Lee Pettymore. There is no remembering in his eyes and he fires his assault rifle into your chest for a full clip and the body of John Lee Pettymore is just gyrating on the ground. The blood is spattering everywhere and Kevin is standing above you with a cold, dead face with no remorse and no understanding of what he was doing.
3227.60 3241.80 speaker2  You said you're going to spend the luck. Yeah.
3238.04 3299.62 speaker1  You actually feel something very specific. You're moving like go-gurt busting out of a plastic tube by pressure alone. You feel yourself squeezed out of a dark constricting space onto the cold, hard floor and rolling. Then your limbs extend from your form and slam into the file cabinet walls on either side of you. It gives you the leverage you need to fling your silver, round frame at your target. As you land, one of your appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of your dad's neck. Another snaps his head forward and you feel the fracture as a third reaches in, gripping the top of the spine where it meets the head, or the C1 vertebrae, and you rip the entire spinal cord out of his body in one swift motion, promptly forcing yourself into the Don't stop a dying love Don't stop a dying love
