0.00 179.06 speaker0  Greetings my sheeple, it's your shepherd, wolf the dog, and I'm here to shear all your wooly little coats so y'all can be a little more comfortable today. And when I say shear your coats, I really mean give y'all some updates on what's really going down here in contention from 694.2 PTBP my babies. This week on Howlin' with Wolf, your best buddy wolf is gonna read one of those fine 5 star reviews from iTunes because it makes wolf feel oh so nice and makes him feel like he's part of a community instead of just isolated in this basement studio here in dreary old contention. Emma Mara was kind enough to write a 5 star review titled Horror, Jokes, and Mystery! focus. Really fun for those of us that care more about the mystery than about the mechanics of dice rolls. This one has a mix of good humor and a pretty chilling story line. Last time the story was getting wild. It's the news y'all. know how they feel. Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like calls about missing persons, animals in the ponds and creeks, and a voicemail from the feds. Doug, Dr. Marie Jacobs' husband who is currently inhabiting the body of the cat Salem, showed the officers the animals are hiding in the water because the oily substance cannot get them in the ponds and creeks. car as well as about Cole's orphanage. a bunch of cleaning supplies and random materials and a small enclave behind an oil painting of a rose, a few loose tiles in the kitchen where something buried has been dragged out, the bottom. A heavy artillery weapon is being fired into the house from the front yard. This shit is intense y'all. You know what though?
174.72 221.46 speaker1  This is Kudzu with No Backbone.
215.38 261.22 speaker0  next to two corpses looking up at Keith and John who is lowering down one pant leg of Randy Angst's shit spoiled slacks. Just then, a brutally loud noise erupts from outside in the front yard and items in the house begin shattering. You are being fired on by some large artillery weapon. Your ears are shot and your vision clouds as dust billows about the room. The drywall is ripped to shreds, letting cold air and moonlight into the house. I need you to roll dodge in order to run or die for cover.
259.74 274.26 speaker1  What's going on up there? I don't pass. 39 out of 30. I do pass 42 out of 50. I don't remember putting points into dodge, but I'm really happy I did. Okay.
271.18 280.46 speaker0  Success is going to gain you one D6 of cover. So what are you hiding behind after you roll? We'll find out.
279.46 297.86 speaker1  I got a five. I'm on my way to get those shit pants, so I tumble into the bathroom and take Randy Anx with me into the tub. Awesome. Fucking baller, dog. Pantsless Randy. Pantsless Randy.
292.62 315.26 speaker0  These extremely large rounds are still going to fly through the house, so I need you both to roll luck to see if you get hit. All right. I need...
314.26 342.98 speaker1  I need all of you to roll. Take that out. Just a zero one. Including you for the fire.
340.98 346.98 speaker0  13 on a 29.
345.98 347.98 speaker1  Oh, no.
346.98 354.54 speaker0  50 on a 29. So I still don't pass. John, you just lose one. The other boys don't lose any.
351.98 399.70 speaker1  Keith, you're going to be the only one who can see this. I would tell them anyway. The front door of the house flies back into the foyer like a playing card being thrown. A staggering figure walks slowly through the doorway. He is a looming, overweight man wearing an all-black combat uniform, and he has a large scar over his right eye. He holds up his left hand and you see his arm is cut off at his wrist, but there is a wire attached to the nub. You hear a zzzzip as the wire begins retracting into his arm and you see the front door whip back into his possession. He holds it up like a shield as he faces you. Roll Sanity.
397.14 406.82 speaker0  We just got into Resident Evil.
402.62 417.82 speaker1  Okay, Keith, you just let out a shriek as you lose one sanity. That was really good.
413.66 421.70 speaker0  If only we had equipped ourselves with all these weapons and body armor.
417.82 462.86 speaker1  I was just supposed to say, did we officially put them in the car? We did nothing with them. And I'm like very close to that table, right? Tell me when it's my turn. Keith, it's your turn. What do you do? I forgot what we were doing. Like how far away is the table full of guns? It's a move action away. Let me ask you this. Can I pull my sidearm and shoot at him while I move to that table? Yes. In one move. You will take a negative 20 percent. On my firearms? Yes. I guess I already rolled, so it's too late for me to do like a called shot. Yeah.
461.86 464.86 speaker0  Okay.
463.86 487.74 speaker1  Then I just shoot at him. You move toward the flipped over coffee table full of guns and body armor and such as you fire at this giant man. Quick question. I don't know if we said we should put that on or if I said I... Should. Okay. Holy shit. No, it's a... It's a one. Fuck.
486.74 490.74 speaker0  God damn it. Oh, wait.
489.74 506.06 speaker1  Yeah. Yeah. It was a one. Okay. Am I running away or towards him? You're running away from him toward the table.
505.06 508.06 speaker0  Okay.
507.06 538.38 speaker1  So it's not in between us. No. Okay. As you're running toward the coffee table, you are firing at him and you clip his arms and you hear one ricochet off, but you hear another one go in, but it's not a through and through and you just hear this like, okay. So it's like the bullet is lodged into one of his arms. Yeah. As I'm running and shooting in between... How many shots do I fire? Three. In between shots, I'm screaming mainly at John, but also to Clark.
536.78 540.38 speaker0  Hey guys, we got company.
539.38 568.26 speaker1  John, what do you do? I say, Randy, you stay right here. Are there two stories or one story in this house? One. Okay. How close is the bathroom to the back door? Halfway. I just remembered that the sniper rifle was in the bathroom with me.
566.34 569.26 speaker0  Oh yes, of course.
568.26 612.34 speaker1  Really? Did you just stay here? Okay. You stay put, buddy. Contention PDs on this. And I bust out the door with my pistol in one hand and like sniper rifle at my hip. The foyer is the room this is all happening in? The foyer is the room where this man is, yeah. Can I see him? Okay. He's on the other side of the hole in the ground where Clark resides. So I take some cover behind the bathroom door, temporarily holster my pistol, and I'm going to take a sniper rifle shot. Like I'm going to line it up and try to plunk this guy in the head. I don't know if that's a called shot, but I want to use the best ... I'm just going to shoot him with a sniper rifle. Okay.
611.34 628.68 speaker0  Sounds good. Yeah. 98 on a 60. 98 on a 60.
627.18 640.46 speaker1  Clark, it's your turn. How deep is this hole that I'm in? 12 feet. How deep is this hole that I'm in? How tall are you?
638.66 644.46 speaker0  Am I in an enclosed space?
643.46 657.30 speaker1  By? Five. So it's- No. Five by five by 12. Yeah. He's just standing there, his head's broken up. Totally exposed.
656.30 659.30 speaker2  Guys. Guys, help me.
658.30 676.02 speaker1  He's like standing- The giant guy just kicks Clark's head off. Clark is becoming one of us.
675.02 677.02 speaker2  Police work.
676.02 743.02 speaker1  I got nothing. Police work never sleeps. Rifling through the pockets of these corpses, you find- You find a piece of paper that has a circle on it, a filled in circle, and that circle is surrounded by six circles. I remember that. I remember that too. And it's hand drawn. forward and looks down into the pit at Clark Bishop. And he holds out his other hand and he aims it at you. I need you to roll dodge. Is his other hand a wire thing too?
741.22 758.82 speaker0  97 on a 50. He does.
750.84 780.86 speaker1  damage as his hand reaches completely into your shoulder and grips. where your collarbone is and then gripped into your skin and his fingers are inside
778.90 802.86 speaker0  His hand is still attached to his arm though?
800.58 807.86 speaker2  25 on a 70. You're 70 unarmed combat? Mm-hmm.
805.86 822.94 speaker1  He's 72 though, right? And you're rolling against him?
821.54 825.50 speaker2  Ripping his earphones out.
824.50 849.82 speaker1  No! Where did it go? Daddy would you like some sausage? Daddy would you like some sausages? The fist is locked into place and it is actually his turn again. How? He's got crazy decks or something.
848.82 850.82 speaker2  No, it's not.
849.82 860.62 speaker1  It's Keith's turn. That's what I fucking thought.
859.62 868.26 speaker2  Okay.
867.02 878.58 speaker1  Actually here's what I want to do. I want to grab.
877.26 880.58 speaker2  Yeah, you can definitely do that.
879.58 882.58 speaker1  Nothing.
881.58 886.02 speaker2  Okay. Wait, so what are my gun options here? Assault rifles.
884.70 888.50 speaker1  I don't know anything about guns.
887.02 900.62 speaker2  Grab the bulletproof vest, throw it on. I grab a fully automatic assault rifle and then I duck behind the, you know, flipped over table or you know, whatever it is. John, what do you do?
897.54 947.54 speaker1  I take another shot at him from behind the bathroom door. Clark, it's your turn. Hell yeah. Yes. And the reason that you don't have to roll is as such.
946.54 950.54 speaker2  I'm just going to shoot at him. Describe it. Uh, well, hang on.
949.54 953.54 speaker1  Roll and then we'll, uh. Hang on. Yeah.
952.54 990.58 speaker2  Hang on. There's the combat ones over there too. Um, I I'm hoping that I, he should have his, uh, yeah, I'm just shooting at him. The wire is slack.
985.60 1005.42 speaker1  onto your hand and moves it away from you actually hitting him. And so you're firing up at the ceiling and it's his turn. I need you to roll against unarmed combat.
1003.48 1036.16 speaker2  Pass but not a great pass. It's 21 on a 70. That's a pretty good pass. Okay.
1027.28 1088.80 speaker1  He retracts his hand and the wire begins zipping back into his wrist nub. And as it does, I need you to roll a constitution, a very important constitution check. It cuts all the way into your skin, but it doesn't go all the way through. You can actually feel this wire rubbing up against your nerves on one side and your bone on the other. And a unfathomable pain is coursing through your entire body and you become lightheaded as he brings you in and punches you directly in the mouth for 11 damage.
1085.46 1112.04 speaker2  I'm glad I didn't touch the suit of armor.
1111.04 1140.16 speaker1  ground. Keith, it is your turn. You are hiding a tactical. I have nothing against it. Okay, so I got a question. Oh, perfect. Okay.
1136.20 1142.80 speaker2  He's got one hand has the door as a shield.
1141.24 1144.80 speaker1  Clark is on the ground. He's on the ground.
1143.80 1162.16 speaker2  He's not being held up. So if I do a cold shot to like just shoot at, shoot at the guy, but not, I don't necessarily want to do a headshot. I just want to shoot and not hit the door. That would be a called shot.
1161.16 1169.68 speaker1  I would have hit him. Oh, that sucks.
1168.68 1172.48 speaker2  him am I? That's cool though.
1170.68 1187.44 speaker1  Well, you're in the living room and he's in the foyer. The coffee table is in the living room and you hit on the other side of it. So you're at least 25 feet away from him.
1181.64 1190.76 speaker2  I have a fully automatic rifle and I'm shooting through a presumably wooden door.
1188.44 1233.28 speaker1  The uh, the door gets, uh, so what'd you roll? crouched behind it. And as the door falls, you see him pop his head with the scar over his right eye above the door and just stare at you. John, what do you do? I wish I'd read that card a turn ago. Clark, what are you doing?
1231.64 1241.52 speaker2  further than I normally would be able to? I would like to get really fucking far into the house.
1240.52 1368.78 speaker1  Crawling like through the kitchen door. Cool. I'm still aiming, but I do like with one hand, I like help reel him in. Nice. toward Keith at full speed while reaching behind him and pulling out a giant metal crowbar from off of his back. And he jumps and he is going to try to bring it down on Keith over through the coffee table on the other side of it where you're hiding. So he has a 50%, you're going to roll dodge, but you get to add 20% on it for being behind cover. Okay. comes running toward you and then you hear quiet as a giant metal crowbar just slams into your side and it doesn't, it doesn't poke you, but he straight up just like baseball bat swings it into your rib cage that doing 11 damage. is a mask. You can actually, as he's been jostling himself about, you can see the glinting metal shine from beneath as his skin sloughs off of its current placement. His whole head skin is just slightly askew.
1367.78 1371.62 speaker0  Okay.
1370.62 1386.74 speaker1  Yes. besides like get away. Oh, it's not realistic. It's your turn though. And you can do anything.
1385.74 1440.78 speaker2  Get this fucker. Yeah. Have we tried talking to him? Tell me, tell me what I can do from this. It might change my mind of what I want to do, but I want to stand up, jump on his back since he's not facing me and use my lock picking skills to try to like, he's a, I think he's a robot. So I want to like unlock his head from his body. That's fucking awesome. Yeah.
1435.88 1450.82 speaker1  The first will be anything against his strength. top of him. Can I know that or not?
1449.82 1459.82 speaker2  Okay. You can do anything that like would make sense against that. I guess.
1457.26 1463.82 speaker1  So I mean athletics, strength, strength is my highest. Dexterity. I don't know. Yes.
1462.82 1467.82 speaker2  Okay. Okay.
1466.82 1477.90 speaker1  Like you just got to be like six.
1476.90 1487.22 speaker2  You should stop using those two. Yeah.
1483.78 1501.02 speaker1  you and throws you over him into the wall. You're back against the wall and then you slide down the wall and you take four damage
1500.02 1509.30 speaker2  I'm very close to dying. These are good boys. Roll with these. John's your turn. I want to try a couple of things.
1508.30 1512.74 speaker1  quick clock.
1509.30 1527.46 speaker2  You get, I give him a weary thumbs up and start to get up back to my feet. You're just looking at your arm. I'm looking at his chair. Uh, but I see that he's okay.
1525.66 1534.30 speaker1  would look into the foyer and the living room. Right. So I'm going to level my gun at him, but I'm going to, I am going to try something we haven't tried yet.
1533.30 1542.18 speaker2  Freeze. Contention PD. Great.
1540.58 1547.38 speaker1  No, I don't have to. That's not going to work.
1544.82 1562.86 speaker2  Just do it. What I want to do is shoot him with the sniper rifle. So yeah. He did spend a whole turn doing it.
1561.86 1565.86 speaker1  That's hard. Yeah.
1564.86 1567.86 speaker2  I don't see me getting a bonus here. Yeah.
1566.86 1570.86 speaker1  Exactly. I was, I was aiming.
1569.86 1572.86 speaker2  We would want the same courtesy to us. Yeah.
1571.86 1599.90 speaker1  Exactly. Exactly. We would hate that. And then before I wait for response, uh, I'm going to just blast him. Okay. Actually, how about trying to blast him? He freezes. If you pass a persuade, I will give you a plus 20 on your shot.
1598.90 1603.94 speaker2  I like it. Like I confuse them enough.
1602.94 1604.94 speaker0  86.
1603.94 1608.58 speaker1  Fuck. On a 60.
1605.94 1610.58 speaker2  You guys remember earlier when I said we were rolling good, boys. Sorry.
1609.58 1657.70 speaker1  Yeah. Two D 10 for damage. Two D 10. Fuck yeah. Eight. Eight. I shout that idiot shit, which obviously isn't going to stop a robot. Where does it hit? Right in his gut. Okay. Yeah. Clark, it's your turn.
1656.70 1662.66 speaker0  Yeah.
1657.70 1668.10 speaker2  I want to shoot my pistol at the robot at the thing that's buzzing at this point. Some kind of beautiful mechanical man.
1665.82 1678.46 speaker1  This is the first time you guys have noticed anything weird. tip off. Now they think about it. Yeah.
1677.46 1679.46 speaker2  Okay.
1678.46 1692.02 speaker1  So you knew he was a robot. Also, I met a robot earlier in this campaign.
1691.02 1733.54 speaker2  You do indeed. And I'm going to take a shot at the boy with my good arm. Just roll. Crit pass. 33 on an 80. Okay. You're not on him anymore? Correct. I'm shooting at his head. I'm on John's shoulder to steady it. Yes. Hell yeah. And that gives me a real perfect line of sight on the guy's head and I pop, pop, pop, pop.
1728.18 1766.26 speaker1  So each shot makes his neck snap back as his head recoils from the bullets. His entire torso reclines fully like he's prepping to do the limbo, but his bottom half stays completely still. And like a spring, his body snaps back into an upright position and you see the skin drooped over his face is covered in bullet holes. The skin is all loose and off kilter and you can see a shiny metal where this thing's skull should be. So send your help us.
1765.26 1773.14 speaker2  Go for it. Yeah, he's the other one.
1772.14 1780.18 speaker1  Yeah.
1779.18 1789.78 speaker2  What was it about?
1785.74 1835.82 speaker1  Well, that's just where all the buffest act, see, we as a people have always loved our That is as Western European as it gets. Well, it's on the border between the two, but it's like, so fucking German. See, that was only 15 seconds of stuff that'll get edited out. we give them.
1834.82 1842.62 speaker2  Let's keep going.
1836.82 1889.82 speaker1  So you begin singing, take me out as this robot man snaps back into place and it is now his turn. This giant being turns and looks at Keith Vigna who is on the ground and he moves his torso like he's going to approach Keith, but his bottom half isn't functioning. His head begins whirring and popping little crackles and short stunted movements. With a look of realization, the metal skull turns its attention to the two officers on You see one of its eyes is dead. You put a bullet right through it, but the other eye stares directly at Clark and John. He holds out both arms and shoots his fist at the two of you.
1888.82 1895.78 speaker2  I do not pass.
1892.70 2013.48 speaker1  He rolled a 50 on a 50 against John Lee Pettymore. Oh, that means he hits me, right? Nine damage on John, three damage on Clark. rib cage and holds on tight and you can actually feel the fist clench down and grab two of your ribs and bring them closer together. Oh, cool. This is the first luck spend of the entire campaign. If I get six more hit points, that would be insanely helpful to me, but even one is very handy at this point. hit points back. Oh, pretty good. He gets four hit points back, putting him at nine. It actually gets caught on a screw that was put in there from my sprint racing days and And the claw actually grabs onto the forearm that had been recently shredded on Clark. Just pushing that nerve right up against the bone and the two are rubbing against each other. Uh, go ahead and nevermind.
2012.48 2014.48 speaker2  You're dead.
2013.48 2015.48 speaker1  You're dead.
2014.48 2023.92 speaker0  Fuck you.
2016.60 2038.32 speaker1  So now I need you guys to both roll against his unarmed combat to try to get out of this grapple. have not. 58.
2036.92 2044.20 speaker2  That's a great fucking roll. Hell yeah, dude.
2043.20 2061.84 speaker1  Fuck yeah. He passed against Clark with an eight. So John, your fist is staying in. It's hooked on that screw. And Clark, describe how you get this, uh, this inspector gadget go-go fist off of your
2059.00 2070.04 speaker2  I use my gun to pry off the fingers. Ooh, badass.
2068.56 2077.68 speaker1  And it is Keith's turn.
2076.16 2087.28 speaker2  a knife in it? Well, no, I don't. Well, I do have a knife on me already.
2085.12 2103.60 speaker1  I would imagine that you have a knife. You live in the country, you're a police officer, I'd imagine you have a knife on you. Okay, so can I describe the knife I have on me? You can describe a pretty common knife that you would have on you.
2098.80 2154.04 speaker2  I've got a four foot long knife. Let me describe it. So I pull out, it's like a pocket knife in the sense that it folds into itself, but I pull it out and it's like a four inch blade. I want to get up off of the ground and run with my knife and just chop the wires that are connecting his hands to these people and just cut the wires and then just like run Okay, awesome.
2152.48 2160.08 speaker1  So if you did one of them.
2155.50 2164.32 speaker2  Would you give me a negative 20 on the second one and a regular one on the first one?
2163.32 2168.92 speaker1  I like that. Yeah.
2166.80 2170.40 speaker2  Did you know you can barter with your...
2168.92 2172.40 speaker3  Who's connected? You?
2171.40 2176.80 speaker2  Yeah.
2175.80 2182.80 speaker1  Okay. Then I'll just do the only taught wire. Yeah.
2181.80 2204.68 speaker2  Hold on. So I pull out my knife. I'm going to use my orange blade pocket knife and I'm going to run and just try to cut the wire that's connected to John. Okay. And that's going to be a strength roll. Roll a strength roll. 11 on a 50 fuck.
2203.68 2211.68 speaker1  And I'll tell you why. Not for any devious reasons.
2210.68 2219.20 speaker3  Zach is happy.
2211.68 2244.16 speaker1  No, it is because I was going to have to be a stick in the mud DM who is like, actually that wire is made from a very strong. Oh yeah. Every time we cheer. So how do we fix that? John is no longer grappled.
2242.12 2245.16 speaker2  Let me fucking describe it, dude.
2244.16 2249.08 speaker1  Oh, sorry.
2246.64 2320.84 speaker2  So I get up off the ground. I like collect myself. My back hurts really bad and I look and see what just happened. I pull this pocket knife that you could barely call a pocket knife out of my back pocket. I flipped the blade up and it's like three inches wide, four inches tall. And I run as fast as I can, arms wide out in front of me and just run into this wire. And I run through it and it cuts through it like butter. And as I do it, I look into the one eye of this monster and I flip it off. And then I, as soon as I hit the wire, obviously like tension comes and it kind of like throws me off. I fall down and roll and I roll and I get back up and just two fingers, two middle fingers up to this robot. Hell yeah.
2319.84 2328.08 speaker1  John, it's your turn.
2322.32 2332.48 speaker3  Can you imagine as I get released from this thing's clutches that I probably in pain,
2331.48 2336.80 speaker1  Absolutely. Uh, because it did pull you forward as the tension.
2335.80 2341.08 speaker3  Okay. So I'm in the foyer now a little bit. A little bit.
2340.08 2362.92 speaker1  Yeah. He is indeed. And the fist is still clenched around my, okay. In your body. Ouchies. Ouchie mama.
2360.70 2376.38 speaker3  That does do more damage than my sidearm, right? It does indeed.
2375.38 2381.92 speaker1  Describe it.
2377.96 2391.08 speaker3  I guess he's still in front of me because he shot at us from inside that room. So I'm in pain. I'm clutching at my side, but I bring the sniper rifle up from the hip and I just try to shoot him kind of in the gut again.
