187.78 217.30 speaker3  one police cruiser and a raggedy four wheeler come pulling back into the contention police
215.86 219.98 speaker2  Let's get professional medical attention.
217.30 232.70 speaker3  I kind of like the idea of me doing it. What do you want to do Keith? it up and then put my boot back on and then just go from there.
229.54 242.10 speaker4  Go ahead and roll a first aid for me. That's a nine.
234.78 253.70 speaker3  With an actual first aid kit handy and perhaps a leather strap to bite down on, you set your ankle back into place and get your boot back on. We would have just taken you to the hospital man. We don't have time.
252.70 258.38 speaker4  Oh, all right. I have to prove myself dude.
256.90 303.74 speaker3  I gain hit points from that probably. He said 60. It's qualified. It's pretty brutal actually. He was murdered in an alleyway the night of December 1st. He was strangled and died of asphyxiation.
300.98 322.86 speaker4  Didn't you say you had a dream about an alleyway? She was an old timey lady throwing me through the floor.
316.18 326.26 speaker3  And did I see you guys pull up in that four wheeler, but did someone wreck the four wheeler?
324.18 336.62 speaker4  Yeah, I wrecked it. Just could you take a look at that? Yeah. You know mechanical stuff, right?
335.62 343.22 speaker3  Yeah, absolutely.
337.62 345.22 speaker4  And then now that Julie Maxwell is definitely not at her apartment, maybe we should go take
344.22 347.22 speaker3  Do all three of you want to go?
346.22 369.22 speaker4  Sure.
367.30 388.98 speaker3  was in her car accident. You head there and you pull up to a quadplex in the shitty neighborhood just northwest of downtown where Julie Maxwell rents a studio apartment.
387.98 390.98 speaker4  What's it say? You weren't here.
389.98 485.54 speaker3  Still waiting for reply. Please help me. You know I've always thought it was weird that this place is called the shitty neighborhood. I feel like step one to raising property values in this place is changing that name. As you knock on the door, the door opens and an odd chemical scent wafts out the door. Yeah, it was just clearly not closed very well. Is it like methy in here? Or like bleach? Not so methy. A scent that John would know pretty well I bet. As you go inside, you find a bed, a desk with an old computer on it, and a large number of complete and incomplete taxidermied animals. Looking around further, you see an empty bottle of brandy, an old digital camera, taxidermy materials like tanning chemicals, pickling agents, bactericides, oils and such, a handful of pictures of Julie with her sister Ashley from before the accident, and a receipt from Forgotten Treasures, a local flea market. Whoever has the best search, please roll search for me. I've got 50. It's flipped upside down underneath the bed, and flipping it over, you see the phone book was opened to the Yellow Pages for private practices, and Circled is an ad for Dr. Marie Jacobs, who is a family practitioner in contention.
484.54 490.42 speaker4  Yeah, definitely. I want to look at that camera and that receipt too.
488.86 495.98 speaker3  Roll computer science.
492.42 501.62 speaker4  My skill is 99, so I pass hand on it. It's awfully handy.
500.54 525.26 speaker3  Damn, it's broken. There are some recent Google searches on her computer for fixing broken digital cameras, and then moving on to where to find a new camera. She was looking into buying a new camera. The receipt from Forgotten Treasures is off an old register for, I don't know, $45. Let's go with $45.
524.26 554.58 speaker4  Sounds good. Sure. I would like to see if I can see anything on it. and really grind my taxidermy skill? Absolutely. Sweet. What is the mattress memory for? Yeah, just stand. Is this just a one bedroom?
551.82 557.86 speaker2  Does Clark know anything about Dr. Marie Jacobs just from being in the town?
556.54 562.98 speaker4  Any pictures or anything around?
558.86 571.06 speaker3  They're all of Julie with her sister Ashley, so they're all from high school. Move on, you know? She is now.
570.06 573.06 speaker2  I mean, she murdered first. Hell yeah.
572.06 581.62 speaker4  All right, for an eye. Literally. Literally. Can you think of anything else to do in here?
580.62 591.10 speaker2  Awesome.
585.68 595.18 speaker3  The whole time that John and Keith are looking through stuff and trying to work on the computer,
594.18 603.86 speaker4  Good. in the woods? Oh dude, yeah.
602.86 613.92 speaker3  Could we disguise ourselves?
612.92 628.78 speaker4  I take the time. Yeah, actually.
627.78 643.66 speaker3  Ooh, yeah. Yeah, there's for sure a boar in here. What about a bobcat? There are three bobcat heads.
641.18 652.78 speaker4  I'm just going to go with a deer.
651.78 657.70 speaker2  happen.
656.70 660.70 speaker4  We've seen some shit.
658.70 663.70 speaker2  You guys are putting shit on your heads. I know. Act like officers, boys.
662.70 674.50 speaker4  Hey, you know what?
673.50 681.14 speaker2  We don't need this stuff.
680.14 697.58 speaker4  Clark. It's a weird call to just set mine on the table, because I just pick it back up and walk out with it under my arm.
693.58 711.44 speaker3  two fellow officers have walked out with taxidermy hats. Sorry, one was a Cerberus.
707.48 721.44 speaker2  I think madness has taken my friends. Yeah.
720.44 722.44 speaker3  I'll take that tray for a sweet bobcat.
721.44 732.90 speaker4  Wait, what kind of camera?
730.70 734.16 speaker3  were about the size of an ID.
732.90 735.16 speaker4  What are you, a grandpa?
734.16 742.64 speaker3  It was one of those. Yes, my children have children.
741.64 749.44 speaker4  of the apartment. He said it's broken. Oh, it's broken.
748.14 757.44 speaker3  We got the card off it. Yeah, so unless you want a digital camera from 2008- I don't.
755.04 764.52 speaker4  Okay, what should we do next, boys? I kind of got caught up in that bobcat mask thing. What was on the SD card?
763.52 772.28 speaker3  Right, okay. I think you figured out earlier in this game that she is a taxidermist, and so it's her Etsy page.
771.28 780.28 speaker4  Yeah, nope. Chuck Testa. Sweet meme. Oh, yeah, vintage. Vintage memes. What are you, a grandpa? What?
778.28 783.84 speaker3  Yeah, his kids have kids.
781.28 793.92 speaker2  We got two things we could go and look at here now. We can see if anybody at Forgotten Treasures remembers what she bought, and we could head over to the doctor's office and see if she has any information on why-
792.44 797.92 speaker4  Let's go to Hidden Treasures. Or Forgotten Treasures. Forgotten Treasures. Forgotten Treasures.
796.92 812.40 speaker2  Let's go there.
805.18 822.04 speaker3  It is in the old neighborhood, two blocks west of, it's, no, it's, yeah, to the left. It's right there. Yep. And it's an antique flea market.
821.04 837.32 speaker2  Yep, there it is. Just to the left. There you go. You got it. You found it.
836.32 852.16 speaker3  To the left. To the left. All your shit in a box in the flea market. Go inside.
851.16 863.64 speaker4  You know what? That's what they're expecting.
862.22 888.92 speaker3  of office to your right. There's a big register area to the left where everybody checks out. There's one big register sitting on it, and an old woman standing behind it. And then looking forward, you just see a bunch of different rows of booths, individual booths. Like old stuff. Cool.
887.92 890.92 speaker4  What was on the receipt?
889.92 895.48 speaker2  It wasn't itemized.
893.52 903.48 speaker4  Yeah, see if Julie came by a lot. We're three officers of the law, and we need some information from you.
902.48 905.48 speaker3  Okay.
904.48 912.08 speaker4  Yes? Do you remember a lady named Julie Maxwell?
911.08 921.72 speaker3  We show her a picture. Oh, yes. Yes. She was in here, I don't know, maybe a week ago.
920.72 927.72 speaker4  Do you recall what she purchased? Oh gosh.
924.72 951.12 speaker3  It was an old camera. What booth? 504? I think. Polaroid? Seemed to be. I'd never seen anything like it before.
949.76 961.44 speaker4  That's John Peters' neighbor. Clark, you're walking toward the booth.
960.44 976.96 speaker3  paraphernalia. Future paraphernalia?
975.96 978.96 speaker4  too unusual?
977.96 996.96 speaker2  I don't know.
995.96 999.36 speaker4  We need to go talk to her.
997.08 1003.60 speaker2  Yeah, we need to find out how she got this stuff.
1001.12 1012.32 speaker3  You might want to check out booth 420. Man, we are officers before war. Man, we're cops. It's all Elvis memorabilia. I'm a big fan.
1011.32 1014.32 speaker4  Well.
1013.32 1017.28 speaker3  Crying all the time.
1016.28 1038.40 speaker4  Let's roll.
1037.40 1044.40 speaker3  Hey Mildred. Hey. How are you doing? Uh, yeah.
1043.40 1048.16 speaker4  I, um.
1045.40 1056.26 speaker3  I'm so, I am, um, I'm sorry. I just like the place to smell nice.
1054.02 1058.26 speaker4  Hey, do you mind if we step in and ask you a few questions?
1057.26 1073.94 speaker3  By all means. What kind of tea?
1072.38 1079.98 speaker4  I'll take the first green.
1078.98 1082.10 speaker3  Mildred.
1080.22 1090.18 speaker4  Oh, I, oh, shoot, I'm so-
1086.98 1150.70 speaker3  with some tea, uh, and sits down on the couch and is like- No, I, uh, you know, it might have been my granddaughter. I think she might put some stuff for sale there, everyone smile. officers standing in her living room, she bolts back upstairs.
1148.30 1151.70 speaker4  I call, hey Tildy, now, we just want to talk.
1150.70 1155.26 speaker3  I call up the stairs. You hear a door slam?
1152.70 1160.30 speaker4  This one's on you, boys, I can't go upstairs. Clark, you go head out the door, I'm gonna make sure she doesn't jump out a window or
1159.30 1178.22 speaker3  Sure. So John runs around the side of the house and, uh, gets a visual of the windows, and
1173.86 1181.18 speaker2  some stuff you might have sold at the, at the booth down at your, your mom's shop down
1179.22 1191.30 speaker3  Uh, you hear, um, some clanking? You hear some clanking around.
1190.30 1195.18 speaker2  Alright, step away from the door.
1192.74 1238.42 speaker3  So I'm gonna have the two of you leave. She has a crazed look in her eyes as she slams a large bullet into the chamber and squeezes the trigger on a really odd-looking revolver. There's an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision, and then, as if she had never been there, the girl is gone.
1237.42 1244.70 speaker2  Okay. Two.
1243.70 1324.50 speaker3  Call it a two. Alright, so Clark loses two sanity. You're looking at it, and it's this old revolver, and it's got some glass tubing that runs around the outside of it. The door open, and there's nothing inside. You look under the bed, and there's no one underneath the bed. Pretty normal. but instead of the ... What would that be called? The spinny part ... God, yeah. If you haven't been able to tell by listening to this podcast, I know lots about guns. So instead of that- Oh, God.
1323.50 1330.62 speaker2  They're chambers.
1325.50 1353.34 speaker3  So instead of the six chambers, there is one chamber that can be accessed from one side. It's closed on the other side, and then it's got one chamber. She slammed a large bullet into ... You saw her do that. of where the hammer would be, there are two lights, one green, one red, and the red one is currently lit.
1349.50 1370.26 speaker2  I'm going to look out the window and see what I see out the window. Yep. Oh! Oh! Oh!
1368.72 1383.80 speaker4  Is Tildy alive? Did she explode into black goo?
1378.18 1393.68 speaker3  see the window from where you're assuming her room was, because it's a rather small two-story house, and you see a extremely bright flash of light come from that room.
1389.64 1400.20 speaker4  I feel like a really dark tingle of recognition and dread.
1398.44 1421.86 speaker3  Do I hear anything? It's a miracle. He looks horrified. He's pale white and panicked.
1420.60 1430.68 speaker4  I go ahead and do that.
1429.68 1441.04 speaker2  See who? Where's Tildy? She's not here. I come up.
1438.24 1456.20 speaker3  The three of you meet at the platform at the top of the stairs.
1449.92 1465.52 speaker2  She pointed a gun at me, and she chambered a bullet, and she shot me, and there was this blinding white light, and then she wasn't there anymore.
1464.52 1475.48 speaker4  What's the gun look like? Be cautious, Leag.
1474.48 1478.48 speaker3  you know. Do you know what that thing's called?
1477.48 1479.48 speaker2  Cylinder!
1478.48 1519.40 speaker3  That's the name! We could not come up with it. So where the cylinder was, there's basically, on one side, it's completely enclosed, cased in, and on the other side, there's a small sliding door, basically, that you can slide open and shut, and it would fit one bullet that's the size of a cylinder. And then there are glass tubes, one going underneath it, and then one kind of going around the side where it's closed, and then on the back of the gun where the hammer is,
1518.40 1526.36 speaker4  I shake him. I want to look around the rest of the room.
1525.36 1547.90 speaker2  She's not in the closet. I checked there. She was scared. We looked each other in the eye. Did I see her chamber the bullet itself, and did I see what light, if there were lights on the gun at the time that she shot?
1544.72 1560.40 speaker3  The lights would have been facing her, so you wouldn't have seen that. Oh yeah, they were there. She already had it in hand when he kicked in the door.
1558.84 1563.84 speaker4  Okay, we heard her fumbling around.
1560.40 1565.84 speaker3  As soon as he kicked in the door, she slammed that bullet into place and shot.
1564.84 1572.20 speaker2  It was a big ass bullet.
1571.20 1573.20 speaker4  camera or the gun.
1572.20 1584.12 speaker2  Clark points under the bed. I checked there and he points at the closet. I checked, I checked there.
1583.12 1605.76 speaker4  Did you check in the bed? Nope. later than me.
1604.76 1607.76 speaker3  Boo.
1605.76 1628.84 speaker4  Yeah, that was bad. Oh yeah. Yeah.
1626.96 1637.32 speaker3  of $20 bills all rolled up. I take it.
1634.40 1639.32 speaker4  scrap you might get like selling bullshit at a flea park. Yeah, exactly.
1638.32 1643.04 speaker3  Like 200 bucks.
1642.04 1661.36 speaker4  Oh yeah. Also, oh my God, like if I was fucking 15 right now and had a wad of 200 bucks, I would feel like a clean.
1658.08 1663.36 speaker2  When the gun went off and there was the flash of light, was there a sound?
1662.36 1677.24 speaker4  Okay. I want to know where the camera is basically.
1676.24 1688.44 speaker3  Okay. Nope. So has anything changed with the camera?
1687.44 1689.60 speaker4  No, it's red.
1688.44 1702.30 speaker3  I want to take it into the room. So you rush out the front door. Keith and Clark, you guys come back downstairs and Mildred is sitting on her couch in a Snuggie
1698.88 1706.54 speaker4  drinking some tea, watching TV.
1705.54 1710.94 speaker2  I'll be right back.
1707.54 1720.74 speaker3  She kind of looks up at the two of you as you come down the stairs. As John comes running back inside, she's like super blazed in her eyes.
1719.02 1725.70 speaker4  handle your shit. Just in as I'm running back to Tildy's room.
1724.46 1725.70 speaker3  Hey Mildred. Don't give up.
