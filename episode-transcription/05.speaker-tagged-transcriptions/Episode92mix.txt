133.00 211.00 speaker1  Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling. All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling. Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling. And just like throughout history in general. And there's a sentence that I want to read to you guys that stuck out to me. Though perhaps lesser known, an important pioneer of hand washing was the Vienna based Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis. Who was alive from 1818 to 1865. Who realized that laboring women caught perpetual fever from doctors who went straight from the morgue to the delivery room.
210.00 213.00 speaker0  Is that real?
211.00 242.00 speaker1  They had some crazy fetishes. Oh no I don't think anyone believed him.
240.00 284.00 speaker0  Immuno-systems. So... For what?
283.00 320.00 speaker2  For funsies? Which is called For Funsies. If you had to be a doctor what kind of doctor would you be? Pussy. Yeah. I'm not a pussy doctor.
319.00 322.00 speaker1  No.
320.00 325.00 speaker2  No? What?
324.00 330.00 speaker1  Cox South. Ball doctor. Ball doctor.
329.00 344.00 speaker2  A pee-pee doctor.
343.00 351.00 speaker1  That's your pee Zack.
349.00 385.00 speaker2  Excuse me what did you say? Pee-pee. That's what I studied in medical school. Well I think I'm a piano doctor. Yeah you have all kinds. I'm a 30 times master. You can be a man in what? A week?
383.00 389.00 speaker1  How many hours are in a week?
387.00 394.00 speaker2  Five thousand six hundred.
390.00 400.00 speaker1  Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred hours.
396.00 436.00 speaker2  That's how long it takes to get good at pee-pee doctoring. You can take that out. Yeah cut them out. Do you do it to other people? Like are you into that? I admit I like popping my own pimples and stuff like that. But I don't like seeing it on somebody else.
433.00 440.00 speaker1  I don't like pimple popping videos. Yeah me either.
437.00 492.00 speaker2  I'm a proud subscriber of the popping subreddit. But that's about something else right? Yeah mine's super boring. Like subreddits we didn't know about. Wait what? 13 or 30 it's pictures of people that could be 13 or 30. I like that one too. Yeah. Ate the Onion is always a good one.
489.00 503.00 speaker1  Awful Taste but Great Execution and Male Fashion.
500.00 544.00 speaker2  What was it? Awful Taste but Great Execution? That's Enough Mr. West Please No More Today. Did you see that? Oh no. Yeah. That was bad.
540.00 547.00 speaker1  It's a sad story of mental illness that is a true bummer.
544.00 551.00 speaker2  But you know when he gets real bad that he's got an album coming out soon.
550.00 560.00 speaker1  Alright so. That's not true. Life of Pablo was fucking dope.
559.00 566.00 speaker2  Yeah. His word is law.
564.00 569.00 speaker1  It's the Wild West there aren't anyone else. It sounded like you called him Kanye West.
568.00 578.00 speaker2  Kanye West.
573.00 581.00 speaker1  It's just like a 65 year old white woman doing karaoke to Kanye.
580.00 599.00 speaker0  I'd watch that.
598.00 608.00 speaker1  Yeehaw. Yeehaw.
605.00 623.00 speaker2  Cause we haven't gone long enough before we started. Yeah people love this. Well let's find out. I'm googling.
622.00 636.00 speaker1  It meant hello and goodbye. Oh.
632.00 647.00 speaker2  God I want a tattoo that says Yeehaw means family on my back.
646.00 668.00 speaker1  Oh no. Should we all stop? One two three five six seven. Who's on a horse? You know Jack Pearlman's on a horse come on.
667.00 716.00 speaker2  I'm on a horse. Come on hey mister. I'd like to think that Everett has a very small donkey he rides on. Can we make that happen? Yeah and Delta Green.
712.00 733.00 speaker1  So how do we get out of this?
727.00 820.00 speaker2  Not like an agile like racing horse like this one can like carry a wagon around. Very sturdy beautiful horse named Jeremiah whom I love and I think Jack also loves. H-A-Y mister. Love it. Love it. I think that's the horse maybe I have too is the Clydesdale the weird like. Budweiser horse. Oh. They're too majestic. I'll write that down. Big fun horse. Big fun horse Jeremiah. It sounds a little hoarse. Gosh. And Ephraim slaps his knee and laughs to himself.
819.00 825.00 speaker1  It was a joke. I don't follow. It sounds hoarse.
824.00 858.00 speaker2  Yeah yeah. And I point to the midpoint between the cemetery and my place. We were thinking we were gonna see if she dropped off those bodies somewhere. Are you uh you just walking? I mean I'll be way behind you guys if I do a walk.
856.00 891.00 speaker1  Bobby Custard speaks up and is like. Bucky looks like a good place for you to ride and Bucky is a gorgeous black horse. And as Everett Pace hops up onto Bucky.
890.00 901.00 speaker2  That's why I keep the donkey at my place. It's easier to get up on. It's a little shorter you know.
900.00 915.00 speaker1  would know her. Her name is Elizabeth Connor. She lives in contention and Judge Cortland you would remember her as a friend of your deceased daughter.
913.00 942.00 speaker2  Is she like furry? Woolly. How close is she to us?
939.00 989.00 speaker1  Hi there folks. Hey Lizzie. Oh hi there Judge Cortland. It's good to see you. I don't reckon I didn't mean to cause nothing but. Speak up. And she walks right over to Cortland and is. But this morning I overheard Mr. and Mrs. Cole there arguing something loud and fiery. And I did hear they were screaming about copper wire.
988.00 1010.00 speaker2  my copper wire.
1003.00 1024.00 speaker1  I was just fetching some water and happened over here and when you came in Judge screaming and hollering about how your copper wire had been done taking. I thought maybe. I mean I would hate to think that of the Coles. I don't know.
1022.00 1031.00 speaker2  He's always seemed a little off to me.
1030.00 1036.00 speaker0  Creepy little fella.
1034.00 1044.00 speaker2  Never can never should.
1042.00 1100.00 speaker1  Do with it what you will I suppose. Okay and just don't hold on too tight there. Yep. Okay. Now I think maybe and the crowd is leaving. They kind of do that thing that big crowds do where they're congregating like a congregation in front of the church. So they're all like saying their goodbyes but it's taking them a while to leave and Custard.
1094.00 1110.00 speaker2  Custard delete this if it turns out I asked you about this last time but do you know anything
1108.00 1120.00 speaker1  Oh six days ago?
1115.00 1141.00 speaker2  the woman she was referring to having having an argument with Miss with Mr. Cole. with Mr. Cole that they had argued fiercely shortly before his disappearance. Luke can you hear Thomas?
1140.00 1168.00 speaker1  Shit really?
1165.00 1175.00 speaker2  if we're gonna interrupt and say anything but. How is it? Still roboty?
1174.00 1184.00 speaker1  Still bad.
1182.00 1193.00 speaker2  Save up all the burps for when you speak. Yeah. I've never seen it before.
1189.00 1202.00 speaker1  I only have like four shirts that I like. Same.
1198.00 1217.00 speaker0  Get me some proper western attire so I can get in character.
1213.00 1251.00 speaker2  Me and Joe can just wear our weird luchador masks. We play luchadors in every single one shot from here on out. Okay so am I still a robot? Yeah.
1249.00 1288.00 speaker1  Okay I'm gonna restart.
1287.00 1292.00 speaker2  Does anybody know?
1290.00 1313.00 speaker1  I think we got a pretty good one. They didn't understand you.
1307.00 1323.00 speaker2  Mr. Cole getting in a terrible argument shortly before his disappearance. I'm not sure what it was.
1321.00 1327.00 speaker0  Cole makes discoveries every day.
1326.00 1358.00 speaker2  What was it? Do you strike oil? That sounds like a bit crazy if you ask me. I'm a man of science and I have seen many things. wacky? Why do you do the things you do?
1354.00 1419.00 speaker1  He's just got his mouth open unsure how to respond. that might help us solve this case on the way there.
1417.00 1426.00 speaker3  I reckon I like that a whole lot. Thomas goo.
1425.00 1445.00 speaker2  No, no, no, no. Bottle that up. Thomas's goo? I actually do, but it would be above you. You wouldn't understand it.
1444.00 1462.00 speaker1  I'm just sure of it. What's static? Oh, uh, well see Silas Cole found out about electricity and sometimes it makes a weird zzzz noise. Ah, I know some Latin.
1460.00 1479.00 speaker2  I don't, I don't think you do.
1475.00 1487.00 speaker1  General natural world for those of you who have natural world.
1486.00 1491.00 speaker2  It's a one. I passed with a one.
1490.00 1495.00 speaker1  Nice.
1494.00 1498.00 speaker2  There's too many fucking. Oh no, I restarted.
1497.00 1502.00 speaker0  Oh, thank God. I still have it. Let's get all these things back up.
1501.00 1504.00 speaker2  Apologies.
1503.00 1543.00 speaker1  Okay. We got a one Everett pace. Looking up into the sky, you see three vultures circling about a half mile down the road and right down there, there's a row of homes. Uh, just a little, uh, early idea of a suburb happening down here on the west side of contention.
1541.00 1555.00 speaker2  dates to the Roman times. Uh, meaning it comes from suburbus, meaning beyond the city. I'm sorry.
1552.00 1566.00 speaker1  And Everett, you would know that that is the sound vultures make.
1564.00 1583.00 speaker2  I've had vultures follow me around before. Uh, usually take a shower, bath after that, but I've heard them bark.
1582.00 1605.00 speaker0  Thanks everyone.
1600.00 1641.00 speaker2  man get that kind of positive affirmation in his life at this point in the 1880s. So sad. missing that he didn't know about before. Oh no.
1635.00 1657.00 speaker1  Everyone roll animal handling except for the judge who does this so often that his horse Oh. Could I roll ride?
1656.00 1658.00 speaker2  Yeah, same.
1657.00 1660.00 speaker0  I rolled a 92. I failed.
1659.00 1673.00 speaker2  I failed hard as well. Your sick party wagon.
1672.00 1679.00 speaker0  Science party wagon.
1673.00 1698.00 speaker2  Well, I figured he went out to his dinosaurs bones every day with a little, with a little
1692.00 1704.00 speaker1  He notices he's um, no, this, this sucks.
1703.00 1705.00 speaker2  Oh yes.
1704.00 1712.00 speaker1  Absolutely.
1708.00 1714.00 speaker0  Firearms are all that you didn't have to roll a second.
1713.00 1731.00 speaker2  Ooh, that's a dead bird. I pull my gun out and ate all my bacon last night and pop, shoot a, shoot a vulture and
1730.00 1787.12 speaker1  They bark. two begin circling just a little bit lower. The horses. Let's see. We got Bucky. We got Jeremiah. Thank you. Yeah, we got Bucky. in order to try to basically at the apex of this horse trying to knock you off, you can push the role to try something a little bit different to hold on tight and regain control.
1782.20 1800.96 speaker2  He just gets bucked straight off the back of the horse and is suddenly on his backside.
1798.76 1814.68 speaker0  to calm down Jeremiah. It's just me now. Okay.
1813.68 1837.96 speaker2  So I pass. That is correct. Yeah.
1836.96 1886.16 speaker1  his name completely. You're going to lose one hit point. And professor horse green, you fall off as well, losing a single hit point and the horses grab on tight and you pull yourself forward, your legs dangling like you're Superman riding None of this loss in translation bullshit.
1884.80 1926.56 speaker0  We got this. Come on now, Jeremiah, come on now. And I'm like petting it's under, under its neck like you do with a weird doggy or with your fat cat.
1925.56 1933.64 speaker2  I like it. I certainly don't. I certainly do not.
1928.56 1937.64 speaker0  Well, some of us don't like real role-playing Joe and some of us love real role-playing.
1936.64 1949.00 speaker2  Yeah, that's good. Did you feel like a horse for a second?
1948.00 1959.00 speaker0  Okay, you're Zach. You're Zach. You're Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard.
1956.00 1982.96 speaker2  Hold on, while Zach was a horse, he shit all over the place. Let's see it. Shit.
1981.96 2012.92 speaker3  God damn it, Judge. What the? God damn it.
2010.92 2018.92 speaker0  be with someone a little more experienced.
2014.92 2040.88 speaker3  God damn Judge shooting a gun out of nowhere and pissed off all those horses. He should have known better. God damn it.
2035.88 2095.84 speaker2  Professor Green is watching his horse just run off back to the stable in town, just over the hill. horse is behind that Mr. Pace does not occupy. All right. It's the bachelor time.
2090.84 2110.84 speaker0  I know you probably don't want to get on Ephraim's and I reached my arm out to like, heave him up with me. Thank you, Mr. Bowman. You're welcome.
2104.84 2232.64 speaker1  large plots of land, but houses closer, maybe a hundred yards apart, give them some space, but not nearly as much as being out a little bit outside of town lends you a lot more room like Pace or Perlman's places. And as you guys are heading on down here, you see that there is a modest wooden cabin with a covered wraparound front porch. There is a watermelon patch out front. To the side, there's a herd of cows nearby on the side of the house. And you guys would know this place is called the Brick House. Ow! B-R-I-C-K-H-A-U-S. Is it mighty mighty? It's mighty mighty. It's the kind you don't take home to mother. You see as you're approaching, every single watermelon in this watermelon patch has been destroyed. And on the front porch, there's a very tall, very buff woman who is crying. She's weeping very openly. And you know that this is Greer Hilfintop Kamonkarno. backer patreon.com slash pretending pod. Thank you M from Michigan for both Greer Hilfintop Kamonkarno as well as the Brick House gym.
2230.64 2270.60 speaker3  They are... They have been completely destroyed. And I... I woke up in the night... Please tie up your horses and come here. The church is perfect. Preach your sheriff. Come here. Contention!
2264.60 2286.60 speaker2  He bends over to get the buzzard he shot and he shoves it in a bag on his horse and leads
2278.60 2301.56 speaker3  It has been circling ever since last night when one of my cows, my beautiful, beautiful is completely eviscerated.
2298.56 2314.56 speaker0  Horace, I'm going to need you with me on this one.
2308.56 2336.52 speaker1  The brick house is a place where people can come work out. Where they can work out? She's a fitness person and she teaches people of all ages and credos here in contention how to do that cool thing where you destroy a watermelon with your thighs.
2334.52 2361.48 speaker2  Oh that sounds fun, I'd like to learn. I'm going to look down at the watermelon patch and search through it to see if there's any...
2358.48 2376.44 speaker1  Yeah, go ahead and roll. Spot hidden maybe? You could roll spot hidden. You could roll...
2374.44 2381.44 speaker2  45, that's a fail.
2379.44 2390.44 speaker1  Two different sets. How big? Neither large, they're medium to small as far as feet go in the world.
2386.44 2396.44 speaker2  Hey, are these your footprints down here, ma'am?
2392.44 2440.36 speaker3  I looked from the porch but all of them, they have been gone. Yes, it evoked me from my slumber and I got up and I looked and I watched them. They were destroying everything in the melon patch. They were stepping all over it and they had no regard for my watermelons.
2438.36 2454.36 speaker1  She's shaking her head and she's crying and she's like... I...
2449.36 2503.36 speaker3  Well, I could have promised at the time. Now looking back I do not know. You know how the mind plays tricks on you. You can create false memories in oneself but it looked to be that woman from the saloon who had gone missing. Kitty? She was dressed strange. She must have been a teenager of some sort. But this lasso that Miss Kitty was using to catch her, it was magic.
2498.36 2514.36 speaker0  We all know that magic ain't real.
2509.36 2557.36 speaker3  Not that I don't respect you, it's just that it didn't seem that they were actually witches. Anyway, I think that this lasso somehow, you know the lights in town, yes? Yes, it was filed to see and it burned her enough to make quite a smell.
2554.36 2566.36 speaker1  Horace Green, what are you doing during this time? It was Courtland's turn last time, what are you looking at?
2565.36 2605.36 speaker2  What's it look like? I do, yeah.
2601.36 2613.36 speaker0  You ever seen something make marks like this on an animal before?
2609.36 2640.36 speaker1  Around it there seems to be bite marks. Go ahead and roll biology if you got it. Using that one a lot! Is there science? Five. Oh, there's science. Oh, either way you succeed on that roll as you see that these are bite marks roughly the size of a human jaw and roughly in the shape of a human mouth.
2638.36 2655.36 speaker0  I didn't want to frighten nobody.
2653.36 2657.36 speaker2  Horace passes.
2655.36 2679.36 speaker1  Jack Pearlman, you just lose one sanity. because this has already happened. Specifically, you've already seen these exact markings. Seeing it for a second time confirms what you saw last night.
2675.36 2703.36 speaker0  but this, before I looked at it myself, but something similar to this happened to one of my horses last night and by God, Dandelion, it looked like she just got murdered and ate up by some kind of creature that in the distance, I thought my eyes was playing tricks on me, but you're telling me it's some kind of man that does this?
2701.36 2709.36 speaker2  What kind of creature did you see?
2706.36 2723.36 speaker0  it almost looked like some kind of person, but they were so far and they were moving ungodly fast, I'd say. I couldn't even catch up with them before they got into the woods and I was on horseback.
2721.36 2761.36 speaker2  Do you still have the body? I'd very much like to see it. My God, what a specimen. You're an absolute mountain of a man. You make that sludge, Ephraim, look like a sludge. Oh. Got him. Certainly not a noble goo.
2757.36 2791.36 speaker0  but I'm telling you, it looks an awful lot exactly like this, and I'm assuming this happened to her last night also. Is there any other things I can perceive from this? Is there any tracks nearby? You could roll a tracking or... I pass, 35 on a 40.
2787.36 2823.36 speaker1  dug in hard, and they've left a mark. It's weird because shoes don't, typically the tread doesn't have a design on the bottom, but these have a three leaf design. It's like three leaves, and it's got three lines through the bottom of this trefoil, and under it, it says EST 1949.
2821.36 2832.36 speaker2  God damn it, I failed again. Would anybody make that assumption?
2830.36 2838.36 speaker1  Go ahead and lose one sanity. Horace, do you see these here tracks?
2837.36 2847.36 speaker2  You're looking at them.
2843.36 2853.36 speaker0  a year that does not exist as far as we know?
2850.36 2859.36 speaker2  and it's from 1849. Yeah, maybe you're right.
2856.36 2873.36 speaker0  And Jack looks a little unsure of himself at this point. I didn't sleep good last night after Dandelion's passing, but yeah.
2872.36 2891.36 speaker2  When can I see that? Cutting right back to Everett Pace. What are you up to?
2889.36 2900.36 speaker3  You can make a fine jelly out of any of this here.
2898.36 2913.36 speaker0  but it's still usable.
2911.36 2942.36 speaker2  Well, that is, I mean, you melt down hooves. It's just a 10.
2935.36 2948.36 speaker3  Everett Pace, you are just as uncaring and otherworldly as they say that you are in town.
2946.36 2978.36 speaker1  I must be going now. And she goes into her home and slams the door shut.
2973.36 3016.36 speaker2  Ephraim looks at him doing it and bends down and scoops up a little crushed up watermelon and eats it and kind of makes a funny face. And then he pulls his flask out and takes a couple gulps of it and then starts to pee on the side of the house. It wasn't like a malicious pee, it was just he had to go and this was what was there.
3014.36 3023.36 speaker1  Wasn't malicious.
3021.36 3025.36 speaker2  Oh, shit. Oh yeah, right?
3023.36 3039.36 speaker1  Delicious pees.
3037.36 3042.36 speaker2  That sweet pee.
3039.36 3055.36 speaker1  Sweet human oil.
3053.36 3067.36 speaker2  Sometimes. It's like extra virgin olive oil.
3065.36 3075.36 speaker0  I regret.
3070.36 3076.36 speaker2  Yeah, Ephraim takes his sweet piss on the lady's house and walks back.
3075.36 3108.36 speaker1  Oh boy.
3106.36 3153.36 speaker0  Like this here cow. If you want to look at it, I wouldn't recommend it personally because it hurt my brain when I did. I saw her out there and I run her off. Okay, because I had one of my horses get real messed up, similar to this, and I just needed to know if it happened to you two, we could put something together maybe.
3151.36 3156.36 speaker2  It was Dandelion.
3154.36 3189.36 speaker0  Beautiful, beautiful god damn horse.
3186.36 3251.36 speaker2  You think Miss Kitty did this? I don't know.
3246.36 3270.36 speaker0  Yeah, but I'm talking like speed and such and viciousness of the jaws.
