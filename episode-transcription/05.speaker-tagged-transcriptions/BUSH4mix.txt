0.00 17.84 speaker0  Well, how do you do, pupparoos? It's your grown-ass pup mother, Wolf the dog. And I am here to provide nourishment for your wittle ears.
14.04 115.98 speaker1  From 694.2 PTBP, maybe. The only radio station that can broadcast in multiple dimensions, probably. But what I'm rock solid for sure about is the fact that we got a new Howlin' with Wolf, everyone named Wolf's favorite segment. Nick with Everything's a Mimic, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod, which is, whoa, something you can do too, dear listener. So cool of you, wow. Nick with Everything's a Mimic writes, to shout out the actual play podcast, Everything's a Mimic, and our players, Ryan D, Ryan B, Chris, Cody, and Andy. Normally, this would also be the perfect time to shout out our website, Everything's a Mimic dot com. But now is just not that time, for I have seen the yellow sign. Its insignia dances carelessly and purposely in and out of the black void of our empty vessels like the ebb and flow of the ocean's embrace. The pallid mask seeks all who are willing, and, oh shit, I ran out of characters. tell me what an actual play is?
112.30 127.52 speaker0  Or do they imaginarily do things? Is an actual play like a real Shakespeare?
123.86 168.14 speaker1  One day, when I remember my AOL password, I'll get to get back on there and see what's poppin'. tag at PretendingPod on the internets. Or don't, what do I care? Though I will say it warms my producer's bones every time he sees kind words written about pretending to be people out there on the damn internet. So if you wanna positively impact my producer's day,
163.46 175.74 speaker0  The first part's a segue, and next it's the news.
172.26 248.14 speaker1  who somehow hasn't aged in three decades, seems to have been bitten by something that looks a bit like a tick. But it's got more than eight legs, and last I recall, ticks can't normally phase through matter, like if they wanted to get into Doreen Morreen's boot just by pullin' some kind of Hayden Christensen and Jumper nonsense. But this here is, indeed, some Jake Gyllenhaal crawlin' around with Danny DeVito while chasin' car crashes in his blue kinda stuff. The Chuckster hollowed for Agent Morreen to pour some of the potion out of the cauldron and into her boot, which she promptly did. on the unnaturally young boy's bruised and bloodied chest. The rash rippled like waves from the terrible epicenter, and the flushed bumps formed a target on the most recent victim's body.
243.14 285.90 speaker0  ["Circles of Death"] ["Circles of Death"]
282.74 288.58 speaker2  that I'm not allowed to see, but it's in my eye line.
286.82 294.30 speaker0  "'Don't look at my cards,"
292.62 315.10 speaker2  my mental decision to look at your cards, but physically, my body will turn towards your cards. Yeah, like guess what, bitch? Oh my God, I love God.
310.10 320.16 speaker3  ["In the Arms of the Angel"]
319.00 352.46 speaker2  Sarah McLachlan. All right, Ellie. I, uh. All right. I don't know if it's linked to your email, though. It might not be, nevermind.
350.12 381.48 speaker3  She's at the $6.66 level. at patreon.com slash pretending pod, and you can get all of our bonus audio content there, including full episodes of full Delta Green like home brew campaign that I ran for the boys, and you can have Taylor's phone call fully sound as your ringtone. Ring, ring. It's on.
379.80 389.56 speaker2  But I think Chuck's version of it would be like, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.
386.72 408.66 speaker3  All right, but Eleanor signed up at the much cooler $6.66 level, which is all the exact same rewards. It's just a cooler number. So far, so good.
407.60 419.08 speaker2  Right, right, right? No, I was never cool, but I was cold. My heart is dead. No, I'm kidding.
417.22 420.52 speaker3  I was a slut, to be honest.
419.52 451.92 speaker2  If you guys haven't figured it out, But I wasn't judged for it, which was great. Oh, that's great. I was fondling the D and the P all up in high school, but no one really judged me for it. Wait, what's the difference between the D and the P? One is a hole and one is like a thing that really shoves things into a hole.
450.36 456.48 speaker3  and the vagina to have sex? I get it. You shoving something in?
453.60 487.52 speaker2  No, no, the P stands for, okay, the P stands for pussy, pussy. I thought you were like, but that's the same damn thing. Yeah, you would also be like, that's when you find out I was lying. I stuck my vagina inside his penis.
486.68 491.04 speaker4  No, I didn't.
489.96 521.92 speaker2  That was a lot later. Pretending to be teen pregnant. You're like, Junie's actually 10 years old. I know she's just developing a little slower. Swedish babies take a little longer to cook. We're like elves, 3,000 years old, but it's like, oh, or baby Yoda. Spoilers.
520.12 524.28 speaker3  Yo, are you watching Boba Fett?
523.08 546.08 speaker2  when you become a parent, you have to basically choose your form of entertainment because you have 10 minutes a day, maybe. because I'm super into Western awful people, apparently. So that's who I like to watch.
544.36 562.02 speaker3  Hell yeah, that rules. I don't know what, I was just gonna talk about how Thundercat is the cameo in the last episode of Boba Fett and it made me so happy. He's a bass player who's fucking awesome. He's like-
558.50 572.78 speaker2  Thundercat, like the Thundercats, like the lion?
571.18 583.54 speaker3  which is a bop. Such a good song. He's such a cool guy.
578.54 587.58 speaker2  It's like kimono print boxers that are like silky.
583.78 597.10 speaker3  Dragon Ball Z embroidered logo on them. and he makes dope music and he's in Star Wars now.
594.36 622.38 speaker2  So he's my hero. Like he's a hired, to me, the clone's out of him.
618.94 639.86 speaker3  Live long and may the peace be on upon you. Give you peace as you sleep and may you know that the Lord, your God, loves you very, very much. That is what my parents said to me every night before I went to sleep and dreamed about demons. Let's go.
639.02 651.38 speaker2  So much to unpack. Oh shit.
648.34 689.46 speaker3  Raise your hand if you've spoken in tongues at this table. Yeah, that's two of us who acted like we were communicating with the other side and no one thought it was cool. It was like we were wearing khakis when we did it. Like it wasn't fucking rad, it was lame and it's also cool. I don't know, the church should lean into metal imagery and I'd be way more into it. I like a bit of chitchat, but I'm very interested to see what happens next and I have to know. So let's get into this.
685.38 714.58 speaker2  You're either gonna let my cool ass boot move work or Doreen, I guess, I don't know, loses a foot. I don't know what's happening. I do. Oh, unfortunately. I'll just take over from here. Okay, sounds good.
712.98 728.54 speaker3  outside of the game knowledge, just because it might be good to know this.
725.98 733.82 speaker2  Oh, that happens to me all the time.
731.94 742.38 speaker3  when Taylor's like, what did you just say? I say, I'm allowed to say stupid things.
741.06 771.70 speaker2  You're not allowed to divorce me because I say stupid things. Just because I'm an idiot doesn't mean you should love me any less. He blamed COVID quite a bit. Yeah. Apparently COVID makes you dumber. When I was pregnant, I blamed it all the time. I'm like, guys, it's the pregnancy brain, you know, it's the mom brain. And so every time I say something dumb, it's what I blame. I know. You're just stupid.
769.58 778.22 speaker3  and so previously I was like, it's just cause I'm high all the time. But apparently, no, it's not. So I-
776.66 782.86 speaker2  Oh wait, for dry January,
782.02 783.70 speaker3  Zach set rules.
782.86 788.90 speaker2  You're doing sober January.
787.14 801.50 speaker3  Until last night and I'm- How about that?
800.18 805.42 speaker2  I think January is over.
803.06 807.42 speaker3  It's February negative 11th.
806.58 814.18 speaker4  Yep. Amazing.
811.58 822.06 speaker2  Like it always gets treated so poorly. It's like you get 28 days and now minus 11.
819.54 827.26 speaker3  The 39 days of February.
826.42 845.06 speaker2  I drink a beer. God fucking scared.
841.90 861.66 speaker3  George Michael this situation and let's get into it. We were in dexterity order. It was during Marine's turn. Now it is Dr. Miller's turn.
857.74 868.38 speaker2  Okay, so just like a brief little thing, what was summary of what happened.
865.18 959.74 speaker3  Let's give a quick rundown of everything that happened in each of your introductions. No, I'm just kidding. So you guys got here, you got your hazmat suits on ready to go. They came out with the camera to shoot a Bush video. You told them, hey, I'm not here to be on camera until I know this shit is real. Let's get inside. As you get inside, you all see not the body of a Bigfoot, but rather the blues and bruddy body of a 12 year old boy who is just filled with bullet holes from a 12 gauge. And there's just blood everywhere pouring onto this tarp that he's laying on, which is on a pool table. and he's just begins weeping and weeping. Michael, his brother who disappeared at age 12, Carl and his dad both said that Bigfoot had abducted this boy. That's what they remember happening in their minds. That's how they must've explained it to themselves to try to explain it to other people. And so now everyone's kind of running around. Dr. Miller's looking at the body. Doreen Marine has grabbed this substance, this potion, if you will, that's in a tiny cauldron for some goddamn reason. And then she's pouring it into her boot because Charles, the Chuckster has screamed that she needs to pour this into her boot. Not knowing what's actually in this potion could just be acid that melts her entire fucking foot off.
957.78 966.26 speaker2  I mean, whatever you gotta do.
962.14 984.50 speaker3  this pharmaceutical remedy with a critical success while in the lab. Janice is on the ground underneath Charles, the Chuckster, who has just disarmed her and is keeping her.
983.66 989.14 speaker2  Absolutely.
985.06 994.42 speaker3  That's some genuine Chuckster moves right there.
990.54 1002.18 speaker2  I'm doing like a little lasso, fake lasso spin. Janice.
997.18 1038.14 speaker3  And Carl and Jerome are kind of in this weird back and forth where Carl keeps rolling fails on his sanity to kind of get upset, but Jerome keeps rolling really well to calm him down and they're fucking homies. And you can tell guys, as you're looking at the two of them, their bond seems to be unshakable. These two dudes have lived life together for the past three years. Honestly, it's cool to see men of this age being so emotionally full. yeah, it's hard to be a man in 2018.
1036.58 1043.62 speaker4  Woe is the white man. Yeah.
1041.66 1053.18 speaker3  Cause Ali's always calling me gay. Yeah, because being gay is so bad.
1052.34 1064.86 speaker4  Oh no.
1061.06 1071.50 speaker2  I prefer calling him weak, emotionally weak.
1069.54 1084.42 speaker3  I'm rubber, you're glue.
1081.70 1099.22 speaker2  What if you guys found out I'm super homophobic or something awesomely awful?
1098.38 1108.34 speaker0  on this podcast.
1105.82 1120.10 speaker3  with the rundown of what's happened so far. And I think that probably gave Dr. Miller enough time to figure out exactly what she's doing with this first turn of her round. What is that?
1118.22 1136.86 speaker2  I've been trying to, I've been trying to catch this little tick for the past 60 rounds. So I think if she can see it now, can she see it now? Can we all see it? Does she know that it went in the boot? It does not. Oh, it already went into the boot. Oh shit. Then.
1135.46 1143.62 speaker4  Oh, I'm sorry, fuck. I mean, you should have all assumed
1140.74 1157.94 speaker3  Yeah, you could maybe yell something in character right now for just the story to make sense, I guess, maybe a little bit.
1157.10 1167.38 speaker4  Okay. I don't know why.
1165.98 1169.42 speaker3  It's the alien bug in the boot.
1168.58 1176.38 speaker4  it's the alien bug in the boot.
1172.70 1195.42 speaker2  pouring the liquid into her boot and she's like, oh no. to get the boot off of Dr. Morin. I'm sorry, Dr. Morin. Morin, Doreen. You've been upgraded. You upgraded, yeah. You're a doctor now, we're all a doctor.
1194.58 1196.26 speaker3  I'm a doctor, you're a doctor.
1195.42 1199.58 speaker4  Oh right, med students.
1198.74 1202.92 speaker3  She says, doctor.
1202.08 1207.18 speaker2  Okay, doctor. Take your clothes off.
1205.62 1217.94 speaker4  Yeah, not those clothes.
1215.74 1235.14 speaker3  You don't know that it went in the boot. Jesus Christ.
1232.66 1256.88 speaker2  If it even is in the boot, you know. That's a good point. and tries to like, is it in the boot? Is it in the boot? And then she's panically trying to get the boot off and try to find this thing.
1254.62 1271.38 speaker3  so goddamn much that she took them off to put on the hazmat suit and then put the boots on over the bottoms of the hazmat suit, which is how she was able to pour this liquid down into the boots while still wearing the hazmat suit.
1270.06 1273.94 speaker4  It's still over my foot. Let's be clear about that.
1272.22 1285.04 speaker3  Yeah, oh, it's definitely still over your foot. And so Dr. Miller helps you remove the boot.
1282.06 1291.94 speaker4  Sick, where the fuck is it? Yes.
1289.26 1311.54 speaker3  and she's like, what, where's what? As she's being straddled by the truckster. Where's what, what are you guys talking about? And Jerome is like, wait, you said alien bug? The fuck is going on? What do you know? They're cool, it's cool, they're cool, you can tell them.
1309.42 1339.94 speaker2  on this poor boy over here, I have reason to believe that it used to be something that it's not anymore. And what we saw was a tick running away from it. And I can only assume tick tend to be only feeding off organic live material. If this boy has been dead for a while, as I understand, several decades, this doesn't make any sense. So we need to find this tick. So basically Dr. Miller reveals everything she heard in private.
1338.18 1340.98 speaker4  where, ticker, where, where, where.
1339.94 1349.90 speaker2  Sorry, that's how I get into character. Totally.
1346.14 1357.54 speaker4  This tick is like jumpy in time and space and like versus there and then it's there and then it's there and then guess what, what?
1356.70 1369.06 speaker2  Is that true? Then we can all be infected right now. All I'm saying is that's what I saw, dude.
1366.66 1373.90 speaker3  This is called helplessness. Jesus. You feel helpless and it's a ness. Super fail.
1373.06 1378.18 speaker4  11.
1376.02 1396.54 speaker2  78 on a 34. if this tick is in my hazmat suit right now.
1395.70 1494.86 speaker3  Critical success. You're able to keep your head very much on your shoulders and we'll go to Eleanor real quick for her sanity. Congratulations, zero sanity lost in this situation. You too will be able to act with a cutting edge movement. You too, the edge. Lindsay, because you critically succeeded on your sanity check, I am going to give you some information that nobody else can hear. Hey, Ally, maybe don't fucking put your fingers in your ears this time. They can go on the outside. Because you're clear and present in this situation, it's very, very apparent to you that underneath the hazmat suit, you've been bitten. You know the feeling when you like see a bug and then your skin starts to fucking crawl, like you think that they're on you? You feel that feeling all over your entire body. Because you critically succeeded on your sanity, I'm not gonna have your sanity again. So you're gonna be able to have your wits about you in this situation.
1492.74 1497.74 speaker4  Can I just chop that bad boy off?
1495.90 1529.66 speaker3  You can do whatever you would like to do. I'm gonna get them back. If that's your first instinct, there's definitely a hatchet on the wall. Like this is a barn slash camping, hunting. I mean, the mobile lab is probably a better option for cutting off your foot than the hatchet that you see on the wall. You would only know that because you critically succeed on the sanity. All right, so I'm gonna bring them back and then you can act. Yes? Yeah.
1528.50 1538.42 speaker2  Okay.
1534.78 1543.74 speaker4  Doreen just screams fuck and just runs outside to the mobile lab.
1542.74 1552.42 speaker2  Runs outside? Runs outside. Do you leave the door open? She left us.
1551.58 1560.86 speaker4  Yeah. She left us.
1560.02 1570.86 speaker0  Fuck. No, I don't think so.
1570.02 1574.82 speaker3  I don't think you saw a tick going towards Doreen.
1573.22 1579.38 speaker0  has been poured on a foot instead of where I intended for it to go.
1578.46 1588.42 speaker3  Hey, quick question. Doreen, did you leave the rest of the vial, the rest of the cauldron on the ground next to you?
1587.58 1603.02 speaker4  I said not all of it. Not all of it.
1601.38 1608.98 speaker0  I dive for the cauldron and grab it and I scoop the rest of it up in it and I'm on the ground scooping up the rest of the potion into the cauldron.
1608.14 1625.58 speaker3  Carl's going. No, he's on the other side of the pool table. So yeah, I mean, he's just across the pool table from you, I suppose. Still elbows, staring at the corpse of his younger brother who he fucking killed and having a hard time getting over it.
1623.94 1636.62 speaker0  It becomes clear to me pretty quickly that Carl's emotions are gonna hinder us in this process so I just throw
1633.94 1681.18 speaker3  Yeah, go ahead and roll athletics just to, I mean, I'll give you a plus 20 because he is completely still and this seems pretty easy but in order to get it enough of it. Oh, fuck. So it splashes all over the face of Carl Lambert and he's like, he'll just sleep real good for a bit.
1680.34 1683.70 speaker0  What's next?
1682.78 1704.10 speaker3  What is she doing?
1701.50 1706.22 speaker4  what my Google search results are.
1705.38 1718.06 speaker3  Yep. Google why this Bigfoot be tick now. Though. Though. Are you spelling though out or is it just a THS situation?
1716.26 1724.22 speaker4  Tick now though. Stupid.
1722.86 1728.94 speaker2  when you find a tick on yourself.
1725.98 1733.82 speaker3  Let's read off at least the first one.
1729.78 1739.66 speaker2  The third result is a song by big homie G called Tick.
1736.46 1747.62 speaker3  instead of looking up what to do with a tick bite which might've actually helped you in this situation.
1745.62 1758.42 speaker2  On a drink so I can't speak up, I won't take no disrespect from no ho.
1756.30 1775.50 speaker4  Not a tip like a light show. Gee, where you been? Hell if I know. I fucking hope. Pull up that skirt, skirt. Watching bitches stalk my bio. I can't go nowhere without my money or my iron.
1773.66 1798.18 speaker3  and this is just playing from his phone and he's just looking at it now. You fucking monster. Janice's turn and Janice is still under him. He is literally straddling Janice Ruth, an asthmatic older woman, and playing the song over his phone. It is fucking-
1795.90 1807.94 speaker2  because it says Johnny did these teeth. Whole lotta cheese for these VV's.
1807.10 1822.74 speaker4  Oh my God. This just turned into an episode of Righteous Gems.
1819.38 1829.86 speaker3  Oh my God, okay, it is Doreen Marine's turn. Oh no, I think you were extremely helpful.
1828.82 1832.34 speaker5  and I loved that.
1830.70 1839.58 speaker4  Thank you, so I'm helping the mission is what they all think?
1837.22 1855.10 speaker3  like it would not be out of the realm of Delta Green possibilities for the wavelengths like underneath a song played by a certain Google search would like pull up some sort of like spell like ability in the air of the situation but this is not one of those times.
1853.30 1859.98 speaker4  Can I roll, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1859.02 1884.50 speaker2  Cause hear me out. And also, so anyway, I think that I was on the special forces team of basic training.
1883.54 1891.18 speaker0  Oh my God.
1888.78 1902.22 speaker3  Your military science would tell you that the action that you've just taken is not helpful.
1899.82 1904.42 speaker4  What can I say here?
1902.22 1917.94 speaker3  Is there anything off limits to say? Let's have them take their headphones off. Yeah, and let's just get this over with.
1916.26 1935.38 speaker4  Okay, because I mean. You're doing this alone? Well, my actual brain wants to, I'm trying to channel Doreen, but I'm thinking like if I have full sanity during this, my first thought would be I'm gonna run out and grab tools to do this and come back. And come back, okay. And ask for help.
1934.46 1938.34 speaker3  Right, okay.
1935.38 1941.78 speaker4  Because if they know what's going on, it will help me. And if I'm fully sane. Totally.
1940.94 1971.14 speaker3  Yeah. The excruciating pain in your foot is growing as you feel the bones in your foot begin to shatter. I'm ready to get it off. All of the bones in your foot just shattered and your muscles are beginning to rip apart and reform. All the tendons are stretching out in your foot. You've never felt this much pain in your entire life. Roll sanity.
1969.10 1978.26 speaker4  Am I like hopping back into the? Ugh. No.
1977.14 1982.46 speaker5  99.
1980.98 1989.02 speaker4  Are you serious? Those dice are fucking cursed, dude.
1988.18 1997.10 speaker3  I know. On you realizing that you're about to turn into a goddamn Bigfoot. And you're by yourself.
1996.10 2005.94 speaker4  I'm by myself. I'm trying to get back, I tried to get back. I tried.
2002.10 2031.46 speaker3  Okay, so I'm gonna have you roll fight, flight or freeze in this situation. So I want you to rank them. You're gonna roll a D six, which is just the normal standard six sided dice that you would use in normal games. I say normal games like they're not lame. Okay, so here's what I want you to do. I want you to rank from most likely to least likely, fight, flight or freeze. So what is the most likely?
2029.54 2035.06 speaker4  Sorry, fight.
2034.06 2036.70 speaker3  rubbing their ears.
2035.06 2056.14 speaker4  They have no clue what's going on. No, I really can't hear anything. I can't, I can't. Okay, so I would definitely, my number one go to as Dorian would be fight. And then flight.
2055.02 2069.58 speaker3  Okay, so that's two and three. And then freeze. Is one, so roll a D six.
2067.62 2084.34 speaker4  I read it wrong, I read it wrong. It's a fancy dice, I couldn't see the thing.
2081.10 2167.30 speaker3  a set of tools next to her. She grabs a saw. on this stretcher that is meant for the Bigfoot corpse. And she cuts. The first one is not the hardest actually. It does seem worse until you hit a nerve. I mean, you just begin almost like violently coughing and choking and your stomach hurts. And if you have any food in your stomach, it's coming up and you're just sawing and sawing and you start crying. Tears are running down your face. Just like hit the bone and then boom, you're just sawing. Saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw until finally crack. This feeling is growing as it goes up into your ankle. And as those bones begin to shatter and the muscles begin to break, it helps you cut the rest of your foot off. Your entire foot is only hanging on by the skin that is on the back of your calf, as you finally have cut through your Achilles tendon.
2166.46 2180.02 speaker4  Yeah.
2175.02 2186.74 speaker3  And so I need you to roll a D six and then add two for how much hit points you lose.
2185.90 2187.58 speaker4  One.
2186.74 2203.72 speaker3  Wow, okay. So one plus two is three, you lose three hit points
2201.82 2209.82 speaker4  Whoa, hang on.
2208.54 2214.86 speaker3  Until someone comes out here, you're bleeding out one D four per round.
2211.98 2227.50 speaker4  Can I like scream as loud as possible for help? Yes. Okay. Do you need me to like scream? That was absolutely miserable. No, that was good. I'm leaving the room from now on for those. Yeah, sorry.
2225.98 2234.90 speaker3  I thought that that wouldn't take as long, but then some crazy fucking shit happened. So Mabi, oh, Ellie.
2233.82 2240.98 speaker4  She's on Pinterest. You on Pinterest, girl.
2240.14 2248.86 speaker2  It looks so funny. Oh, fuck yeah.
2245.78 2255.10 speaker3  all to roll alertness real quick for me just to kick off.
2253.50 2257.38 speaker2  Big fail for me too.
2255.10 2270.86 speaker3  Okay, Chuckster, you're the only one who hears just the slightest faintest, just like blood curling scream. Dr. Miller, it's your turn.
2270.02 2273.46 speaker4  Okay.
2272.38 2297.62 speaker2  Seeing that she said like, don't leave this house because we're all gonna die. She's very disappointed in her colleague, Dr. Marine. So she is going to take out a firearm from her hazmat suit and actually follow Doreen ready to threaten her to not leave and get back into the house. And so she's gonna run after Doreen.
2296.22 2311.30 speaker3  to the back of the van. So you can start off the next turn, opening up that door.
2308.46 2315.82 speaker4  I mean, I want Dr. Hooch to have some power. I just thought you were skipping.
2314.98 2334.82 speaker3  That's my bad. Jerome, where'd she go? Alien bug. Someone tell me what the fuck is going on here. I didn't know this shit was happening either. You've knocked him out. Do we need to... Janice, are you okay?
2333.14 2344.62 speaker2  I just need you to stay calm.
2342.18 2349.18 speaker4  Hey, Janice, you gonna be cool?
2346.58 2375.26 speaker3  She trusts Jerome dire enough to where she's like, okay, okay. And she's just gonna walk back over and go sit on the couch that's in the corner of the room. And she's just sitting there and she's just got her head in her hands and she starts weeping uncontrollably. What is the plan? What is happening? You've got two people gone already.
2373.10 2384.50 speaker0  I'm becoming suspicious of him. and I say, show me your fucking ID right now.
2382.74 2388.82 speaker3  I'm the one who brought you here. I don't trust you for shit.
2387.42 2396.22 speaker0  what's going on. What would my ID do?
2394.02 2399.18 speaker2  or like to see if he's doing anything that might be.
2397.90 2424.42 speaker3  Human intelligence. It's reading people. and questioning piece of shit. but he reaches back in his back pocket.
2422.82 2435.46 speaker0  Jesus Christ.
2433.54 2442.26 speaker5  Yeah, you take him right to the ground.
2437.26 2455.46 speaker3  And so fucking bang having banging black turtleneck wearing Dr. Hootch just like lunges over the pool table, over the corpse and just spears this dude into the ground.
2454.50 2458.58 speaker4  I'm saying, what do you know? What do you know?
2457.58 2462.26 speaker0  I don't know shit. What the fuck?
2460.58 2484.38 speaker3  There's an alien bug apparently and you're not doing anything to stop it. And it's Chuckster's turn.
2480.42 2491.98 speaker4  We gotta be helping each other take down this alien dick. Now I say we all go out there and check on our friend. Come on.
2490.86 2501.82 speaker0  because nobody else is. Everyone's just letting sheer chaos happen. So I'll just hold down the Fort in here. I'm still on top of Carl or Jerome, sorry.
2499.10 2504.98 speaker3  You're on top of the sleepy, sleepy Carl.
2503.02 2510.30 speaker4  I'm keeping control of this situation. Yeah, I'm gonna run after Dr. Miller.
2509.26 2514.10 speaker5  Yeah, I think that makes sense.
2511.82 2523.08 speaker3  Janice Ruth is crying on the couch. And Doreen, you've got a D4 to roll please. It's a pyramid.
2522.26 2527.18 speaker2  It's a little pyramid. This guy? Yeah.
2526.06 2535.92 speaker5  Three.
2533.38 2565.14 speaker3  The street lamp is shining down. It's the only thing. Snow begins falling. I think that's nice. Snow begins falling down through the street light. It's actually really, really beautiful. And as you- Starts playing as you open up the back doors of this sprinter van. And Lindsay, can you describe what she sees?
2560.14 2576.18 speaker4  and trying to put pressure on this nub of a leg. Could you demonstrate the screaming and the growling? Ugh. Something like that.
2575.34 2578.42 speaker2  Like big what?
2577.18 2582.98 speaker4  Big poop sounds. Yeah.
2580.56 2586.66 speaker2  I didn't understand before, but now I get the sound.
2585.06 2590.34 speaker3  and they make sounds like- Big poop sounds.
2589.18 2593.62 speaker2  Wait, wait, wait.
2592.78 2630.24 speaker3  On a nub. And you see her foot and ankle standing up on the stretcher next to her. She's like strapped her leg down onto the stretcher. Blood is pouring out between her fingers. She has no idea what to do. She is at less than half of her hit points. And so she is turning white in the face as she's crying and screaming and gurgling. And literally the foot that is next to her is transforming. So I need you to roll sanity real quick.
2627.86 2634.78 speaker2  Oh, Jesus Christ. Bigfoot foot.
2633.86 2639.78 speaker4  Point of a Bigfoot.
2634.78 2647.90 speaker2  Yeah, that's a big old 91 on 55 sanity.
2643.22 2650.88 speaker3  And so I'm going to have you roll a D4 and add one.
2650.06 2659.10 speaker2  Three plus one. So four.
2655.50 2715.94 speaker3  You lose your fucking shit because this foot, you would know as a medical doctor that you can see the bones, part of which is sticking out of this foot that's just sitting on this stretcher next to Doreen Marine. The bones are shattering and then seem to be reforming themselves as the tendon, the Achilles tendon that she's severed begins to stretch and grow out. Like all of these things are trying to grow. As they're shattering, you see the blood that's spreading out and all the blood is coming up to the surface in this foot. It's rapidly turning purple, as well as the blood that's hitting the air up top is finally oxidizing. So red is starting to pour over the top of all of these bruised and bloody foot and Doreen is bleeding the fuck out and with your sanity failure, you're not able to attempt to stop the bleeding this round. The Chuckster is running up behind you in this moment.
2713.66 2720.64 speaker2  I think Dr. Miller turns around and throws up.
2718.24 2754.38 speaker3  and I need you to roll a sanity as well. Okay. and begins throwing up. and this foot, her bloody situation, what do you do?
2752.14 2761.90 speaker4  is he's very astute and he puts things together really quickly as, yeah. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2759.86 2780.14 speaker2  Did not know that about Chuck at all. Yeah. and that if he shoots the leg,
2778.90 2785.48 speaker4  and maybe infect something else.
2783.10 2805.88 speaker2  and he notices a deep freeze. So he's gonna throw the foot in the deep freeze And then he says, not today Bigfoot foot. Yeah.
2804.48 2814.80 speaker3  Thank you so much. And Doreen, you continue to bleed out. Roll a D4. Yeah, sorry, Doreen.
2813.64 2824.48 speaker4  I'm gonna die.
2822.28 2836.64 speaker3  All right, you are down to two hit points now. You die. There's no death saving throws. There's no negative hit points.
2835.14 2843.30 speaker4  No potions can save me.
2839.72 2870.28 speaker3  if you do not fail a constitution check. So Doreen has two hit points. She is going into shock from blood loss. You have to pass a constitution check or you will fall unconscious and you will still lose a D4 from blood next round.
2869.20 2878.92 speaker4  She's like shaking.
2877.44 2911.24 speaker3  for a little bit longer. It's Dr. Miller's turn. He is just laying there and he lets his body go limp. He looks up at you and he says,
2909.16 2923.26 speaker0  but I'm just still kind of like pointing my gun in the general at this point? You are on top of Jerome
2919.12 2933.28 speaker3  like Carl is now snoring and he's face down, which is impressive. Like that he's still snoring face down. This guy, wow, what a body.
2932.28 2974.16 speaker0  What a goddamn mess. My team is outside. There's a fucking kid on the fucking table. I gotta destroy some of this evidence. So I'm still just kind of pointing a gun over in that area. I walk over to the cameras and can I roll computer science to just wipe all the cameras? Yeah. Nope, I'm wiping them. Oh my God. 83.
2970.04 2976.52 speaker5  do you want, I'm, this is, I'm good at, I'm good at this stuff.
2975.52 2982.32 speaker0  You're gonna have to prove it because you've done jack shit since we've gotten here.
2980.12 2994.40 speaker3  he's already finished clearing one camera, he took out the SD card from it and like steps on it.
2993.52 2998.32 speaker5  That was easy.
2997.24 3002.36 speaker0  I don't like you.
3000.52 3020.94 speaker5  Do you want to help me with the rest of these? I just point my gun back at her.
3019.82 3026.98 speaker0  I liked Jerome.
3024.58 3031.58 speaker5  Dr. Miller, you've already lost your sanity.
3028.86 3043.58 speaker3  You have to save this woman. If you can pass a first aid check,
3042.58 3058.94 speaker2  you guard that thing with your life. Pointing towards the ice bag that he put the foot in. And then she's going hurriedly trying to stop the bleeding.
3055.26 3065.58 speaker4  I'm doing the like surfer sign where you stick your thumb
3063.02 3078.94 speaker2  And Dr. Miller says, tubular bra. And rolls a 90 fucking five.
3077.50 3087.54 speaker4  Bye Doreen. Bye. Holy shit.
3086.10 3095.90 speaker2  And she's like, you're going to be all right. You're going to be all right. Okay. You have to survive. Just trust me. Trust me.
3091.98 3107.86 speaker3  And you just can't find the exact shit you're looking for. I don't know. I don't know. Like you're looking for gauze. You're looking for anything to like, to maybe burn the, you know, singe the flesh at the bottom
3105.26 3120.26 speaker5  to try to cauterize the wound, anything.
3117.06 3152.94 speaker2  And then continues to look at Doreen trying to be like, you're going to be fine, all right? You're going to be fine. Just trust me. Give me one moment. As she continues to look for things, fumbling like a fucking idiot.
3151.22 3222.74 speaker3  and Jerome is like, okay. So Dr. Hooch, you actually see on this laptop, you see some of the pictures that they took and it's the strangest thing. They're all blurry. It'll be like a picture of the two of them throwing up peace signs on either side of the pool table. There's this like incomprehensible blurry thing on the table. It's almost like there's some sort of cloaking that this creature might have that would make it so that no one could get like a clear picture of it, no matter how good the equipment was, no matter how hard they tried. It's almost like the pictures you've seen of Bigfoot in real life. Maybe that's why. Roll sanity. You're like, damn, I figured out Bigfoot. Fuck.
3220.94 3228.74 speaker0  that knows how to take a good damn picture?
3226.54 3235.94 speaker5  but it didn't, Jesus.
3233.46 3255.06 speaker0  frantically trying to see if there's one that's in focus. I just throw my hands up in the air. I'm so frustrated. Where's my fucking team? They all just ran outside. And I open up the front door and just look outside.
3253.90 3271.62 speaker4  Nice. Hell yeah. But like I could easily just pull it over, But instead I like rip it from the collar down. So it like still has like part of it. Like one sleeve is still on, but yeah,
3269.54 3280.34 speaker2  there's got a big patch in the front that's off.
3279.18 3296.82 speaker4  Not good odds, but. I pass! Doreen reaches up and gives him a little pat on the head.
3295.38 3314.78 speaker3  I mean, you're patting him on the head as he's wrapping this around. And you see Dr. Miller is still just frantically going out. I mean, just like throwing shit out of the cabinets all over behind her, trying to figure this out. You guys are almost like dodging shit that she's throwing out, being like,
3313.18 3320.30 speaker5  Why can't I find it?
3318.58 3366.42 speaker3  around the nub at the bottom. Okay, one of you guys. As you're patting his, I mean, roll a D4 please to see. You're able to stop the bleeding, which is the most important thing. And with three hit points back in your system, that takes you back up to five. And you're able to kind of stabilize your breathing. You're still extremely panicked. You're on the verge of throwing up at any moment. You're extremely pale. You've lost a lot of blood. You do not feel well, but you at least have someone who is your fucking savior now.
3364.38 3367.26 speaker4  You do remind me of my whippet.
3366.42 3373.82 speaker2  Ha ha ha.
3371.74 3388.86 speaker4  This might be too forward, but do you want to celebrate Christmas together? Ha ha ha.
3388.02 3390.54 speaker5  Yes.
3389.70 3450.86 speaker0  Yes. Yes. You don't know where you found it. In this heat, as your eyes fall short, you better learn how to keep it. Water leaks through your fingers. He is your king.
