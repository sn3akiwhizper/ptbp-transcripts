829.84 847.20 speaker2  It's not we recently had it at a game where these boys had to
845.20 860.20 speaker3  Yeah for some first-timers
855.64 901.30 speaker2  I know this is an audio podcast and you rely on me to tell you What you are seeing visually to think about in your head Google red sands
897.34 925.72 speaker3  Inspiration it's sort of like the saying the thing that could became Sealand aloft above an ocean Yeah dilapidated basically
921.34 1019.42 speaker2  What I'm picturing as you guys are poking your heads out of this Door of this hatch that kind of opens out down you see a ladder looking down on this boat about 10 yards below This bay boat made out of this the same familiar inky black yet Unnaturally colorful material that also makes up the sky you see the two men standing on this craft One is a short stout man in his latter years a thick white beard Makes his round face look even rounder and the bags under his eyes are large and fluffy He's wearing a dark navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy Overalls and the other man is John Lee Pettymore the fourth's uncle Don D. Pettymore as you all poke your heads out of this hatch We can see from the outside that you are in this kind of this Lofted room that is made out of the similar inky black yet colorful substance that is on stilts It is like a stilted room that the still legs then go down into this shimmering silver sea Cuz you haven't rolled sanity since you arrived wherever you are now and I do think that that was a third whoopsie so we're
1013.94 1064.94 speaker3  Lost I don't know if that's a whoopsie cuz this just happened What were we like? But it is the inverse of a passing score. It's 32 instead of 23. So does that get me anything? And
1062.74 1209.46 speaker2  Luke I heard you say that you failed, right? that puts me at 11 and Clark Bishop with losing five sanity all in one go at the sight of all this. I'm gonna need a fight Or freeze from yeah Go ahead and roll a d6 for me It's a two, okay, that's gonna be run away run away Clark Bishop has not yet made it down this ladder as you're all looking out this door and He is looking for a place to run. He looks down at the ladder He sees the boat down below with two men one of whom he vaguely He opens up the other hatch in the room across the room from the hatch that is currently open He slams the lever into the up position Alertness or search from sorry Justin Okay, good, thank you I needed that Luke and Thomas give me a search or alertness and Thomas because you're looking at your uncle right now I'm not gonna put you at a negative 20 because you really wanted to go through that door
1204.38 1274.16 speaker3  It's cool to see you and all but weird things are happening all the time around here right now and Frankly, you know, I learned I could distrust as many elder members of my family as I could trust so who knows if you're just gonna try to rope me into some shitty con or You're gonna make me wait in the car for hours while you just get drunk in some bar a lot of bars. Yeah What's through that other door? I really do no offense to Uncle Don Wait, hold up But if that's true I pictured me wily coyoting my way out that door
1271.20 1281.92 speaker2  So Clark Bishop is gone Joe take off your headphones
1274.72 1350.18 speaker3  Keith Joe who the fuck is Joe John Keith John Justin looking down you see the two men Don you'll do the plat thing and introduce Keith to that stranger I'm gonna go poke my head through this other door real quick just to be sure I don't we'll probably just be in like, you know some kind of endless torture for the rest of you know So I'm not wondering the whole time, you know For the next thousand lifetimes or whatever the fuck until we get back to here So I'm gonna poke my head through that door and I will be right back. Okay, be careful
1345.90 1585.30 speaker2  Just squealing away in pain and you walk over to the other hatch Have you seen the door what door and he turns back and he looks at dawn this extremely colorful You can see that adjacent So basically the the room above you that is about 10 yards up its square it has four walls, uh, There seems to be a bridge and you're just now seeing it for the first time as you look up There is sort of a rope bridge that is also Unsurprisingly It leads across to a second Stilted room. So there's another Identical stilted room that is attached with a rope bridge. That's cool
1582.64 1600.70 speaker3  Yeah, nice Luke roll sanity
1592.18 1656.00 speaker2  Okay, you just lose one. So now you have 10 as you realize the other hatch in the room above you is across from the hatch the two hatches are on opposite sides of the room and yet the rope bridge is Coming from the adjacent wall not the wall that is parallel
1654.00 1667.70 speaker3  Nice view
1663.14 1700.62 speaker0  No, I'm continuing along
1698.62 1867.18 speaker2  When you come starts to fall All right, you guys ready? Another one of these similar rooms except this one does not have nearly as much junk in it as the last and as you bust In really the only things you see in here are a hatch in front of you and Two figures Oh, dr. Marie Jacobs is an older plump woman with mascara smeared all over her entire face Her hair is a disaster and she is wearing white coveralls and long Neoprene gloves she is in the exact same State that you saw her when she was locked up in the contention police department except for the last time you saw her in the contention police department was on tape when you saw her body being lifted and then slammed repeatedly into the ground so you do notice the matted blood caked all over the back of her head and She is laying on the ground next to the body of Doug Jacobs With dried blood all filling his broken nose He's still wearing that same pair of novelty boxer briefs Featuring Pepe Le Pew and he has a black collar around his neck. He too has bruises all over him and blood coming out the back of His head they are cuddling while laying on the ground Looking straight up into the sky above you there is no that is so colorful shining down on you and Giving you peace while you sleep man You actually bump into the back of John Lee Kevin Moore the third from behind somehow and the two of you fall Kind of into the same room that has nothing in it except for dr. Marie Jacobs and Doug Jacobs
1864.94 1888.98 speaker3  Clark I thought you were in front of me
1885.10 1920.98 speaker2  You go through it. You run through the same room again. Both of you are all sanity
1918.98 1970.54 speaker3  It's just a loop thing a loop Fucking dawn. I think I owe money or something. It's been a while He's one of these one of those ones where it's like oh you're spending the day with Uncle Don and then it's like spending the Day with Uncle Don was four hours in a hot car and then Uncle Don driving you home drunk. I
1965.78 1988.66 speaker0  He's actually Salem her cat remember the radio switch that the Doug Jacobs and the cat
1980.94 2003.42 speaker2  They're just staring up into the endless ness above them and you as she kind of looks over and catches your eye Oh
1997.90 2008.94 speaker3  I was just asking for the benefit of folks who might not have ever heard any kind of recap about this sort of story
2005.66 2030.48 speaker2  absolute total fucking pieces of garbage If we wouldn't have been locked up we wouldn't be here
2027.00 2068.16 speaker3  But if you are admitting right now to being in love with your cat Even though he's in the body of that man. That is a crime. I am so sorry You see I love my friends. I love my partner Thank you, I
2064.12 2079.78 speaker0  There I we don't know that there's a crime here, but it doesn't feel like it's
2075.48 2216.20 speaker3  But ma'am once again like while I understand the appeal of having a cat NFC being reached with that body that I don't think is appropriate Either for the original owner of that body the cat's mind. That's now in it Or This this is yucky It just seems like it's coming from the wrong angle. It's not making me comfortable at all good In a normal time you Michael borrowed it Really just sounded like you got cut right off. So
2214.20 2244.60 speaker2  Is to annoy you
2238.20 2288.66 speaker3  Why do you think I'm applying that and then she implies it more and I don't care about rolling around with your big cat, man That sounds enjoyable and adorable. I Just don't don't fuck the cat man. Don't I Scratch his ears, you know lick his hair. All right, whatever
2285.06 2298.54 speaker2  It seems like that's all you want to think about to be fair
2295.62 2316.64 speaker3  So I'm not just gonna get in little word games with you where you're like Oh, you're the one who wants to fuck cat cuz you're the one fucking this cat apparently
2314.64 2338.76 speaker2  That note I think I'm gonna switch back over
2335.12 2371.88 speaker3  Like I literally just want to be like if she can engage with me on a real level
2364.36 2376.14 speaker2  Is the same inky dark substance that is extremely colorful at the same time. It's like dripping down from my eyes
2371.88 2379.96 speaker3  Oh, yeah, do I look really fucking goth and badass? You look so
2377.32 2393.84 speaker2  Cool, you're also in like Kevin's body
2391.84 2418.10 speaker3  Oh my god he was So Sam Elliott in Roadhouse but in like an amazing and possibly like multi-fluorescent goth makeup just like Streaming down his face Clark recoils John John your face
2412.60 2436.74 speaker2  But you didn't know and it wasn't there at all because when you look into someone's face you see What you know their face to be right you don't really see what they look like, you know, you see who they are
2429.22 2466.74 speaker0  It's it. I don't know. It's maybe it's maybe it's all maybe it's always been there. I don't I just never noticed that
2464.22 2491.86 speaker3  That doesn't doesn't hurt
2486.58 2535.34 speaker0  It doesn't startle me the way I thought that it should I'm at this place. It's uh You're here like a you're like a part of it, I don't understand John but it's
2533.34 2535.34 speaker1  What You
