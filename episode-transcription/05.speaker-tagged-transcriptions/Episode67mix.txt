0.00 68.66 speaker0  Hey y'all, just in case y'all forgot, it is indeed 26 years ago, and for some reason, my voice can transmit to the past, from the present, and speaking of the present, y'all know I am here to bestow my vocal gifts upon all of y'all, no matter the when. Live from 694.2 PTBP, time traveling dogs named Wolf can be scary, but what is not scary is howling with Wolf, a segment I am definitely not forced to do against my will by my amorphous producer who may or may not possess ownership over my soul. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from At Perfect Us Nemo, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

323.66 375.18 speaker1  you he would act like if you asked him to he would probably kill me oh i don't know
370.34 418.98 speaker2  my parents were like yeah we thought it was going to be a stupid action movie and it was a good guy richie it was yeah it was without some stinkers yeah yeah well it was not a
412.50 622.36 speaker3  meeting room is wearing a white dress shirt gray slacks and black shoes there are six chairs and a half circle all facing a single chair that this man stands in front of as you feel an uneasiness in your balance as this room is tilted a bit toward the chair that is alone on the other side and you all sit down in this half circle and he sits down course i want to start by introducing myself and telling you a little bit about this place we obviously as you know uh specialize in taking people who need to focus on something and get that focus either a little bit more accurate or there at all some people need to be forced all the way in so uh we're just here to help you achieve whatever desires you may be heading toward we can help you with that goal and i just think the group session is the best way to start any of these sort of weekend events so if everyone could go around and introduce themselves i think that would be absolutely fantastic well i am angela fairfield and i'm here with my husband raj hey hey there hey there folks and we're here to really focus on like moving forward in our marriage and making this thing last and and really like we both care so much about each other that i think that we're going to the others okay well uh let's uh jump in here uh i like to play two truths and a lie to get things started so basically how this works is we'll go around the half circle here and everyone will say three statements two of which are true and one of which is a lie and after you say the three statements we'll each go around and ask a question about the three statements to try to determine which one the lie is right so we'll ask a question you'll have to answer it and then we can all kind of gauge who each other are and how we react to help with these group sessions moving along we really want there to be an air of openness and vulnerability and so we think the best way to do that is to have you all know each
615.60 632.86 speaker2  other why lie in the background i ask alan what is openness it's just a willingness to
627.44 664.70 speaker3  is the tall lead man wearing the charcoal suit who is there with the 16 year old walter can probably explain to you their father-son dynamic more than i could but let's go ahead and start with uh charles digby down there you got two treats in the life for me sir

1352.98 1437.38 speaker2  but just to be sure i want to kick them in the hip not like hard i want to like knock them over result of my behavior is he on the ground as bradley's foot comes up to my hip i grab it that'll grab it but his foot is moving too fast he hits me in the hip and pushes me over like three inches
1432.98 1504.74 speaker3  about touching people earlier it's mostly a physical thing that i'm talking about right now so if we want to not do that from here on moving forward otherwise i'm gonna have to
1498.26 1649.46 speaker2  against what i believe in what do you believe in well many things but that's not the point of this have to ask my father that i did not i've not asked that question but i i think that is beside

1824.82 1857.22 speaker1  hand on uh luke's shoulder my name is walter
1851.70 1929.38 speaker3  and physical activity during our group sessions and the whole weekend here sorry i've been i'm so the four of you you're being led around the property of calm comfy campground by ones that you're going to and uh he's got your your accoutrement and everything already at your sights around here and he points up as the sun is going down and he's like look at that sunset and you just see the sun is going down behind these mountains off in the distance and on this side of that sunset is just trees for as far as you can see up until this lake hold on hold on i'm sorry
1924.34 1976.98 speaker1  i've got to take this and uh bradley waters off from the group on his cell phone that'll happen me uh eavesdrop on his side of the conversation but from the group like i'm just gonna stop paying attention to james and try and hear what he's saying on his side of his phone yeah for sure
1970.42 2116.50 speaker3  been uh given to us here and we've got you know all these uh trees on the island really gives for some good oxygen around these parts it's quite nice you can smell that smell and uh we got this beautiful lake here and you look out over lake calm and it is black it is a completely dark water lake is that a thing it is an ominous uh short fiction yeah and he's leading you to the two-story boat house on the north side of the island before we head to individual places for the weekend but uh heading down here is the boat house and we've got our boat man down here mr russell and he's a good guy i'll get you to meet him and he'll give you the rundown on how to use these canoes if you want to take a little solace time out on the water and he
2111.94 2175.14 speaker2  called a uh this is a walkway i think it's called a little i don't think it's anything weird it's
2169.78 2521.94 speaker3  there are pillars coming down and there are spots for canoes that are floating in the water i'm in the wrong google doc you sure you're not still on the floating walkway walking down some stairs on the side of the apartment down to greet you he's a short stout man in his later years and as you approach you see that he's got a thick white beard that makes his round face look even rounder the bags under his eyes are large and fluffy and he's care of all your canoe needs i'm gonna head on back so after you wrap up here and get all your information you can go back onto your cottages or feel free to roam the grounds and he takes off back down the large flaky flock and walk a flock of lake and he walks back and he's gone roger you know come down come close you know get around here we got six canoes right and so there's enough for everyone to take them out whenever you need them you're gonna want to go ahead and grab a life jacket there's life jackets right over here and he points at a bin it's got a bunch of life jackets in it you're all seemingly adults he looks at you walter he's like except for you how old are you be required to take out life jackets in the canoes with you and you head on out but you don't have to wear them except for i'm guessing you if you're under 18 you might want to have that on for the you're never gonna go out by yourself in a canoe if you go out by yourself in a canoe you're gonna have a bad time we always say stick to two in a canoe right so you gotta have two people in the right now these waters these waters out here you look at them they're very calm right but as such a dis to its face i say dis all the time it's one of my favorite words i mean it's hypothetically and so the water right it's it's mean at times right because the water is the most powerful thing that exists on this realm outside maybe i'm just floating and all of this is some sort of mental reaction to everything
2515.54 2543.70 speaker1  that yes i would also posit that water would still be powerful up there in fact maybe more so you could use it to stay alive or to push off of something if you needed to you could
2535.78 2549.54 speaker2  in the sky there is water as well so i think that just adds to what you are talking about you guys
2543.70 2670.50 speaker3  are all really validating me at this time and i appreciate it you know it's not too many times that we get people who are not so raw and ready at the beginning of the weekend you know some people are a bit meft in the head so it's nice that you guys are all taking a group mentality to try to validate each other's existences and thoughts and i really appreciate that so does now i grew it over the summer it's nice though to have a bit of protection from all this wind and you know if you happen to get into water it's nice to have it and you know not you just sort of around this area right so it's just circles on circles so we got a circular island with a
2663.86 2688.58 speaker1  just over and over repeatedly just thrusting thrusting thrusting there's water at the bottom
2681.70 2724.34 speaker3  so we got is it but specifically like is my boat that one no or or take out any of them that you young sprightly man it's gonna be right over there and he points to this spot that the shoreline has clearly even from this distance you can tell canoes have like entered this shoreline and left a bunch of divots up there and he's like right there that's a good trail that's the best trail
2718.74 2771.62 speaker1  side except for the walkways you know from the cottages back up to big house charles digby takes this time to pull out a little notepad that he always keeps with him to take notes and looking at the like creepy almost obsidian like water he starts like jotting down notes for ideas i love it choice for you yeah it might have something to do with something gotta keep an eye on this one
2766.42 2823.14 speaker2  effect yeah kid i'm not paying attention i'm looking back down on my feet again kid are you
2816.10 2955.62 speaker3  unless anyone has any more questions about the water the canoes or how to get from here to there on this cold water but just remember what do we remember always have a life jacket for each that's why we always stick to bit of quiet i got these and he points up at the wall and there's some like noise canceling like gear that you would wear if you were doing construction or something like that if you ever want to have a bit of peace and quiet you know i'll just put that in and read if that'll thought you're gonna say on the trails and no there aren't but there are my question is could
2948.42 2972.58 speaker2  i have never been fishing before but i've heard about it is it possible to go fishing in this no no fish in the lake they stocked all these lakes back in the day when they first dammed i think
