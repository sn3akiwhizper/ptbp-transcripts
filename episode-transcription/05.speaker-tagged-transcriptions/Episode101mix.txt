0.00 106.56 speaker0  What is happening my students? It's your professor of wolf studies, Wolf, the dog. And I'm here to lecture you about the various bones that wolves like me possess. How much cream is in the body? How much grease the fur retains? You know, college stuff. And I am teaching it you live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio show that delves into factual things regarding wolf the dog biology, my babies. Speaking of knowledge, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf. This episode's Howlin' with Wolf was sent by Derek from the RGV, the Rio Grande Valley. They write, howdy y'all. Big shout out from South Texas to all the PTBP peeps near and far. Can't wait to get back to the boys in contention. And finally get to the bottom of this mystery. Don't get me wrong, all this timey wimey stuff is fun and all, but boy howdy does it give me a headache. If only there was a handy dandy recap that retold these events in a succinct but thorough fashion. Anyways, stay safe out there. Lots of love to the PTBP crew and a big eye woo to wolf the dog. Thanks for writing in Derek from the Rio Grande Valley. I hope one day to visit this mystical Texas that I've heard so much about. It sounds like a place that a wolf really could lay down a garbage nest to lay many eggs in.

There's some Q and A's, there's some really silly one shots and 10 of the episodes tied together in an ongoing story that has featured 11 different agents due to the brutal approach Zach has leaned into this more delta greenie, delta green campaign. All of which is homebrew except You know where I'm heading, it's time for the news. Last time, our three leading men came to And every single name on their bodies has been crossed out. After Keith revealed he went back in time, became Silas Cole and invented ball. Well, John got real angsty and poured out some pent up daddy issues while in his dad's body. The trio called an Uber and headed off to contention to confront Maggie Cook. But the driver Spud in his vintage Volkswagen van couldn't evade the goo-nami that first consumed the bodies of Councilwoman Carrie Pages and Salem the cat atop a familiar four wheeler with an odd radio on the back before it eventually swallowed our narratively central characters as well.

300.92 357.96 speaker2  before we start on like a new story and people might be like listening to it for the first time. We only have so many intros where people have already listened to like a hundred episodes of this probably if they're listening to this. So we can say some pretty messed up stuff and they'll keep listening. So I looked up on Quora what are the most inappropriate questions to ask people. So Joe, are you pregnant? Yes. Luke, are you wearing a wig? Yes. I have a legitimate question though.
353.92 368.28 speaker3  Why on earth would I do that? Here's the deal. I have over 500 orchids and not one of them will get anyone high.
365.04 380.38 speaker2  So the other day you posted a thing on Instagram. You were like my favorite corner of the house. it was a picture of plants, but they're all mine.
379.54 385.38 speaker3  I did not.
380.38 399.90 speaker2  That's stolen valor and I'd like an apology. did I say that they were mine.
396.14 408.02 speaker3  this is the best corner of the living room, which is true. I did not say these are mine. So I'm not apologizing.
404.70 412.10 speaker2  Plant emoji and then a colon and then tag. Not going to happen.
409.26 433.38 speaker3  I'm going to comment on there right now. These are all mine.
430.38 462.38 speaker2  Were you in jail because you murdered someone? Some's one, but yes. Adam's cane. That's the deal. I got some orchids. You got some orchids. I got some orchids. I got some orchids.
461.38 465.38 speaker3  Oh, you got some? I got some orchids, but I got some orchids. You got some orchids.
464.38 489.38 speaker2  That's the deal. That's the other deal. Luke takes care of them all. Luke, I watered your orchids yesterday. You're welcome. Luke does have two orchids. That's what he calls his penis.
484.38 505.38 speaker3  I was in jail because I put my orchids in a bong and smoked it. Should we start the episode or should we talk about cat suck house?
500.38 628.38 speaker2  cannot quite comprehend while at the same time completely dark. The nothingness is endless and you feel content physically. and above you in the direction you're weightlessly falling is nothing but the complete absence of light. Somehow both a maelstrom of overstimulation and a wholly empty void. Completely warped, completely confused. You see that John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth has rolled himself up into a ball and he is floating up alongside with you as is. Do they see that? Are you rolled up like a ball? I thought we couldn't see anything. Oh you can't but you can clearly see each other. That's a thing. You can't see anything but you are all seeing each other as well as this weird light around you that is the most colorful thing you've ever seen, hues you've never experienced and it's also completely pitch dark. And you're all there. And you're falling upward. Endlessly. And who else is there but Spud? This is where I should say shout out to Bip from Hebo, Oregon. For giving us Reginald. You cut out a little bit when you said your name. Arthur McKenzie. I also did not hear the name again.
627.38 630.38 speaker3  Wow.
629.38 644.38 speaker2  They're a small town Bip. It's not even a town, it's an unincorporated census designated place. In Tillamook County.
641.38 650.38 speaker3  There's definitely something, this is where crazy shit would happen.
649.38 662.38 speaker2  Now he's saying it. So haunted Air Force base. I wonder why it closed.
660.38 666.38 speaker3  I wonder why it closed.
662.38 712.38 speaker2  Find out on the next arc of our Patreon Delta Green game. Sure. down? No, do you guys want to sing what I sing? Thank you. And then I go around and I tell them each good job with their name and I give them a high five and a low five. So as you guys are literally falling upwards.
707.38 720.38 speaker3  Keith is kind of content because he knows it's not actually happening to him.
716.38 724.38 speaker1  Am I able to get closer to anybody in any way?
720.38 810.38 speaker2  Oh yeah, and like the minute you get closer you're super far away from them and then you're right next to them. It's all kind of happening at the same time. You're very much moving wherever you want to and further away. his body, not to mention the time and spatial anomalies means John Lee Pettymore just barfs It's the ooze that's coming out of John Lee Kevin Moore, the thirst mouth as he vomits, but the ooze is like lighting up with sparks of this unnatural color that is just like abreasting your eyes. You have no idea how to handle this and your brain is essentially just like fucking melting because it is just a complete overstimulation and at the same time physically you feel more calm than you ever have in your life, maybe next to the time that you were commanded to feel calm by that giant, gaunt, translucent skinned man. He says as he floats in and out of your view simultaneously.
808.38 819.38 speaker1  Hey, hey man.
815.38 822.38 speaker2  brought this character with you into the next part of the story.
821.38 826.38 speaker1  Fuck. Is he laughing like that? Yeah. Is he feeling good about it?
825.38 1095.38 speaker2  Shit. Yeah, dude. Oh, man. Why are you saying he though? It's weird, man. Is he feeling weird about it? And he points at you and as he's pointing at you, you see that he's pointing at Keith and he's pointing at John at the same time and he's kind of pointing at himself with four fingers because that's what happens when you point a finger and he's like, dude, And as your hand reaches out, there's like a trail behind it of this color, like a like tracer, like on the back of a bullet in a video game or something. I don't know if that happens in real life. I've never seen a bullet moving or not moving. And as your hand moves, it's just like this crazy color scheme is just like failing behind it. Like you just won solitaire. Yeah. Is that what's doing it? You all see a series of scenes play out around you, the subjects in settings, like a hologram made of the same unnatural light. Two coffins are closed up in front of the lectern with pictures of the deceased burn victims on either side. Adam Cain's parents looked happy in their wedding photo, but somehow even more joyful in a JCPenney photo shoot with a smiling, toothless baby Adam Cain. The orphaned boy with black eyes and a balloon head sneaks slowly out of a conversation with extended relatives before running quickly for a closet door. He does not, however, find the solace he seeks. Rather, he finds himself in this small, dark space cluttered with old hymnals and extra candles, one of which is lit. He is not much older than he is here in this vacuum seemingly outside both time and space. Clark reaches out and tucks a note into the inside pocket of Adam Cain's blazer previously only worn on Easter and Christmas Sunday. The closet suddenly goes dark. The balloon-headed boy pulls the metal chain attached to the singular bulb above and finds himself alone with the spare songbooks and vigil lights. He pulls out the note, unfolds it, and you all see a list of directions. Underlined at the top is the sentence, one day, years from now, it will be imperative that you replace Keith Vigna as Silas Cole, the founder of contention. Step one outlines where to find and how to use the strange helmet Cain eventually bought at Forgotten Treasures. Step two includes an incantation that claims to change the shape of water. Step three discusses the properties of the ooze and its relationship with fish and fish-filled water. Finally, at the bottom, it simply reads, I'm real sorry about your family. That's crazy. obviously it won the awards it won because of that. And I think if you mess with that formula, it's just not going to be the same. The set design was just delightful. Literally, John Lee, Kevin Moore III, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna, seemingly as well as this other man, Spud, witnessed this.
1094.38 1100.38 speaker1  that's happening internally with us?
1097.38 1122.38 speaker2  You can kind of see each other through and around it as well. Bifrost? Yeah. Where did you just let slip out?
1121.38 1125.38 speaker1  It's a Thor thing. The bifrost is how they get around. Damn it.
1124.38 1130.38 speaker3  It's a nerd.
1128.38 1291.38 speaker2  It's Norse mythology. Wait, it's actually real? It's called bifroast? Beef roast. at this letter that says, I'm real sorry about your family. The letters of the word family morph into the city skyline, but an out of place, massive circle is moving quickly up toward the top of one of the tallest buildings. Your view approaches in time to catch planet juggernaut with its two wild eyed partners in tow, fling itself from the towering high rise, reach out with its powerful hands and slam two helicopters together like a kid playing recklessly with sturdy toys. Instantly, this wily child dons a helicopter hat as blades begin chopping the air above the gigantic ball that lifts into the sky and slowly disappears into the horizon. Your view zooms into the distance until it is engulfed in an ivory endlessness before the experienced hand of one Vanna White touches it gently and a letter appears. You all see John Lee Kevinmore, the third laying lazily, lying lazily on Clark's couch, absolutely crushing wheel of fortune. And then in the distance, fast approaching, you hear the whir of helicopter blades as something massive and round blocks out the sun that previously poured into the windows of the Bishop house. like multiple versions of your hand are seen moving through it and the color displaces and replaces and it's next to you. It's behind you. It's through you.
1286.38 1305.38 speaker3  If you looked over at him, you would see John weeping, but it does seem like big, warm,
1304.38 1331.38 speaker2  That's a good one. And he's like looking at both of you as, as this happens. He's like, what the fuck?
1327.38 1347.38 speaker1  I think it is an us that was, it's not now we're, we're here, right? And I try and touch somebody, whoever's nearest. Can I put, can I make contact with someone?
1345.38 1351.38 speaker2  completely, but it's also very real.
1349.38 1362.38 speaker1  It is, but it's not. And then at the same time is.
1360.38 1377.38 speaker3  Spud. Yeah. Here's a line reading of me saying velvety. Velvety?
1376.38 1385.38 speaker2  Punch that in. What did you say? Experienced hand.
1383.38 1412.38 speaker1  Shut the fuck up.
1411.38 1414.38 speaker3  Oh man.
1413.38 1434.38 speaker1  Oh fuck.
1430.38 1469.38 speaker3  No, I'm at like physically the location of where he is. So far. Where does it say we are though? Fuck yeah. Guys, what do I look like? I look at him.
1464.38 1487.38 speaker2  He's wearing stupid shorts and a stupid shirt and he looks like his stupid fucking self. that you've seen so many times and a light begins beaming out of your face.
1486.38 1496.38 speaker1  What do I look like? And I start feeling my own head. You look like you. What do I look like in Keith's magic phone?
1495.38 1498.38 speaker3  You don't see anything.
1496.38 1522.38 speaker2  He peers deeply, yeah.
1519.38 1528.38 speaker3  What?
1526.38 1625.38 speaker2  That's nuts. Sometimes I just like stand in the mirror and stare for as long as I can until my eyes are the only thing I can really see and the rest just kind of fades away. And then I slowly move my head back and forth from side to side but try to keep my eyes in like the same spot. lit subterranean laboratory. Keith Vigna stands on the outside wearing clothes that fit in around 1880-something and jots in a notebook as he looks through a porthole where you all see Tildy B. Mitchell's body convulsing on the floor. Her leg is stabbing into the cement ground rhythmically as it turns into a piece of machinery on a beautiful sunny day at the Contention Mining Company. As Keith Beans walks past his workers and into his office, he's met with hearty greetings. Good day, boss. How do you do, sir? Take care, Mr. Cole. You watch as the physique changes around the mouth making the greeting and see a rotund, sweat-covered man finish the previous thought like a before and after on Wheel of Fortune as he says,
1624.38 1629.38 speaker3  Fucking impeccable.
1627.38 1632.38 speaker1  That's a professional artist right there.
1631.38 1640.38 speaker3  It hurts. Did you hear that? Oh, my God. Some of it came back out. It was so gurgly.
1637.38 1648.38 speaker1  I literally had spindrift in my mouth on that burp. Oh, God.
1647.38 1680.38 speaker2  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1678.38 1696.38 speaker3  I mean, not that stuff isn't happening, but I'm waiting for, like, to be able to do something.
1695.38 1698.38 speaker2  Nah.
1696.38 1704.38 speaker3  This is crazy.
1701.38 1713.38 speaker1  So, wait, is the Silas Cole flashback, it ends with Ephraim saying that? That's the end of that? Nope, I'm in the middle of it. That's what I thought.
1711.38 1877.38 speaker2  I mean, we've all been, we've all been real silly, but Judge Ephraim Courtland was anything but. This meeting he had called was about to decide if they, the elders of contention, should hire this roaming cowboy, Cornelius Beans, to dispose of their town's paranoid figurehead. The judge excused himself to fetch this mercenary for hire who just happened to be in town for the day, and Cornelius Beans later entered the secret meeting to spit and shake on the deal. The handshake transforms into a live hand grasping the cold, limp grip of a body that drapes like a frequently worn sweater in a closet. This closet, however, is down in a crawl space six feet deep with dirt floors. It smells heavily like rich earth and cedar, and there are rows of other long hanging cadavers suspended from the supports. A small metal ball with long metal tendrils excuses itself from the beans-dubbed cowboy shell it inhabited and enters its familiar host, known to the town of contention as Mary Cole. She walks up the dusty wooden stairs, enters the house, and begins to chant an incantation she remembers from her maker's lips. A swirling hole opens in the ground, and Keith Beans wakes up from a deep sleep, eyes wide and horrified, as Mary Cole, this woman standing in his bedroom with old timey clothing on, throws her creator into the eternal portal, filling the bedroom floor. And then, as you're falling upward, your vision fades, and the light refocuses as Keith Vigna? You were still dreaming, but you woke up in your bed and you saw a woman in your time in clothing.
1875.38 1889.38 speaker1  There was a ball. It had tendrils. It's one of the balls, right? You guys saw that, right?
1887.38 1909.38 speaker3  duh, it was a ball. Keith is having just flashbacks to that dream and trying to piece things together in his mind, but also he still isn't fully convinced that any of this is actually happening to him.
1906.38 1929.38 speaker1  it wasn't something I remember, per se, but it all kind of touched on things that I could understand being a thing. What you just saw, was that anything that rings a bell for you? Did you see anything that rings true?
1927.38 1979.38 speaker3  She was there. I had a dream and she was there. Marvin's Awesome Robots, y'all. Y was the version of it, and it's M-A-R. Manipulating Activator Robot.
1977.38 2027.38 speaker2  you're all sitting on the ground. Above you is pure darkness, the same darkness you've seen above you this whole time, and beneath you, the ground is made of pure light. But as your eyes adjust to your new surroundings, the endlessness of it all begins to fade away, and you see you're actually all sitting on the ground in a small room. like a hoarder studio apartment. And you hear a whiny moan, pained from behind a jostling pile of clutter.
2024.38 2042.38 speaker1  Leo?
2036.38 2119.38 speaker2  And this jostling amount of junk just falls over, pours over onto the ground, the real ground now below you that is still made of light, and it falls over, and he falls toward you, and you see as he falls on his face in front of you, it is very clearly Leo Piston. He looks exactly like he did the night that he stood atop the two-fanged plunge, and a bullet was fired through his body by Julie Maxwell, who then you shot in the eye. And as he falls forward, you do see he's shirtless, and the skin kind of like falls and hits the ground below, and the fat on his sides kind of presses against all the junk that is down there next to him, and you see a very clear exit wound from where, or an entrance wound from where the bullet went through him, and he's like, Oh, I'm in so much pain, and this is all you felt.
2117.38 2122.38 speaker1  You're not real. You're not real.
2120.38 2127.38 speaker2  It fucking hurts.
2125.38 2136.38 speaker1  This can't be real. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. We saw his body slide down the slide.
2134.38 2149.38 speaker3  because we suffocated news, and we're up here in sixth-cent ghost hell with Leo. His body got caught by the goo. Yeah, just like us.
2148.38 2154.38 speaker1  Oh, yeah.
2152.38 2159.38 speaker2  I've been in your unconscious for a while, and you'll have it in.
2157.38 2167.38 speaker3  I was going to say, how long has it been? Two and a half years?
2165.38 2173.38 speaker2  Please come back home.
2171.38 2196.38 speaker3  at his worst impulses? Eh.
2192.38 2210.38 speaker1  Clark is going to have a look of dawning realization. He starts looking around. Does that mean, is she here? Leo, is Julie here?
2208.38 2255.38 speaker2  My body was here. And he points to the ground nearby, and there's no body. And his eyes get huge. And he's like, Jesus. fell down the same way you guys just did. Well, you shot her.
2254.38 2258.38 speaker1  Where'd she go?
2255.38 2262.38 speaker2  And he points at a large metal door.
2260.38 2276.38 speaker1  Are there any windows in the room we're in? And are we saying hatch because it's on the ground?
2274.38 2308.38 speaker2  It's on the wall like a door. I don't know why I'm saying hatch. I think it's just like the big rectangle. It actually looks like a walk-in freezer, I guess. Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure. Gotcha, yeah. That kind of thing. Sorry, I'm just really bad with words.
2305.38 2348.38 speaker3  I'm glad you finished that last word. Me too, yeah. I'll show you a hard wire. I'm going to show you my dictionary. Nice. It is porn.
2343.38 2386.38 speaker1  So I was under the assumption that we were in some sort of afterlife here, but maybe that's not the case. Maybe when she shot Leo, it was not a fatal wound. It was the goo that got him. the real world? Maybe time passes differently here. If it would have been a fatal wound five days ago.
2384.38 2391.38 speaker2  imagine, in your fucked up brain. Oh, sure.
2387.38 2398.38 speaker1  Yeah, go ahead and roll. I fail.
2397.38 2404.38 speaker2  Certainly not sure. You're about as sure as Joe would be either way on whether or not that wound would be fatal.
2403.38 2415.38 speaker1  Yep, yep, yep. And then is, is freezer door hatch the only door in this room? The only way we would be able to get in or out?
2413.38 2458.38 speaker2  One on either side of the room. As you're talking, you saw like at Leo, Leo's literally just like crawling around knocking shit over, and he knocks over enough clutter on the opposite side of the room to reveal a second door that was unseen previous. constantly, and he's just crying out in pain the whole time. happening constantly. It's honestly pretty relaxing.
2457.38 2490.38 speaker3  Sorry.
2489.38 2495.38 speaker1  However little it may be.
2493.38 2549.38 speaker3  He's got a decent frame of reference for right now. And also it's, he is being kept alive in here. And even though he's been going through unspeakable pain for five whole days, we, we could probably get him out of here. Keith says nothing, but isn't so sure. is any of this for? upwards, goddamn Leo dying for five days bullshit?
2546.38 2593.38 speaker2  Spud is kind of walking towards one of the doors. This is, he's just kind of pacing back and forth. Now he was walking away and now he's walking toward you and now he's walking away. I was like, why? And I was like, yo, and you guys are all different and stuff and it was crazy. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
2590.38 2611.38 speaker3  I guess this ain't so bad. Leo, do you feel content even though you're dying in pain constantly?
2607.38 2619.38 speaker2  And I don't think I've slept the whole time I've been here except for being unconscious maybe.
2618.38 2621.38 speaker3  I guess it's a big ol' no.
2619.38 2627.38 speaker2  I was just trying to describe my physical state to you. He's not hungry. He's not sleepy.
2625.38 2639.38 speaker3  Is this a riddle or is this meat? We're detectives' greatest detectives, so we're just thinking out loud.
2635.38 2650.38 speaker1  I think, I think if we're going to find a way out, we got to start trying to find a way out. Shh. Do you, do you guys think we should go out the door that Julie went out or do you think we should go out that one? Can I point to the other one?
2649.38 2666.38 speaker3  I don't know. Which one did he go to?
2659.38 2726.38 speaker2  and he turns back to fully face you with double finger guns as the door behind him swings open. Without turning back around to confirm his footing, he steps backward over the threshold. And beyond the doorway, you all look out and see a technicolor sky your eyes cannot quite comprehend. And it is, at the same time, completely dark. The nothingness is endless, but below the horizon is a shimmering silver sea.
2723.38 2747.38 speaker3  I was gonna, like, weed like three stooges' heads.
2741.38 2790.38 speaker2  that surrounds Leo's auxiliary piston junkyard for as far as you can see. But just below, Spud is laying on top of this gleaming expanse, and his face is contorted into a twisted grimace.
2788.38 2801.38 speaker1  Let's try that other one, guys. I gotta see how this ends.
2800.38 2814.38 speaker3  No, Justin.
2810.38 2857.38 speaker2  And two men are standing on this craft. One is a short stout man in his latter years. A thick white beard makes his round face look even rounder. He's wearing a dark navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy overalls. And the other man is John Lee Pettymore IV's uncle, Don D. Pettymore.
2849.38 2874.38 speaker1  He's got that leathery, been out in the sun too long, strong, dark hair that's very disheveled right now.
2873.38 2880.38 speaker3  What, how...
2877.38 2884.38 speaker0  Is that John?
2882.38 2886.38 speaker3  Hey, Uncle Don, uh...
2884.38 2890.38 speaker2  I start going down the ladder.
2888.38 2917.38 speaker1  Don, you could climb up the ladder.
2913.38 2917.38 speaker3  LAUGHTER What kind of world are you living in?
