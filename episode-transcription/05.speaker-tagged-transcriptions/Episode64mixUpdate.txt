0.00 174.00 speaker0  My producer just handed me a note, just a content warning up front on this one for my wolf pups. Caution, these boys have done some fucked up shit on this show, but this is perhaps a bit more intense. If you or anyone you know are dealing with suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 1-800-273-8255. Take care of yourself, y'all. Bonjour, my beautiful, bountiful, bouncing baby babies. Papa Wolf is here to cradle you to sleep with my soothing grumbles and growls. As always, I am lulling y'all to your dream states live from 694.2 PTBP. I just want to let y'all know, it's December 6th, and it is the night time. The good numbers of 6.9 and 4.2 are here to smear me and smear. That's that good cream, the sweet cream. When I get all lathered up in cream, y'all know what time it is. It's Howlin' with Wolf O'Clock, daddios and momios. who tagged that pretending pod in a tweet that read, A stoner, a Jedi, and a surgeon walkin' to a bar. Blunt. Force. Trauma. Hell yeah. Jesus Christ. Good job, Dustin. Dustin the Wind here, from Toledo, Ohio, aka the armpit of the Midwest. I'm made like Muse and plugged in baby. Now I'm all cut up on the backlog and hungry for more. Just like I'm hungry for the taste sensation that's sweeping the nation. Food Witch, now with extra flavor. What flavor? I'll never tell. Try one and find out. Food Witch, it's edible. Brought to you by Bar Corp. The only magic we make is the illusion of choice. Well, hello, Mr. De Wind. And by processed, I mean mostly rotted. Maybe add a little MSG and sugar to it. But I'd be willing to try some Food Witch, if you'd be willing to send me a couple of dumpsters full of them. I just need that fresh from the dumpster flavor.
173.28 180.24 speaker1  What's that?
178.40 255.04 speaker0  It's so easy. Just write something nice about us on the internet and tag at PretendingPod. What's that? You don't follow us on Instagram or Twitter? What the fuck? What's that? You've listened to over 60 episodes of the show and you still haven't written a five-star review on Apple Podcasts? That's wild, my babies. I'm talking to the vast majority of you, but on the real. Thanks for listening, y'all. I fucking love making this show just for you. And guess what? All five of those pretending to be people stinkers are going to be on Twitch for a night of goofy buffoonery on Tuesday, February 11th at 7 p.m. Central Time. That's twitch.tv slash pretending pod streams. Find a link in these here show notes. Tuesday, February 11th at 7 p.m. Central Time. Who knows what they'll get up to? Maybe some Jackbox? There's only five of them. Leave some room for y'all to hop in on the action.
252.48 259.20 speaker1  Oh, that's going to be fun.
258.32 327.28 speaker0  Just kidding. I'm all out of good news. Last time, our intrepid assholes made their way across campus to Glass Hall, where the biology lab is located. But they're fucking losing it. And Clark Clark started chanting.
324.56 342.80 speaker2  Did anything happen at the end of last episode? No, I don't think so. No, nothing important? Nothing I remember. That makes a lot of sense. What I remember is that you lost your fucking mind. Zero Sand started chanting and then took a big ass finger bump out of Keith's cocaine finger.
342.56 359.76 speaker1  Yup.
358.24 362.72 speaker2  Is it like Star Wars? I don't know what...
361.92 367.04 speaker1  You're a farmer.
362.72 368.72 speaker2  So it's like what Star Wars would have been about if Ben Kenobi would have never shown up. Exactly.
367.44 378.48 speaker1  If Luke had just stayed on the farm.
376.96 396.80 speaker2  And we'll start with that. So first off, you are going to be chanting when we begin. When everyone comes back in the room all together. Remember it's towel alacle. Towel alacle. Yeah. That's what it is. Yeah.
395.84 400.00 speaker1  Towel alacle. Am I doing it right? Towel alacle. Yeah.
399.84 408.40 speaker0  Yeah.
407.20 416.80 speaker2  And I can just do that in post. You can lay it in. Yeah. Actually, let's get a clean take of it now.
415.84 418.48 speaker1  Oh, a clean take. A clean take.
418.00 425.44 speaker2  Yeah. As opposed to what you were wanting to do there.
424.16 434.96 speaker1  Towel alacle. Towel alacle. Towel alacle.
433.92 442.80 speaker2  My dad always told me that. Okay.
442.56 450.96 speaker1  Okay.
449.36 468.72 speaker2  So let's call it the third round. So you have two rounds of just chanting and like maybe moving about and kind of finding what you're going to use to kill yourself. And then on that third round, you're going to go ahead and really try to make that a reality by going through with it.
467.92 486.40 speaker1  You have to do it. But I mean like, what happens if I get to the third round and I haven't like prepared well enough, is there a penalty or something? How does that work? Because theoretically the guys are going to hopefully try to stop me from doing something. Exactly.
481.92 499.84 speaker2  And then if you can't do to them, good on them. However, if you can't not do to them, I'm going to force your hand. Sure. Or just, you know, I'd prefer that you do it.
498.72 508.56 speaker1  Thanks for giving me agency.
501.52 519.12 speaker2  I'm giving you the full reign of motion, full range of motion, but you have to kill yourself. No, I don't care for it. They're going to use this recording in my trial.
517.92 525.44 speaker1  I fucking know it. Oh, God damn it.
521.68 528.48 speaker2  So with that all being said, are you ready? I assume I need to be cagey with the fellas, right?
527.68 554.56 speaker1  I believe so. Is it possible for Clark to speak other than tell a local at this point? Not at this point.
553.84 672.88 speaker2  Oh, Hey Luke. That's me. That's my sign. Is there like a, what's it called? Sign on call something. What's up, man? An image. You did something at the end of the last episode, didn't you? I did. Yes. Like a beat. Like slam poetry. That's pretty good. Self opinion. Okay. Right. So you had how much luck? I had 35 and before you tell me that I have five points, let me say this, because I used it in succession so quickly, let's call it one. I agree. Hell yeah. So you have 25 luck still. Tight, tight. Also using it, I remembered when I first got it, there was a reason that I hadn't used it, but I forgot what the cost was. So I was just hoping that it wasn't like something terrible. So the cost is that 10 luck. And normally the positive that you would get is that it puts your willpower back up to full. However, during this arc, we haven't been using the willpower because I'm still at 10 out of 10 because I forgot about it. You just are waiting for the right time. Exactly. Thank you for understanding.
672.48 677.36 speaker1  Okay.
676.48 679.92 speaker2  Fuck you.
678.56 681.52 speaker1  Donovan West.
679.92 689.04 speaker2  Why can't we remember that? Sorry.
688.88 693.20 speaker1  Sorry. Sorry, Justin.
691.20 747.20 speaker2  We'll care about your next character. So just a reminder, before we get into tonight's episode, you have a pile of money in your pockets and at your feet. And you're very excited. I'm so excited. I'm sorry. Cause I can buy more. Exactly. All right. Let's get the other boys in here and kick this thing off. I don't know. Nothing really sticks out. It does. Nothing has to stick out. What about you? I don't know. That's a weird thing to remember. That's what I'm thinking.
747.04 755.44 speaker1  Yeah.
753.52 806.32 speaker2  I had in our pre-interview. Is that what they're called? Any anecdotes you want to tell? If not, some of our writers can punch something up for you. Probably doesn't mean anything, but I, a doctor told me to cut off my penis. I went into the doctor because I was having like, I was like, I think there's something wrong with my penis. I'm really busy. Here's some snips. You're going to cut off the end of your penis, the head and some of the shaft. Good to use all the scientific terms.
805.60 817.20 speaker1  He didn't.
815.84 896.00 speaker2  He's like, yeah, I don't have time. You've got to cut off the tip of your penis, put it in this plastic bag and, uh, carry it around until your appointment tomorrow. So he made me do that myself. And I was like, fuck. running into people in life. And they're like, wait, why do you have your penis in a bag? And then also I just had this like open penis sore. I was like, but I can probably get away with it. So I peed and just like blood and piss came out, but there was no like pee muscles. It was just an open hole. So it just kind of sprayed everywhere. Well, when you're rinsing off like some chicken grease or something, you got to really some chicken grease from where? You know where. Speaking of taking home stuff from the hospital, Luke, have you seen anything interesting on Reddit recently?
894.08 899.20 speaker1  A friend shared it to another friend. Way to turn your back on me.
898.88 919.20 speaker2  What? Just say you saw it on Reddit because that's what I asked, Luke. A guy in Oklahoma got in a motorcycle crash.
918.56 925.20 speaker1  of tacos.
923.68 930.56 speaker2  He had a dinner party. He had a dinner party with tacos. Yeah, feet tacos. Foot meat.
929.20 934.08 speaker1  Inspired by our podcast.
931.68 942.88 speaker2  Oh shit, I didn't even make that connection. Wow.
942.40 944.32 speaker1  You get it.
943.60 955.60 speaker2  He gets it. Wait, no, no, no, no. Far more interested in whether or not you would eat your own flesh if you had the opportunity.
953.68 963.92 speaker1  Honestly, when else are you going to get that chance? Sure. You know what?
962.16 1085.84 speaker2  I would eat me, but I would not eat you. So there's a possibility that in some alternate reality where Thomas got like 30 more minutes of sleep, you all got to enjoy my dream penis. where I talk about the dick cutting off dream and just let them decide what that's all about. I won't. So you guys are all in the basement of glass hall. Dude, it goes on for like three and a half minutes. And you have recently walked down some stairs that were covered in blood with loose screwdrivers, all strewn about on the stairwell leading down into the hallway that the lab is in. The lab's just up here on your right, as Donovan might say. Donovan, what's your last name? I'll let you guess. Elizabeth. View? I said it right earlier. And then I told him, I don't think that's it. Have you never written it down? It's probably written down like eight times somewhere. Did he make it up? I didn't give him his name. Okay.
1084.48 1093.92 speaker1  Zach doesn't tell me to do shit. Hey, that's right.
1092.48 1140.16 speaker2  But I can't, because I don't know what's happening. Didn't pay attention. Ouch. I was like, good job, Zach. Good job, Zach. I love you. way too much practice.
1139.36 1148.88 speaker1  I love you, mom. I do love my mom. I love this mom.
1147.76 1179.28 speaker2  You guys are standing there. Keith Vigna is shoving bloody screwdrivers into his pants pockets. Donovan is just staring in confusion and amazement and horrifying revelation that maybe you're not with the best people as Keith just puts his finger up the nose of Clark Bishop and then puts his finger up the nose of John Lee Pettymore. And then... Joe, is this the first time Clark's done cooking?
1176.96 1182.16 speaker1  Unless I did it for some reason earlier in the podcast. Definitely. You definitely did not.
1180.88 1192.80 speaker2  Yeah, definitely. Zero. Zero. So Clark's just gone. Yeah. Okay.
1192.32 1226.40 speaker1  That's sad. The vessel formerly known as Clark. Towel alico. Towel alico. Towel alico.
1224.48 1293.12 speaker2  the red emergency lights. Do the thing. The red emergency lights. You guys know what happened. Who told you about this? Red room. Red room. And you guys see you're standing in front of this lab that is completely just like a wall of glass, like looking into this laboratory and you hear the doors that you just came in the entrance to glass hall bust open and you hear a bunch of chatter from up there. Go, go. We got another. Clark Bishop, you're up first. You're chanting. What do you do while you're chanting?
1291.12 1300.96 speaker1  If he was handing me one, I'm taking it. Otherwise I'm reaching down to the body that had those screwdrivers hanging out of it and grabbing one. Yeah, I'm offering him one. Then I'll grab it out of his hand.
1300.72 1319.36 speaker2  Okay. So John Lee Pettymore, he's walking towards Clark, but you can tell that he thinks he's He's making these little tippy taps.
1319.20 1326.32 speaker1  him.
1325.36 1332.16 speaker2  like stretched out. Clark, my child come, we must get you to safety.
1330.56 1339.84 speaker1  Do I see people coming down the stairs?
1337.28 1363.20 speaker2  He's wearing a backpack and cleaning the baseboards. Now I don't remember this. I don't remember that word. Yeah.
1362.40 1378.80 speaker1  I don't remember it either. So I might not have been. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Um, why is there a kid at college? If I only just see that kid and nobody else, I'm going to keep getting screwdrivers, just
1378.00 1425.12 speaker2  What are you doing? looking up the stairs, you see a small canister and gas starts emitting out of it. And it's right next to this kid cleaning the baseboards with that. It's Clark Bishop's turn and you are being moved into the lab currently. What are you doing? John's just pushing you. You guys can simultaneously here.
1420.64 1436.24 speaker1  If you're just pushing me, I'm not going with the push and I'm going to the opposite wall from the glass walls to the cinder block wall and trying to rub the screwdrivers head really hard to kind of sharpen the tip of it. Okay.
1433.36 1454.24 speaker2  So if you want him to not do that, we're going to roll a strength. And I pick up a pile of screwdrivers from the floor and I wave them.
1452.48 1457.92 speaker1  Make it rain, brother. Hell yeah. Make it rain. I like that.
1456.72 1467.12 speaker2  Those were the best ones. Those were the best ones. They're all good. There was a, there was one that was worth more.
1465.52 1481.76 speaker1  It said, it said on there. Very good screwdriver. Better than the rest. But, uh, fuck. Double elical, double elical.
1480.96 1499.20 speaker2  It's on the stairs. Yeah. Smoke hasn't made it down here yet though. Is the lab open? The door is closed, but it is just a push. It's not like a lock. I see the gas coming out.
1491.68 1503.36 speaker1  I take a one last, like handful of screwdrivers, shoving my pockets and I head towards the door, try to open it up and go in that room. Okay. Sounds good.
1501.84 1568.00 speaker2  You'll be in there at the start of next round. Donovan West Haven. And Leon Simpson is going to continue just moving, grinding, bumping, bopping, duping, dipin' and dopin'. And at that moment you see legs, just legs, and then torsos. submachine guns. And... Joe, if you could hit that vape real hard and just blow it around here and get some Fatter, fatter. Oh, we need those clouds. Get that rip. Oh shit.
1566.80 1583.04 speaker1  That was actually really fat.
1580.48 1609.20 speaker2  Thomas, what if you got popcorn lung just from that one hit? I'd haunt you all. We'd all talk like every time you were haunting us, we'd be like... No, that's what I would do. What do you do?
1605.68 1628.32 speaker1  He kind of looks around and gives a smile to everyone around and jams the pick into his eye and up through the top of his head.
1624.40 1672.72 speaker2  and blood begins dripping down his face. But with one last staccato motion, he shoves the handle of the screwdriver flush with his eye socket and a stream of warm dark red blood sprays into the air as each of his limbs go limp and the body of Clark Bishop crumbles into a pile on the floor. So it's my turn. I'd like to load our autosave.
1671.04 1674.48 speaker1  Wait, could I have done that, Zach?
1672.72 1716.88 speaker2  We turned autosave off and we... Oh, come on, we're on survival mode? Yeah. Joe, Clark is dead. Get the fuck out of the room.
1714.56 1728.56 speaker1  Can Joe just lay down on the ground right now? Make gurgling sounds. Joe, be a dead... Oh, roleplay a dead guy. Can we eat your foot?
1728.08 1750.32 speaker3  I'm at it.
1745.76 1769.76 speaker2  You just saw Clark Bishop stab himself in the eye with a screwdriver and fall limply dead to the ground. Like a flash in his eyes before he... Well, that's real handy because I'm going to have you all roll sanity for me.
1768.56 1788.72 speaker1  Oh my God.
1784.48 1833.68 speaker2  Which is the crittest of fails, except for 100. Except for 100. Hey, Thomas, you're going to lose four sanity. Well, that's all I got. Okay, I need Donovan to roll a d4 for me. Oh, there it is. So as you lose one sanity, you're still going to be able to keep your wits about you for the time being as fucked up as that seems. He's not like a cop or anything.
1832.64 1834.48 speaker0  What are you going to do about it?
1833.68 1924.24 speaker2  Don't leave. Can you teach me how to chant again? A towel. Towel. Alakol. Alakol. Towel alakol. Yes. Towel alakol. And I need you to roll a d4 for me. You are going to start working on finding a way to kill yourself over the next three rounds. I mean, I think I just have a gun, right? Yep. And on the fourth round, you have to go through with it. Can I go through with it before that? You cannot. Oh, okay. That is correct. Okay. I'll get the other boys back in here. John Lee Pennymore walks straight back to the corner. He's still doing the tippy tap thing. Like he thinks he's floating with his face to the corner of the back wall of the slab and his arms outstretched. He starts saying. Towel alakol. Towel alakol.
1923.44 1935.20 speaker1  Towel alakol.
1929.20 1952.88 speaker2  to John as he walks away from you and starts chanting this that you barely notice the woman and the lab coat or the man and the lab coat sitting at a desk faced away from you. Are there two people? Two people, one man, one woman, both wearing lab coats and the woman looks at you and it's
1947.60 1969.76 speaker3  Oh, oh, thank God someone came except for he's doing the, he's doing the chanting and he is he.
1964.32 2016.72 speaker1  all of the stuff out of my pockets and I start counting it with a huge smile on my face. Is he also looking at us or? I don't, I don't understand what's happening. I'm trying to count here.
2011.84 2064.00 speaker2  filled with smoke and bathed in red emergency bulbs. Through the gas, you see the beams from four flashlights attached to the barrels of this four man squad's rifles. The hazy gleam illuminates the screwdriver filled old woman and the body of Clark Bishop before all four rifles are pointed at Leon Simpson, who has ceased to dance. He's just standing there chanting.
2063.36 2074.16 speaker3  On the right.
2073.04 2081.76 speaker2  And that's his turn. Keith Vigna.
2080.80 2095.76 speaker1  What else do I see?
2088.08 2105.28 speaker2  combat boots all the way up to a gas mask, big goggles on the gas masks and helmets on top. Just some straight Resident Evil motherfuckers.
2103.36 2112.48 speaker1  Like it's me, my pile of goodies. And then I have clear sight of the door looking at them, but also just continue counting.
2112.00 2121.60 speaker3  Donovan. Donovan Westhaven.
2117.60 2139.52 speaker1  I don't know why, but I haven't been infected with whatever's happening. I'm Barbara.
2136.64 2145.04 speaker3  But I mean, you've seen it all from the beginning, ain't you?
2140.24 2162.88 speaker1  I just, I thought there was some like weird campus prank or something in the beginning. And now it's freaky. that he is experiencing. When he's, he's like stammering and finishes.
2160.96 2181.84 speaker3  Yes, I did send those tweets. Yes, me and me and Phillip both sent those tweets. And Phillip, tell them, tell them what you told me earlier.
2181.20 2193.76 speaker0  I look over at her.
2193.12 2212.16 speaker3  I don't know. I suppose it's just more for me then.
2208.72 2226.00 speaker1  I think we need to, can we, can you help me restrain him? Yes. Yes, of course. I'm like walking towards, do I even know John's name? I just know Clark and Leon.
2221.12 2241.44 speaker2  So I'll let you guys roll a, uh, if, if John, uh, doesn't want to be. John will contest it, whatever you do. Okay, so you'll get a strength check and I'll give you, because there are two of us doing it, even though we're probably not as strong as John Lee Pettymore is, I'll give you a 70 strength with two people working together.
2239.60 2245.04 speaker1  So it's a blackjack rules.
2244.16 2248.32 speaker2  Price is right rules. John's got a 50. What did I say? Blackjack.
2247.76 2265.78 speaker1  Oh yeah. Okay, come on.
2265.28 2273.92 speaker0  Yeah.
2269.76 2281.76 speaker2  So as Barbara and Donovan come toward John Lee Pettymore, what does John Lee Pettymore do?
2280.88 2293.44 speaker1  He's so slippery.
2289.12 2317.52 speaker2  lab through the glass door and are clearly preparing an entrance. God remains dead and we have killed him. And it's Keith Vigna's turn.
2312.24 2345.44 speaker1  I grab an arm full of what I've been counting, trying to get as much as I can. And I run behind the desk, drop it on the ground and then prepare for an assault.
2342.40 2351.84 speaker2  So a called shot would give you a 10% chance. So you're just going to go ahead and fire.
2348.96 2367.44 speaker1  knocks him out of shooting himself and disables him. But can I have a bonus power of love of Clark?
2366.80 2372.08 speaker0  Yeah, I'm good. Didn't. 87.
2371.20 2377.76 speaker1  He's not good. You shoot John directly in the head.
2376.64 2389.44 speaker2  It wasn't a crit fail. So you fire just past him and you're like, the camera zooms, like the camera is looking at your gun as it fires. And then when it zooms up to your face, you've got your eyes closed.
2388.64 2405.44 speaker1  That checks out.
2401.28 2424.88 speaker3  to use to try to create some sort of antivirus for whatever's happening here. Oh God. to be able to make it through this.
2420.24 2452.40 speaker2  a little bit and the rolly chair that he's in rolls, like spins around. And you see that this man has no eyes and there's blood just running down from his eye holes. And in each one of his hands, he is holding his own eyeballs, stringy mucus hanging off the end of each one limply in both of his dead hands. So you're like Pan's Labyrinth.
2450.72 2454.08 speaker1  But grosser somehow.
2452.40 2512.96 speaker2  Oh, much grosser. And you hear canisters hit the floor and smoke starts filling the lab. It's John Lee Pettymore's turn. But you've never seen a being more at peace with itself. John Lee Pettymore just looks out at all of you and like smiles and then blows his brains out through the back of his head. I need you both to roll sanity. Roll a d4 for me, Luke.
2511.76 2537.60 speaker1  Alrighty.
2533.76 2548.10 speaker2  And a pool of blood starts forming around his head. And it's Keith Vigna's turn.
2547.60 2592.40 speaker1  Fuck. And I almost like, I feel like I'm going to throw up, but I keep it down and I look down at what's in front of me. This is all going to his funeral, if I can keep it. And then I look at the door. I don't know what the fuck is happening. And everyone he's been following has gone crazy and is either killed themselves or is counting screwdrivers on the floor. Like does the hands behind the head, just gets on the knees.
2592.08 2600.48 speaker3  Help.
2599.92 2615.60 speaker1  I do not.
2612.80 2618.16 speaker2  into the room all four of them at the same time.
2615.60 2619.36 speaker1  From that preparing, like an aim kind of thing.
2618.64 2626.16 speaker2  So what do you do?
2623.52 2634.24 speaker1  I like focus in on them. My mind is going a thousand miles an hour from that bump of pure coke.
2633.28 2643.52 speaker2  Glass family coke.
2636.80 2683.68 speaker1  And what Donovan would see is I take a screwdriver in my hand, holding it like a piece of money paper and I like snap it, flick it like I'm throwing a card. Right. And I'm aiming right at the neck between the helmet and the body armor. Sure. And that one exposed piece of skin. Yep. And I. But in reality, I'm throwing screwdrivers into their necks.
2675.60 2706.88 speaker2  So you're going to roll athletics and I will give you a plus 40, 20 for being prepared and 20 for being gacked out and just fully believing that this is possible. And then negative 20 for it being a called shot. So it's a plus 20 overall. And not one. No, you fucking didn't.
2704.32 2721.52 speaker1  I thought it was, but I mean, that's still pretty good. Yeah. It's still a pass. Seven.
2717.20 2754.32 speaker2  You will be at a negative 20 for being yocked out of one mind. Two of them just hit him. Like one hits him in the gas mask. One hits him in the chest and they just bounce off. But one of them slides through and hits him directly in the neck, right in between the gas mask and his body armor.
2752.48 2762.24 speaker3  He's got screwdrivers.
2760.00 2776.16 speaker1  I'm like, that's what you call it. So I'm covered.
2773.60 2783.52 speaker2  And then you would have taken another negative on that role.
2780.48 2784.82 speaker1  My, my, my most vulnerable part of my body. Yeah.
2784.32 2867.36 speaker2  Okay. Keith is going to take 22 points of damage. I'm still alive, baby. So you're down to three because you took more than half of your full health points in one hit. You have to roll a constitution check in order to not take like major damage. 46 on a 70. All right. So not only are you still conscious, but you're not going to take like a lifelong ill effect to those bullets. You're like laying down, but you're still conscious and you can still act. Barbara immediately is just like hugging on to Philip, the man who is like bent over and he's like slumping out of the chair. And as she's trying to like cover him with her body, they both kind of fall out of the chair together. You see them both hit the ground and looking over, Barbara's eyes are wide open, but she is unconscious. Keith, it's your turn again. I'm laying on the ground.
2865.92 2891.52 speaker1  coke right into my bloodstream. All right. Did you see that?
2891.36 2953.92 speaker2  Yeah. And then one of them, as you're like clearly giving up the gun, one of them runs up to Are you going to let him? I let him. Okay. So as he puts it on your face, your eyes roll into the back of your head and you fall on your back right to sleep. Oh, No, I'm good. Okay. Sounds good. I'm not a cop.
2953.28 2959.20 speaker3  Oh shit.
2957.44 2970.56 speaker2  gas mask over on top of your face.
2964.16 3006.80 speaker1  Like I have no iris and they're dilated so much that I have very little white in my eyes. I take a screwdriver and shove it through his neck. Opposed melee combat. I do want to set this up. I do that with my left hand as I have my hand on my gun in case I do pass this role, preparing for my next. Okay.
3001.76 3030.72 speaker2  So you shove this screwdriver up into the exact same spot that you hit the other guy. Carotid artery. Oh, and blood just splatters straight down all over your blood riddled body already.
3025.20 3036.72 speaker1  I shove it into my pocket and then I aim my gun at the next guy.
3034.56 3092.08 speaker2  One who is coming around the other side of the room. Not the gas mask on Donovan's guy. Okay. Sounds good. So it is their turn. And as they turn the corner rifle aimed at you, they see the second victim of your screwdrivers and immediately fire. That kills me. As Keith Vigna is staring down the barrel of this guy in full tactical gear coming towards him, you know, he's a trained shooter. He's got his gun right at you. You've taken out two of them, but you couldn't handle all four of them by yourself. What is the last thought going through your head?
3091.04 3136.00 speaker1  I killed the other two. I fall to the ground and in front of me, I see this giant pile of screwdrivers and I smile to myself and I reach out and I touch one.
3133.36 3515.36 speaker2  lifeless in pools of their own blood. The camera leaves the lab, passes the elderly pile of a corpse in the hallway, moves up the stairs and out of glass hall. The CSU campus is humming. Sirens are constant. Limp bodies are being transported by teams of two in full tactical gear and dragged into prison transport buses. The sky is littered with unmarked black helicopters. We see one hovering above the minion atop the bell tower, a rope ladder allowing ShamWow Chameleon to get even higher. As we leave the CSU campus, we see a confluence of black SUVs heading toward one of the taller buildings of the city skyline, a building that is being climbed by something massive and spherical. We continue past the business district and swoop down into the back of a van heading out toward the pier. The broken and upgraded and dead and metal corpses of John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna are jostling around the posterior of this van that pulls up to a grand old edifice alone on the edge of the water with a well-lit sign outside that reads, The City Asylum. Inside the front doors are two familiar guards, tall and overweight and all black with prominent facial scarring. After we move down through the floor, we are immediately looking through a long line of the bottoms of feet. Body after body has been laid out in a row covered in sheets, feet sticking out. We stop on the final four soles. Both right feet are blank. Both left feet have dead skin in the shape of the circle of knowledge, but one left foot has the name Maggie burned on top of the seven circles. Our vision moves up through the ceiling and into a small dark room. Donovan Westhaven wakes up to the sounds of beeps and bloops of a machine that you feel yourself connected to and you're laying in a hospital bed in a room that is completely dark except for the lights coming from the machine on either side of you. You see that your blood is being drawn and there is an IV in your other arm and then a screen turns on like a TV that's on one of those like roller things that they would roll in when you're in elementary school. recognize as a fellow student at CSU. She was a political activist pro-union and you know made herself known all over campus so you knew who she was. She also became quite something in the news when she committed suicide in her dorm room frame of the camera and you're just looking at her dorm room with a paint of blood behind her on the wall and on the ceiling and the video stops. And a man comes out of the darkness in the back corner of the room and you can see that he's lit by your machines and he's wearing a black suit with a black tie and a white shirt.
