32.16 229.42 speaker0  Hello, y'all. It's your best friend with the trash-eating problem wolf the dog It is December 6th, and the time is five o'clock y'all Sounds like it's about garbage been o'clock for your wolfy boy But upon venturing outside the sky suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit y'all ever seen an eclipse it was like that but uh Different it was real spooky y'all wolf nearly shit his big-ass britches I found a note attached with a thumb tacked to the inside of my door It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says for wolf at the top I guess it's this week's howlin with wolf it comes from user chuckling boy over on the subreddit He's an Android user But logged on to iTunes on his computer to leave a review this boy sure knows how to make old wolfy blush Chuckling boy writes the cowboy years introduced a turn of phrase for dealing with a shitstorm We called it a night at the Opera you boys have taken care of a few off-screen But damned if your debut isn't like the Mets own debut Faust Somewhat fitting isn't that and remember the mission is over when the world ends stuff see y'all there Wolf bless you chuckling boy I think you're smooth like butter like a criminal undercover hot like summer y'all make me sweat like that when you tag us on Instagram or Twitter at Anti-science rhetoric it's time for the news a tall gaunt humanoid figure None of that made a lick of sense to me, but that doesn't mean I'm not hungry Filling me up always is kudzu with no backbone
221.62 354.66 speaker1  Darkness and you feel eyes on you all over you and out of your own bodies floating in this vast nothingness in this endless void You see a hand stretching out of darkness and in the palm of this hand a small metal sphere a ball Shape the wires wrap their way around this hand holding the silver object and begin tightening the grasp Constricting until the skin on this hand peels open at each strip of wire Bleeding out into the nothing and this hand unable to hold the ball any longer falls and disappears and with no platform no support the silver sphere to begins falling a Trajectory hoping to slow its descent the bodies are human men women children and their fashion Follows a distinct pattern the first bodies are dressed like pioneers in the Old West you recognize one as the founder of contentions wife Mary Cole the next looks to be from the turn of the century then the roaring 20s the Great Depression then looks from the Mid-century and eventually you see modern clothing as you know It far down at the end of this line and this small metal sphere this ball Cannot be held for long on top of each of these bodies before its wire arms Decimate the skin until there's no more blood left to drain from this Biological shell or the round object simply blasts its way through its short-lived host Either way the blood from previous bodies above trickles at the start Eventually pouring down onto those below before the subject of this story even makes it to them and finally the lowest body a
351.98 367.38 speaker2  Receives this hellish gift
363.58 440.42 speaker1  Setting this girl is running through the woods. It's raining She seems to be chasing a teenage boy The girl lifts a machete that flickers in the glint of the moonlight and the boy turns around just in time to watch as She brings the sharp blade down Blade facing up and this young girl falls face first splitting open her skull revealing a small metal sphere sitting inside The scene changes again and the only image that remains is the cleft head of this young girl Now sitting in a storage tub atop a folded bloody suit But time has not treated this head. Well, it has been removed from her body the skin decayed and slumping over the bones in her face completely Unrecognizable and we see John Lee Pettymore the fourth who's plucked the silver ball out of this corpses dome And he pops it in his pocket
438.26 456.38 speaker2  And your vision fills with water
449.08 557.16 speaker1  As an odd-looking old-timey revolver with glass tubes on the cylinder and a green light lit in front of the desk Rosemary dives for the gun and snatches it behind the desk Marvin Glass reaches out one of his spindly arms and with the flick of his Translucent hand he flings the ball at her Suddenly multiple shiny limbs extend from the small metal sphere and slam into the body of its target Rosemary one of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of Rosemary's neck Another snaps her head forward and you hear the fracture as a third metal tendril reaches in Gripping the top of Rosemary's spine where it meets her head and it rips her entire Spinal cord out of her body in one swift motion promptly forcing itself into the now vacant spinal column of this human being The new Rosemary standing before you has a crazed look in her eyes as she blows her nose into her hand Slams the mucus black shiny There's an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision and then Covering the spot where Rosemary just stood this black shiny Fiscus sludge
554.40 619.20 speaker2  she is lying peacefully as Her limbs seem to fold into this ooze becoming one with the sentient mass of goop and then You all Wake up You've felt this feeling before the shock your stomach feels weird and content your ears are Ringing it's dark. It's cold And it smells like burned flesh which immediately brings you back as your eyes begin to adjust there's a pool of blood on the floor and next to it is a coffin on the ground an Ari Manstein's mausoleum where you've woken up before you look at each other there's blood splatter speckled on each of you John Lee Kevin Lee Pettymore the thirth and
611.24 627.92 speaker1  All-black tactical gear Keith Vigna in his brightly colored polo and boat shoes Clark Bishop and an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick
624.08 656.88 speaker2  Black cloak and the shock begins to wear off You feel the searing pain on your chest on your back on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm Welcome back to contingent boys or rather the city cemetery
654.88 692.08 speaker0  Uh We found we found my parents old book you
690.08 914.84 speaker3  It lets you it lets you do things it's What's what's your last memory Keith? What happened when you? falling through the door landed on the pastor I went through some of those doors down there and went down an elevator and I Opened a few doors and what I got I got into a room and found Well, I found Some papers and I found the gun and I saw Tilly B, but she was Very Much worse for wear skin looked thin and almost translucent and just she didn't have any fingernails and oh man, I I found a spell on One of those papers and I I said it and my my fingernails popped off She was acting like a monster or like a caged-up animal she was Behind a door like a blast door, but I didn't open it up. She was screaming and making crazy noises and figured it worked and Figured you know magic works. So I I cast this cast a spell that that Mildred Mitchell had on her and my god my I Feel I want to feel my arm You can feel the metal My arm and chest and face ripped open and all the metal that was in me popped out and I pre grew my bones They just popped back in At that point I kind of lost it and I pulled the trigger on that gun and Guys I was Silas Cole. I I found it contention. I own them. I own the mine and I Mary's a ball you made Mary Cole Don't know if there is a Mary Cole Mary is is ma are why she's a ball She's one of those silver balls Why did you what do you ma are? Why what I? It's fuzzy and it's not at the same time when before I pulled that trigger. I found paper looked like a success and it was M a are why Like
912.84 966.02 speaker2  Had to off the dog make that same
964.32 995.12 speaker4  There was one thing that you cut out for that I was here Oh your but did you say your your metal popped out and something about your bones?
989.60 1085.74 speaker3  Yeah, I wouldn't I don't know if I'd recommend going through that again, but let me see that watch you son of a bitch Starting the town and having the mine and making stuff that helps people and you know Once I've pulled that trigger it all gets super fuzzy. I just Like somebody else, but I know it was me Cuz I felt going back in time Don't know what apparently not I've you know I was feeling a little crazy when I pulled that trigger Like if I had a meter of sanity, there was nothing else to lose in it
1081.06 1089.90 speaker4  You're talking about the the gun with the tubes on it, is that what you're saying that was the one yeah
1086.14 1144.34 speaker3  But at the same one, I don't know if it it's either the same one or Science lab for Silas Cole, which was me But I didn't know it until I became Silas Cole but then I must have remembered the diagrams and made them from what I remembered again and then That's weird and he just looks off into the distance like way deep in thought
1142.34 1157.54 speaker4  I
1155.54 1168.36 speaker2  Like courts martial
1165.56 1176.12 speaker4  He wouldn't have been able to change anything in the past. It sounds like
1174.12 1206.56 speaker3  Predetermined I thought of He's probably I bet he did that earlier than just right now
1202.52 1234.36 speaker2  Seemed like by the time we got back there. He'd been consolidating all this shit for a few days He really yeah made hay while we were away, you know
1232.36 1269.24 speaker1  So it's 5 o'clock
1264.34 1356.82 speaker2  You saw that Maggie on the bottom of your left feet were crossed out Which you also confirm and Clark you again see the eaten away logo for the circle of knowledge Which you all see is crossed out when you check each other's backs Literally, yeah
1354.82 1395.60 speaker3  oops But yeah withdrew what happened withdrew drew Carries or what? However, we're saying he was good I'm the last thing I remember pretty much was him in her body and not really much else had happened
1391.42 1429.10 speaker4  We thought we thought drew was a goner because we heard a gunshot ring out right then Turned out we had a little Savior in the in our midst. Yeah, who shot Kristoff's hand off. It was a
1424.22 1437.70 speaker3  What she killed your parents? Why is she trying to get you and mister?

1485.14 1489.70 speaker2  Thanks, something's up
1487.30 1549.90 speaker4  Got a firm grasp on how all this works Jim was her hands. So you're telling me So you remember we saw those notes about how Maggie heard that Jim Cook was worried about Maggie and all that And Was was working for Jim in particular. So that's why she killed my parents Jim sent her off to get a book You remember that book we found in Jim's house. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, that's one. He like homemade so it didn't work too. Well
1547.90 1569.10 speaker2  Everybody's doing their part to save the world
1566.34 1659.78 speaker4  And then we were gonna go over to calm comfy campground But then she did some shit that we didn't take too kindly to namely killing John I And then I still was kind of curious about what the book would do now that we knew where it was cuz she was so Hyped up on it right went and got the book and That's I Use it no not it. It certainly didn't kill me in fact. It. Maybe did the opposite, but I it all gets fuzzy after that
1657.66 1667.14 speaker2  enough for me to help out and killing her I
1660.54 1800.98 speaker4  Also, I gave a I gave a shot at doing the same thing. I'd just seen an do which was Just a little just a little blood magic heart Sorry, that's I don't know yeah, it felt real nice It yeah you Keith you can relate you know sometimes at the end of the day You guys remember Jim cook right remember Jim when we found out he died in a yeah in an alley right I did that Was suddenly in the alley with Jim and I knew that he'd sent and loved to kill my parents and it it just got the better of me and I I So we potentially could have
1798.26 1844.22 speaker2  You know the last thing I remember is watching wheel of fortune I
1838.38 1847.50 speaker3  Don't know what the hell we do now. I mean going to watch wheel of fortune sounds just good as anything

1921.78 1972.58 speaker4  Yeah, so and and was telling us that the the giant Penta kid The thing here's here's one kind of scary thing Keith that and mentioned to us is that Maggie had some designs on the circle of knowledge That would then Lay in a new world order or something like that But Ann was pretty much on our side as far as she didn't care about that She just wanted to make sure that the creature didn't happen
1970.58 1998.98 speaker3  made Mary Daddy
1994.90 2024.54 speaker1  broken androids who's crushed and falling on the ground and Sitting in this dirt and this cold cold December 6th. You're looking up The fire is almost completely out on this crawfish boil smell

2121.10 2163.70 speaker1  Mausoleum, I need you to roll an alertness check for me Pulled up at the entrance of the city cemetery, which is now likely an hour ago
2161.70 2196.78 speaker2  Pay my respects to You know this woman who we have really come to think of as a friend
2191.34 2234.54 speaker1  Mausoleums here in the city cemetery. I need you to roll alertness checks for me Certain roles to get made. Oh You see lights from an ambulance Semi-semitary
2232.54 2247.54 speaker3  the semi-semitary
2240.90 2266.30 speaker1  The running of a slightly heavier than human man taking off in a perpendicular Direction to the entrance of the city cemetery and that man is running toward the glass compound
2261.50 2369.62 speaker4  I wasn't sure if it was one of the robot guys that were protecting Stan Manstein got back up Ambulance up there at the front gate. He's good. He's going the other way. He's heading toward the glass compound. Let's John I
2366.98 2379.74 speaker2  Nope 70 on a 50 so as you're
2377.10 2441.86 speaker1  Main street here in the city
2439.38 2482.94 speaker4  You had a dad. It was Kevin. You're in his body now
2481.62 2518.98 speaker2  Well a
2515.98 2601.94 speaker4  First of all that his name is crossed off our chests That seems like a clear sign that that's all taken care of over there at the end of the day We didn't we never treated a different after we found out you were ball Yeah now that we know where the book is and these days I'm feeling like I have my wits about me a little more Why don't we go get the book and head over to calm comfy campground? See what see what we can do? Maybe save the world there
2601.02 2608.38 speaker3  Hey, all right
2606.02 2673.88 speaker2  Moving them into the mausoleum, so they're not so obvious Androids back into the mausoleum, but also giving them a thorough you know these ideas just come to us second I There's nothing interesting about them. Fuck you
2667.46 2708.74 speaker1  So the three of you make your way back to where you just were deep in the heart of the city Cemetery as you're dragging these androids into Ari Manstein's tomb
2706.74 2726.52 speaker2  This guy's totally lame rat dead
2719.98 2917.20 speaker1  Fighting one of these things at James the mill workers house and you remember how strong? the metal was and how the wrists popped off and had wiring inside and There were there were all sorts of gadgets kind of an inspector gadget style 65% right now. He's nailing it for blockbusters Also movies are huge right now robot seems to have none of the advanced features that were previously part of The Android that you fought at the behest of you now know Maggie Cook and myriad They're at James the mill workers house and dr. Bradley anus fuck
2915.72 2942.68 speaker2  I
2939.12 2981.00 speaker1  Dragging this thing in by the ankles of its pants Pants begin to fall down and instead of a Ken doll Right there where the smooth part is
2978.08 2997.58 speaker2  Holy shit are there any cavities to search? Cuz just call me dr. Anus I
2991.36 3034.72 speaker4  There's this other group this opposing group called the city asylum, and that's who we think McKinley and Harrison Harrison Harrison Harrison was one of them They kind of helped us out in the end and and was like yeah
3030.72 3053.82 speaker3  Robots are from them and some of these robots are from myriad
3049.36 3089.16 speaker2  I think these people started out trying to save the world and now now it's just gotten out of hand I mean we know Maggie's trying to take over the damn thing a small-town police chief just seems like a really unlikely and Poor starting position to be taken over the world from but somehow she did it, so that's I Will give her kudos there. That's some real Putin shit
3083.78 3108.56 speaker4  I'm blanking on is that and clarified a little bit of those connections, and I'm blanking on how it all worked out
3106.56 3126.68 speaker1  Jim Cook's operation operation stapler was his respect operation to cut down on cost
3124.90 3217.62 speaker3  these are cheaper and not myriads Hmm I think out loud as Keith Vigna And I say I feel like I knew somebody that did this Cops can do that right do we have any badges I?
3213.44 3265.42 speaker2  They're they're around cops all the time what we need to do is go up to a civilian And steal their car under the guise of you being a cop. Yeah, I That's genius once we're in the vehicle. We can steal an uber well Yeah, and also let him drive us around a little bit and see if you know is this a car
3262.66 3303.36 speaker3  So I'll call him Keith. What'd you do? Oh? Right, but I don't know
3298.52 3427.22 speaker1  See we had to record the rest of this episode on a different day and on that day We had issues two of them in fact the first is fine Luke. Just didn't have his newer microphone So he's at a slightly lower quality than he will be moving forward But the second sucks shit my laptop couldn't handle my recording and Google Docs and discord and my manatee Masturbation meditation videos all at the same time so my voice is pretty choppy I've been trying and trying tirelessly to figure out a way to repair this issue to no avail however Unnerving part of the story so when you feel your jaw finally relax at the end of the episode stars from just one Incident so I think we should all describe a single
3423.66 3457.34 speaker2  That was really cool how we all work together
3451.26 3483.26 speaker1  And then as he takes him back to the police cruiser you realize he locked his keys in his cruiser with the car running so then he has to
3481.26 3513.86 speaker0  I
3511.86 3538.38 speaker2  Away, there's no trouble afterwards
3536.22 3566.78 speaker1  I guess it wouldn't say vintage, huh? I wouldn't say what year the car is no I guess he doesn't know that there's three of you, and you don't know it's a he But it does does it say his name. It's been a while since I've used you. Yeah. What's his name?
3564.78 3575.50 speaker3  1966 Toyota Prius oh
3573.50 3586.10 speaker1  1966
3583.22 3594.38 speaker2  Two different things are just the same name for the same thing
3590.54 3620.98 speaker1  Volkswagen van rolls up on the outskirts of The city cemetery and it is driven by a man as like long hair He looks pretty Pretty lanky and his eyes are darting all over the place. He's kind of flinching a little bit and You see that his shirt seems to be made from random pieces of fabric that were like patched together quilted together
3618.98 3637.74 speaker2  Hey guys
3635.26 3653.62 speaker1  He he really liked the name Reginald And he grabs a can of whipped cream from the floorboard under his feet, and he just goes
3648.66 3660.06 speaker2  But but I'm gonna sidebar with my compatriots real quick
3659.78 3693.86 speaker3  Yeah And I'm gonna search for cream in his mouth
3688.18 3713.50 speaker1  You know there's some he keeps his lips tight around that white But
3710.06 3780.54 speaker2  You know can only make so many variations of his own creations Zach you gave me like dirty looks and flipped me off, so I was asking a legitimate game strategic question
3776.50 3807.68 speaker1  Hey, hey, I had some I had something in my
3802.90 3818.40 speaker4  I've started, but this seems kind of like the guy that wouldn't think twice about anything. We're about to do
3816.40 3861.54 speaker2  His level or beyond on I guess we're we're kind of wandering vagabonds like you creatures of the road Are you guys going to like a costume party or something?
3858.14 3913.98 speaker1  Self man, it's yeah, I'm making myself. It's really me I'm really glad that I got that thing out of my throat. I feel much more comfortable like this I'm one of those uber drivers who likes to talk to everybody the whole time. What are you guys doing in contention? Huh? Do you find that people like that? I know I know dude. It's just like I get so lonely
3910.42 3940.98 speaker2  You know some pretty well-liked music radios busted man Pretty me some music that like everybody can kind of get you know anything from the 70s basically off I wish I could do the worst Worst thing they could do besides talking is like put on Imagine Dragons, but they do that a lot
3936.06 3990.38 speaker1  Yeah, you're from contention. That's sick, dude. I heard the cops. They're like
3985.42 3998.70 speaker2  Hey, could you put something on like even Imagine Dragons at this point? Oh, like I said before
3995.38 4054.68 speaker1  But like so I couldn't hear you or you can hear me
4052.68 4083.96 speaker2  All together they're
4077.32 4137.54 speaker1  Roughly 30 feet in the air the Sun slowly beginning its descent behind them one is four-wheeler this Familiar all-terrain vehicle adds another terrain to its already impressive resume As it seems to surf on some sort of
4134.70 4164.18 speaker3  Do you think 44 is a good roll
4162.18 4197.46 speaker1  Congratulations to no one if you Joe and Thomas both roll a d4 as Luke takes one d4 of sanity damage or I mean, sorry
4193.66 4223.64 speaker4  Zach I got bad news for you or good news. I hit my breaking point. Hey This already but every time I wake up in the mausoleum, I'm one point away from my breaking point
4220.06 4262.62 speaker1  It says if they pass read this I won't read that formed from the indelible viscous sludge that infiltrated your town and Disrupted your lives inside this thrashing swell of my I wrote this already Jesus Christ inside this thrashing swell of muck
4255.82 4287.06 speaker2  Thrashing bodies. Yeah, read your copy and add like any commentary or like embellishments later. Don't fucking Okay, do that you don't know you got it I mean
4281.62 4367.66 speaker1  inside this thrashing swell of muck are the thrashing bodies of councilwoman Carrie pages and Salem the cats their hands and paws Stretch out trying to breach this inescapable tide But their struggle does not last long their limbs fold into this ooze becoming one with a sentient Massive goop that is about to crash down upon you What do you do? You dude But the dude is pretty much cut off by the wave like the swell of like, you know when you get hit by a wave in the ocean and just kind of holds you down and for like a moment you think it's over
4365.66 4384.62 speaker2  flarp flarp flarp
4381.90 4439.86 speaker4  It's not in the thing, but I've got the case for it. No
4433.38 4547.78 speaker1  The the stuff we created in our kitchen with like borax and water and liquid glue is a lot like wetter and runnier Than the GAC like the name-brand stuff and it felt cold and wet but sort of heavy at the same time And when the stuff moved around it peeled away like it had to like make an effort to release from your skin vorish Process as you are consumed As the ooze pushes in around you it becomes increasingly difficult to move your limbs this cold wet sludge relentlessly fills every orifice in your body and you struggle to maintain a sense of optimism as you are completely enveloped in this suffocating
4541.26 4572.24 speaker2  He rolled up into as much of a ball as he could, you know, this form is not really my own. I Will survive the goo onslaught. I hope my friends will be as lucky If not, perhaps I might rip their spines out and take their corpses if this one is ruined by the goo Keith
4567.08 4581.48 speaker3  But he's just decided it's not actually happening to him. And so he's just sitting there Breathing in as normal. I
4579.48 4620.14 speaker4  This isn't how it was supposed to go
4619.10 4639.94 speaker0  Unfortunately Staring down the empty pudding cup of my existence But on the other hand, it kind of looks like rotting putrid slop like I said, I'm hungry What the fuck You
