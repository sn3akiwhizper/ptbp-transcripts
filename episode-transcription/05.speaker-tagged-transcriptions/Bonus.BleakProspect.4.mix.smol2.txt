0.00 160.44 speaker0  What's good, my nasty children? It's your busted ass ass bustin' Buster Wolf the dog. And I'm here to bust up them eardrums with my drumstick tongue. Am I Russian or am I dragon? Who can say? Prepare to get whiplashed like JK Simmons because we got a new Howlin' with Wolf. Today's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Maury from Seattle who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretendin' pod. They right. First things first, Wolf, your dulcet tones haunt my dreams to the fun Delta Green has to offer. And last things last, shout out to my friends Darian, Ryan, Robbie, and Mike. You volunteered so I could learn how to be a good handler and I promise to murder you all in fun and interesting ways. I once went to Seattle and I saw a whole bunch of crabs feasting on a mound of rotten hot dogs. Now that is a city Wolf can get inside of. If you wanna howl at your Wolf, tag us on the internet. Or write a five star review and shoot us an email or somethin'. We love hearin' from y'all. All the links are in the show notes. And while you're perusin' that vast and mysterious worldwide spider butt stuff, go ahead and do Wolf a favor. Follow at Scott Dorward on Twitter and check out his various projects, be they podcast or publication based. And maybe fill up on hugs when you feel strife. It's Grady Philip Drug with Real Life. Life, surreal, in retrospect a dream. Easy times, feel less than serene. In the moment it's hard to count your blessings so we long for days gone past us.
158.36 170.48 speaker1  All right, let's get gory and vory, baby. So the rest of you upstairs,
166.84 195.44 speaker2  having heard the orifice demanding Rothstein and having lost Rothstein and his panic through the house, what are you actually doing? This is the only room that we saw from the outside There were other lights dotted throughout the house, yeah.
192.28 231.70 speaker1  Freddie, wait, what if the brain's in here too? Do we wanna kill it before we get like the kids? I don't, I really don't know. It just might be good information to have where this thing's like neurological center is. Yeah, I mean it can hear us clearly talking about it. Oh yeah, I mean. Oh yeah, sure. Well, it seems to be in a lot of pain. All it wants is Rothstein right now. It's probably not gonna answer our questions. I wanna look around and see if I can spot anything hidden that looks like some ganglia or neurons or you know, gray matter up on the ceilings.
228.98 238.12 speaker2  where you should probably consult a medical doctor.
236.12 266.12 speaker1  I was really, I keep forgetting that they're not the same kind of doctor Yeah, it's obviously, is this a first aid roll or a medicine roll?
263.36 290.36 speaker2  Okay, you don't see anything in the room here that looks like gray matter, but yeah, you're fairly certain that what's inside this room is maybe, well, maybe working as lungs or something like lungs.
285.74 293.44 speaker0  This is all for the breathing of the apparatus here.
291.68 305.88 speaker1  Lung and tongue, yeah.
303.24 318.36 speaker2  Let's have listen rolls off the three of you 43 on a 50.
317.52 326.40 speaker1  I also failed.
322.28 359.06 speaker2  that he has heard from deeper within the house the sound of a slow, steady heartbeat. And you may be able to identify what that is. What Freddy has heard, however, is the fairly distinctive crunch or cracking sound, despairing scream and loud splash of someone falling through the floor in the kitchen. Heh heh heh heh heh heh.
354.98 366.42 speaker1  but I think I just heard someone fall through that same hole that I fell through earlier. Carl must have forgotten about the lull.
365.58 374.74 speaker0  There were stairs. There were stairs down there. Maybe they lead to wherever that hole leads.
371.30 398.50 speaker1  Do we wanna be in the digestive area of the home? What if, wait, real quick, while we're in this room with the mouth, what if we, I just wanna loudly say, He just fell into your belly. Do not digest him, please. Or we can't give you what you want.
396.38 430.62 speaker2  And it says something else. So hungry. And as it says that, its tongue starts coming out of its mouth and moving towards you like a huge fat worm. So you are turning and running. Yes. Yeah. Yep, yep. Yep.
428.62 448.94 speaker1  The tongue is the part you talk with, so let's stay around and try to talk with it. I guess we got a fucking safe call, yeah.
446.90 498.38 speaker2  Okay, so speaking of cowl, so you have tumbled down into the darkness below. There is pretty much no light down here. There is a faint, just a faint bit of light The bad news is that's because you have fallen into what feels like several feet of liquid. and you're going to have to come back up before, obviously before you can breathe. What I guess I would like is a constitution roll just to see whether you can avoid gasping or doing anything unfortunate under the water. Oh. Sorry, I said water, it's really not water.
497.06 514.78 speaker1  Yeah, it's not water.
510.54 538.02 speaker2  I mean, you've not managed to get your way up to the surface. There's something bumping around overhead. You're desperately trying not to take a mouthful of whatever this is. You can try to push the roll if you want, you are absolutely taking a lung full of this.
537.18 547.66 speaker3  Hell yeah. Fantastic.
543.18 705.02 speaker2  and you take a deep gasping breath of this foul air. which you realize is probably a really, really good thing now that you're above the surface. Because now that you're getting your bearings, you can pick up a few things, even though in the darkness. One, and possibly the most important, this liquid that you're in is caustic. It is burning your skin. It hurts. It really hurts. It's stinging your eyes. You can barely see. Your eyes are filled with tears in the liquid. The thing that was stopping you getting up was maybe an old packing crate that was floating along. that's just floating there. Some of these solid lumps of something. And there are also other more solid things that every now and then you feel wriggling under the surface. and how much sand do you start with? down there in the darkness is just falling apart fast. I mean, you can hear the sound of this girl sobbing, but you're not quite sure where it's coming from and every now and then you're certain you can hear other voices crying out down there. These things that are wriggling around under the surface, some of them, yeah, after your experiences with these things that can phase through matter, yeah, you're certain some of them are just wriggling inside you. they feel almost like hands grasping at you, trying to hold you down, pull you under the surface.
700.66 725.62 speaker3  Okay, so Carl's not doing very good. floating thing and trying to hoist myself up onto it.
722.90 798.38 speaker2  Then yeah, you've managed to pull yourself on top. I mean, the top of it is slippery and the weight inside is unbalanced. You're pretty much almost pushing it completely under the surface now with your body weight displacing it, but yeah, you are largely out of the caustic liquid. You can take two hit points of damage though, just for the burns you've taken so far. yeah, you can see that hole in the kitchen floor is now larger and there is definitely the sound of something large splashing around down in the liquid below. because you're operating on completely faulty sensory data at the moment, you're completely lost. Let's just have a luck roll to see whether you end up anywhere useful.
794.62 803.70 speaker3  And I'm just gonna try to like use my foot as a paddle so I don't get more on my hands.
801.06 820.46 speaker1  So I'm just spinning around in a circle.
818.18 822.86 speaker3  from the hole I fell into? The hole isn't above me?
821.66 824.30 speaker1  Yeah, not anymore.
823.46 831.54 speaker2  It was when you fell in, but obviously you've moved around a bit since then.
830.14 836.02 speaker3  the whole, this room is?
833.06 847.78 speaker2  that it's not just like one big room,
845.74 858.66 speaker1  He's right here, what are you talking about? He's fine, look at him. The other doctor.
857.82 870.14 speaker0  Alley-oop.
867.50 880.78 speaker1  so should we like crawl along the floor to look through the hole to see? We don't wanna trust the ground there though, right? Like, I mean, it just gave way under your weight, right? That's a good point, maybe we just go down the stairs.
879.06 886.38 speaker0  I think we should try the thing that's made to be walked down first, yeah.
885.42 891.30 speaker1  Carl.
886.38 919.54 speaker2  So yeah, from somewhere that you can't quite make out, just echoing through these walls all around you, you can hear the sound of your voice being called the voice of a little girl from somewhere down there as well going, help, help, help.
917.58 947.30 speaker3  There's a little girl down here. That's not my voice, but help me. I need your help. This is a little girl. Thank you.
945.14 983.22 speaker1  That could be one of the kids we're looking for. that the people who are kidnapping kids to put bugs in them, alien bugs, to steal their potential. I don't know if it would be weird but I think it would actually really follow. Anyway. I agree.
979.30 994.78 speaker2  But yeah, the stairs down to the cellar, you can see are covered in the same kind of slick intestinal teeth.
992.54 1015.98 speaker1  Yeah, that was smart, but if we found a sled. Then how would that help us getting back up the stairs? Tie the hose to the sled. The hose broke. The bad hose. Let's go down these stairs with full confidence that we can get back up them.
1013.50 1049.06 speaker2  you're cut off enough from the light in the kitchen that you're in almost pitch darkness. of just excrement and acid and just foulness. Your eyes are watering from it. And by the time you've made it down even about a half dozen stairs, you can feel that you are now stepping in liquid
1044.06 1060.98 speaker1  I had a friend about 20 years ago, her name was Rose. She survived the Titanic by floating on a door. What if we did the same thing?
1059.14 1071.82 speaker0  Did it fit more than one person?
1069.14 1106.02 speaker1  I don't want to make you guys cry right now. I'm already crying because the air is so accurate. of all time on top of that and it ended in tragedy. That's what happened on a whole door. So let's get three doors.
1104.10 1119.66 speaker4  I was just saying that we could potentially sled down the stairs. And then have sled door boats. Sled your boats.
1116.18 1128.38 speaker2  on the stairs while Rothstein floating around in the muck, lost in a blind panic, is just overhearing little shreds
1127.54 1142.70 speaker1  And love stories. And Titanic, yeah.
1139.90 1159.50 speaker2  of the essence here because Rothstein is slowly getting eaten away by this acid. I think with all the kicking around that you've been doing in it, trying to steer yourself, I mean, Rothstein's got to take another hit point of damage just from acid burns to his legs.
1157.74 1165.02 speaker1  Well comment, don't worry.
1163.10 1172.66 speaker0  and we'll try and navigate that one person
1170.22 1179.78 speaker2  I do want a mechanical repair role for this just simply because time is a factor.
1177.90 1189.26 speaker1  Okay, I've got a 40 in mechanical repair. 85.
1186.34 1210.78 speaker2  the problem is that this fleshy material is covered off the hinges and you can't quite see this isn't really going to be a quick job. You could try potentially going for another door and pushing the roll like that, but if you fail, it's going to take way longer than you planned.
1209.66 1225.62 speaker4  Dolan, you're a strong guy. Maybe you could just like jump into the door and bust it down. Okay.
1222.34 1232.58 speaker1  I'm gonna go size with a 29 on an 80.
1229.90 1240.62 speaker2  I mean, obviously it gets a bit damaged in the process, but there's enough of it that you can use it as a flotation device.
1238.26 1255.02 speaker1  All right, I'll take the door. I'll float on the door. You're the perfect size for it. Well, I am quite big, but we need the dock. How big are you, Freddie?
1252.10 1257.26 speaker4  Look at us standing here.
1255.02 1267.30 speaker1  You're right, I can tell in an instant that I'm about, you know, if you had to put us on a scale between
1265.42 1270.78 speaker4  probably 20 less than you.
1269.18 1275.06 speaker0  Me and Freddie look about the same.
1273.34 1284.46 speaker1  Unfortunately, we need the doctor. So maybe you should go on the door, Freddie. All right, that's fine.
1281.42 1288.14 speaker4  and sits down on it and says, Rosebud.
1285.86 1298.26 speaker1  I don't think we get that reference yet.
1295.38 1325.10 speaker2  floating on his crate in the dark and the others, you've heard the other's voices, they've come down, they've gone back up. They're having conversations up above. You can hear little snippets every now and then. They're talking about doors and boats and stuff like that. And then they come back down, but they just seem to be leaving you down here and in the dark on your own.
1322.06 1332.34 speaker3  Carl thinks it's time to take matters into his own hands and really focuses on trying to get to a wall.
1329.06 1430.90 speaker2  I think if you're trying to then just focus your mind like that, that's going to be a sanity role just to see whether you can gather your wits because at the moment, yeah, Yeah, that's not good. Then you'd lose another point of sanity as well. Just in your mind, there's something about this. I mean, you've seen the way space gets warped by the Hawke's Device and the way that it's torn through to other realms and what if there aren't any walls down here? What if you've seen how all that's leaked out from the Hawke's Device, how it's brought other parts of this realm here. What if you're not in the cellar anymore? What if you're somewhere else just floating away further and further away from everything that you know, everything that's real, just getting lost?
1425.90 1455.90 speaker3  I just sit down on the raft like with my head in my hands.
1450.90 1492.54 speaker2  So meanwhile, we have Freddy riding a door to victory. You've got the door, you've got it down the stairs. You can use it as a fairly unsteady raft. I'm probably going to ask for a Dex roll at some stage. Perfect. You can hear things moving around in the water. You know, some big things, some small things. You can hear the sound of the young girl crying. And now that you're down here and you've got a better ear for what's going on, you are 99% sure that the voice you can hear is that of Esther Frain.
1491.22 1514.70 speaker4  We can help. Karl, Karl, we're here. I'm here. We're going to get you back out of here. I'm only here for Esther.
1513.74 1520.38 speaker3  I'm here.
1518.78 1597.14 speaker2  completely different in the cellars and where Esther's voice is coming from. I mean, it's difficult to tell. I mean, you're judging this entirely on sound. Rothstein's voice is a bit muffled because he's obviously not in the same room as you. Esther's voice is quiet, but then again, she's a little girl and you don't have any visual cues really acidic liquid. I mean, by the time you catch up with Karl, you are going to take one hit point's worth of damage from chemical burns. You are covered with this and as some of the liquid splashes up over the doors, every now and then you can feel things wriggling in it.
1596.30 1625.70 speaker4  He's focused. Frederick Millen I is nothing if not focused and he is going toward Karl Rothstein. He thinks two heads are better than one for continuing our journey and collecting as many children as possible
1621.10 1638.30 speaker2  and eventually navigating around a couple of open doorways. You do eventually find this little sort of cul-de-sac where...
1634.78 1651.22 speaker4  on all the doorways that I'm crossing through on the hallways? I'm trying to make marks in the membrane to mark my path. Sure, okay.
1650.38 1674.86 speaker2  but you can try to feel for these. Oh, right, because it's pitch black. It is pitch black. But I mean, you can leave marks that you can try to feel again.
1673.74 1687.54 speaker4  Who is it? Oh yeah, he couldn't recognize me from my voice. That makes sense. It's Frederick Millen, the voice.
1685.30 1699.86 speaker3  so that we can see each other.
1694.86 1712.26 speaker2  yeah, his skin is just red with burns and blisters. His eyes are swollen up.
1708.58 1719.30 speaker4  Maybe just run a comb through those locks real quick.
1716.78 1727.18 speaker3  and some of it just falls out into my hand.
1723.22 1751.88 speaker4  And so he'll put his heels on your raft. Lock your legs with mine, put your legs on my raft. You put your fucking heels on this raft right now. We got children to save. We're here.
1751.04 1754.72 speaker1  You hear me?
1753.40 1768.08 speaker4  See, I am here forever. That's on you, but there are other people down here who have not given up and we are going to save them. You hear me? We are going to save them.
1766.68 1794.32 speaker3  And I just keep sitting. No, no, no.
1790.32 1806.16 speaker4  So I'm trying to like, I'm trying to paddle backwards and drag you along with me, I guess. But I'm literally only giving you one more room
1804.12 1829.48 speaker2  particularly as you're not getting any help from Rothstein here and you're trying to pull both of these, I do want to roll just to see whether you can do this without upsetting your raft. let's do this as a strength roll.
1828.64 1838.32 speaker1  Oh.
1833.60 1849.80 speaker4  Okay, so I rolled a 52 on a 40. So I am going to spend 12 luck. Oh, okay. Rather than pushing this roll.
1847.16 1880.36 speaker2  So yeah, I mean, your feet almost slip off. I mean, this is really slick. And yeah, in the little bit of light that you've seen from Rothstein's Zippo. Yeah, I mean, this is absolutely smeared
1878.80 1887.36 speaker4  or anything, I'm kind of hungry.
1886.40 1904.80 speaker3  Oh, fuck. Once we get to the next room, I kind of snap out of it and I look at Frederick. But what do you want me to do? I've got an idea.
1902.80 1909.32 speaker4  like you're about to keep talking.
1908.24 1923.88 speaker3  And that's a statement.
1921.28 1931.80 speaker4  She would get thrown up too, saved us time.
1930.12 1943.20 speaker3  but as soon as we get close to a wall, I'm gonna start kicking it.
1938.20 1948.64 speaker2  Because it's not really feasible to stand up on the raft.
1947.04 1952.04 speaker3  but don't stand up.
1950.20 1960.76 speaker4  Okay, now let's go.
1957.76 1975.48 speaker2  of Esther's crying as quickly as possible. Let's again, I think do this as a strength roll. So one of you can make this whichever one of you wants.
1974.44 1982.60 speaker3  I'll do it. Okay.
1980.40 2005.04 speaker2  but it's just a question of how much damage you're going to take on the way from the acid. How long it all takes. from the acid as you make your way across.
2002.36 2012.68 speaker3  The skin is like completely gone from my foot.
2009.40 2035.48 speaker2  of mobility that you used to get in that foot now. And it's probably best not to try to think too hard about why that is. or are you just checking that on when you need it?
2034.64 2038.60 speaker3  Okay.
2036.48 2093.60 speaker2  And yeah, as you get over, you can see over in the far corner, what seems to have been done is someone has built, it looks almost like a jail cell there. There are metal bars that reach all the way up to the ceiling. I mean, obviously the liquid is as high in there. You can see that Esther is there on top of a crate that she's sitting on top, just huddled, looking panicked again. She's quite badly burnt. There is also a shape floating in the liquid beside her, which yeah, it takes a little while to identify it even as being human, but there isn't really that much left of it.
2091.64 2111.96 speaker4  Can you get me out of here? and begins paddling quicker and quicker to get to the metal bars.
2109.96 2128.80 speaker2  Now that you're closer in the light, you can see the figure that's floating face down maybe. I mean, it's difficult to tell anymore. It has got the remains of curly red hair on its head.
2127.72 2152.12 speaker4  Don't look down, Esther. Just look at us. We're here to save you. It's me, Frederick Mellon the first, your favorite,
2150.16 2159.60 speaker1  Nathaniel Coombs and Thomas Tullock.
2157.64 2163.68 speaker2  and that's the point at which you realize that the door is locked.
2162.48 2205.00 speaker4  I'm the man for the job. It's a good thing I'm the one who came down here on this door. I mean, I'm still the man for the job, but I wish I wouldn't. Like he's not gonna not do it at this point. He's gonna just go for it.
2202.40 2218.72 speaker2  below the surface of this liquid and that the only way you're going to get an angle on it is going to be to get off your raft and basically stand there up to your neck in this liquid and try to do it.
2216.76 2239.28 speaker1  How do you sexually pleasure a door?
2238.20 2249.16 speaker2  Are you trying to pick the lock? Are you trying to go for the hinges? What are you doing?
2247.32 2254.96 speaker4  So can I make an intelligence roll to see which would be easier for me?
2252.56 2271.56 speaker2  I'll tell you that if you're going to pick the lock, that's going to be a locksmith's roll. If you're going to try to get the hinges, you don't necessarily have the right equipment. So that's going to be a hard mechanical repair roll.
2266.56 2293.60 speaker4  between having a 70% chance and a 10% chance, Okay, so can I lay down belly first on my door and then put my hands like armpit deep into the wet?
2291.96 2306.52 speaker2  It's far enough down that if you would try to reach down that low, you'd be putting your face in this liquid.
2303.36 2329.68 speaker4  Could try to feel around, doesn't quite get in there. And then he's like, ah, fuck, ah. When his nose is about to touch it, he's like, oh no, okay, I got to get in.
2328.68 2340.64 speaker5  I'm with you, Scott. You said, I'm going to do that first. I was like, you're going to dip your face in the acid first? So it's more like.
2338.72 2345.52 speaker2  It's like dunking for apples, except the apples are turds.
2343.28 2355.32 speaker5  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah.
2353.76 2363.12 speaker3  So yeah, go face first.
2359.60 2374.36 speaker4  So I'm going to go ahead and get off the door.
2373.36 2378.80 speaker3  Oh, damn it.
2377.80 2390.36 speaker5  God damn it.
2386.92 2401.84 speaker4  That's been pretending to be people with Scott Dorver.
2398.92 2416.52 speaker2  you can, I mean, you're not that tall, but you can just keep your head above the liquid as you work. I mean, you're having to stand on tiptoes to do so, but you can. Oh, thank God.
2414.00 2420.56 speaker4  28 on the 70, so hard success.
2418.68 2469.00 speaker2  So yeah, I mean, there, I mean, you're fumbling around with your tools, unable to see working with this acid just burning into your skin, but eventually you can feel the tumblers click into place and you can pull the door open. As you do so, the liquid moves and the floating remains of Billy Spitzer just float out past you disintegrating, you know, bits of his body going in different directions. Fuck. that you're in the liquid doing all this, take a D3 hit points of damage. Okay.
2467.56 2476.44 speaker4  As you are digested.
2474.52 2492.76 speaker2  But yeah, I mean, Esther is there. She's still perched on top of this crate precariously. That's just looking, trying very hard not to look at the remains of Billy as they float out.
2489.56 2501.84 speaker4  Look at me, can you tell me, does that flake croak? Oh, fuck, I'm losing my mind. Does that crate float
2499.68 2511.36 speaker2  I don't know, Mr. Hut, I don't know.
2509.84 2534.32 speaker1  will overweight the door. Jack weighed down rows, that wasn't gonna work. So if this kid is smart, you guys should be fine. Okay, thank you.
2530.32 2545.96 speaker4  So Frederick will kind of push forward. from off the box onto this door.
2542.36 2614.72 speaker2  just to see whether you can do this without capsizing. So you can get both her and yourself on the door So you managed to kick your way over to the door. I mean, in the process, you are going to take another one hit point of damage each. Dr. Rothstein up the stairs because the foot that he's been kicking with and navigating with, There's certainly no flesh on it and a lot of the bones have dissolved away. It's less of a foot now and more of a nub.
2611.84 2620.08 speaker4  Fredrick is just kind of like taking on both of them, you know, and is Esther strong enough to just?
2617.52 2624.96 speaker2  Yeah, you can help her up the stairs.
2622.88 2631.40 speaker0  I can help grab people.
2627.96 2652.88 speaker2  Well, I mean, Dr. Coons, as he grabs hold of Esther, yeah, you can start helping her up the stairs. You've got hold of her. What you do notice as you're helping her up the stairs is under your hands, you can feel things moving beneath the surface of her skin.
2650.28 2658.92 speaker1  and give kind of a knowing nod. We'll be able to take care of you.
2657.60 2664.20 speaker0  Where's Billy? Did you get Billy?
2661.76 2673.48 speaker3  Ixnay on the, Billy Bae.
2670.56 2677.24 speaker1  I punched the dog in the side of the arm.
2675.92 2704.76 speaker2  at this moment. And by the time you get everyone back up to the kitchen, there's now enough light that, yeah, you can see that there are things now moving around underneath her skin. of Dr. Rothstein and Freddy.
2701.48 2714.52 speaker1  Clearly you've got things moving under your skin, probably those bugs. What if we try to force up them out of you?
2712.72 2738.36 speaker2  The things you can see moving around are much, much smaller than that. is the thing that he saw crawling out of the man's eye outside.
2736.72 2754.92 speaker5  And hope they get digested?
2753.84 2761.48 speaker4  One second.
2760.12 2770.96 speaker5  I'm as good as a hospital.
2769.40 2789.08 speaker3  And then I point at my foot. Oh.
2786.20 2800.48 speaker0  We put them in the lab back there. We can keep them in there. I can run some tests. Quarantine who?
2799.64 2817.56 speaker3  Why?
2814.04 2836.00 speaker1  For anybody who's got things moving around under the skin. This is crazy. You've got them too. No, I don't. No, yeah. Yeah, they're there.
2834.80 2842.16 speaker3  to see how it goes.
2839.20 2850.80 speaker1  Why don't you be the one in there observing her? There should be exceptions.
2847.92 2855.88 speaker2  what is your plan at this stage?
2853.84 2867.04 speaker1  I mean, I want to kick him down the stairs and let him get digested.
2865.00 2873.36 speaker0  for Dr. Coombs to be okay with that.
2871.40 2884.04 speaker1  where I see if I can kick you down too.
2880.76 2895.16 speaker4  because I think we'll probably want to do some wrap up and talk about the scenario and stuff. So are you cool with doing another session? Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfect, cool. That does give you a week to see
2893.80 2909.00 speaker2  about this situation.
2907.84 2915.64 speaker1  it's a very smart idea.
2913.92 2926.44 speaker2  if I were playing this is I wouldn't kick them down the stairs when there's a nice handy hole in the floor that I could just push them through.
2924.44 2936.16 speaker3  but you shouldn't do it.
2934.40 2959.80 speaker1  to save the girl and yourselves.
2954.80 2995.80 speaker2  but I have had actual play reports from other groups that have managed to get into some of the situation than you and actually managed to contrive a positive outcome. It's never happened when I've run it because I'm a bastard.
2994.20 3014.16 speaker1  Yeah, yeah. Is there a word for that? Is it neumlexia, neumslex, neumaslexia?
3011.72 3025.88 speaker2  Is it, well, it'll be the lex part that's different because lex means kind of letters or. Letter or word, yeah. Dyspneumia.
3023.32 3031.76 speaker4  It's always good to start out with a fun fact, regardless of if we know it or not.
3030.52 3049.28 speaker5  Regardless of if it's a fact.
3048.00 3057.68 speaker1  but it's a dyscalculia. Dyscalculia.
3055.16 3065.44 speaker2  Right, well, now that we've got the rehearsal. Yeah.
3063.68 3072.88 speaker4  Like a Snapple bottle cup.
3071.20 3083.92 speaker2  or rather, last recording session, I think we'd left it so that you'd just recovered Esther from the flooded cellar.
3081.92 3091.76 speaker4  Yeah, yeah, poor Billy.
3087.52 3114.16 speaker2  The problem is that there are perhaps now too many pieces that she does seem to be crawling with parasites, as are some of you. We left it, I think, with you in the kitchen, having just made this discovery that basically everyone who's been down to the cellar is now infested.
3113.32 3136.96 speaker4  Mm. that said he wanted to push us down the stairs or through the hole in the floor. Oh yes, yes, yes.
3135.52 3145.68 speaker0  That's barbaric.
3144.00 3163.08 speaker4  and you know what we had? It said a name multiple times. It wanted to talk to... And I start tapping Luke Gintman on the head.
3160.48 3166.56 speaker1  Your character name's not- Karl Rothstein.
3164.96 3170.92 speaker4  I start tapping him on the head.
3169.72 3174.60 speaker5  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3173.00 3203.00 speaker4  He wanted to talk to him. The house wanted to talk to Karl Rothstein. It didn't want to eat him. It was lamenting the fact that it was so hungry, in one man's opinion. I kind of whispered to Karl Rothstein. I'm like, anything to keep them from pushing us down into the digestive acid again, you know?
3200.40 3207.12 speaker3  Oh, take me away.
3205.44 3210.88 speaker0  the house tongue has to say.
3209.24 3215.20 speaker1  down the stairs and be done with it?
3213.12 3218.88 speaker0  I would prefer to save people.
3217.20 3227.48 speaker1  You're not going to save the house? The trolley problem here. Two assholes or one house, you know? Which lever are you going to pull?
3225.32 3236.72 speaker0  There's a chance that the house knows how to be not a house. Maybe Karl knows something about this house being a person house.
3235.32 3240.00 speaker4  to help him be person again.
3238.32 3265.08 speaker1  It just seems like a real good opportunity to just shove him down there and get the fuck out of here. The stairs also go up. All right, well, can you guys just promise that if this doesn't work out, you'll be cool about coming back down and meeting right here where we are now and then we push you down this test. Sure.
3262.08 3293.80 speaker4  in that stone slab where we saw that big fish. We could go into the lab. I'm perfectly fine if you want to put me in the lab after all this is said and done. But until then, let's at least try to talk to the house and see if the house and Karl Rothstein can work out between the two of them, for all the little fishies living inside. Okay.
3289.72 3314.20 speaker2  obviously you can still feel the warm breath of the house moving through the corridor. And as you get back up to the top of the stairs, yeah, there is still that mouth visible in the wall
3312.16 3326.04 speaker4  in order to talk to it, personally.
3325.20 3333.64 speaker2  Rothstein.
3332.80 3361.24 speaker3  Save me.
3356.48 3398.04 speaker2  Come closer, Rothstein, come closer. It doesn't seem to be lashing out and trying to grab you, but at the same time, it is making tentative little explorations in your direction, like this monstrous worm just flapping across the ground. Foreplay.
3393.04 3411.32 speaker3  uh, um, look, you've got to tell me where you are so I can find you or help you. I, I don't know.
3407.60 3424.92 speaker2  I don't know who I am anymore. Rothstein, I don't know what I am. It has been so very long.
3423.76 3435.92 speaker1  have a lot of catching up to do. So I'm, I'm just gonna split.
3434.64 3445.84 speaker3  Austin Hawks. That's what I said. We've got to find the Hawks.
3442.92 3454.40 speaker0  does the room react to that name? Not especially.
3452.80 3472.32 speaker3  House, man.
3468.68 3507.88 speaker2  He says, as his tongue reaches out towards you. roll, just to see whether you can discourage the tongue from wrapping itself around you. Because at the moment, this is a little more tentative than his previous attack. But on the other hand, you know, it's still, I think it still wants to eat you.
3506.44 3513.16 speaker3  So what, what did you roll?
3512.24 3517.84 speaker4  That's just a failure.
3514.44 3524.12 speaker3  Yeah. OK, I just failed regularly then.
3520.24 3543.24 speaker2  So yeah, you slap at the tongue. You're not exactly a powerfully built man and you're a bit worse for wear. But on the other hand, as this monstrous, flopping, muscular tongue comes towards you, you slap at it. And it just instinctively recoils and slithers back into the mouth.
3541.56 3560.24 speaker3  I'm trying to help you. Maybe ask its name, Doc. What is your name?
3558.88 3591.24 speaker1  peeking around the corner.
3588.52 3600.32 speaker3  Was it the portal? Yes.
3597.88 3670.96 speaker2  I was trapped there. I was trapped somewhere else for so very long until until I found a way back. Am I back, Rothstein? Am I back? Bring me something to eat and we can talk.
3669.12 3683.24 speaker3  Are they in the room or where are you guys?
3681.40 3690.48 speaker2  Can you give me listen rolls?
3688.68 3699.28 speaker4  Oh, fail.
3695.32 3712.04 speaker2  that you can hear a car coming up the driveway.
3709.52 3728.00 speaker4  We got a we got we got a car coming up the chute. Oh, vroom vroom.
3724.84 3734.04 speaker0  It could be somebody who's in on on all this on all this terribleness.
3732.60 3738.48 speaker4  So he'd be a good guy to feed to him.
3735.96 3750.48 speaker1  Exactly. Yes, we feed him to this giant tongue. And by the way, around here in these times, they're called Chitty Chitty Bang Bangs.
3747.16 3757.40 speaker0  that would look out toward the drive and see what he sees.
3754.84 3780.20 speaker2  and meaty curtains aside and take a look out. But on the other hand, it is driving fairly slowly.
3776.76 3802.56 speaker0  A Chitty Chitty Bang Bang up the up the chute, like it like you said. What should we do? Should we should we meet him? Should we meet him at the door downstairs?
3800.56 3822.88 speaker4  If there were guns in me, I'd know where they were.
3821.24 3828.96 speaker1  Does it open up?
3825.12 3919.20 speaker2  I mean, it's not locked, but on the other hand, it is kind of scabbed over. that just push it back down again every time you try. the the laboratory outside and in the light that's coming out from the windows of the house, you can see that there is a man who's got out. He's wearing a fairly nice suit. You can't really make out who he is because he's wearing a mask over his face or at least some cloth tied around a bandana, tied around his face. As he gets out, he's got an electric lantern in one hand and you can just make out he's definitely got a revolver in the other hand and he's looking around. I mean, you can't read the expression on his face because all we can see is his eyes, but from his body language, he's cautious, nervous, just trying to, I guess, make out what's going on.
3917.56 3929.92 speaker0  tank is all smashed to bits.
3926.64 3939.92 speaker2  laboratory, opens up the door and heads in there.
3935.24 3960.68 speaker0  They might have a solution for the little parasite problem we've got on our hands. Do you think it's worth trying to talk to him? As opposed to what? Kidnapping him and throwing him in a house mouth?
3954.92 3966.04 speaker3  Maybe we should talk to him and then back up plan V feed him to the house. I like this idea.
3963.52 3972.64 speaker1  It's pretty out there talking, you know. All right, but let's give it a whirl.
3970.28 3977.40 speaker4  We don't have any like weapons or anything.
3976.20 3984.44 speaker3  Yeah, four on one. That's a lot of talking we can do.
3981.68 3991.60 speaker0  So maybe one of us could like hide behind the lab. And if things go south, they'll just sneak up on him from behind.
3991.08 4003.12 speaker4  Let's try. Let's try that. Let's let's do it.
3996.28 4009.52 speaker2  Throughout this plan, because you do have a frightened and rather ill 12 year old girl with you as well.
4007.64 4021.80 speaker4  We needed a fourth for the Beatles photo. No other ideas. That sounds like the best one.
4020.48 4077.24 speaker1  We could feed it to the mouth. Yeah, that was crazy. What a day. And it's how we got you to come along on this adventure.
4076.80 4149.16 speaker4  Right. Okay. So what we're going to do is we're going to go down to the front door. All right. And we're going to find a spot for you that seems like you'll be fine there. And you're just going to sit on the floor and you'll be right next to the front door. So on our way out, as we're leaving, you just come with us. We're going to get into a very nice car. When was the last time you were in a nice car, Esther? It was probably when you were being kidnapped. Sometimes when I keep talking, I dig a hole for myself, but I think everything will be fine. Look at me. Everything will be fine. Look at me. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. I'm going to have to ask somebody else. What are the baseline for charm or persuade?
4147.56 4171.76 speaker0  I've got, I've got some charms. I don't know what the baseline is. Regardless.
4170.44 4221.96 speaker3  You know, Call of Cthulhu.
4216.72 4234.72 speaker2  And she bolts out of the front door and starts running off into the darkness.
4233.40 4241.00 speaker0  Yeah, that was upsetting. Yeah.
4239.76 4256.04 speaker2  Oh, it's still being weird. Oh, shit. Okay.
4255.56 4264.04 speaker5  Seemingly. Right.
4256.84 4267.12 speaker2  In which case, yeah, the last thing I said was that, you know, she seems to, if I'd just broken up again.
4266.48 4276.12 speaker5  It did. It broke up right as you were starting again. Motherfucker.
4275.80 4288.40 speaker3  All right.
4287.64 4300.12 speaker4  What's the name? That's the name. I will be there very shortly. Record the same person.
4299.12 4307.48 speaker3  I have a cough.
4305.60 4310.28 speaker5  Been a little fevery lately, but.
4310.04 4311.28 speaker0  Yeah.
4310.96 4314.52 speaker5  Okay.
4314.04 4330.44 speaker3  Right.
4320.44 4336.88 speaker2  And as you take it down to the front door, she takes a look around at all the creepy shit in the house and then just in a panic runs out of the house into the darkness.
4336.36 4367.16 speaker0  I'm just going to... Stay with us. You're safer with us.
4356.12 4377.88 speaker2  I think at this stage, if you fail this roll, she is going to be so panicked by the situation that she is going to run into real danger.
4376.76 4406.20 speaker0  Fantastic. Bedside Manor. I pass. Brilliant.
4394.88 4430.28 speaker2  But now that she's there in the darkness and can't see what's going on and can hear all the strange things moving around in the garden, she just stops. And as you come up, she turns around and just throws herself at you and just puts her arms around your waist and starts crying.
4423.96 4447.92 speaker4  This is a song that everybody knows. That's her line. That was me doing Esther.
4446.16 4473.68 speaker1  Lose your toes.
4465.44 4488.92 speaker2  And yeah, I mean, every now and then as your parm makes contact with her, you can just feel things squirming around under your hand.
4486.16 4506.44 speaker4  As I look around my surroundings, where am I at?
4502.52 4534.92 speaker2  But, you know, has long since just gone completely wild. You can see a bit of light coming out, but you can't see any movement over there. So when you say the car, do you mean the one that the guy drove up in or the one that you guys brought? Oh, God, no, not his.
4532.88 4575.64 speaker4  Because it's been so long since we recorded this bit. I remember now, yes. We'll be here in two shakes of a chicken's thigh.
4574.08 4604.60 speaker3  Have those been invented yet?
4603.48 4608.68 speaker2  Nice, very good.
4608.08 4668.00 speaker4  OK. That way I can kind of watch his movement.
4666.36 4670.04 speaker0  That could work for our advantage, right?
4669.56 4681.84 speaker3  How?
4681.32 4687.56 speaker0  I don't know.
4686.72 4717.72 speaker3  Let's do it. Maybe we can go to the lab.
4710.00 4747.00 speaker1  And I stop by the lab and I'm like, pistol cleaners, can I see a pistol, sir? But I will have disarmed him cleverly with my ruse.
4742.60 4755.64 speaker3  And then we, how you call it, wing it from there. You asked what the ultimate goal here is.
4754.04 4768.24 speaker0  I think that's our number one. And if it's impossible or he doesn't want to or whatever, it may be feeding him to the house.
4765.16 4771.24 speaker3  Are you going to be pistol cleaning or should I talk to him?
4769.72 4783.48 speaker1  Why don't you just go try to talk to him?
4776.64 4814.76 speaker3  Maybe do you stay outside or do you come with me to beat holes again?
4807.00 4828.76 speaker4  and Thomas Dolan are inside the like entrance of the house waiting within earshot and Carl Rothstein is going to be on the stoop of the house to try to draw him out.
4825.32 4844.04 speaker2  I mean, if you think of the laboratory as being off the side, so you've got the front entrance, then it goes around the front of the house down to the side. That's where the car is parked. And then a bit beyond there, there's the laboratory.
4842.44 4853.88 speaker4  see me as I move.
4848.12 4861.88 speaker2  But the problem is that Rothstein is going to have to get a lot closer in order to really do anything.
4856.12 4878.44 speaker0  That's just kind of me and Dolan can just form like a henchman line behind you.
4871.40 4901.40 speaker2  man clattering around inside and just swearing angrily to himself over and over again. I will give you a bonus die on this because you've got some cover and he's distracted.
4900.28 4907.72 speaker3  No, 93.
4904.20 4963.32 speaker2  So if you roll the tens again and take the better of the two results. Knock, knock, knock, knock. is hitting you. You switch the lights back on inside, it's all fully lit. And yeah, you are just framed there in the doorway and you watch for a moment as he's just rustling around in the wreckage looking for anything he can salvage. And then he notices you out of the corner of his eye, looks over and immediately starts
4961.64 4988.84 speaker3  No, come on. Calm down. I am the... Tell him you're the pistol cleaner. I'm the pistol cleaner for the estate.
4987.96 5001.72 speaker2  I can see you. Oh, good.
5000.68 5019.48 speaker3  And then I walk in. Yes. At the moment.
5018.44 5071.32 speaker2  if you don't mind. He says, right, who else is here with you? I mean, he's got this white silk kerchief tied around his face and he's looking at you over the rims of that. But I mean, even just seeing his eyes, you can see just the undeniable, unmistakable expression of what the fuck in them.
5069.00 5082.20 speaker3  And I'm here to show you secrets. Come.
5076.12 5098.36 speaker1  Would you come if this terrible Henry Kissinger, like, surprised you and was like, I have secrets. I'll clean your gun. Come look at the surprise.
5095.40 5102.36 speaker2  And if I don't like the answer, I'm going to shoot you.
5100.28 5136.60 speaker3  How far into the laboratory am I? I love it when Luke asks those questions. And then I sprint out of the laboratory as to not be shot.
5131.56 5236.84 speaker2  I'm going to give you a chance then to dodge and get some cover between you and the gunfire that's coming your way. He is going to get one chance to shoot you. But because you've dodged, it's just going to be a straight roll and he's not really a gunman. So I do fancy your odds here. Yeah, I mean, clearly that dodge did help. You've dived out of the way. The bullet just wings you. It clips your left arm just as you're diving around the side of the metal door and there is searing pain. But on the other hand, yeah, it doesn't seem to have hit anything vital. You can hear the sound of this man cluttering through the debris that you left in the lab and chasing towards the door after you. You can certainly see in the light that's coming out of the doorway that, yeah, Rothstein darts out, dives out of the way, there's gunfire, and then he staggers.
5235.00 5255.72 speaker0  And so, yeah, we're like preparing a move.
5254.92 5275.48 speaker1  We accompanied him. Oh shit, that's right.
5268.44 5281.56 speaker2  So whichever one of you has got the worst stealth roll, make a stealth roll just to see whether you're going to get the jump on him.
5280.84 5291.90 speaker1  Yeah. Yeah, I've got the same.
5291.40 5296.68 speaker4  Right.
5296.28 5308.04 speaker1  Okay.
5303.88 5333.08 speaker2  this, you're there within the light that's coming out of the doorway. And yeah, as you're getting into position, he is going to get a chance to react to this. And the bad news is because he's got a prepared gun, he is almost certainly going to act before either of you. it?
5332.44 5342.52 speaker0  Yeah. Okay.
5338.52 5367.00 speaker2  And I think Thomas Dolan is the larger of the two men. So yeah, I'm pretty certain he's going to shoot you. This is going to be point blank range, so we'll get a bonus die.
5365.32 5383.72 speaker4  It's fucking 8 AM. How did you get Andy's frozen custard this early in the morning?
5381.56 5391.56 speaker1  Jesus Christ, guys.
5390.28 5418.68 speaker3  You guys look great. in a medium. Hey, thank you.
5413.08 5450.60 speaker2  He is clearly not expecting two of you to jump out at him, even though you've been pretty obvious about it. The shot just goes clanging into the metal door beside you and ricochets back into the lab. Now, are the two of you just trying to deck him at this stage then?
5450.28 5452.84 speaker1  Pow!
5451.24 5474.36 speaker2  Give me a fighting brawl roll. He is going to try to fight back by pistol whipping you. So what did you get on your fighting brawl roll? Because I got an extreme success. I rolled a zero four.
5472.44 5482.76 speaker1  Very good, but not good enough.
5479.96 5485.64 speaker2  doing so because extreme successes do maximum damage.
5484.28 5525.56 speaker1  Do I spend luck points on that? Yes, yes, if you have enough. I don't think Thomas Dolan does. I think he lost. Yeah, I think I lost all my luck.
5518.92 5538.12 speaker2  So basically, as you come in to try to deck him, he ducks underneath, brings his gun up, just backhands you across the face. And there is this almighty crunching noise as he breaks your nose and blood goes flying.
5537.08 5567.00 speaker1  Lights out. And now he's taking all his time killing me.
5566.20 5581.64 speaker4  Go for it. He's open, baby. He just took a shot. Fucking chomp that.
5580.20 5591.40 speaker2  You do get a bonus die on this.
5590.68 5600.92 speaker5  It's a 22. Okay, doctor.
5599.32 5606.86 speaker2  You're not using your weapon at this stage. So it's just going to be a d3 plus any damage bonus you've got.
5606.36 5619.42 speaker0  Okay. Total.
5615.50 5646.62 speaker2  And you split the bottom of his lip. There's a bit of blood running out and he staggers back for a moment. And he looks really pissed off about this. He's now going to try to shoot you. What's...
5638.62 5661.66 speaker4  I think Frederick Mellon the foist began his waddle, his quick waddle, right toward the door, getting ready to join in on the action. Yeah, and then I'm going to try to disarm this man.
5659.18 5714.54 speaker2  He is going to act first, I think. Yeah, he is because that's plus 50 on his decks. And unless anyone's got a decks of higher than 115, he's going first. Let's see how this goes for Dr. Coombs. Okay. Oh, hang on. It's point blank. He gets a bonus die. So both my rolls were 84s. So that's good. He's staggering back and he's firing wild. The bullet just goes between you and Frederick and you hear it smack into the car behind you.
5713.98 5726.62 speaker3  Different car.
5720.30 5769.68 speaker2  One thing you can see as well, actually, yeah, because Dr. Coombs got a solid blow on his face, his cachif is coming loose. As he steps back into the light that's coming out of the laboratory, it comes down and you can see that his face, there's something wrong with his face. You can see his mouth there, but the problem is all the other mouths, all these little mouths with teeth that have just opened up all over his face and seem to be screaming in pain from the blow. Frederick, to make sand rolls.
5769.18 5781.26 speaker4  OK. Fail.
5779.50 5823.18 speaker2  I mean, you see much worse things today. Dr. Coombs loses three points. But Dr. Coombs, on the other hand, was already indefinitely insane, I think. So this pushes him over into another bout of madness anyway. I mean, there's gunfire going off. You're not someone who is used to combat. You've seen Thomas go down. You've nearly been shot to yourself. I think you're just running away blindly into the darkness.
5820.78 5842.94 speaker0  That sounds like what Coombs would do.
5841.90 5898.78 speaker3  Well, it's up to you. I feel like I'm down to three hit points and I start running away. But then when I hear the other gunshots and stuff go off, I turn around and I see between Nathaniel and Thomas what is going down and I look to see what Frederick Mellon is doing.
5896.94 5905.02 speaker2  and you're going to try to get the gun off him?
5900.46 5924.30 speaker4  I'm a very stealthy man and I've been known to steal things off of people a lot by misdirection. So I'm going to try to flick a coin in the air and then while he's looking at my hand that's up in the air, just grab the gun out of his hand, maybe.
5922.30 5983.10 speaker2  instead of fighting brawl for the maneuver. So that is a complete failure. He's trying his hardest just to ignore the very obvious distraction that you're doing. But there's just something so compelling about the way you flick that coin. That he's just bringing the gun back to smack you in the face with it and he's just looking up at the coin and then he's looking down at his empty hand and just muttering, oh fuck, not again, to himself.
5982.62 5990.54 speaker5  Every time. Decades of practice.
5986.46 6011.26 speaker4  And with that, I think on the extreme success, by the time he realizes what's going on, I'm backed out the door. Gun still pointed at him and hollering back to my comrades. He's got my coin.
6006.30 6013.50 speaker2  look buddy, don't shoot, you know, I'm sure we can talk this out, right?
6012.78 6023.10 speaker1  Just the one mouth.
6021.26 6036.94 speaker2  I can get you all the money you want. I don't want money.
6031.34 6063.66 speaker4  I forgot about my chief concern in life, which is also stealing money from rich fucks like you. Yes. I also want money, but mostly right now I would like answers. Do you look at my skin? Look at my face. I see that your face is equally fucked up in a different measure, Oh, yeah. What do you got?
6061.26 6155.74 speaker2  You got some of the entities inside you now? Yeah, I don't know what you do about that. I mean, those aren't like species 17. I mean, those things, when they go inside you, we can just fish them out and yeah, that's good. But what do you got inside of you? No, we've seen those before and yeah. Look, between you and me, buddy, I was coming in here to clean this place out, take what I could and just abandon it because last night these things got out. You know, things like what's crawling around inside you, they're everywhere now. It's too dangerous here now. You'd have to be an idiot to hang around here. I mean, I guess they're not from the same dimension as the rest of us. I don't know. You might be able to do something with the Hawke's device and I don't know, just face certain types of matter. It's not something I've ever tried doing. Keep talking. I know Hawke speculated about stuff like that, but I mean, he's gone.
6153.58 6190.94 speaker4  But you're Sedgwick, right? Yeah. I need you to close my story and give me back. Every Tuesday night.
6188.62 6209.50 speaker0  No one listening will get that reference.
6207.26 6230.54 speaker2  I don't know that we're even going to get it working. I mean, some idiot pulled the tank over. There's water everywhere. I'm sure it shorted out half the electrical circuits in here. I don't know if we'd even get this working again.
6229.42 6235.02 speaker4  That's the man behind me.
6233.50 6252.30 speaker3  I'm back that you shot me. Fuck you.
6244.54 6280.40 speaker2  So Dr. Coons is running through the undergrowth, running through the darkness. There's thorns and branches whipping past you, cutting your skin. You can hear things moving in the darkness all around you. You can feel the wet traces of things that you're brushing against. And you don't know where you're going now. You're just running blindly in a panic. So I think what I'd like is a luck roll.
6279.90 6298.70 speaker5  Nope. I've got zero of it.
6295.18 6353.74 speaker2  all of a sudden, your feet go out from under you. And you realize that you've run into, fallen into the remains of what was probably an ornamental pond out here, and just gone splash into this filthy stagnant water. I mean, the good news is that this suddenly brings you out of the panic you're in. There's just this cold, this almost freezing splash of water in the face just shocks you back to some kind of semi-coherent state of mind. You can hear the water moving around you.
6352.54 6365.42 speaker0  Is it that shallow?
6357.58 6379.02 speaker2  I mean, this is one that they've obviously dug in the garden because it looks pretty. Are you somewhere in this pond that is shallow enough for you to stand up?
6378.22 6383.26 speaker5  I got the zero.
6382.06 6409.98 speaker2  Oh, oh dear. Yes, of course you've got zero. And as you drop down, your head dips down below the surface. You can feel the bottom, the muddy bottom of it down there, but it's just too far. If you stand at the bottom, the water is just inches above your head.
6408.38 6424.06 speaker0  he's still in self-preservation mode. And so he's just going to try and swim to the nearest bank. Try to get out of the water. Maybe a little frenzied.
6421.98 6561.74 speaker2  before it takes a lively interest in you. And that will be a swim role. So you're probably a bit out of practice and you're splashing around in the water and you're fully dressed as well. They're pulling you down and just in the darkness, you don't have your bearings and you're splashing around in the cold. There's just the shock of being in this cold water. But yeah, somehow, I mean, you splash around and you just get to the muddy edge of the pond. But it is muddy, it's slippery. You put your hand on it and you haven't managed to get close enough for you to really get a grip on it before something starts wrapping itself around your neck. It reaches up around your body, reaches up around your neck and it feels soft at first. But then there are all these sharp bits that start digging in. So I think let's give you one chance to break away from this before it dines on you. So that's a hard success versus your ordinary one. Yep. as he reaches for the banks, his fingers digging into the mud. There is a brief disturbance. There's bubbles that come up and a little froth of something that's not water. But then the water goes very still again and stays that way.
6561.34 6592.86 speaker5  Yes.
6590.38 6651.18 speaker2  You were discussing what to do. Rosslyn had made his presence known. Dolan at this stage, I think, is beginning to come around. I mean, you've been half awake for a few moments, but you're beginning to get your senses back. That your head hurts like a motherfucker. But your thoughts are beginning to come back together into something coherent. I mean, whatever he's done to you, I mean, as you're feeling the wound and it's not just a cut, but you're certain that there's bits of your skull moving under your fingers that aren't supposed to move. But on the bright side, you do know a doctor. As long as you can get to him and you should be fine.
6648.94 6661.82 speaker1  We're so lucky we brought Nathan Coombes along.
6660.70 6686.70 speaker3  I'm a doctor.
6683.90 6689.02 speaker5  Yeah, I think this is...
6688.46 6718.94 speaker3  Oh, that's a criticism. Wait, what? Are we doing that?
6716.62 6723.82 speaker1  He bends over and reinflates me from the other end.
6723.02 6726.78 speaker5  OK, yeah, yeah.
6726.06 6791.50 speaker2  Yeah, we need to... stop his head getting any worse. I mean, he is going to need proper medical attention at some stage. But at least you can get him to the stage where he can move around without it being life threatening. It doesn't set your hair on fire. There's too much blood in your hair for it to catch. Just kind of singes it. Four.
6790.22 6799.82 speaker1  I'm at three, baby.
6796.78 6837.44 speaker2  You've been talking to him about the situation. I mean, with all the damage Brink did here, I don't know whether we're going to get it working again. But if we can, I don't know. I mean, maybe we can get these parasites out of you. But there's a good chance that it's all going to go horribly wrong. And you're just going to get lost there. You willing to take that risk?
6836.94 6847.02 speaker4  Yeah. Let's give it the old college try. Carl, get in here.
6844.86 6854.54 speaker2  He says I helped build all this. I was Hawks' lab assistant.
6852.94 6859.10 speaker4  I've got a gun pointed at you. That's all I'm doing this whole time.
6857.10 6862.46 speaker3  What is the plan?
6859.10 6868.38 speaker4  You are helping this gentleman fix me. I need fixed, too.
6864.54 6874.70 speaker3  Look, and I hold up my arm and it's crawling around.
6871.50 6929.82 speaker2  They'll suck the life out of you within a day or two. you know, rewire anything that needs to be rewired. We can try, but look, I understand how to make this thing work. I understand the basics of it. I don't know if I can adapt it to do what you're talking about. We both do.
6927.26 6946.62 speaker1  one time, but I internalized all of that. I would say I have exactly 25 percent of a master's skill in electrical repair.
6945.42 6965.34 speaker2  probably going to be Dr. Rothstein unless you want to play on hard mode. Rothstein just to see whether you can repair the electrics.
6964.86 6980.30 speaker3  Damn it.
6976.38 7006.62 speaker2  all this water across here, that it has fried a lot of the circuits. And now that it's been here for a while, it's seeped in, you might be able to take some shortcuts. You might be able to just bypass entire sections of it. But, you know, this is an unfamiliar device. You don't know what effects that might have. You could push the roll if you want and try doing that.
7001.02 7035.10 speaker3  I find two exposed wires and look at them and push them together. And, uh, 90. What, really?
7030.22 7042.22 speaker2  fucked this all up until Sedgwick switches the machine back on.
7039.10 7061.98 speaker4  I have the utmost confidence in this man right here. Dr. Rothstein's the smartest, most capable doctor. I mean, he can see the future. He's a psychic. So I don't want to hear any of this. Oh, can he do it? Can he do it? Obviously, he got it right.
7060.70 7247.82 speaker2  Rothstein of the Miskatonic. I've read your papers. I'm sorry. You should have said who you were. Well, all right. I mean, obviously, yes, I mean, I'll take your word for it. If you think this is all going to work now, then yeah, let's power it up. Oh, I feel better about this already then. All right, gentlemen, stay outside the circle for safety, but we should be all right to turn it on now. And it all sparks into life. around is this containment ring. ring as it did before. But this time it doesn't stop. And more than that, it is accelerating. I mean, even before you have a chance to turn and start running and leaving the lab, it is just spreading out. Sedgwick is screaming in terror as he just sees the world around him changing and being consumed by these alien dimensions crashing in. You can see the ground around you changing into something that's not quite a marsh, but maybe a marsh is the closest thing that your brain can make of it. And there are things in it. There are things all over the place. You look around for the door, for the laboratory and the walls, but they're not anywhere now. There's just this marsh that's spreading out and these strange clouds and these things moving through the air and moving through the liquid around you. And there are the large things, the large things that you're one of which you saw coming before and you managed to switch the machine off. But now you realize that's just one of a herd and they have you surrounded. Sedgwick is looking around in panic, trying to switch the device off, but the device isn't there anymore. The switch isn't there anymore. And just with a look of absolute defeat, he just collapses down into the muck and starts crying.
7247.18 7269.18 speaker5  What room?
7266.94 7277.34 speaker3  nobody puts Carl in a portal. And I shoot myself.
7274.62 7286.06 speaker4  Rock, paper, scissors, Thomas Dolan for the last bullet.
7282.70 7295.50 speaker1  So he was never a good person. Shoot. Okay. This is a paper. You win.
7294.62 7316.62 speaker4  He threw rock. And, uh, Frederick Millen the first takes the gun in his hands and holds it up to the skull of Thomas Dolan and is like, you're welcome and fires.
7316.22 7335.74 speaker1  relief. He was a good man.
7331.18 7395.02 speaker2  like they just tear you apart and, and digest you or anything like that. There's, there's a part of you that is now forever within them, just they're still conscious. And you can see, you get this realization that, you know, when hawks broke free, that it wasn't just hawks that came back. It was one of these things as well that had basically assumed the identity of hawks or assumed his memories the way that they're now assuming yours. And, and of course, Edgwick's. And who knows? I mean, maybe, maybe if someone ever repairs the device and fires it up again, you can find a house of your own one day.
7393.74 7415.90 speaker1  Should have killed myself.
7414.78 7418.70 speaker5  Oh, thank you.
7417.98 7421.90 speaker1  Thank you so much.
7421.10 7439.58 speaker4  Holy shit.
7438.54 7461.26 speaker2  repair before.
7454.30 7467.90 speaker4  That was, I can't, I can't, I can't say enough how much fun that was and how, how horrible that was.
7465.74 7470.46 speaker2  I had an absolute blast running it for you.
7469.90 7481.98 speaker3  Super fun.
7480.38 7505.42 speaker4  the scenes on this scenario. was going on? I'm very curious about two things. One, the faceless man, part of it, me thinks that, you know, having a kerchief covering all the mouths might, might be a faceless being, but the puppets.
7504.46 7510.86 speaker0  Yeah, okay.
7510.54 7515.18 speaker4  Okay.
7513.58 7526.94 speaker0  Did they bring it into the camp? Camp with them for some reason?
7520.46 7549.10 speaker2  And what the way it works is when they come into the camp, they wear earplugs of wax and they have this thing that they, one of them just carries on his arm. And when they want to basically knock people out, they just stick a pin in it and make it scream. And it's scream just sort of drives people temporarily into madness and unconsciousness. Nice.
7547.82 7561.58 speaker4  How many of them are there? Them. Capital T. There were four.
7557.90 7710.56 speaker2  around there and get some information about what might have happened. That basically- Why would we do that? But yeah, I mean, it doesn't happen very often, but it's definitely an option. There are these four guys, I mean three initially, so it's Sedgwick who started it all off. So when Aston Hawks disappeared, Sedgwick took over possession of the device, the Hawks device. And he realized that some of these creatures they were pulling back, this species 17, would basically siphon, in Call of Cthulhu terms, luck off people. So it would siphon some power and certainly luck and allow you to transfer it from one person to another. So basically, he and a few friends were using this in a predatory manner going into initially targeting people they just didn't like, business rivals or people who were snooping into their affairs and stuff like that. This was why so many people in the camp, their lives had basically collapsed because Sedgwick and his friends had basically been sucking all the luck out of their lives. Damn. They just carried on doing that and, you know, using the luck to play the stock market and make themselves wealthy even during the Great Depression. The previous night, they'd taken these two kids back to, you know, they'd taken Billy and Esther back to the Hawks mansion to try to siphon some luck out of them. And that was the point at which they'd lost containment on the ring, which had already been playing up a bit. And basically, Hawks got out and possessed the house and other things happened. And they ran away and left the kids in prison downstairs and just thought, fuck this for a game of soldiers, ran off and were making plans basically to leave town and abandon all this before it got any worse. That's great. out and infesting the house and so on. But the big breach that let Hawks out was just the previous day and it was just big enough to reach the house.
7709.76 7732.48 speaker4  We can leave that.
7726.16 7778.56 speaker2  Yeah, if someone does have the wherewithal to start making modifications to the Hawks device, you can do what Sedgwick suggested and basically use it to sort of phase extraterrestrial matter out of your own body and remove the parasites that way. I'm always open to creative solutions, but that's the one that occurred to me.
7776.88 7794.16 speaker3  and then you don't have to worry about it.
7789.92 7820.08 speaker2  and so on, he basically did the same thing but as this monstrous entity. He'd been fused with one of these giant things that you saw lumbering around and that basically did the same thing. It became a parasitic infection in the house and fused with it. That's so cool. Yeah, shit dude.
7819.28 7843.20 speaker4  Oh, okay. So the marsh essentially that was once the garden where Thomas Dolan found that guy, that was from the breach the night before?
7837.28 7861.68 speaker2  house, was basically looking for something to loot and had been attacked by the parasites in the garden. They basically just drained him. So that was like a some foreshadowing of what was going to happen to you if you didn't manage to get the parasites out?
7856.00 7882.80 speaker4  And while over the past, I mean, you mentioned earlier, we had three weeks in between knowing
7881.68 7892.88 speaker0  Yeah, yeah.
7887.52 7926.32 speaker2  But yeah, the big breach offered a chance for some larger nasties to get out. I'll take you all.
7925.52 7937.04 speaker1  On a high note.
7935.44 7942.50 speaker3  Milton Keynes, where would we go? Oh, gosh.
7942.00 7954.32 speaker4  Yeah.
7953.28 7965.28 speaker2  There we go.
7959.60 7968.00 speaker1  Okay, so bachelor number one, if I was a salad, what kind of dressing would you put on me?
7966.56 7978.32 speaker5  That's a bit personal, isn't it?
7975.12 7990.16 speaker3  I would say ranch because it's not legal and I'm a bad boy.
7989.20 7996.72 speaker4  This was so much fun. I know. So we long for days gone past us, grief and strife, but that's real life.
