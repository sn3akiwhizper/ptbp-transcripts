0.00 6.48 speaker1  Cock-a-doodle-doo, my chickadees.
3.16 290.96 speaker0  It's your mother hen, T.J. Wolf the dog here, to sit on you and increase your body temperatures with the warm embrace of my bum. I am giving you life energizing force live from 694.2 PTBP. The only radio station that broadcasts to all chickens across the dimensions. All of them hear this. They all know what you all think about them now. Be wary and beware. Hey, lean in close. Let's shake it up because I've been shook. This is me beside myself and I'm howling with Wolf at two you slashes who have nailed me to a wall with a handful of dimes in my mouth. A detailed description by user, resistor0 underscore zero was titled, My View of the Wolf and reads as follows. Wolf the dog always pops up in my mind as a crusty Chester Cheeto version wolf covered in a restaurant trash bag grease. That is all. I can maybe assure you of that. Chester Cheeto wishes he could get close to my beauty, my grace, my grease. And a sopping wet illustration of supposedly yours truly was provided by user, BlueBlairyBlob. Is this what I truly look like? Has anyone ever actually seen me? Can the human vision orb even perceive me? Draw them and show them to me and show them to the internet. If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod on the internet and reveal your true self to your internet friends. Or I guess do something rad on Reddit. I'm not sure I'm allowed to ask this of you, but it'd be oily as all get out to see recommendations for wolf the dog in 694.2 crew on big old internet places like broad RPG subreddits and niche Facebook groups and freaky deaky discords. Word of mouth is the word of the mouth. Spread the word like Uzi Fogg and cover folks and wolf the dog. It feels good when you know you've locked onto a really good new catchphrase. Last time, the church doors creaked open and a group of uniform school children took on the steep incline to reach the top of the gorge on the same side where Stevie and the rest of the can crew were checking on the sopping wet fox godel. When the party of prep schoolers got close enough, Beck zoomed in and saw blood on their uniforms. And also one kid walked on all fours and one was a kangaroo that walked like a dude. And the last weird one was a humanoid with the face of a pug. And that pug face student had a Jaguar on a leash that eventually jumped toward a bright spotlight onto the unnaturally smooth cliff face and to its death. And the city action news field team shot a stunning little clip with a horrifying background. unmoving across the rift. Enough with the rift. Let's hear a riff. It's Alter Girl with My Life Is Great and It's All My Fault. And it's all my fault.
289.12 292.96 speaker1  I know that is the, that's the message.
290.96 298.16 speaker2  If you live on Australia, you can probably get it. On Australia?
294.12 303.90 speaker1  If you live on Australia, you drink Fosters
303.06 320.82 speaker2  Oh my God. We're about to kill a kangaroo.
319.26 331.64 speaker1  Dog your Barbies, bitches. Cause these boys from the Ozarks are coming from you, Australia. Coming.
330.82 337.54 speaker2  Coming from you. Coming from you. We're coming from you. We get where you're coming from,
335.54 342.66 speaker1  but we're going to kill your kangaroo.
341.82 357.18 speaker2  We're coming back. We're coming back. Just kill him.
354.22 380.26 speaker1  And I got one thing to do right. One thing before I can pass easy. he would see the kangaroos and be like, I can do that. I'm totally better than that. I can do that.
377.82 389.50 speaker2  Julius is like, shit animal. He would look down at his thighs and be like, so what?
386.58 395.42 speaker1  That pissed him off. Cause he didn't have one. Damn.
393.14 398.98 speaker2  and is immensely popular at a young age.
397.68 409.30 speaker1  Let's go. Let's get 30 seconds of silence actually. Let's kill this energy. Agreed. I was going to say kangaroo jack, crocodile Dundee, a cry in the dark.
407.26 415.16 speaker2  There was a crocodile person over there too. Wearing a school uniform.
413.78 418.38 speaker1  Oh, yeah. Are there any others?
417.54 433.30 speaker2  The Sapphires? The proposition. Ah, the proposal.
429.30 437.10 speaker1  I would watch a Nicole Kidman Mad Max reboot.
435.54 444.78 speaker2  to the theater energy these days. I don't know what it is. The sheep fucker's daughter.
443.54 467.42 speaker1  I think that was it. in Australia now. Shout out to Luxembourg. Shout out.
465.44 473.38 speaker2  unlike those fucking Australians. No, I'm like, I want to go to Australia. It seems so cool.
471.46 501.42 speaker1  Oh fuck, the movie was called Australia. Oh no.
499.98 508.46 speaker2  or they're going to want this every time.
506.98 524.74 speaker1  Listen two weeks from now. So everything's fine seemingly. Yeah, everything's fine.
522.30 542.90 speaker2  We got that last little stinger there. It's in the can. Julius was showing Cal how to use TikTok. What time is it? I imagine cinematically it was like the sun was setting
540.62 546.54 speaker1  Are they like, are they grownups?
544.94 565.98 speaker2  The kids are the animals. There's six normal kids and then. Exactly, you know, I'm just describing it as people, right?
565.14 569.14 speaker1  I forgot to ask them their names. Yeah, you gotta yell out.
567.30 582.54 speaker2  Hey, Stevie, do you know any of those kids' names? No. That's the one I liked the least.
581.54 587.62 speaker1  That is correct. And then there was a kangaroo.
584.02 603.16 speaker2  So you're not sure of the ages from either of them. Yeah, the kid who was on the ground is a kid crawling. You've got the pug man. That is a much taller creature, humanoid, than the children. And then kangaroo is kangaroo.
602.32 604.42 speaker1  I would say.
603.16 615.50 speaker2  Oh no, you said walking kind of human-like. Walking almost up on its toes to walk more human-like. Oh.
614.56 632.88 speaker1  Please? Please. as we're driving back to the. I was a little worried that there would be something in the lockers. I'm not gonna do that to you, huh? Okay.
631.10 663.82 speaker2  Everything that you brought, you grabbed. You had enough time there. You took the time to shoot a little segment, you know, and nothing bad happened. for like 15 minutes while we shot our segment and then packed up leisurely. It felt very ominous. Julius already got his shoes. And you look down and see that his shoes are tied.
662.40 676.54 speaker1  Not just individually, nicely. Yeah. Like that supplies.
673.82 679.82 speaker2  And you would like duct tape and everything. Yeah, you guys are awful people.
678.98 681.98 speaker1  Yeah, of course.
681.02 695.06 speaker2  We're a film crew. We have useful things. and he is still unconscious. And she's like, I guess we should try
691.78 698.90 speaker1  to make him comfortable that way he stays this way as long as possible.
697.26 702.56 speaker2  in the weeds here theologically.
700.28 710.14 speaker1  could God microwave a burrito so hot
707.66 713.54 speaker2  Is he constrained by the limits of his physical form?
710.18 715.94 speaker1  Well, I have to assume he was a turtle for a reason.
713.54 721.90 speaker2  How do we get him back into something like a turtle?
720.10 724.86 speaker1  Oh yeah, we gotta like decree the turtle, the new mayor, then kill him.
723.44 727.50 speaker2  Do we have to kill him?
724.86 747.10 speaker1  Maybe not, maybe just decreeing a new mayor makes it like automatically transfer. Let's try. out of the gates of the wall.
743.50 764.90 speaker2  that are like dead end, road stops here, no outlet, please stop. There's like some danger signs. And you're on this road all by yourselves and there's no streets that are like coming off of these streets, do you know what I mean?
761.66 775.14 speaker1  Julius wants to, not all of them at the same time because the algorithm, but upload at least one crazy TikTok.
773.46 782.94 speaker2  You took a few while we were there. Should we actually pause and like figure out what they were?
779.90 789.34 speaker1  the year dance before we got attacked by the Jaguar.
786.58 794.50 speaker2  Technically that includes the Jaguar attack. He hits the window as you were filming,
792.54 807.76 speaker1  Right, but then there's one of us. That's what I was talking about. to rescue Chuck. So there's that one and I think that one includes us doing funny walks, sneaking.
804.32 814.28 speaker2  Yes, there is the good sneaking one across the plant wall. And I assume it also has you pointing it right in my face as I say turn that off and get on the fucking train.
812.84 840.32 speaker1  That's in that one. There's also the one where you're in the it pitch. Yep, behind. Did I get the Jackalope attack? Yes, exactly. It totally got me, dude. It snuck up on me with malicious intent. It wasn't my fault.
839.48 845.84 speaker2  Whoa.
844.44 850.56 speaker1  He's gonna do the Jackalope attack.
848.72 852.30 speaker2  Beck, is it okay if I show this?
850.56 877.44 speaker1  I think that's like probably the best one It gives a taste of the thing that is crazy, but it's not the craziest. and then, oh no, Jackalope attack.
875.76 882.72 speaker2  Oh, perfect. So now we need to do an algorithm roll
879.60 886.36 speaker1  to see how well it favors us. How well it favors us. Is that audio being used?
884.92 908.08 speaker2  Do you think this is a straight up luck roll?
906.72 918.80 speaker1  You know what that means. Spend some luck. Do you have luck?
914.44 922.16 speaker2  What is your, no, what's your notification sound bite? And also give me your luck coin.
921.32 934.40 speaker1  Flick it. Nice. So good. What's the notification on the phone?
931.68 948.42 speaker2  Like that he received the notification noise? I assume he means it's about to start blasting off. Si, se puede. Yes, we can.
947.58 955.48 speaker0  Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can.
954.00 962.80 speaker2  And we're back. Your phone is just lighting up. And so is Julius's face.
961.62 969.44 speaker1  Which he's picking at furiously.
968.28 977.28 speaker2  I miss that man. And we're driving.
975.76 980.88 speaker1  or whatever twice. And both times it was a thing.
978.10 985.04 speaker2  Their eyes just get fucking huge when you say that.
983.60 990.12 speaker1  Is that like part of it?
986.74 996.00 speaker2  you're looking in the rear view mirror at Stevie's face, which is pointed directly at the road.
992.40 1006.56 speaker1  No flinching, no moving, just yeah, I, They used to say that's how it would change bodies.
1003.20 1025.96 speaker2  that he was gonna come back like he was And the story goes would, and they kind of take their hand and do the like under the chin, throw the hand back and forth thing. Throw their hand back and forth.
1024.40 1033.80 speaker1  Throw their hand back and forth. It's not necessarily that they leap off of something.
1031.52 1038.20 speaker2  Yeah, a leap of faith as it were.
1036.96 1040.40 speaker1  Here's the deal, like do we need to keep,
1038.20 1046.08 speaker2  Hey Zach, do you call it the leap of faith in your notes? Did I nail that?
1045.08 1059.40 speaker1  It's a little smile. Like we're going to have to like,
1058.56 1069.48 speaker2  Well. I've got a basement in my townhouse. You can't jump off of that.
1067.60 1075.04 speaker1  or are they basically zombies?
1073.64 1087.08 speaker2  Rest in peace little guy. what did you get out of Chuck? It seemed like he was pretty much driven to throw himself off that gorge.
1083.28 1100.20 speaker1  I met Jeremiah Krumpy, but long after he was deceased. He's buried behind Fox's house and I tripped over his grave.
1099.36 1116.28 speaker2  Yeah. They caged his grave site. Yeah, I thought it was a bit odd,
1113.36 1123.00 speaker1  Yeah, that's my biggest fear is that when he gets conscious, he's just going to start like grabbing scissors and poking them in his eye.
1119.52 1161.52 speaker2  Yeah, that's, and she points at the zip ties. Man, when we get back in Cal, Colorado's on Bumble and trying to have a dinner date, while God is in his basement trying to kill himself. That's going to be great. I think we're on to something. Tell me about that basement. No, no, God will be quite comfortable in the basement, I think.
1160.68 1163.96 speaker1  We're saying this is God.
1163.12 1169.72 speaker2  Greg. Greg. Gregle. Gregertle. Don't make it weird.
1168.44 1175.64 speaker1  I mean, it can just be Greg
1173.72 1187.52 speaker2  Wait, was Greg Fox's name?
1186.68 1209.64 speaker1  at this point. But if it is God, do you think we have like an obligation to like keep that to ourselves and like make sure that he doesn't do bad things or? but he did go to church.
1206.52 1223.48 speaker2  Whatever it is, it seems to be a very dangerous and powerful thing. And I think you're right, Beck. I don't know who we can trust with this shit. I think we leave him out of the edit, if you know what I mean. And maybe don't mention he came back to town.
1220.60 1231.72 speaker1  I guess like our first like thing would be to try just like declaring like you have a pet goldfish that we can say is the new mayor and just see if that works.
1229.72 1232.56 speaker2  No, Goldie died several weeks ago.
1231.72 1236.20 speaker1  Oh, Cal.
1232.56 1251.92 speaker2  Maybe something that lives a lot longer than a goldfish, like a rock. I do have a pet rock somewhere. Whom? Bon Jovi.
1250.46 1258.48 speaker1  Thank you. Oh, nice.
1256.32 1267.58 speaker2  Here's what I propose. We cut the story and get the word out to the world about what they're doing there. I don't think we should tell anyone we have Greg.
1266.74 1278.36 speaker1  Agreed. But everything else? Everything else.
1277.50 1286.84 speaker2  and our own safety. We don't know who would wanna come for us. Right now, it's those weird fucking kids
1283.68 1294.86 speaker1  Dude, when the world sees the footage, though, like, we are going to change the world, yo.
1292.92 1300.14 speaker2  I'm sorry, I forgot about 9-11. Heh.
1299.32 1309.40 speaker1  It's obviously not as big as 9-11. Moment of silence.
1305.90 1324.28 speaker2  This could potentially be as big as 9-11. This podcast is bigger than the Beatles.
1320.52 1351.08 speaker1  Okay, so like, yeah, the plan is get Greg, God, Greg God into Cal's basement. and we'll just see if that works. And like, if that doesn't work, we're back to square one, in the process, yeah, of course. So we're gonna go, like, take the footage
1348.76 1358.36 speaker2  No, no, no, we need to get Greg in the basement, but then Stevie and I could maybe take care of him
1355.28 1381.48 speaker1  I look over at Julius, are you still at like, two hit points, are you still like, bloody as hell? is like, yanking at it and like, kind of stripping it off. We also gotta give Julius to a goddamn hospital.
1379.20 1385.92 speaker2  You didn't happen to pack one of those,
1384.04 1392.96 speaker1  Oh, I didn't even think about it. That would have been so handy, aw. Good thing I grabbed one.
1391.22 1400.18 speaker2  We can always count on you, Beck.
1399.36 1407.00 speaker1  is that what you meant? Yeah.
1404.76 1408.64 speaker2  I guess, I mean, I wanna see this cut
1407.00 1412.20 speaker1  before I go to the news, but I mean,
1410.28 1459.24 speaker2  Julius, can I see your hands for a second? He holds his hands up. I wrapped some gaffer tape around him, so you can't. just because he doesn't want it to happen, Uh-oh. Well, that's just a crit success to not get. You dodge and he's, I wanna try to persuade you that this is a good idea. I'm like, I understand, I understand, I should have just come at you like that, but I think we might need to get your hands under control here for a second
1458.40 1464.68 speaker1  Yeah. You can roll if you want, but because you crit,
1462.44 1479.96 speaker2  you can just like tell him to fuck off if you want. I got a 63 on a 70. Oh. A 43.
1479.14 1505.10 speaker1  So I. He's picking at his face, but then Julius is like in his notes on his phone, like writing down thoughts on different ways to cut this. The video.
1502.52 1533.24 speaker2  I need you to elect a rolling leader who has a D8 closest to them. Luke, Luke is gonna roll the D8. More like eighths of something else, you know what I mean? Weed. Eight. Hell yeah. Full tank. They filled it up while we parked. Yeah, come back and see us. You're only a few hours away.
1530.56 1537.28 speaker1  It's about as full as a tank could possibly be
1535.20 1540.68 speaker2  We stopped at a gas station right before we pulled off.
1537.84 1545.48 speaker1  The same gas station is approaching on your right
1542.80 1567.60 speaker2  that you really see on this side of civilization. You seem to be coming back onto a road that might be used for more than just heading out to this location. And as you come up to this gas station, you see that there are three black SUVs. No, that's not fun.
1566.16 1576.22 speaker1  Now that's fun.
1574.72 1605.14 speaker2  Roombas. Range Rovers. Like bright green Range Rovers. and men wearing monochromatic gray scale suits
1603.16 1609.76 speaker1  what's the thing that goes in your pocket?
1606.98 1644.76 speaker2  And their green pocket square and their green tie get out and begin pumping gas. I guess just keep your heads forward and don't. Julius, pretend to do a TikTok.
1643.92 1655.20 speaker1  That looks like a TikTok. He just like does a little dance.
1654.36 1677.80 speaker2  Great job. You totally looped that roll. as you're almost past this gas station, you see one of the side doors opens from the back of one of these green Range Rovers and out steps. Fred Godel.
1676.96 1679.72 speaker1  I forgot. Oh, shit.
1678.88 1703.28 speaker2  We knew that. And he squints as he looks at the can van driving back toward the city. You're back in the normal world. So you're seeing homes, you're seeing normal signs.
1700.12 1712.92 speaker1  he says it as a statement, but it's really as a question. We've also got his daughter with us right now.
1712.08 1713.88 speaker2  Son.
1712.92 1717.16 speaker1  Whoa.
1716.28 1726.64 speaker2  Shit. And? Oh, I'm not going back. She's driving. Yeah, she's like, fuck that, Julius. I'm not doing that shit.
1723.84 1733.40 speaker1  He knew that was the correct answer, but he had to ask.
1730.52 1737.92 speaker2  She's just like frozen this whole time in the rear view mirror, just staring.
1737.08 1747.34 speaker1  Ugh. Like some burrs.
1746.50 1750.24 speaker2  Yeah, it kind of got caught up. At the end of a twig. Yeah.
1749.00 1755.16 speaker1  Stevie, what? She smashes it.
1753.08 1767.12 speaker2  Oh, that poor little jackalope. Stevie, what were the circumstances Probably Cal.
1764.12 1770.22 speaker1  I figured we were all in the back like figuring shit out. Yeah, that's good.
1767.96 1773.24 speaker2  Looking at footage and tying up Fox.
1771.20 1779.40 speaker1  of whatever Stevie's response is gonna be.
1777.72 1784.24 speaker2  You know that moment when you find out that maybe your parents aren't good? I don't know if you've ever had that.
1783.40 1799.76 speaker1  Yes.
1797.28 1816.44 speaker2  Susan's the judge. Susan Bloom, Judge Bloom. And then Susan was helping. I mean, we were trying to help, but. Help how? Well, I mean, you saw the it pit. You know, we were trying to save the new visitors.
1814.90 1823.98 speaker1  and it wasn't just people. It was like all sorts of things and creatures like we saw back there.
1819.50 1843.62 speaker2  And we were trying to help them because what would I mean? Vernon would take them and put them in the it pit Because Fred needed them to be quiet or because he needed them to die in the it pit? I think he needed something from them. I don't know exactly what,
1840.58 1858.82 speaker1  but we found animal ears down there also. Now that we've seen animal people, it was like transforming them? Oh, they were starting animal-ly. Yeah, they were just popping into Grover's Gorge.
1857.02 1896.14 speaker2  and I mean, I got out of there quick. And their eyes just kind of fade away and you see it's something cut deep enough to leave everything they knew behind. And she just can't bring herself. She, despite of all that, let you go to the it pit. I understand. Stevie, we are not our families. We can move beyond that and become our own people. I did. Or tried.
1894.66 1901.66 speaker1  We got what we needed. Hell yeah, we did. Let's shut them down.
1898.50 1904.38 speaker2  That's the spirit of a real can news intern. Let's show the world what they're doing.
1903.54 1907.22 speaker1  Let's do it.
1905.22 1911.06 speaker2  Through the transformative power of journalism. I'm sleepy.
1910.22 1918.98 speaker1  Yeah.
1917.82 1926.26 speaker2  He shakes his head back awake like he's trying to keep his eyes open. Maybe we should drop him at a hospital. No, no.
1923.94 1932.06 speaker1  The way they do in the movies where they just
1929.46 1941.82 speaker2  I think Stevie's gonna have to help Beck with the cut. You're still my super producer.
1938.86 1950.38 speaker1  is continuing to write his thoughts down in his notes. It's Z, yeah.
1948.06 1956.14 speaker2  Text, try to text what you have to Stevie.
1954.26 1957.10 speaker1  Okay, I don't feel very good.
1956.14 1993.02 speaker2  I know, little guy. Little guy with the big thighs, eh? We're gonna take care of you, right? Is that, and she's like kinda eyeing Greg? Well, here's what we could do. We could either drop him off at a hospital or you can leave him and Greg in my basement. I'll watch him while you and Beck make the cut. I don't know what Luke wants.
1992.06 2006.18 speaker1  Luke's along for the ride. What does Julius want? I'm playing the character. Julius wants to go cut this shit together. Fuck yeah. He's got two hit points left, so. You look such a mess.
2005.08 2022.30 speaker2  It's so funny. Like you are trying to hold on by a thread at this point and it's still a fair amount of car ride left. Okay, why don't you, we'll get God situated in the basement and. And I'll go help cut the news together.
2020.22 2024.22 speaker1  Yeah, you'll show Stevie the ropes.
2022.30 2034.78 speaker2  And maybe we'll call an ambulance. all the way into town.
2033.54 2044.34 speaker1  An eight on a 50. adrenaline pumps through his veins.
2042.02 2047.02 speaker2  And the consistent rings of yes we can. Yes, exactly.
2046.18 2051.66 speaker3  Yes we can.
2049.30 2053.34 speaker1  Dopamine fills his brain every time he hears that. Yes we can.
2052.50 2056.66 speaker3  Yes we can.
2055.84 2063.38 speaker1  I can do it.
2061.94 2065.60 speaker2  And also I'm gonna go pee again. Sorry I drank so much liquid.
2064.74 2073.46 speaker1  What is the first stop? We haven't really hammered out what our order of operations here.
2072.58 2074.70 speaker2  I'm a little nervous.
2073.46 2085.80 speaker1  I think Beck would be nervous too about leaving Godel unconscious in the van. That he could pop up at any moment.
2082.30 2094.94 speaker2  So Stevie can handle the cut if he passes out or goes to the emergency room or something like that, right?
2091.46 2099.86 speaker1  I mean, yeah, but like I know what all the footage is. Like that's kind of my whole thing
2099.02 2111.10 speaker2  I mean. Let's just bring him with us.
2109.22 2112.54 speaker1  Why don't we just lock him in your basement
2111.10 2118.62 speaker2  and then go do the cut? Julius nods his head. I mean, someone has to stay with him.
2117.26 2125.26 speaker1  I don't know about that, dude. Like you said, it's God. Like if he does wake up, what are you gonna do?
2123.28 2137.22 speaker2  Well, that's why I asked one of you to stay with me but you all wanna be a part of this fucking cut. I don't know, Beck, but.
2136.38 2148.92 speaker1  That's my point though. It's like, what are two people versus God?
2147.70 2173.50 speaker2  Julius nods his head. but I don't think we can just leave him alone. but just would you not use the upstairs bathroom while you're there? Okay, cool.
2171.70 2177.06 speaker1  Yeah, no, as long as there's another one.
2175.14 2188.06 speaker2  If you do need to go up there for any reason to use the kitchen or anything, I just mean the one upstairs. There's just still some of, there's just still, there's some things my wife left that I haven't really touched. Wait, hold on.
2185.82 2191.06 speaker1  Why'd you say, oh, that's horrifying.
2189.86 2192.18 speaker2  Oh, if that's what you mean,
2191.34 2198.14 speaker1  I take back the awe. No, I think it's the way that it's messily arranged, the way that she would have it.
2197.30 2200.18 speaker2  Yeah, that's what I meant too.
2198.14 2202.32 speaker1  And she had smeared all of the walls.
2200.18 2215.50 speaker2  No, there were, yes, the hairbrush, the tooth brace, which she never closed, some toiletries, and of course a bowl of shit. do not flush the upstairs toilet.
2213.74 2238.70 speaker1  I just can't bring myself to flush it. Yeah, okay. That's fine. If Taylor dies, I'm throwing all of her stuff away immediately.
2237.14 2242.04 speaker2  No, that was me as Zach.
2241.20 2243.74 speaker1  I got that.
2242.04 2291.48 speaker2  You were pretending to be a person? So we'll get you guys all secured in my basement and hopefully you and Greg will be fine there. And then we'll go edit this cut together like a news crew should. And bring back a new god turtle. Okay, sick. What's the vibe? Oh, I mean, nice ass neighborhood. Stately like early 20th century or late 1800s like townhouses. Some of them are brick. His is painted white. It's probably like three stories maybe. Whoa. And you know, it's narrow, right? And yeah, I don't know what time of year it is but it seems like it's fall there. It's like nice.
2289.88 2295.78 speaker1  But it seems like it's fall. It's like June 18th or somewhere around there.
2294.20 2326.80 speaker2  Specifically July something. We did start in June. Today is July 5th. Oh, okay, yeah. So there's all these 4th of July banners and stuff. Cal has a big American flag outside the front. Nice. And yeah, you see a neat little, like a couple of like garden, whoops. What the hell's happening? It's the helicopter landing at the hospital. Cal says, don't worry. That's just the helicopter landing at the hospital nearby. Thank God it's closed. Yeah. So there's some nice little like window planners and shit.
2325.24 2328.76 speaker1  Julius, I could just like run you over there while they get situated.
2327.92 2344.86 speaker2  That's true. We have time. It's been a few hours. This is not going on tonight's news. We have all day to cut this thing. We could definitely get you some medical attention.
2342.26 2347.54 speaker1  It's like 11, 1130 p.m. now at this point.
2344.86 2349.50 speaker2  Maybe that is the order of operations now.
2347.54 2377.78 speaker1  Yeah, it's, oh my God, it's too, Julius texts his uncle to see if his health insurance has kicked in yet. Yeah.
2375.98 2378.94 speaker2  Who has insurance or nothing.
2377.78 2387.54 speaker1  I had to check. It's part of my world building process. Extensive employee records.
2385.42 2416.62 speaker2  It's like, oh, nope, sorry Julius. That doesn't kick in until the end of the month. Not to junior producers. Then call the chopper. And we're in the driveway of this beautiful brick three-story town home. We didn't want to leave God alone in the van. Can we leave Julius alone in the van for a second
2415.58 2422.14 speaker1  I'll help.
2420.78 2454.46 speaker2  Keep writing your notes. Oh yeah. So I imagine we just kind of all like take them in and get them situated. There's probably a nice like couch and like sofa and shit. I was like blindly following behind Oh, we were saying stay in the van. Yeah, no, he's following blindly behind you. I'm just trying to get us out of here quick, dude.
2453.34 2458.30 speaker1  That's what I was saying. I like, I imagine. Cal and Stevie.
2456.86 2507.54 speaker2  Yeah, exactly. Sopping, making puddles everywhere that you're pulling him. and Cal like visibly winces. And he's like, do you guys have this? Do you guys, do you guys got this? I need to mop some of this up. I'll put some tea on. You see the face of Fox, Godel, Greg Godel, God Godel,
2506.06 2534.62 speaker1  What's a fist punch? Oh shit.
2531.58 2568.14 speaker2  and like this almost sea foam is pouring out of it. And it smells and you think that you might actually as the sea foam is like pouring up out and coming out of his mouth and he's fighting. I need a first a grip check for this coming out of fucking nowhere. Fail. Beck passes. going down into the basement. Yeah. Okay, so Cal who has like been turning around fully just like scrambles backwards up the stairs
2567.18 2576.18 speaker1  But right before you do,
2572.54 2586.66 speaker2  However, the other two headphones off sir, thank you.
2583.58 2589.10 speaker1  You're gonna lose Cal one D four plus one,
2586.66 2630.42 speaker2  which with the crit fail means that Julius automatically loses five grip. and you lose two grip Cal as the both of you see is that fingertips reaching out through the top and then suddenly it's gone and you just see the water and then it's just foaming at the mouth and there are multiple hands, multiple fingers reaching up through the foam, trying to get out. He closes his mouth shut tight and continues to wriggle. I'm gonna burn Joe back.
2629.54 2632.14 speaker1  I did math wrong.
2631.30 2643.06 speaker2  That makes sense cause you already hit your breaking point. Yeah, I'm two away though. But you did lose five grip.
2640.06 2650.04 speaker1  I'll go top in that order flight flight freeze. And freeze is a one. Five.
2649.20 2657.08 speaker2  So what do you do? Punch him in the nose.
2655.68 2666.48 speaker1  and he's gonna just like go and like put his hand over his mouth and nose.
2664.28 2693.16 speaker2  and he's gonna roll at a massive disadvantage because his arms are behind his back with his wrists tied. And with the success, Julius Summers has his hands over the mouth and nose of Greg Gottel. as he was running up those stairs. And so he's trying to grab some duct tape from his utility drawer in the kitchen cause this seems untenable.
2692.32 2697.02 speaker1  Like don't kill him. Like just make sure he passes out,
2696.18 2720.26 speaker2  Help him. Help him. What am I seeing? You are seeing Julius like plugging the nose and mouth of this dude. Stevie grabs and is like, He's not budging. Nope.
2716.66 2728.26 speaker1  and my goal is to, when I feel Gottel passing out, We can't kill him, Julius. We can't kill him. If we kill him, that God thing will pop into one of us
2727.06 2744.08 speaker2  Don't kill him, Julius. I'll be right there. from Beck Wilder to see if you can feel or you can go for one of the like first aid type roles if you have that. I'm gonna take the human.
2743.00 2752.60 speaker1  Okay. I pass.
2749.80 2765.18 speaker2  with duct tape and Stevie is trying to like push at the arms and hands of Julius Summers, you feel on the arms of Julius the kind of release of consciousness from Greg Gottel.
2764.34 2772.54 speaker1  What are you doing? We got to, it's not as bad as like death though. It's okay. And I'm trying to pull.
2771.70 2805.74 speaker2  It's okay. Cal's got a big thing of duct tape stripped out and he's like, okay, okay. And I started rapping and rapping and rapping. that you're gonna wrap your mouth in a serious way. All right, you've got duct tape all around the mouth and jaw and neck of Greg Gottel and he is unconscious.
2804.10 2809.74 speaker1  make him comfortable again.
2807.58 2815.82 speaker2  And you see like she's pleading with you.
2813.02 2820.90 speaker1  I just want to apologize that I hit your God brother. No, it's, it was just a reflex like he was waking up.
2819.66 2824.20 speaker2  Sorry, your mayor brother.
2822.92 2828.10 speaker1  Your little mayor God brother.
2826.98 2837.54 speaker2  Looks up at both of you. It's fine. Let's get him secured down here. Yeah, I don't know.
2834.84 2841.22 speaker1  Could we like, is there like a something sturdy down here?
2840.06 2855.58 speaker2  I've got some tie downs. I've got some tie down straps and in the utility closet, I could, we can, we can strap them to this couch. Yeah, let's do it. Julie's is just kind of staring off.
2853.98 2865.42 speaker1  Okay, let's be gentle. Yeah. And all these straps and you use the rest of the roll
2863.60 2877.42 speaker2  of duct tape to secure the. I don't think we need the duct tape that she wants comfort, right? It's, I just. staring at you as you're like, I'm not sure about that.
2873.98 2882.18 speaker1  They're like, but if they get out, they want the comfort,
2881.34 2890.58 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah, understandable. So I am gonna crank these straps kind of hard and he starts ratcheting down. I gotta go.
2888.74 2895.22 speaker1  She just gonna walk upstairs.
2893.74 2918.02 speaker2  Could you, could you check on the T? But everyone is just dazed as, it's been a long. There's some energy drink, the kind you like Beck.
2916.66 2923.10 speaker1  I'm touching my mic stand. It's not me, it's the cat. So we've got him ratcheted down.
2921.18 2931.72 speaker3  The cat touched my mic stand.
2929.28 2935.88 speaker2  You said you liked it that time you came to my house three and a half years ago. So I keep some around now.
2934.20 2946.00 speaker1  Oh dude, thanks. Is it three and a half years old or? Oh dude, Cal.
2944.76 2954.72 speaker2  You're a great camera man.
2953.18 2957.80 speaker1  after this story gets out.
2956.56 2960.20 speaker2  Okay, so I'm picturing.
2957.80 2963.94 speaker1  Julius hears the word story and perks up.
2961.66 2980.80 speaker2  They're having this conversation in the kitchen and Julius is just standing at the top of the stairs out of view from them listening and just picking at his face. In the darkness of the basement stairwell.
2978.52 2984.44 speaker1  on what is gonna go into the edit
2983.04 3005.58 speaker2  You do hear at that moment. Energy drink. There's a whole six pack. Would you like some? and the four of you are sharing caffeine in the kitchen.
3004.52 3010.68 speaker1  It's close enough.
3009.76 3022.92 speaker2  It's a nice day. Where everyone knows your name.
3020.16 3031.88 speaker1  Does he smell regular air or is it? Uh-oh.
3031.00 3038.20 speaker2  What do you think it smells like?
3035.16 3045.68 speaker1  Okay, he's happily walking to the hospital, peeling his skin and losing blood.
3044.84 3050.28 speaker2  and just start strolling down there and we're like, we grab you by the shoulders
3048.74 3051.98 speaker1  get in the can van.
3050.28 3068.56 speaker2  Come on, we're driving you. He allows it. Yeah, Stevie, you stay here. We're gonna get him some medical attention and then as soon as they've got them checked up, I think we're pulling an all-nighter down at the station.
3067.72 3088.02 speaker1  Of course. I'll let you know if anything happens on my end, obviously. Don't let Greg kill himself. Right, yes, obvious, I mean, yeah.
3085.62 3119.36 speaker2  I would help you move my collection of antique steak knives out of the basement, but we've really got to get, really got to get out of here and get him to the hospital and then get this thing cut. I think you can handle that, right? and swift cut back to you guys waving goodbye. Here's a glass case full of like all these blocks of knives.
3118.52 3147.92 speaker1  Oh, that might help. I feel so much better, Julius says, after spending some time in the hospital.
3145.92 3151.76 speaker3  Guess it's you and me on the edit, Beck.
3150.16 3184.30 speaker2  And the two of you. Like we're standing by his hospital bed while she says this? Yeah. Or like in the emergency room, they just got him in the hallway on a bed. Like ma'am, there is some news tonight. Do you happen to recognize me? Cal, Colorado city action news. And I wink. 49. So yeah. Um, well, as you know, the news never sleeps. Of course not. But this man needs to, his face is broken in like multiple places. We need to do CAT scans. We need to do X-rays. We need to draw blood.
3182.52 3191.16 speaker1  Let's just give me a Tylenol. Or, you know, something stronger. Anything that can. Let's just get him back on his feet for now. And then like we can bring him back.
3190.04 3195.04 speaker2  We'll bring him back in the morning. Right, yes. I'll be back for sure.
3193.68 3201.86 speaker1  1 p.m. at the latest.
3201.02 3213.40 speaker2  No, that makes a lot of sense.
3211.16 3222.80 speaker1  If you want something quick, go to Walgreens. You got better stuff than Walgreens? Yeah, but we're gonna need to book you overnight
3221.52 3233.40 speaker2  If you could just help us out.
3231.80 3237.44 speaker1  and make sure that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3235.68 3242.20 speaker2  And go ahead and assist.
3241.08 3243.48 speaker1  Yep, success.
3242.20 3247.44 speaker2  So plus 20. Oh, and he already succeeded.
3246.28 3252.32 speaker1  I passed my persuade. Oh. A 46 on a 50.
3249.36 3253.98 speaker2  That plus 40, which puts me over, and I fail.
3253.16 3260.00 speaker3  Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. We are way too convinced.
3258.16 3290.04 speaker2  The dice work in the worst way ever. What a shame. She's like, uh, yeah, whatever you guys want. And you're all like, he should stay here. Oh. Those are pain pills, you're putting them in pain. if you're not gonna stay overnight. Half a D6 plus one. Not a chance. which is quite substantial.
3288.88 3293.54 speaker1  Plenty of hit points.
3291.52 3320.32 speaker2  where we're looking at you only two hit points better, have now been like pushed together with a bandaid, the pieces together. And then currently you've got fluids going into you, and you've also, they're gonna do blood work.
3318.64 3328.50 speaker1  No they're not, he gets up. Okay.
3326.00 3332.92 speaker2  You know, your nurse always gives you your medicine.
3331.20 3338.96 speaker1  from our personal stash.
3337.08 3348.04 speaker2  She's like, okay, here's some of the good stuff. And? Again, like I said, we'll be back 1 p.m. two at the latest.
3345.94 3352.52 speaker1  To get him, you know, the full treatment.
3350.24 3372.72 speaker2  if he does want to stay up till nine to watch his segment. I don't know. We'll see, but. Let's fucking go. As you're heading out down the hallway, you hear a man hiccup and shit his pants at the same time.
3371.72 3375.24 speaker1  That could be a story.
3372.72 3389.72 speaker2  Camera goes right back to the vroom vroom of the can-van We see the columns, we see the glass, we see the beautiful moss, we saw the landscaping, we see the marble-less floor as you enter.
3388.64 3393.44 speaker3  I miss that marble.
3390.68 3405.64 speaker2  It's the three of you, rolling in, ready to go, as you hit the edit bay. We are rolling Julius in in a hospital wheelchair. Oh, nice, wheelchair to go.
3404.80 3418.56 speaker1  As Julius is- I run. As Julius is wheeled in, he's thinking, but he says it out loud. He's like, I'll be Raylan now.
3417.72 3423.36 speaker2  It's your-
3420.92 3428.88 speaker1  but they've always considered me not a Raylan.
3427.30 3434.80 speaker2  You can be your own man. A newsman.
3432.64 3442.20 speaker1  I definitely feel closer to you guys.
3440.72 3462.94 speaker2  that's ever happened in my life. Let's show the people. and is like doing a big stretch of her shoulders but do you want me to take care of anything for you guys before I go?
3461.80 3467.92 speaker1  Do we need her help on this or do we know what we're doing?
3466.76 3473.44 speaker3  He's not an editor,
3470.04 3486.20 speaker1  Like he normally does want Vivica there to do the editing. Sure. But I think, I look at Cal and Julius, I think maybe we should handle this one or do you want like a professional set of eyes on this? She gives you
3484.08 3491.86 speaker2  Vivica, how did you get your job here?
3488.76 3495.66 speaker3  Yeah, no, I went to school, applied, intern,
3494.12 3508.30 speaker2  get health insurance next year. Yeah. No.
3506.96 3515.88 speaker1  You might want to see this.
3513.24 3531.96 speaker2  Vivica, do you want to edit the biggest news story since 9-11?
3530.08 3537.16 speaker1  There's something that you can't know about that's in this footage. That is actually what I forgot.
3536.20 3555.52 speaker2  Fuck you guys.
3554.12 3561.96 speaker1  coworker friends here. She's always had my back. And I mean, obviously she's never seen anything like this,
3560.28 3573.60 speaker2  Is she like religious? that's kind of tinted at her. And she's like bringing the computer back up. She's getting the programs going, yeah.
3572.32 3591.20 speaker1  And she's good at what she does. I mean, we're going to have a good looking piece if she's ever fingerprints on it. versus the quality of having her help us. And it's gotta be-
3588.44 3593.04 speaker2  but it will be a greatly edited segment, right?
3591.20 3601.84 speaker1  Here's the deal though, guys. I could just like, I think I should just like not give her the time codes for the stuff with Fox.
3599.64 3604.24 speaker2  If you can pre-scan the footage and yeah.
3602.68 3631.84 speaker1  So that's in the earlier episodes, that's one of Beck's things is that he has like an eidetic, is an eidetic memory of like the footage that he has he knows of the timestamps of everything you shot. So he just won't give her those timestamps. Who was making that crazy noise? That was me. I had a bunch of spit in my mouth from burping a bunch and I had to swallow it.
3629.40 3666.28 speaker2  and what I don't understand about fucking NPR? in their mics that picks up every bit of moisture it's so hard to listen to sometimes. It's me hard to listen to. That's why NPR stands for National Boner Radio. What?
3665.44 3670.92 speaker3  NPR.
3669.32 3682.72 speaker2  that would be a good shock shock.
3681.88 3694.88 speaker3  I'm the clit. I'm the clit.
3694.04 3715.52 speaker2  I'll be right back. Would you all like some coffee? Cal, you follow, like the camera follows Cal to the little office kitchen and he makes everybody some coffee. He knows how many creams Beck takes or doesn't. He grabs a handful of creamers and sugar for everybody else who he doesn't know and he stops by his office
3712.72 3748.28 speaker1  In the editing bay, Beck cracks his knuckles and he says, okay, first it's like a, there's a jackalip that I fall on. You can, there's footage of that at four minutes and three seconds. And then there's also the time when the god turtle fell off the stool and that's at seven minutes and eight seconds. Oh, and there's also the machine that heals people. That's at three minutes and five seconds in and he's just like helping rattle off other things that happened. but are also humans, that's it.
3747.28 3773.28 speaker2  Go ahead and roll. Did she crit fail a grip roll? We're fucking dumb. We should have kicked her out. You see Vivica just staring blankly at the monitors. onboarding Vivica to this project. Yeah, Vivica. ["My life is great and it's all my fault"]
