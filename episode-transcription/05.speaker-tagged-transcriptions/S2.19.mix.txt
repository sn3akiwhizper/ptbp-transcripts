0.00 86.14 speaker0  Happy holy days, my friends and my families.

And speaking of fun dudes, this year howling with Wolf is from Curtis and his friend Jared, both in St. Louis. Curtis tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, the merriest and most cheerful act of giving outside of ripping a hole in the corner of a grease-filled diner dumpster and squeezing that big old nasty metal box like a piping bag until the sludge slips and slides right into Wolf's gaping inscrutable maw. Mm, baby. But the tweet thing is pretty good too. Curtis writes, hello Wolf, master of grease, time travel, trash, and dumpster grease. First off, thank you for all the new songs you always bring

Time's running out, baby. But I am not running out of time, for time is merely a tool at my disposal. Mm, I love two things in this here world. A good bout of disposing. Last time, our assumed heroes showed And then Kurt, the red-eye siren chaser, showed up with some wild footage of a new weather phenomenon. Absolutely exhausted and spent, Julius Summers headed to the hospital while Beck and Cal made their way back to Cal's to check on Stevie and Greg Fox god-goddle. But they found neither of the god-goddle's siblings, Beck Wilder and Cal Colorado sped on empty tanks to Bean's Bridge to assess the scene after that seemingly god-caused freak weather incident from Kurt's footage. Too tired to succeed, but too driven to hit the brakes, Cal maneuvered past the police barricades and taken us now to a better view of Bean's Bridge's new, unnaturally smooth hole. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great, and it's all mine, all. Oh.
380.84 389.34 speaker1  Oh.
388.52 392.28 speaker0  The noise.
390.18 436.08 speaker1  That's part of why I was making that face, because I was like, if there's a noise, just say it so we don't have to do this. But what is it? it's just literally this mechanical thing that's just like, so I can absolutely just unplug that. It will cancel out. in my ears.
434.64 441.56 speaker2  Episode 19. Episode 19. Whoa.
440.72 447.20 speaker1  Episode 19. COVID-19.
445.52 450.84 speaker2  You know what that reminds me of?
448.40 457.20 speaker1  19, nine one, nine 11.
455.00 521.28 speaker2  of Presenting to be People. I don't care, it's numbers. and we went inside and there was the loudest conversation happening right behind us. We were the only two groups of people eating in this tiny living room converted into a restaurant dining room. And this loud, loud conversation, the first sentence that I heard was one young gentleman college age asked the other young gentleman college age, what is it about your actions and behavior Oh damn, so it's- Yes, it was an incelvention. Incelvention are just like bullying in White Lotus season two.
517.32 526.12 speaker1  well, and after the whole thing went down. The fish, but the one guy wouldn't let the other one have it.
524.88 574.24 speaker2  At one point in time, he's like, you're obsessed with women. And the guy was like, I'm not obsessed with women, I'm obsessed with beauty. And then he's like, don't you think it's not okay to say things to girls that make them uncomfortable? And his response to that was, I say things that move me. At one point in time, I thought the conversation was sort of veering into a like, What? He was like, you're messaging these girls repeatedly, they're not responding to you in their DMs and you continue to message them. And he's like, I don't send them questions, I send them things. You don't have to respond to things.
573.40 580.32 speaker1  Oh no.
577.92 599.16 speaker2  I don't always respond to them. They seemed to be the same age, yeah. Much older women in nursing homes. are physically incapable of moving their thumbs.
598.12 601.48 speaker1  having a talk with his son.
599.16 618.40 speaker2  Oh no, that would have felt more appropriate.
614.80 634.88 speaker1  You should see my campaigns, they're quite beautiful if dark. Yeah, the guy who was like- Is that what it's called in an intervention?
633.88 645.80 speaker2  It will be in mine. we'd get out of my house.
643.80 650.04 speaker1  It's offensive defense.
645.80 704.76 speaker2  Oh no, I'm feeling really suppressed right now. actually Taylor got up as we were leaving, walked over to their table and said, after we witnessed both servers coming in and out of this room, like looking over tentatively every single time, Taylor went over and was like, hey, everyone can hear your conversation, it's making everyone uncomfortable. And then everyone clapped. we got to keep the chair. I went back to Ramatai a week later, because I love Ramatai. They were still having the conversation. Makes sense. Copy pasta. Is that how you say that?
703.22 713.86 speaker1  No, it's not, you say copy pasta.
710.86 724.76 speaker2  we're role playing, you're in the hospital. I'm still not playing yet? We're about to play you,
721.88 730.54 speaker1  Joe and I have written up pretty extensive backstories for your critical care team that we're gonna be playing.
728.62 745.22 speaker2  That's what I was doing outside. I was on nurse talk to see good tips on patient health care.
743.86 751.10 speaker1  I'm glad you kept that to yourself.
749.22 757.02 speaker2  So, did they look like peers? I'm like, well, they look about the same age.
753.38 766.82 speaker1  Thanks for not telling about me dressing down my dad.
764.70 775.00 speaker2  I say things that move me. He wouldn't be talking about the same kinds of things this boy was saying, but.
774.16 779.12 speaker1  We're standing at a hole. Standing at a hole in the middle of a bridge.
777.52 786.12 speaker2  So, and you'll remember from the footage that it did seem to close up in the footage that you saw. Yeah, I didn't remember that at all.
784.94 794.40 speaker1  It had left a giant hole and that's why the tugboat was swirling.
792.00 802.72 speaker2  but then after some time of the swirling, after the tugboat and barge disappeared, it's almost like it got stopped up.
801.84 807.64 speaker1  Gotcha, okay.
805.56 813.28 speaker2  but there's still a hole in the bridge that people are very curious about.
811.84 819.40 speaker1  No, the hole in the water. The hole in the bridge is still there. Yep. Gotcha. That's the hole we're looking for, man.
817.56 823.44 speaker2  That's the money hole. That's the money hole.
822.60 825.00 speaker1  Oh, boy.
823.44 831.76 speaker2  Did you guys follow that at home?
830.32 838.20 speaker1  Big money, big money, big money. I'm shooting the hole over the edge.
836.06 883.28 speaker2  It is on the Beans Bridge, which is the nearest bridge from Cal Colorado's home through downtown. And at the end of this bridge, nearest downtown, there is a hole the size of a revolving door from a shopping mall in the middle of this bridge. And it is unnaturally smooth on the sides where the hole has been ripped through this bridge. Around this hole, there are countless city, county, federal, state employees all coming around, looking at it with their own different sort of operational awarenesses and their own skills and trying to figure out what happened here. It is clearly a multi-agency task force. Nailed it. Nice.
881.28 897.08 speaker1  I'm getting some B-roll of the sides of the hole because I think you mentioned they were smooth. And then at the end of our last episode,
893.88 910.76 speaker2  we saw Cal Colorado with a glint in his eye, wink at the camera, move one of the barricades, and make his way past onto the bridge and toward the hole. Follow me Beckwith.
908.50 916.52 speaker1  and we're gonna get you the real story here tonight. He B-lines it for, you said there were like people in suits?
915.68 925.44 speaker2  Do they? People in police officer uniforms, people in like hazmat suits,
923.16 933.92 speaker1  Who looks to be the most in charge?
930.92 942.32 speaker2  and people seem to be walking over to her and keeping her abreast of the situation. And she's kind of like on her phone
940.28 953.48 speaker1  Keeping an eye on her for now, Cal like looking into the camera, like gestures. Come here, come here, come here. And we go straight up to the hole. Get this Beck, get this. Look at this now. Show the people what we've got here.
951.16 959.84 speaker2  Let's go ahead and roll law. Whichever one of you has the highest law.
958.66 963.50 speaker1  I've got 40.
962.68 989.38 speaker2  No. Me neither. Nice. Immediately upon you hitting the hole, stepping up to it, a police officer walks over. Get up. And you see that line over there, about that there? Of course, of course. And he's pointing over at the barricade
988.42 1000.34 speaker1  where you just came from. This is bigger than the line that we're showing the people what's really going on here. Get this Beck, get this. Sir, would you consent to being interviewed and telling us a little bit about what's going on here tonight?
997.34 1005.46 speaker2  Hands behind the back or bodies behind the barrier.
1001.90 1036.84 speaker1  We start backing away towards the people who are in charge. Thank you very much. kind of towards the other side of the barrier that way. So we are heading towards the barrier, but diagonally in this kind of direction that also sort of takes us through the center of the rest of the things over here. At this point, you're backing into the woman. Cal Colorado, city action news. I put the microphone in her face. Get this, get this, get this. She puts her hand up to the camera
1034.62 1049.38 speaker2  Your laptop screen light actually makes it look Blocking it away.
1047.68 1055.98 speaker1  Cal did not say so sultry. I was like, that was my comment on your vocal choice.
1053.54 1061.74 speaker2  Well, in that case, Zach says, oh, hey, thanks. Nice.
1059.98 1067.20 speaker1  like how wild would it be if.
1065.66 1069.10 speaker2  and it's bad.
1067.20 1085.98 speaker1  Cal takes a huge fucking gamut and he says, Cal Colorado, city action news. Do you know me? And he winks. That's a fail. Would have actually passed 8,385, but.
1084.62 1097.98 speaker2  Back up behind the border. And the guy comes up behind you and he's like, And it's got hands on you now. He's like, what did I just say?
1095.66 1099.66 speaker1  Hands behind her back or behind the barrier. We got it.
1098.82 1103.00 speaker2  We got it. Cal failed your role. Get the fuck out of here.
1102.16 1106.58 speaker1  I understand. Did the woman with the sultry voice
1104.94 1112.50 speaker2  have any kind of identification on her?
1109.22 1123.94 speaker1  Also, is she age appropriate to Cal Colorado? And it's like a powerful peer of Cal Colorado's. He's a little taken.
1123.10 1141.18 speaker2  The sequel. So you would notice that there is a tattoo on her hand, the hand that she put up. To put in front of the camera. And it is like the tail. It's like a tail that's scaly.
1138.06 1144.50 speaker1  That's running up out of her cuff. Scaly like a rat tail?
1143.66 1162.92 speaker2  No. Like a dragon tail. How close to a dragon than a rat? A dragon rat. And it just kind of creeps up out of the cuff from under her suit jacket. And I just realized she's wearing a suit. And so as you back up, what is Beck's reaction to this whole situation?
1161.52 1200.84 speaker1  The whole time he's been walking through here, he's been sweating bullets. You've noticed that his eyes been kind of darting back and forth. And he's kind of been keeping his head down like strictly into the viewfinder, pointed directly at you. And then when I bumped into her, I was probably backing up and bumped into her and saw her and I probably, the camera jostled really bad. And you saw me start to turn around and walk toward the barricade like strongly. And then remember, oh shit, I've got a job. And I got, I'm pretty far away now using a zoom to get you guys in frame. As the officer approaches them, he's like, I'm sorry officer, I'm sorry. And he immediately turns away and you kind of see like a sheepish boyish grin on his face.
1195.84 1223.58 speaker2  And with the waters of the city river raging below you, the sounds of the lapping waves hitting the rocks below. The two of you kind of headed off back on the other side of the barrier. It's about 4.30 in the morning. The haze of sunlight is kind of growing off in the distance, even though it's still quite dark out.
1220.80 1237.60 speaker1  I think Beck then is feeling that and would just look at you with just the most bloodshot and hang dog eyes.
1235.84 1241.68 speaker2  Are you not, I mean, I'm so,
1240.46 1243.76 speaker1  We've got to go to the foundry.
1241.68 1252.16 speaker2  We've got to have some drinks at the foundry. I'm buying.
1250.48 1266.16 speaker1  I was gonna ask if I could crash at your place, but it sounds like you're still going out. So I'll just sleep in the van and I'll meet you in the morning. I'll be right in front. We'll have some drinks at my place. Come on, let's go back to my place.
1264.80 1267.00 speaker2  It's just like hanging out with Thomas.
1266.16 1309.00 speaker1  Go to sleep. Hey, I was trying to explore that subtly through character work. I liked it. Something I've learned and I'm trying to express through my character, What are you guys doing after this, by the way? But yeah, I said I'm going back. Yeah, we get back there.
1307.48 1311.44 speaker0  and I'll see you in the morning, man.
1310.60 1318.00 speaker1  I insist. I've got seven bedrooms in this home. You will take one.
1316.12 1322.32 speaker2  I mean, if you're talking about sleeping, yeah.
1320.40 1343.92 speaker1  I mean, well, you know, we're gonna probably, I've got some pretty nice whiskey. and I don't know what to do with them.
1340.96 1353.84 speaker2  Let me see that, let me see that. I'm looking at the hours after we left
1352.84 1380.42 speaker1  They are holding pizza. Yeah. They walk away the first time, they come back, A little too many, like feed too many red peppers and God goes crazy.
1377.78 1394.34 speaker2  Like it had been long enough that he'd clicked on it, that it wasn't downloaded. So you click download on it and as it's finishing up the, oh man, you're asleep.
1392.46 1418.88 speaker1  and I like pluck it out of his hands, like plug it in a charger, walk off with the two glasses of whiskey I've just poured for me and Beck. I throw one down my gullet and walk upstairs to my bedroom, pass dozens of pictures of Cal's career from the seventies on to today. And he downs the second glass, brushes his teeth, gets in like some silk pajamas and slips into a pretty fucking nice bed set.
1417.48 1437.52 speaker2  This sounds lovely. Just in case either one of you are wondering.
1435.68 1440.52 speaker1  What was that? You said broken.
1439.52 1450.52 speaker2  You're broken.
1447.52 1454.52 speaker1  I broke and I couldn't breathe.
1452.52 1462.52 speaker2  He's like a human bug. Oh my God.
1461.52 1512.52 speaker1  You had wake apnea. We didn't really try that hard to go find Stevie and God. he just wouldn't be able to. He just couldn't. Energy drink coursing through my veins.
1509.52 1532.52 speaker2  Yeah, I think just with the day that you guys have all had hitting that 5 a.m. spot, I was just going to be like, nah. What are we at on recording time? Cool.
1529.52 1533.52 speaker1  Now we're going to double down on the soft bitch stuff.
1532.52 1538.52 speaker2  Go back, go back.
1537.52 1543.52 speaker1  Double down.
1542.52 1547.52 speaker2  So he doesn't... Luke! We got Luke a boy.
1546.52 1549.52 speaker1  They sent me outside.
1548.52 1554.52 speaker2  I watched TikTok videos. Yeah? It was nice. Did you have a good time? Yeah, but I'm glad to be back.
1553.52 1559.52 speaker1  Yeah, back in the hospital.
1557.52 1565.52 speaker2  Oh, thank God he's alive and the camera zooms in and sees that Julius Summers is out cold.
1564.52 1585.52 speaker1  Do whatever you want. It's zoomed in on the monitor, the heart monitor, Okay, it's disconnected.
1583.52 1630.52 speaker2  That's not what happens when you have to pee. My heart stops and I have to pee. Go ahead and roll a con times five for me and that'll see whether you get your natural healing of one hit point back for the eve. 37 on a 50. Nice. So take one more hit point of health. And what does that bring you up to? Seven? Lovely. Nurse comes in, puts your TV on, and you see the same thing that Kurt showed you, but it's all over the news. And there's footage from all sorts of different angles, but you do think that Kurt's footage might be the best of anything that you're seeing flash before your eyes on cable news here? Did it break on can?
1628.52 1638.52 speaker1  Don't really care. How does it make you feel? You can handle it?
1636.52 1641.52 speaker2  It's some sort of weather tornado they're saying.
1640.52 1645.52 speaker1  That's what they're saying? Keep believing that. I've got to pee.
1644.52 1654.52 speaker2  That's what I'm here to help with.
1653.52 1659.52 speaker1  does she have a badge on?
1656.52 1663.52 speaker2  It's just some wild person roaming the halls.
1659.52 1676.52 speaker1  I hit the call a nurse button and then go pee real quick. And I get back in bed and wait for the nurse.
1674.52 1717.52 speaker2  Oh, yeah, what's going to happen next? Global warming, right? Right. So you think it's weather? Yeah, lightning tornado, is that what they're calling it? Yeah, I mean, everything looks fine. You're going to be in pain for four to six weeks at least. You're going to want to stay on the medicine for, Don't be a hero. You'll have some serious pain in the face for a while. Yeah, I know what you mean. But yeah, besides that, you should be fine. No severe broken tissue. You're going to look the same after a while.
1714.52 1728.52 speaker1  Thank you very much, and would like to be discharged, please. Do you need a wheelchair?
1725.52 1736.52 speaker2  But he also wants to search around for any sharp objects in the room. Oh, they don't like to keep those around in hospital rooms typically. Yeah, but how good are the doctors here?
1734.52 1737.52 speaker1  Not that great apparently.
1736.52 1740.52 speaker2  So what are you looking for?
1737.52 1756.52 speaker1  Something to maybe try to cut part of my face off. Because the pee didn't take that long, but Julius staring into the mirror in the bathroom,
1753.52 1761.52 speaker2  You roll under 50, you find something sharp.
1760.52 1772.52 speaker1  Okay.
1767.52 1782.52 speaker2  And it's the kind with the plastic grip. It's not super sharp scissors.
1781.52 1795.52 speaker1  Yeah. He's not going to go full face, but he's going to see at least, he's pretty sure underneath is like what he's actually supposed to be.
1794.52 1797.52 speaker2  How much?
1795.52 1799.52 speaker1  Like the right cheek.
1798.52 1819.52 speaker2  Yeah. Oh my God. 21 out of 25.
1818.52 1829.52 speaker1  Yeah, you passed.
1827.52 1869.52 speaker2  Nurse walks in and says, oh. I mean, he just, you shininged him. He like walked past the door and saw you in there with the scissors inside of your like skin and mouth.
1867.52 1871.52 speaker1  Is he like completely blocking the doorway?
1869.52 1876.52 speaker2  No, no, no, no. You just walk right past him. Yeah, I just kind of squeeze around him.
1873.52 1890.52 speaker1  I pat him on the back and say, thanks. And I look at his badge. Darren. Thanks, Darren. Thank you. Bye. And I'm going to start heading towards the exit of the hospital and give Cal a call. Yeah, absolutely.
1888.52 1903.52 speaker2  Bird, bird time. Yeah, you were in for a while. You had a full rest.
1900.52 1906.52 speaker1  I was watching the noon o'clock news, right? Yeah.
1904.52 1918.52 speaker2  So we're talking noon thirty. Oh, God.
1915.52 1965.52 speaker1  Hey, Cal, it's Julius. I just got out of the hospital. Well, they discharged me from the hospital and a clean bill of health. I guess I wouldn't really go back to that hospital if I had the choice. Oh, which hospital? The procedures they gave me were all too small. I'm sorry, I just woke up. I don't understand at all what you mean. Well, where should I go? Max is ten. Oh, like twenty percent better. I'm sixty right now. Okay. Well, you know, we all had a rough night. I feel like I'm about a sixty-two.
1962.52 1979.52 speaker2  Curious. Cal and Beck, are the two of you down any hit points? Oh, yeah. Okay, so you can actually roll a constitution check to regain a hit point of natural healing with overnight sleep. That makes sense to me.
1978.52 1991.52 speaker1  Bummer. Bummer. That's unsettling.
1986.52 2008.52 speaker2  God fucked it up in the escape, so it's all... your back is just, like, shitty this morning.
2007.52 2080.52 speaker1  Great, I'll jog over. He's got to exercise. Yeah, that's close. So, yeah, you would hear him running up and down stairs and stuff, and he's a big enough guy that it's booming through the house. Get on up here.
2078.52 2097.52 speaker2  Oh, uh, 60 percent? All right, good enough. All right, I'll be up in a sec.
2093.52 2154.52 speaker1  Oh, he's got some very well-made lattes, each with a little, like, news van in it. He's like, oh, yeah, yeah. Those are great. You can have some water. Julius takes one and then sips it and has a little milk froth mustache. I saw the news broke. I saw God on TV. Cal drops the tray. You can do magic? That story is... You turn the TV on and it's in Cal, Colorado's house, so it's on can. And can is currently covering this exclusively. Is it ours? It's Daddy's. Kurt's. Kurt's footage. Okay, with our pickup from last night? Would you have been able to send that in? Yeah, we sent that in, Link.
2150.52 2167.52 speaker2  The rules of the universe, as we've established, seems like we would have to take it.
2161.52 2185.52 speaker1  People saw it, as far as the logistics of Julius' thoughts went.
2179.52 2248.52 speaker2  I mean, for those of us watching at home who have never seen Lightning Tornado before, it can be scary, but I'm being told from those scientists who we love listening to here at can Isabella Kaya, City Action News. and he flashbacks to the moment that Vivica- Put that kick me sign on you. She stole it. And you reach the bottom of your pocket and your heart sinks. Beck, what's wrong?
2245.52 2263.52 speaker1  We'll just tune into can and we'll tell you what it's all about. Beck, what's wrong? Look at his face, Julius. Yeah.
2258.52 2271.52 speaker0  And I put it into this pocket and that pocket is empty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I check another pocket, and I check another pocket.
2269.52 2341.52 speaker1  And I check another pocket, and I check another pocket. Your coat. Check the fucking camera, Beck. Check the can van. Vivica, she had to have. When would Vivica have taken the drive? When she put that hilarious sign on his back. All we have is your TikToks, Julius. I posted the Jackalope one yesterday. Yep. Guys, which one should I do? I don't know what you have. Yeah. He posts that. Do that. And while it's doing it, he puts, like, the sound that would be in a St. Jude's commercial, he puts that in the background as the sound and uploads it. Good edit. We've got to find Vivica. We've got to find Stevie and God. We've got to find out what the fuck is going on at Cannes and where our footage is. I'm going to call Cannes. Bec, do you feel comfortable? Yeah.
2340.52 2348.52 speaker2  Do you know her? Of course. I've got to get my footage back, dude.
2347.52 2350.52 speaker1  I call Tyfe.
2349.52 2358.52 speaker0  Boing, boing. Boing, boing. Boing, boing. Julius. Uncle.
2357.52 2364.52 speaker2  My guy. Uncle Tyfe.
2363.52 2380.52 speaker1  Tell him we've got questions. What are you doing? Why weren't you answering my calls yesterday? I'm fucking hungry for good news. We've got crazy footage, but we lost it.
2378.52 2392.52 speaker2  All right, tell me about this footage.
2389.52 2399.52 speaker1  which is a hidden utopia that's ran by the- Dystopia. The Godel company. It's a utopia? It's run by the Godel company? That's amazing.
2398.52 2424.52 speaker2  It's nice, but it's bad. It was an anonymous tip? What was it? It was just a pin in the middle of nowhere. Just a pin? Who was assigning all the- I mean, I assume it was Isabella who assigned you all the stories? She did a bang up job. She's good. She's all right. She's the best. Let me slack her real quick. Oh, it says she's working from home.
2423.52 2431.52 speaker1  Did you- What's up?
2429.52 2435.52 speaker2  Oh, no buy? No buy for your uncle?
2434.52 2445.52 speaker1  Uncle type, yeah. When I talk to Vivica, we'll bring you the footage and show it to you, but it's big.
2443.52 2457.52 speaker2  They were really haranguing us about that last story. Good job, Julius. Oh, you're going to be on top so soon if you keep it up like this, my guy. Are you working all week?
2456.52 2461.52 speaker1  What? I thought you told me. You're taking the week off.
2460.52 2465.52 speaker2  Just a day. Had a meeting down at the city, city tower.
2463.52 2469.52 speaker1  Well, you sound like you could get some rest.
2468.52 2472.52 speaker2  Did I get got? I don't know.
2471.52 2474.52 speaker1  I've got to find Vivica.
2473.52 2485.52 speaker2  Beep. I couldn't help but hear like some of that over the receiver.
2484.52 2492.52 speaker1  We can't show it to him. We've got to find a way to run it without it going past him.
2491.52 2496.52 speaker2  He said... He threatened you?
2493.52 2540.52 speaker1  He said only good news for the Godel company. I mean, he didn't threaten me, but... He threatened the truth. He threatened the news. Basically, yeah. I mean, has my uncle always been like this? Not in my experience. Julius, I haven't felt like this since 1983. What happened in 1983? But it is the closest to truth and justice I've ever truly come. And you see a flashback to Cal spending a summer following his brother around You've worked with her closely for so long.
2537.52 2549.52 speaker0  I dropped her off two or three times over the years. Ooh!
2548.52 2623.52 speaker1  Good boy. Yeah. Totally, dude. I think we've got to go get this shit from Vivica. We've got to get our fucking footage. We've got to get the footage. Vivica has our Pulitzer. editor. Vivica's good, though. Vivica's good, though. Maybe she just is doing touch-ups at home and forgot to- You saw her face yesterday, Beck. She's not just doing touch-ups. even we suspected. We know we've got something here, but we need to be a little more careful with it, and to that end, we have to secure it immediately. Guys, we've got to get this footage from Vivica. The Beatles were very popular when I was a schoolboy, and- They're still popular. Let's go, boys. I met them once. You can tell us about it on the way there, Cal.
2620.52 2626.52 speaker2  I figure that's what he says as we're walking out the door.
2624.52 2633.52 speaker0  You met the fucking Beatles, dude?
2628.52 2690.52 speaker1  As we're walking out, Cal points to several pictures, like three pictures with the Beatles at different stages of their career when he's a kid, and then finally in their 70s crazy phase, one is him as a teenager reporter, and then multiple pictures of him with John correspondence with Ringo. You got this last one in under the wire. Not for friends. Who else? Beck, you've never shown any interest in my pictures before now.
2687.52 2698.52 speaker2  I had never noticed that that was George Harrison there that you're sitting on the bench with.
2697.52 2758.52 speaker1  Is it that one? The van is lined with pictures too. Some of the choicer ones. A bodega? I thought you said bodega, which would be really fun. Bodega. No, it's clearly not. Julius really wants to stop in, but knows that there's no time.
2753.52 2769.52 speaker2  Beck, you would know that when you open up the door, it just immediately stares on the other side, so you'd have to buzz up, but the last time you were here, the buzzer didn't work. Now I'm just picturing your old apartment.
2768.52 2773.52 speaker1  Well, we hit the buzzer.
2770.52 2793.52 speaker2  It is July 6th. It's about 1pm. It's a hot day. The sun is shining down. It's a Wednesday. Less kids on the street than usual, and the ones that you do see, you're like, It's Wednesday. There's the urchins.
2791.52 2808.52 speaker1  and that it'll have all the footage from last night. Oh yeah. Of here? No, of my place. Remember how God and Stevie escaped?
2806.52 2821.52 speaker2  Yeah, you guys haven't talked about that much.
2820.52 2844.52 speaker1  So what, did you find anything?
2841.52 2847.52 speaker0  So I downloaded the app last night, and I didn't get a chance to look at it.
2846.52 2876.52 speaker1  That is a wild sound. Yeah, there's a bunch of owls going crazy outside. Is that what that is? What were we doing? Oh, yeah. The app. The app, I downloaded the app. Yeah, the Ring app. Let's see what happened.
2874.52 2881.52 speaker2  In grainy black and white. Get the premium.
2878.52 2887.52 speaker1  No, it's a Ring camera, it's not grainy black and white for sure.
2886.52 2907.52 speaker2  Yeah, but it's nighttime. We're not allowed to have separate deals, you rat.
2906.52 2909.52 speaker1  They're both in on it.
2908.52 2912.52 speaker2  Thank you.
2909.52 2957.52 speaker1  We see high quality black and white. Because it's Ring camera at Ring.com.
2952.52 2966.52 speaker2  She holds the door open as Greg passes her and heads down to the front yard. Stevie closes the door, notices the Ring camera. Oh.
2963.52 2996.52 speaker1  I thought she was here and I was like, I don't know why she's here, but I'm excited. I also got a 93. Ooh, spooky. Cal's looking at all the features of his everything bidet on the box.
2993.52 3002.52 speaker2  When Stevie turns back, you see Shane.
2997.52 3003.52 speaker1  So like I can tell from the footage it doesn't look like she's doing it completely against her will.
3002.52 3021.52 speaker2  That's right. And you two see the face of Stevie turn back. They look at the camera and they turn back away and head off into the street.
3020.52 3055.52 speaker1  I wasn't getting that from this footage. What did you see? Look. Rewind it. Look. She's not making her do it. She's doing it on her own but she knows. Look. She sees it right there. She sees the camera. I think she looks gassy. Shame gas. But I mean, Godel's not forcing her to do this.
3053.52 3058.52 speaker0  She wouldn't let him jump off of something.
3057.52 3073.52 speaker1  Could she stop him? Yeah. Even if she was on the way to somewhere she thought might help.
3071.52 3076.52 speaker2  I assume the buzzer.
3073.52 3081.52 speaker1  Guys, I don't think the buzzer's working here. We gotta find Vivica.
3080.52 3084.52 speaker0  Hang on a sec. And I'm trying to find a pebble to throw at the window.
3083.52 3086.52 speaker1  Oh, yeah.
3085.52 3090.52 speaker2  Tink. Vivica!
3089.52 3104.52 speaker1  Vivica! Is the door that leads up to the stairs a wooden door or a glass door? On the outside it did. Yeah, like the downstairs one.
3103.52 3105.52 speaker0  What?
3104.52 3106.52 speaker1  How tall?
3105.52 3111.52 speaker2  You could see into the stairwell.
3110.52 3118.52 speaker1  Interesting. It said, Joe Terry, private eye. Very much like that. Dangerous dames turn around.
3117.52 3120.52 speaker2  He had legs.
3119.52 3137.52 speaker1  Guys, watch out. Joe's apartment.
3134.52 3146.52 speaker2  but then there's the rest of the door is composite.
3139.52 3158.52 speaker1  And he hikes up his fancy work shorts and is going to try to kick this door in down. I'm normally not a fan of property damage, but we don't know that our coworker is safe right now. Got those big powerful legs. We should use them.
3153.52 3203.52 speaker2  At the exact moment that you rear back on one of your enormous thighs, one of the... Yeah. about to light up, they look over at you as your leg is like up in the air about to kick and their mouth just kind of drops. But the cigarette sticks to their lip because it was dry.
3202.52 3209.52 speaker1  Strength or criminology? Yeah. Let's see. I don't think I have any criminology. Nope. Okay.
3208.52 3215.52 speaker2  Let's see. Up and down. 50-50. With a plus 20 because... Okay. 12 on a 70 then.
3214.52 3231.52 speaker1  Oh. Oh. Little did Julius know the door was just a little bit ajar. So when he kicks it, it kicks hard and like smashes into the wall. It looks like he kicked it open, like forced it open, but it was just gonna happen anyway.
3230.52 3234.52 speaker2  Whoa.
3232.52 3237.52 speaker0  What the fuck?
3234.52 3254.52 speaker1  Cal Colorado City Action News, step aside. 29.
3248.52 3265.52 speaker2  The cigarette trembling, still stuck on his lip as he just like quivers and backs up. And he's just like going to light his cigarette in front of him, but the cigarette's not there
3261.52 3272.52 speaker1  Cal pushes everybody through and after they're up the stairs, I turn around and I'm like,
3268.52 3274.52 speaker2  He goes, yes, sir.
3273.52 3342.52 speaker1  Which apartment is hers? I don't know. Kick down all the doors. You did point at her window, you creep. That's my favorite rock. In the fiction, I said I dropped her off. And there's a doormat that just says Vivica on it. Julius wants to knock very aggressively on the door. Vivica? Cowcall her out of here with Beck and Julius. Hey, I'm here. I'm here.
3341.52 3357.52 speaker0  He's not gonna...
3354.52 3367.52 speaker1  You should open the door, though, for the next people to come in.
3366.52 3393.52 speaker0  Vivica, it's back. Hey, are you just in there editing the footage with another pass like we talked about, maybe?
3387.52 3416.52 speaker1  and I think that caused me to be fairly short-sighted about showing you what was really on there. So I want to say, I'm sorry. We're sorry. We're really sorry, Vivica. Would you let us in to talk about it?
3411.52 3437.52 speaker2  and she is trying so hard not to burst into tears again.
3435.52 3442.52 speaker1  There's the Vivica we all know.
3438.52 3500.52 speaker2  So I had a plan. I was going to take the footage, I was going to bring it back here, I was going to figure out what to do with it, I was going to talk to people, I was going to figure it out, I was going to talk to people, I was going to let you in on it too, but we were high energy and you guys seemed so gung-ho about getting it out and I didn't want to get it out because I'm scared to get it out because it's scary and terrifying and I needed to tell somebody else and I needed to get somebody else's opinion. So I decided to go wait and hide in the parking lot until after you all left and then I went back into the building and I was going to go delete all the footage. and where were you? You weren't there. No one was there. And I couldn't do anything.
3499.52 3503.52 speaker1  Yawn.
3502.52 3507.52 speaker2  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3505.52 3515.52 speaker1  Can I hear a bit of that?
3513.52 3522.52 speaker2  Better throw out a yawn.
3520.52 3561.52 speaker1  Yeah, good stuff, Zach. Oh, the thumb drive. Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. Ooh, 24, a pass.
3560.52 3570.52 speaker2  Not nice. Did you see a name?
3567.52 3580.52 speaker0  Were the badges City Police Department? Yeah.
3579.52 3586.52 speaker1  They got it from the... At the office? At the office, not here.
3585.52 3594.52 speaker2  A lot of cameras. We can see if these guys are real cops, what kind of car they pulled up in.
3592.52 3601.52 speaker0  you don't have any of the footage at all? You weren't able to maybe sneak some? Maybe pulled out a hard drive or...
3600.52 3617.52 speaker2  Her eyes go like blank.
3615.52 3661.52 speaker1  Maybe not actual demons, but who knows? Let's go look at that footage and we've got to find... We've got to find it. We can't let them have it. Guys, I'm sorry here, but it's in the hands of the police. It's perfectly safe. Cops like me. Got to go.
3660.52 3664.52 speaker2  What do you do?
3662.52 3668.52 speaker1  You get like, you see a call coming back like Cal, Colorado.
3667.52 3679.52 speaker2  I forgot to tell you. I'm dropping a pin.
3676.52 3689.52 speaker1  Like how far from the hospital is his apartment? Oh. And I imagined we got another pic of it. I thought it was real.
3688.52 3727.52 speaker2  Yeah, it was all nonsense. He's been asleep. You wake him up. Yeah, I think that's fair. So you would have the footage on the drives that the camera records the footage onto the drives. And then you take the drives to work, load them onto the computer.
3726.52 3735.52 speaker0  I already backed it up to the cloud. We're good. Oh, sweet. I'm going to make pancakes. Cool.
3734.52 3737.52 speaker2  It's raining. Oh, it's not there.
3736.52 3768.52 speaker1  Well, that's so weird. No, no, no, Zach. I'm sorry. The end of music episode already started playing. We are not there yet. Yeah, that is some fucking dark ass shit.
3767.52 3790.52 speaker2  Happy birthday to you.
3786.52 3808.52 speaker1  It's How Far is Heaven a hundred times. Julius runs back down and sticks his head out and says, And it's all my fault.
