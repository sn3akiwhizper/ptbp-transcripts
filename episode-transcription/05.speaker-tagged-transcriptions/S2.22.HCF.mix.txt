0.00 32.72 speaker0  Welcome, listeners new and less new. I've been informed by my producer that it is perfectly fine for anyone to start right here if they want to. No previous episodes are required. These next four episodes, they are here for all of you, dear listeners.
25.84 43.12 speaker1  I still have not gotten access to a smart device to listen to these so-called podcasts I hear y'all screeching about.
41.44 85.80 speaker0  season one. Now we hear it pretending to be people love to receive fan mail in the form of electronic mail.
84.32 115.24 speaker1  Howlin' with Wolf. I gots a cool rights.
111.68 121.34 speaker0  Stellar writing and an amazing cast.
120.20 142.00 speaker1  two. the last couple months. And thank you for inspiring me to run my own Delta Green scenario. Keep up that good work.
139.60 252.00 speaker0  Keep on howlin' the way you do. Ain't nobody eatin' the trash quite like you. I hope you have fun liftin' them forks. a crystal doctor or something.
243.64 267.80 speaker1  hair, and he's watching someone die, get murdered, geez louise. Oh my, it's the jungle, so jungly, so viney, y'all miss vine sometimes, no more premonitions,
263.18 343.56 speaker0  only vague and subtle hints through the gift of song.
340.00 389.80 speaker2  the city, along with a special guest. Dice Society, her work with Wizards of the Coast, Magic the Gathering, her Twitch channel, Geek and Sundry, her appearances on Glass Cannon Podcast, it's Becca Scott. Oh my God, you made me sound so fancy. She lived a long and storied career and she's gone, we got our last words here at pretending to be people. Rest in peace.
388.80 398.68 speaker3  Actually.
394.00 416.28 speaker2  In today's content-driven society, even my grandpa has an OnlyFans. He does his lawn work shirtless.
411.28 439.28 speaker3  It's just like a lemonade stand box, but it says OnlyFans. Yeah he doesn't accept charity.
435.28 442.28 speaker2  We were telling Becca before we started that we're the only Christian Delta Green podcast.
440.28 444.28 speaker3  And I said praise Jesus.
443.28 478.28 speaker2  Thank God. Once or twice. Once or twice.
477.28 493.28 speaker3  Here and there. The best RPG players and dungeon masters I've ever met will always look straight to Cameron and say, this is a homebrewed rule. For the no one else.
490.28 521.28 speaker2  Well we like to play it by the book, rules as written. That's right. And that's what we'll be doing tonight. And if you call us out on it online, you're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. Yeah, we will mobilize our armory of Tweetbots. Too political. Way too much Jesus. Yeah, we got a pretty sick two star review the other day.
517.28 529.28 speaker3  It was great because nothing in it was wrong. That's the best kind of review.
528.28 542.28 speaker2  That's all fair enough. They described our podcast very accurately. I like that Thomas said, well, they had to give it up for the quality of the show, even
538.28 560.28 speaker3  though they disagree with our politics and give us that second star. Well, they listen all the way through, so kudos.
556.28 584.28 speaker2  It is filled with chairs and a long aisle that goes down the middle. There are people scattered about. It's a decent crowd, but not anything that the speaker would text a picture of the crowd to their mom that's not overcrowded. Anyone else? Anyone else? Hey mom, look where I am.
582.28 605.28 speaker3  You'll never be here, you bitch.
603.28 621.28 speaker2  20,002. 20,002. Damn.
617.28 694.28 speaker3  and he's got well-kempt hair and he's pretty fit and he is addressing the crowd at a podium there. The workers were able to break through the ground there and they were smart and to immediately notify me and I went over to take a look and it was, in fact... but it's not writing that is familiar to anyone. It looks significant. in your history books from here on out. It's the first of its kind and it does prove, in fact, Now it will take some time to get more facts to you but at this time I can confirm it has been found. Well, that's a find.
688.28 726.28 speaker2  we cut to a hotel room, seemingly above where this conference is taking place sometime later as we see this same dignified academic. The person who you are with is a large, squat woman who is in her late 20s and she has a broken nose. It's like off to the side. One of her eyes is looking up at you as the other one stares at the blank TV as she's sitting at the foot of this bed.
724.28 751.28 speaker3  on the table in the hotel room there. You did an excellent job, Shelly.
745.28 828.28 speaker2  It's very kind and nice and I think that we're going to work well together, do you agree? and assuredness in herself, but also just a foreknowledge of what saying yes to this life means. And she kind of nods and says, It's not any way to live, but hide away your pain, I suppose, if you want to. don't feel like a fish? a text across reads, 20 years ago. The same door opens up, but we see different people inside an identical room.
825.28 879.28 speaker3  Luke, what does your guy look like? kind of eyes that are a little too big for his head, kind of slightly bugged out. And he's wearing a very, very nice three piece suit, just black with like little hints of red accents and white undershirt, very well dressed and manicured.
877.28 914.28 speaker2  that we saw in the previous room. And she's got one eye on you and her other eye is planted firmly on the person who is laying down in the bed with a pillow over their face. And as she pulls the trigger on the gun and red begins to expand out slowly from the top of the pillow, we cut back to Vincent Bori living his life in his home. What does that look like?
910.28 929.28 speaker3  making a mess in his very, very nice apartment. And once the mess is all cleaned up, fast forwards, the sun goes down, it's nighttime and he's looking up at the stars through his telescope.
927.28 946.28 speaker2  The stars are looking at me. You're looking at a particular set of stars.
944.28 955.28 speaker3  Look at them stars.
950.28 967.28 speaker2  Slowly at first, one of them just darts down to the bottom left of your view. Another one jumps from that area up to the top right.
966.28 978.28 speaker3  And as you're taking notes.
973.28 1003.28 speaker2  We cut to a picture of the notes as you're scribbling them. You've got different stars and then you start connecting all of these dots. And it makes your classic five pointed star with a circle all the way around it. And on the inside there are a couple stars. And you're not sure what to make of just two stars in the middle. But that's what it is.
999.28 1014.28 speaker3  And starts sending it out and reverse Google image searching. 2002. And not even. Unfortunately nope.
1013.28 1023.28 speaker2  You could have a digital camera.
1021.28 1026.28 speaker3  With a drawing in it.
1024.28 1033.28 speaker2  With a quill ink pen. Oh like he'd use.
1030.28 1041.28 speaker3  He's replicating the image. And he's going to do some research on scientists.
1040.28 1066.28 speaker2  You in libraries. And then eventually we. Somehow all of this knowledge brings you to this point in this hotel room. And as she pulls the trigger with one eye on you. You're quite welcome.
1064.28 1071.28 speaker3  But yeah yeah I appreciate you too.
1066.28 1093.28 speaker2  I just wanted to show you here at the top that you know. I'm not unwilling to join in. Get my hands dirty okay. I'm not going to be one of those aloof handlers. Who's just you know. Not able to handle any of your business. Because they're too busy with their own shit. I want to be. I want to be helpful. I want to be good. Do you? Right.
1090.28 1107.28 speaker3  Well in my family it's all back scratches. And I scratch hers. Alright. In my family we don't hug. We don't shake hands.
1104.28 1172.28 speaker2  It's all back scratches. The camera goes deep into the textiles of the shirt. That Vincenti Bori is wearing. And through on the other side we see a jungle. The bottom that says ten years ago. And then over the top like you do in a movie. The characters walk over the camera into view away. And we see a squad. We see a team of archaeologists with equipment. And there's a security personnel squad as well. Who is at the lead of that security squad? Jimmy Corrigan. And what does Jimmy Corrigan look like? He has a high and tight haircut. Yeah there it is baby.
1170.28 1177.28 speaker3  I'm not just doing Luke's voice am I? I don't think so.
1173.28 1205.28 speaker2  I haven't done the voice enough to have really established one. it looks like a Jurassic Park team or some shit right? Yeah absolutely.
1202.28 1213.28 speaker3  Tree sounds, tree sounds.
1206.28 1267.28 speaker2  And up to the right of you we all see a man who has frozen but he's done so in just like an extravagantly dramatic way. He's dressed. He is I promise. I fucking guarantee you. It's a Christian podcast. He's got a short beard and hands stained with dirt. He's wearing a flannel shirt, cargo pants, rugged boots. He's got a well worn backpack and a faded grey brown cowboy hat. And the tip of his shovel kind of glints and gives you a ding to show the sharpness at the tip of the shovel.
1265.28 1288.28 speaker3  It's weird.
1286.28 1348.28 speaker2  I know maybe just be a little more. Oh man if you could keep it down. Dr. Brock Hargrave says as he takes off his hat, his cowboy hat, holds it to his chest and gives you the most earnest look you've ever seen. And we are here to, we got to say thank you to Nathan in Texas who is a patron at the $10 or up level on patreon.com slash pretending pod who made Dr. Brock Hargrave. Thank you. Okay so Dr. Brock Hargrave is kind of giving you the looks and then he looks back and looks at everyone and he says, crew, I think I found it. And he shoves his digging tool into the, he thrusts it into the ground.
1347.28 1352.28 speaker3  Sorry.
1349.28 1360.28 speaker2  Good stop. He puts his, he jumps, he jumps on the, he starts to shovel.
1359.28 1367.28 speaker3  He shoves his shovel. He shoves it hard.
1366.28 1375.28 speaker2  Metaphorically speaking. The head on that shovel. Open the virgin earth.
1373.28 1382.28 speaker1  Jesus Christ.
1379.28 1397.28 speaker2  ground jungle floor noise as he puts it in. That's what I'm talking about.
1396.28 1408.28 speaker3  I got to give it up for that.
1404.28 1509.28 speaker2  The big cats are out at this time of the evening. Where we are. I think that was just one of the babies, coming from inside the clearing that this tree has made. God damn it. you see a temple that is in ruin. And you see columns. And you see a massive statue of a jungle cannon. And it groans again. It is a statue. And you approach it with your rifle. Dr. Brock Hargrave is sneaking up on his hands and knees up next to you. What an impish way to do that. at the base, the pedestal of the statue. He is unrolling this piece of parchment
1507.28 1516.28 speaker3  This guy has his own parchment.
1509.28 1539.28 speaker2  We cut to the entire escort, the entire crew of this archaeological dig As you make your way out of this tree clearing, the tree falls behind you. as you guys are running.
1536.28 1562.28 speaker3  but he's able to kind of stumble his way up to Corrigan. Corrigan. I fucking thought I was going to keep you safe from wild animals or poachers. I didn't know what the fuck that was. I've never seen anything like that in my life.
1559.28 1595.28 speaker2  and this woman walks up to you. She's quite fit. Shelly, you actually recognize the broken nose and wandering eye of the handler you had met 10 years ago as she approaches. Jimmy, is it? Appreciate your silence moving forward on what you saw back there, yeah? May I ask why? Do you think that the world is ready to see that?
1593.28 1626.28 speaker3  and his two newborn babies. Nice pond. Yeah.
1624.28 1629.28 speaker2  Is it Jennifer Jason Leigh from Annihilation?
1628.28 1645.28 speaker3  Well done. Just watched it with me?
1644.28 1716.28 speaker2  Yep. And as the hands shake, we do that wild, old-school Batman transition And it says, June 25th, 2022, 10 days ago. And the camera pans up on an old Victorian home that has seen much, much better times. It sits just outside of the city. And after it says June 25th, 10 days ago, comma, or no, underneath it, nice. Good formatting.
1711.28 1886.28 speaker3  spray paint covering most of the exterior walls saying, Keep out and hobos will kill you in here. And other things people would definitely spray paint on the outside of this abandoned house that is obviously holding some derelicts. You know, the dregs of society, but a family to one another. and it's got the dirtiest bear mattress you've ever seen lying on the ground, newspapers taped up to every wall, red strings attaching them, but then sort of like a ball of string never really finished its initial job. Somebody just decided to get really stoned in the middle of whatever they were working on. A lot of unfinished projects, but a lot of things left to be uncovered in this room as you see a ladder hit against the window sill, and a mess of wiry black hair peeps up over the side. Hey fish face, you in here? Check out my score. The army surplus green rucksack she always carries lands in the living room before she slings the leg over the sill and you see this tiny bit of a woman. Meat hook. is gaunt and thin, pale skin, beady, darting eyes, always sizing up every wall of the room, every exit before stepping into it with kind of squirrel-like movements and doesn't trust nobody. Yeah, look at all this top ramen. I scored like 20, 30 packs. You see this? Oh, we're gonna be full to our gillyworths. That's right, just like we always say, full to the gillyworths. You know something, fish face? What's that? Even though it's never gonna work out romantically between us and we've made that very clear. That makes sense. You're the only person I can trust. Cause you're too dumb to ever lie to me. That's enough for me.
1882.28 1893.28 speaker2  He pours out some of the powder and does a quick line. Line of what? Oh, fish face, of seasoning. The ramen seasoning.
1891.28 1914.28 speaker3  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like it when it gets all up into my nasal packages and then I can only taste this shrimp lime for a week. He's a little freak.
1912.28 1924.28 speaker2  I was thinking the whole time like,
1921.28 1926.28 speaker3  She even got her name right on the first try.
1924.28 1942.28 speaker2  That's a pro. That's a pro.
1941.28 1944.28 speaker3  First check of the game.
1942.28 1949.28 speaker2  First check of the game.
1944.28 1959.28 speaker3  Alertness. Okay, I got a 50. Let's see. That's a fail. 75.
1955.28 1972.28 speaker2  which I mean immediately puts the hairs on the back of your neck at the opposite of ease, you hear a woman's voice from behind you.
1969.28 1985.28 speaker3  She stands up quick and flips out her butterfly knife and does a four point flip maneuver. Who the freak are you?
1982.28 2002.28 speaker2  I appreciate you being about your wits.
1999.28 2027.28 speaker3  of Meat Hooks. Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. Which in tattoo form inside the mouth is never going to be legible.
2024.28 2029.28 speaker2  Especially since Fish Hook did it.
2027.28 2033.28 speaker3  He can't even spell good.
2030.28 2045.28 speaker2  Yes. who's a human. I'll just say that since we're playing Delta Green.
2042.28 2053.28 speaker3  I'm imagining a full on fish.
2047.28 2066.28 speaker2  Her nose is extremely crooked off to one side and this woman is gaunt. This woman is skin and bones. You think dripping wet. She wouldn't even weigh two stone. What's two stone? Not a lot. You should know before you say it.
2065.28 2082.28 speaker3  Forty pounds? Oh, not even forty pounds. Not even four stone. Maybe four stone.
2078.28 2128.28 speaker2  No, but she has seemingly shrunk. She is extremely, extremely gaunt. And Meat Hook, my name is Esther or Ruth or Solomon or Lazarus, whatever you need it to be right now. I guess you can call me Esther. You're used to it. And what else you're used to is putting your life on the line for things that matter. Is that right? I see. I see you.
2127.28 2136.28 speaker3  Yes, ma'am.
2133.28 2155.28 speaker2  Meat Hook for some time, but no one in the house would know, something that you keep a secret?
2150.28 2159.28 speaker3  and watch them finger paint because she never got to have that one-on-one personal attention when she was a kid.
2158.28 2212.28 speaker2  That's sad. what you think I don't know that I know about you, which is that I know that you stand outside that window every Thursday
2207.28 2234.28 speaker3  I got all the paint I need and I point to a whole collection of graffiti can spray paints.
2230.28 2240.28 speaker2  Because I think you'd be surprised once again at what I can offer.
2238.28 2264.28 speaker3  You know, we've been working for a while. We're trying to bring down the man in a lot of ways. We're starting a revolution. We want people to know what's out there, that the government is run by lizard people.
2261.28 2291.28 speaker2  we got to take it one bite at a time on our way to the top. And I've got a job that needs skills with your persuasion. that way you don't have to make as many runs like you do, or whether it's putting our sights on something big, maybe you got your hopes up for.
2288.28 2326.28 speaker3  That's within your capability. I've heard tell. Only seen it through a window. As soon as I touch it, it's so soft.
2322.28 2334.28 speaker2  And you got to deal with it.
2330.28 2338.28 speaker3  I'm in.
2334.28 2342.28 speaker2  The people that I'm bringing to this aren't going to want you in here. I'm just telling you right now.
2341.28 2349.28 speaker3  I'm used to that. Someone just watched Andor.
2347.28 2358.28 speaker2  It's just those patches on your jacket there. I'm just, you know, it's the choices you made with your life.
2355.28 2365.28 speaker3  As we look down and see the outfit I forgot to describe.
2363.28 2394.28 speaker4  Stained and dirty. Black ripped jeans. And of course, never leaves the house without her leather jacket. Covered in studs with a big anarchy A on back. You were noticing my patches?
2393.28 2400.28 speaker2  That one's true too.
2399.28 2402.28 speaker3  Yeah.
2401.28 2414.28 speaker4  What else? You know, milk isn't just for kids. I made that one myself. I'm not sure where I'm going with it.
2411.28 2458.28 speaker2  I like that one best, personally. Here's the deal. This job, it's about getting some of this information out about some of these alternative things. These three other agents that I'm bringing in on this job. They're all about keeping all of this business under wraps. Keeping it hidden from the world. I need you to be on that side of things for just this one mission. You can keep spouting off your rhetoric, however you see fit outside.
2456.28 2500.28 speaker4  That's where I gotta say no. If there's one thing I can't do, it's put the kaput on. I'm not a kaputter putter oner. I'm not a kaputter taker offer, you know what I mean? Look at this article. It says governor unveils new nuclear power plant. You think that's all that's in that building? I've broken in. Well, I couldn't get into a lot of the locked doors, but I'm going to find out more.
2494.28 2507.28 speaker3  He just goes around the room pointing at normal, everyday announcements for the public
2504.28 2521.28 speaker4  One day I'll put it all together. I know there's a big master plan.
2516.28 2533.28 speaker2  the story arc that you're on saying no to this right off the bat, but...
2531.28 2542.28 speaker3  That's one of her patches.
2541.28 2545.28 speaker4  That's right. Can you get me a soft ramen?
2544.28 2571.28 speaker2  That's right. And any more information on any of these flipping through some of these articles, these dead ends, I can give you a through street.
2570.28 2575.28 speaker3  Hell yeah.
2574.28 2630.28 speaker4  That's a 40.
2626.28 2682.28 speaker2  You've all been invited to a Bible study. It is delivered by email from watchingthestreetatgmail.com.
2681.28 2723.28 speaker3  It's an email. Yeah, Shelley's butler printed it out for him.
2718.28 2739.28 speaker2  We need to arrive. We need to arrive at this house. So who gets there first? Would anyone scope out the place before? Yeah, I kind of thought.
2734.28 2748.28 speaker4  Okay, so I was at the library naturally because Esther told me, look out for an email.
2746.28 2756.28 speaker3  Oh.
2750.28 2784.28 speaker4  The UFOs are right above you at yahoo.com. So this is a Bible study. It ate oak av. I know these streets of the city.
2776.28 2852.28 speaker2  So we see a street with a house on it that has, it's a ranch style house. Two car garage has a basketball hoop concreted in next to the driveway. And the landscaping at one time was well done, but has very much gone to shit. It hasn't been mowed in weeks and it's July. And you pop your head out of one of these little drainage ditches on the side of the road with direct eye contact with the front of this house. And you see a foreclosure sign is in the yard of eight oak avenue. Avenue spelled all the way out in all of your emails. There's a Jeep parked across the street and it's been there for a couple hours.
2847.28 2866.28 speaker4  pull out a can of spray paint from her bag and just spray paint an X in the middle of the street and then kiss it for good luck.
2862.28 2879.28 speaker3  out of the sewer, Vincent or Vincent. Do another lap around and we'll make sure everything's good and you can drop me off. No problem, boss. Okay.
2878.28 2901.28 speaker2  Of course. Of course I will. Nailed it. Thanks Joe.
2897.28 2932.28 speaker3  Now it's looking a little raggedy and he's pulling up and uh, he sees Jimmy and they kind of make eye contact. You're like shoes. You live here?
2931.28 3010.28 speaker4  I was told to be here. Second of all. I never seen your kids. I never seen a single finger paint in my life. You must be thinking of some other trash lady.
3006.28 3014.28 speaker3  He's like, well, I never seen nobody look like a fucking rat like you. Okay.
3012.28 3035.28 speaker4  You just beat up on me today. What is this? Are those, uh, spats on your shoes? I didn't have the means.
3034.28 3043.28 speaker3  Do you smoke cigarettes?
3042.28 3045.28 speaker4  Here you go.
3043.28 3082.28 speaker3  He gives her a fresh cigarette. And then he looks over. Oh yeah. Yeah. You never returned my letters when I was asking about the sky stuff, but you're more of an
3081.28 3085.28 speaker1  The star crystals. Yes. I remember.
3084.28 3106.28 speaker3  Yeah. We can talk about this once we get into our mission, but I got lots. I got your brain, your whole brain.
3105.28 3109.28 speaker2  He's just walking away. In a way kid.
3107.28 3120.28 speaker3  I fear that that man is not a surgeon.
3113.28 3137.28 speaker2  You see a woman that you've seen before, uh, looking at two of you at a time, nose crooked, crinkled off to the side this time. However, she is just extremely gone. So small. I mean, maybe four stone.
3132.28 3140.28 speaker3  You've doubled in size.
3139.28 3146.28 speaker4  You look good. Thank you.
3145.28 3151.28 speaker3  Ruth. How are you?
3150.28 3208.44 speaker2  Come on in. Come on in. thorough, thorough cat piss. your eyes. And this house matches when it comes to whether it's clean or not. And she says, how about we go with Moses on this one? All right. Now you'll see that I've been busy and you see papers, maps everywhere, circles, numbers, dates all around. You see she's written Holy cow farms on one of these maps and she kind of points at it and she's like, this is your mission. Okay. Dr. Brock Hargrave.
3207.44 3221.72 speaker3  Jimmy here. Jimmy, uh, first of all, the scent of the cat piss and then the mention of that name,
3220.72 3222.72 speaker2  team.

3264.36 3319.20 speaker2  Years of practicing that tense situations and suppressing his own emotions come to his service and he just pushes it down to his toes. on reality. You glance around, you notice that just within this small room and kind of the rooms around you, you don't see a cat. You don't see any cat toys. You don't see a litter box, um, nothing to that. All right. So, um, all right. I guess, uh, and she goes to the table and is like, I guess we'll, we'll talk here. And she just shoves all of these papers off of the table onto the ground and puts that map down that she, uh, takes off all these pins, uh, from it off the wall, slams it down. It says, Holy cow farm. She's like, this is, this is where, um, Dr. Brock Hargrave has been working and, uh, he went missing.
3316.08 3322.36 speaker3  One of his coworkers also went missing, you know, he's on the list.
3320.24 3363.76 speaker2  We need to figure out what happened. He was after something that we were looking into and he, uh, clearly maybe fell prey to the vector. But, um, that's why we're sending in you is to figure out what happened. The vector. Yeah. Vector is the word that we use sometimes to describe an unnatural incursion, like, like what you saw and looks at you too, like what you saw and looks at meat hook. Like what you know is real.
3362.36 3369.88 speaker4  That's not what's really real.
3364.76 3372.60 speaker3  You're telling me this kid has never experienced the mythos and you're bringing her in on something like this.
3370.88 3396.16 speaker2  This kid has skills that you need. Roll. Okay. On top of the fridge.
3395.16 3400.16 speaker3  This kid's good.

3435.24 3449.80 speaker4  Look at you.
3448.80 3450.80 speaker3  Your moon rock store.
3449.80 3465.44 speaker1  Moon rock store.
3463.08 3492.04 speaker3  Well I smoked too many cigarettes to smell anything. Now let's go to the stinky shit cow farm.
3486.80 3522.20 speaker2  It is in a business district and it is just an office building. Damn. I'm sorry. Meat hook. Meat hook.
3521.20 3526.00 speaker4  In stick and poke?
3524.60 3536.76 speaker3  I've, I've got it memorized.
3531.36 3567.88 speaker4  You know, it's like a 700 page book, so we're still working on it, but, uh, we at least got the prologue, my boy fish face. You can't come on this mission. Sorry. He'll be here if we need him.
3562.04 3576.10 speaker3  Ruth you're telling me these two urchins who are so obviously in love, one of whom has You're going to send them out untested on an operation.
3574.96 3587.08 speaker4  We're not meant to be together. I know it seems that way. I know it looks like we're very compatible. It didn't work out. I don't want to get into details.
3586.08 3595.76 speaker2  Okay. See, I think that this is going to be fine for these exact reasons.
3593.76 3599.08 speaker1  Yeah, I'm cool with it.
3598.08 3624.32 speaker3  Yeah. you're going to survive.
3623.32 3637.32 speaker4  Sorry. Uh, Vincenze really looks like a Jimmy. He does. All right. Well, uh, I'm pretty quick.
3636.32 3668.92 speaker2  What's the game plan? Well, do they know we're coming? Uh, no, I mean we can, we can, she kind of points to an area in the corner where there's some like a laminator and a printer. And she's like, I can dolly up some, whatever kind of ID you want here, uh, to get into the building. If you, if you want to start there or, uh, you guys can just go break into his house or you, you know, I mean, whichever one you feel, why don't you get those credentials
3667.00 3674.92 speaker3  ready while we break into his house?
3672.52 3709.04 speaker2  I mean, that's why you're here, right? So one of them went missing at work. The coworker went missing at work, but Dr. Brock Hargrave left that same day and then didn't come back in. So coworker never clocked out and Dr. Hargrave left and never came back. It sounds a lot like that. Doesn't it? But for what?
3701.28 3724.36 speaker3  If I know anything about crime scenes, uh, which I mean, why would I, uh, but maybe we should try to get some evidence at the holy cow farms and then present it to the doctor, uh, in order to take him in.
3722.36 3733.32 speaker4  To make him turn himself in.
3729.52 3735.04 speaker5  Yeah, we could put on a play where we recreate what happens.
3733.32 3739.92 speaker3  So he's forced to confess out of guilt.
3738.92 3745.16 speaker1  I'm sorry.
3743.52 3758.96 speaker3  I can put on a puppet play. You've noticed. And he kind of straightens his jacket.
3757.96 3762.72 speaker4  Doc.
3761.72 3764.72 speaker1  This is.
3763.72 3767.72 speaker3  This is Craig. Mile.

3785.76 3813.52 speaker3  Craig Mile is essential. He makes the puppet look up at him at St. Blythe and then look away and then look back. You of course are essential. She gets all up in his face.
3811.76 3822.00 speaker4  Oh, Brock?
3818.32 3846.72 speaker1  The guy who thinks he can just walk into a place and all of a sudden he's the talk of the town? That he can just discover things? Like he points at a thing. Oh, he discovered it?
3843.12 3874.52 speaker3  Jimmy knows about my history with Hargrave.
3873.52 3890.42 speaker2  What? I don't believe so.
3886.80 3894.82 speaker3  so that the puppet show can go.
3890.42 3900.36 speaker1  So that there's some verisimilitude to the play that I produce, yes.
3898.88 3903.04 speaker3  How do we use those?
3901.24 3933.20 speaker4  I don't think you're sewer people.
3931.92 3940.24 speaker3  it.
3937.68 3946.96 speaker2  That one turn at the end is going to get you.
3943.72 3954.66 speaker3  I don't like doing it, but I walk 30,000 steps a day.
3953.66 3964.10 speaker5  That's grimace.
3959.94 3972.94 speaker3  He is my driver and a decent friend of mine.
3965.78 3984.84 speaker4  As impractical as it might be, I think, um, we should take the giant Escalade limousine
3979.82 3988.32 speaker5  I'll be following, uh, the convoy and also comprising the only other vehicle in the convoy in my Jeep.
3987.32 4265.42 speaker4  Yeah.
