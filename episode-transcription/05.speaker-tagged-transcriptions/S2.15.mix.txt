278.72 283.52 speaker0  Hmm, weird.
280.32 325.20 speaker1  The can crew then crept quickly through the woods on the far east side of Grover's Gorge, heading south until they met the enormous plant wall. without starting a commotion. There was, however, a commotion in Grover's Gorge and backed toward Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge,
322.72 332.80 speaker0  that crosses the foggy crevasse
329.92 355.04 speaker1  and a church stuck upside down where it fell into this chasm so many years ago. You know what?
352.72 405.04 speaker0  and it's all my fault. It's all my fault Cause my life is great And it's all mine Cause my life is great And it's all my fault What about my hair?
402.56 422.72 speaker2  if you don't follow us or if you do specifically on camera.
421.04 428.96 speaker3  Do you put anything in your beard? Nope. Yeah, gasoline.
428.32 433.36 speaker2  but it doesn't. It's just dry and brittle.
432.24 444.80 speaker3  and that was crazy. Yeah, then we smelt it for a while. I think I just got used to it and then go outside and come back in. I'm like, oh, it definitely smells like burnt hair.
443.44 449.20 speaker2  I was smelling it the next day.
448.72 451.52 speaker3  Yep. How does it feel?
451.12 468.00 speaker2  It's fine. It's 100% fine, except that I did singe my eyelashes and they feel weird still, but they're going to be fine. Like crusty?
466.64 480.16 speaker3  when I was standing outside. Oh, I got the whole thing.
477.20 488.16 speaker2  but I looked at myself in a mirror later and always and I was like, did I get like Cheeto puff in my hair? Like dust?
487.04 491.44 speaker3  It was orange?
488.16 500.64 speaker2  It was like a little, I guess cause I have like brownish hair. I had like brownish hair.
498.80 515.60 speaker3  New Year's 01 was crazy. Everybody thought, you know, Y2K was going to end it all the year before.
511.52 537.28 speaker2  Oh, so you guys just pass through the door? The door? Well, I did some research on what those doors are called. Nice. Yeah. And apparently...
533.52 543.36 speaker3  that the fucking libs have put on the big ass door industry. What did you learn?
542.72 557.12 speaker2  Wait, wait, wait. Dows. The watertight things that come together. So like the seal.
554.80 569.12 speaker3  The cams is what I'm reading on the internet. Submariner. Whatever.
565.20 580.88 speaker2  And they said dog the door. Spin the wheel to engage the cams in the closed position. The pins.
579.52 591.52 speaker3  So it's not called the dog. Okay. So the pins that like lock it into place? But not the door itself, which is what you just said earlier.
590.16 597.20 speaker2  It's called a door, I think. And then the parts around are dogs. So dog the doors. I adore with my dogs.
596.16 604.40 speaker3  I adore my dogs. Nice. Y'all.
602.16 612.56 speaker2  See, that just opens up more confusion now. Cause when you say dog door, we're going to all start crawling. Yeah.
612.08 620.16 speaker3  Very good.
613.20 668.64 speaker2  Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, Julius Summers, and Stevie are all standing in a simple steel single train car sized train station on an unnecessarily massive bridge, 20 meters tall and 100 meters long. This bridge that crosses this enormous massive ravine is a minimalist construction showcasing the steel that seems to be your only way back over this deep, wide, and foggy ravine. The fog seems to be growing thicker and taller with every second. And soon it will be a wall that this simple steel single train car will need to penetrate to get to the other side.
664.88 670.64 speaker3  Did you want us to, uh, where did you have a beat written in there? No, no.
669.28 679.04 speaker2  It says and standing. So there's a, there's a hatch.
677.76 680.72 speaker3  Pause for the dirty boys.
679.04 759.84 speaker2  Pause for the dirty boys. Is this the kind of hat you can dog? Chug Bidwell in his snug, now snugger green, now darker green polo steps confidently through the door, just dripping. Suddenly Stevie, their eyes get huge with realization. And she begins like she's going to sprint out of the train car toward the soggy current mayor of Grover's gorge. We're going to move in dexterity order. So if one of you has higher decks than Stevie. Yep. 75. 50. 50 and? 45. 45. So it's going to go Julia Summers, Stevie, and then down the line, we got Beck, Beck What do you do?
759.60 769.76 speaker3  Okay.
768.96 804.16 speaker2  Yeah, I don't win. Stevie rolled a success. single steel, simple train car sized simple train station and toward the sopping wet current mayor of Grover's Gorge. It is Beck Wilder's turn.
798.48 812.32 speaker3  Beck, we've all resigned ourselves to trying to get the fuck out of here. I don't think that he's on the train.
809.68 827.12 speaker2  Stevie, dude, we got to go. Would that be helpful? We need to leave. No, it's got to happen now.
826.88 843.28 speaker3  knee. But yeah, he's starting to chase after Stevie and he's shouting, Stevie, I don't think this is very prudent. Have you really considered if this is the best course of action? Why don't you just wait up a minute there? Hold on, Stevie.
841.76 857.92 speaker2  I'm really serious, guys. This is very serious.
855.68 864.10 speaker3  I fail mine a 65 on a 50. I also rolled a 65 on a 80.
863.60 871.44 speaker2  Nice. Very good.
865.60 878.16 speaker3  So you are giving it your all, but I gave her a plus 20 because you had a predetermined
873.28 889.44 speaker2  I gave her a plus 20 because the thing that she knows is very stout. And I gave her a 50. What did she roll? For a human. Luke, what did she roll?
888.00 918.16 speaker3  77 on a 70. Wait, why did you want to, what were you going to do? Okay.
910.72 935.60 speaker2  Sopping wet, Chuck Bidwell is just walking confidently, carefully, and slowly toward the edge of the cliff with one eye kind of looking over. He's kind of glancing over Stevie, giving her a very dirty eyes. Where's the other eye looking? Now, both of them, both of them together, one of them and the other one. Two eyes.
933.84 942.48 speaker3  He's got two eyes on Stevie.
936.88 946.80 speaker2  And he's just walking away and walking toward the edge of the cliff while you guys, they've turned around and they look at you.
946.40 968.48 speaker3  Yeah. Now I feel like I've made a mistake. Should you run after him, Stevie?
967.04 985.84 speaker2  He's been trying to do this the whole time. That's why he's the mayor. It's this weird, some sort of fucking spell or some shit that's actually real where he's the mayor and he stays the mayor and it stays the mayor as long as there's a mayor. But if he dies, there's no mayor and it's loose on everyone.
984.88 989.92 speaker3  Turtles are slow. And they live for a long time.
988.08 990.96 speaker2  And they typically don't kill themselves.
990.32 991.76 speaker0  Yeah.
990.96 1006.88 speaker3  God turtle. God. Stevie should go. Stevie, go get him.
1004.72 1066.08 speaker2  And she, and she turns around. So either one that you decide to use is fine. Word. Oh, cool. Tight. on and restrain Chuck Bidwell from walking any further. However, Chuck Bidwell continues his gate as Stevie continues to plant her heels into the ground and they're just trying to hold on. You've only got one roll. Do not let it pass you by. The classic crap.
1065.04 1071.04 speaker3  from the gorge.
1069.04 1081.20 speaker2  Because he's just walking slowly. You can just roll strength if that's higher than unarmed combat. I'll do an unarmed combat. Cause you're trying to push.
1079.20 1106.88 speaker3  I got a 31 on a 60. Damn.
1104.72 1112.72 speaker2  Tired from pushing Vernon.
1106.88 1121.92 speaker3  Julius is just a little worn out from, you know, he basically maxed out at the gym today. On Vernon's head.
1117.04 1135.36 speaker2  And now you are just trying to hold on, but Chuck Bidwell continues. Darth Vader like walk toward this edge. Oh yeah. The Olympics.
1134.64 1136.80 speaker3  Atlanta? Come on.
1136.08 1154.56 speaker2  96. Whatever. And Colorado, uh, Beck Wilder has. Uh huh. Yeah. Thanksgiving, the year I was born.
1153.04 1160.64 speaker3  He wasn't allowed in the parade. So people were trying to hold him back.
1157.04 1162.64 speaker2  That Darth Vader walked with such strength and vigor. Beck Wilder.
1161.36 1182.80 speaker3  I'm doing the same thing. Stevie has convinced me that I've already seen this crazy shit happen. And I don't want more of that. And it sounds like it's going to be real bad if I do. So he wants to, uh, I want to go over there and try and help block like a, is it a frontline man? Yeah. I want to, I want to kind of get into stance. Okay.
1180.56 1194.56 speaker2  Now are you doing pass blocking or brush blocking? So pass blocking is going to be kind of on your heels, trying to keep them in front of you and rush blocking is going to be driving the group forward.
1192.32 1209.36 speaker3  Once I, once I center mass him. Yeah. Orlando pace. That's what I was thinking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1208.56 1218.16 speaker2  2000. Explosive. Explosive. A lot, a lot like Beck.
1217.28 1233.28 speaker3  300 pounds. I don't know what I was rolling on. Was it good? But it's good. Well, what are you trying to use? Let's go strength. 21 on a 55. Okay.
1232.16 1241.12 speaker2  Chuck, but it all failed. Yeah. 78 over 70.
1237.44 1247.76 speaker3  I don't know if it's strong enough to knock him down, but I'm at least digging in my heels and he, he was not moving forward.
1242.32 1258.16 speaker2  You have stopped the progress of Chuck Bidwell and it is Cal Colorado's turn. Dope, dope, dope.
1252.08 1260.00 speaker3  And I think he just like grabs on to Julius's shoulders and yanks back and brings like the whole group with them. Love it.
1259.44 1287.92 speaker2  Go ahead and roll. Hopefully you bring the whole group with you in a good way.
1287.60 1299.04 speaker3  back. But, uh, he, he merely. What? Julius is in the front.
1298.32 1311.28 speaker2  part. Okay. So in my mind, Stevie is on the back holding back. Julius was in the front, trying to push him forward. And then Beck came up behind Julius and was pile driving the two of them.
1310.48 1316.24 speaker3  Yeah, he was. Well then no one to me grabbing Julius's shoulders. Exactly. It didn't help.
1315.68 1323.76 speaker2  It didn't help. But thankfully you got the momentum on your side. And so I think we're all feeling pretty good about the outcome of this.
1322.32 1331.36 speaker3  I'm grabbing Stevie's shoulders then. Yes, that is correct.
1330.00 1337.44 speaker2  Yes, absolutely.
1336.40 1362.48 speaker3  It's a good old fashioned tug. We got a good old fashioned tug of war. Away. Distract him a little bit. A 70 on a 60.
1362.24 1373.76 speaker2  Yeah. As you go to tickle him, you feel the wettest. Where are you getting in?
1372.56 1402.56 speaker3  It's going to be nasty. I had my arms on his shoulders, like pushing back and I took one hand off to tickle him and I put it up into his armpit. But like the polo is like sopping wet and the tickle. Well, it's like squeezing a ShamWow. Right. It's just there's too much pressure to tickle. It just feels like I'm poking his armpit. Gross. Yeah, absolutely. He's like, ouch.
1401.44 1432.32 speaker2  Stevie attempts the same. Will it tickle? Finger in armpit, wiggling around, but just poking and sopping wet you.
1430.96 1440.32 speaker3  What cool thing did he do?
1434.00 1454.00 speaker2  Chuck Bidwell continues with one foot over the edge like he you're holding on now. You've had to move out of the way in order to not get pushed off the back yourselves and it is all up to Cal Colorado.
1451.44 1460.24 speaker3  Success.
1460.00 1463.28 speaker2  Right?
1463.04 1479.44 speaker3  Oops. other hand. But instead I slip trying to get lasagna out of my pockets. Where you're pointing is just down.
1478.48 1510.96 speaker2  Hey, look down there. He looks down there. This is one of those let go or don't situations. Raise your hand if you're audio medium. Say a holler at if you're letting go of Chuck of Chuck as he is strongly moving over the edge. Basically you're choosing whether or not you're going over. He's not making an attempt to grab at any of you.
1509.92 1512.80 speaker3  Would I have a chance?
1511.76 1528.48 speaker2  This is your moment. You're not going to stop him from going over because that ship is sailed, but you can stop him from grabbing. Just want to slap his hand away. Because he is going for a very firm grasp based on the rules that I rolled. It's an 18.
1528.24 1539.44 speaker3  Okay. Uh, yeah, absolutely.
1538.88 1544.72 speaker2  Go ahead and roll.
1543.44 1562.56 speaker3  One last push for a tickle. As he reaches out, you tickle like the inside of his wrist.
1561.04 1574.24 speaker4  to the perfect tickle pressure.
1573.12 1582.80 speaker3  The gradient of tickle. Yeah.
1580.96 1598.48 speaker4  before I'm not touching his armpit at all.
1591.20 1605.52 speaker2  And like releases Stevie as he just falls backwards and looks at you with these like dead eyes.
1604.80 1626.64 speaker3  Have us on. We'd cast you. Dead eyed motherfucker.
1620.48 1689.04 speaker2  With kind of a blurry image behind him of the smooth cavernous crevasse. I think it's just a. The crossbones fills your stomachs with dread. Your hands get clammy. Your sight seems compromised. And you feel an air blasting boom so loud that you wonder for a split moment. If you'll ever hear again. And I need you each to roll con times five. To stay conscious.
1688.08 1707.52 speaker3  It's a 77.
1704.96 1778.96 speaker2  Thomas and Joe take our headphones off. Take your pants off. and just vibrates your entire being. Your vision goes completely. And suddenly it's extremely dark. It was a perfectly bright day here in this gorge. And now it is extremely dark. I need you to roll grip. In this darkness, you see that the rest of the can crew, Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, and Stevie have all fallen to the ground, seemingly unconscious.
1773.84 1788.24 speaker4  to try to rush over to his coworkers on the ground and see what's up to kind of try to slap him away. Okay. You're kind of slapping at him.
1785.60 1812.08 speaker2  You see, you know, Cal's an older guy. He seems to have fallen okay. He doesn't seem to like have broken anything in the fall. Stevie's just completely out. None of them are getting back up. And you hear this rumble coming from the bottom of the chasm.
1807.28 1831.36 speaker4  is on the ground and Beck is incapacitated and real footage is better than TikTok footage. So he's going to grab the camera and he's going to point it at the sound. Okay.
1824.64 1845.20 speaker2  And the fog is rising up like a push pop being just lifted from something coming up as the rumbling is growing louder and louder from below. Yeah.
1839.84 1855.20 speaker4  the camera so he doesn't have to, you know, completely look over it, but aim the camera, see if he can see anything through the fog as the fog lifts.
1854.24 1859.20 speaker2  What does that smell?
1858.96 1859.84 speaker4  Yeah.
1859.20 1869.28 speaker2  It's dank. It's like, it's musty, but it's also.
1868.00 1879.36 speaker4  That's exactly right.
1872.32 1883.92 speaker2  And in order to witness it, I need you to either ask me one question or three yes, no questions.
1880.64 1903.20 speaker4  I already know that I get a salty taste in my mouth. Yep. I know that it sounds like disembodied voices that aren't really saying anything. Yep. And I know that as you remember that you begin hearing it and I know that it's a liquidy human formed this thing. Yep. Sorry, give me a second. I'll just, I'll do yes or no. Make it quick. Okay.
1902.56 1904.16 speaker2  That's three.
1903.20 1921.12 speaker4  Do I see it now? Yes. Is it coming at me? Yes. Yes.
1911.76 1962.96 speaker2  This incomprehensible humanoid wet energy structure erupts out of this chasm, lifting the fog above its head as it rises its shoulders next, you see an enormous torso and you're staring between the legs of this. It's the size of a suburban. It's coming to scoop you up.
1959.04 1987.60 speaker4  Julius is going to take the camera off his shoulder and set it down on the ground toward the camera is still kind of facing it. He's going to run. Okay. Okay. No. I promise.
1987.04 2010.72 speaker2  Holy shit. Where do you run? How do you, how do you get away? I'm going to run. That's what you want. Holy fucking. You turn the wheel. Let's go doggies. Doggies. You dog the door.
2010.08 2016.00 speaker4  try to save you. Okay.
2013.84 2019.92 speaker2  So you've dogged the door. Yeah.
2016.64 2026.56 speaker4  He just like flips it and it just spins on its own. Yes.
2025.52 2044.96 speaker2  Slam it shut. Dog those doors from the other side. You are now inside. Luke just mouthed what the fuck to no one in this room right now. Just looked at, I don't know what.
2044.08 2070.08 speaker4  No game plan. No game plan. Yeah. Julius like closes the door and locks it, seals it back up again, turns around and looks at Grover's Gorge and just. Okay.
2065.60 2090.40 speaker2  that you did this all quite stealthily and are able to just kind of blend back into this wall.
2085.04 2094.88 speaker4  here that might have any chance of giving a shit about what is going on specifically with Stevie is Fox God.
2093.44 2125.28 speaker2  We're going to the GIZ? Okay. How are you going to get there? Basically your options are you can, I mean, cross over the track, this bouncy synthetic colorful material, or you can kind of go around to a sidewalk situation over near the GIZs, or you can cut all the way through the wall and then go around the backside of the GIZs.
2119.76 2133.68 speaker4  and go back, but there's not, I don't, I feel he thinks this is pretty fucking urgent. Okay. You might get caught.
2132.32 2140.72 speaker2  perception of the town. If you go straight there, if you, if you kind of cut around and use the sidewalk, if you go around back, I'll give you a plus 40 to your stealth.
2140.56 2173.84 speaker4  Yeah. He's going to cut around back and, and just be like, try to be stealthy, but he's booking it. I got a 47 on an 80. It was 80. What did I roll? He could succeeded with 77.
2170.56 2232.48 speaker2  You're creeping through the brush and flowers. No, I'm not creeping. I'm running. And as you head around the corner behind these GIZs, you see there's a privacy fence in the backyard, right? So you keep going around the back of the privacy fence and you run down. Now you're running kind of North South based on when you first arrived. Right. And you're running toward the far side away. You're trying to remember where the GIZ was that Fox went into. And as you're trying to remember, you trip on something in the ground and you look down and you see a fucking Jackalope. Nope. And at the head of this body length metal cage is a tombstone.
2231.44 2240.16 speaker4  It says, oh. Julius Sommers.
2239.20 2242.16 speaker0  Wait, fuck.
2241.36 2249.20 speaker2  What's the name? Is it too late to do something? Yeah, of course it is. What's the name on this tombstone? Just give me a good last name.
2248.24 2249.70 speaker4  Cream pie.
2249.20 2252.32 speaker2  Nope.
2251.68 2253.36 speaker4  Crumpy.
2252.88 2269.28 speaker2  Thank you. Okay. So it's Jeremiah Crumpy, former mayor of Grover's Gorge. And as you trip, you hear a voice call out.
2268.88 2279.52 speaker4  Hello?
2276.32 2302.56 speaker2  in one of the GIZs that you were running past. He's in a very like fine robe that's monochromatic with green accents. And he holds up a cup of coffee to you.
2299.36 2312.64 speaker4  I actually just got into town from the train station. I have a very important delivery for Fox Gotel and I've got to get to him.
2310.08 2323.04 speaker2  Uh, either disguise or persuade.
2322.56 2339.84 speaker4  Okay. But you can look if you want.
2338.64 2348.40 speaker2  Holy fuck. No way!
2346.96 2353.20 speaker4  Could you show me where he is? Where his GIZ is?
2352.64 2362.48 speaker3  Fantastic.
2361.76 2382.88 speaker4  Yes. Yes, sir. Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.
2382.40 2411.04 speaker2  Well done. He's got like a basketball hoop with a trampoline next to it. He's got a pool. He's got a hot tub.
2409.44 2435.44 speaker4  drive it and it flips all around. Two of those. That's crazy.
2434.72 2453.12 speaker2  that's covered. And there is like a huge bar with a built-in grill and a tabletop kind of situation.
2451.28 2462.32 speaker4  Yeah, Fox is dancing. What music do I hear?
2459.60 2475.76 speaker2  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Just kind of on repeat and he's just kind of getting it.
2470.56 2484.96 speaker4  And Julius is going to take his shot and go, he's going to close his door.
2483.36 2522.96 speaker2  Hey, what's up, my guy? You came in through the back? I, uh, wait, did he talk more like this? I think. I think so. Oh wow. No way. Oh my goodness. It is fairly wonderful to see you. Good, sir. Where are your compatriots? And you came in through the back. Wowzers. Whoa, whoa. Slow down there, buddy. What's going on? Do you know about the mayor?
2522.24 2535.84 speaker4  Best turtle.
2534.72 2565.60 speaker2  It's my last name. We have the landlord. Mr. Vernon Covington takes care of all of our aggressive needs.
2563.12 2573.12 speaker4  just, what the fuck am I going to do?
2572.32 2577.76 speaker2  It's unusual. It's nuts.
2577.20 2585.36 speaker4  Please. We don't have a lot of time. My coworkers... Sure.
2585.04 2594.00 speaker2  Yes?
2593.52 2602.32 speaker4  Squirrel? Your faith.
2600.96 2608.00 speaker2  She's actually alive.
2603.04 2618.80 speaker4  Stevie is Faith, but she might be dearly departed soon if you don't help.
2611.44 2629.60 speaker2  I've still got a grip on what's going on here, so I'd say that I will help. I don't believe you that my sister is Stevie that didn't even look like her.
2628.72 2641.84 speaker4  Chuck Bidwell. If something happened to Chuck, who would be the mayor?
2640.64 2662.24 speaker2  Do you want to play VR? You were asking about who would be mayor if it weren't Chuck Bidwell.
2660.64 2678.48 speaker4  something awful happened. No, I don't think there is. Would you want to be the mayor? Let's hold an election right now. Hmm.
2676.48 2692.80 speaker2  I wasn't expecting to become mayor today. Well, why wouldn't Chuck just be mayor? This is purely hypothetical. Hypothetical.
2689.44 2699.52 speaker4  Well, I mean, you, you've got a really cool house. I think you should be mayor. Wow.
2698.00 2706.24 speaker2  Let's do this, buddy. Cool.
2705.44 2711.36 speaker4  Okay. Let's go do that.
2710.80 2716.32 speaker2  Okay. Hmm.
2712.96 2753.36 speaker4  She just had come back and she was about to see us off. Okay. Let's go now though. Strap it on augmented reality and you can play as we go. Okay. Roll persuade with a plus 40.
2752.64 2767.92 speaker2  He failed.
2766.56 2798.40 speaker4  Turn on the AR function. And it's like looking through your own eyes, but he has programmed it for us to like, we're like Pac-Man and we're running. It's got a crazy monster. Once you collect enough rings. Well, yes, of course.
2797.60 2809.28 speaker2  Get the rings. Let's go. Oh my God. Okay. So you're running out the front door.
2808.64 2814.88 speaker3  More rings.
2812.64 2858.42 speaker2  You brilliant son of a bitch. And you guys dip out ring collectors on your way through his backyard around the back area over the corpse with the metal cage around it. The corpse, the bear. It's a corpse. Yeah.
2858.02 2888.98 speaker4  Okay. Perfect. but not hard enough to go through. Break your bones.
2886.74 3006.34 speaker2  I need everyone to roll an alertness check for me. Let's start with Beck Wilder. You come to your stomach still just queasy, your hands wet and cold. You're feeling completely disoriented, but you hear this rumble and this noise and this strange kind of like maybe, oh, what do you, what is that? see down at the bottom of this enormous chasm as you come to and look over the edge. like strangely moving wet energy there at the bottom of the chasm and it shoots like a spray, like a jet stream through the windows of the church, the upside down church, the upside down church that is at the bottom of this chasm off to your right side. And I need you to roll grip.
3005.94 3020.10 speaker3  Okay.
3014.10 3141.94 speaker2  as your brain tries to figure out and kind of make it something that you recognize. So start putting those in order as you lose six grip, Luke is back. You smell that salty sea spray. You hear those voices calling out. And at this point you can once again ask one question or three yes, no questions. Okay. Right. It was extremely enormous. Now it's like still kind of similar looking, but it's down at the bottom and it's making its way. It's still enormous, bigger than a human making its way through the valley toward the church off to the right side, the upside down church stuck in this unnaturally smooth chasm. And then it dives through the glass and into pouring itself into this upside down church. Roll grip. It's incomprehensible. Your mind cannot handle what you see. Two plus one is three. That puts me at a 40. Jesus. That's low.
3140.34 3145.70 speaker3  Yeah, fight is number three.
3145.14 3153.94 speaker2  Okay. Freeze.
3151.78 3161.70 speaker3  You feel clammy hands.
3156.58 3234.10 speaker2  Your vision is kind of off your head, shaking, vibrating almost still. And when you look in that direction, you see where you had previously seen like this beautiful stained glass in the front of this church. Now you see it has been completely broken and there's a hole in the stained glass that leads into this church. Who would do that to a church? Teens. How many do you have so far, Julius? He's rolling. That is considerably more than you, sir. Yes. Julius was telling me that we're going to make me mayor. I'm sorry.
3233.86 3244.10 speaker3  What? How long was I tying my shoe?
3240.42 3246.04 speaker4  He's the emergency mandated mayor of Grover's Gorge. Stevie, Stevie.
3245.54 3256.76 speaker2  What? I feel fucking bad and weird. What happened? That noise. What was that?
3256.26 3266.50 speaker4  God.
3265.78 3281.70 speaker3  Beck, what? I got it on camera. I feel around for my camera.
3276.58 3285.32 speaker2  And as we have determined in this game, when Beck is conscious, he is filming. So yes, you shot what you saw. Dope. Yeah.
3284.82 3292.68 speaker3  Yeah. Yeah. Show me God.
3292.04 3336.84 speaker2  Should we go? What? Fox? I mean, we're going to make you the mayor. How would that help? We'd have to do the whole thing to get him back in. I don't know. What's the whole thing? I don't know, but it was a... I don't know any of it. He doesn't. hips a good loosening when old Julius popped in and suggested we do some AR while making me the new mayor for some reason. Or not even the new mayor, but just another backup, was it, behind Chuck Bidwell?
3335.64 3364.04 speaker3  What do you mean Julius showed up? He's been standing here by us this whole time.
3360.52 3370.36 speaker2  However, Beck Wilder, you're going to roll a D4.
3368.60 3379.16 speaker3  That brings me down to 51.
3373.16 3388.92 speaker4  I just thought that the thing had to be in the mayor and if we made someone the mayor, it would have to go back in.
3387.08 3400.12 speaker2  How do we make him the mayor? That doesn't seem right to me.
3394.28 3405.88 speaker4  I feel like you guys have, you know, can call Godel Law and make an emergency mandate. On God. On God. On God. On God.
3405.56 3419.64 speaker0  Okay.
3417.64 3428.92 speaker4  And Julius is like pointing at Fox.
3426.68 3436.84 speaker2  And as she finishes saying that.
3434.68 3455.40 speaker3  I was picturing her being the younger sister.
3450.04 3494.86 speaker2  A wildly frenetic, wet energy. him backwards, back towards the plant wall. You can either ask me one question or three yes, no questions about what you see, what you smell, what you hear, what you feel as this thing kind of zips past you and you're trying to perceive it, but it's really hard. Almost like it's incomprehensible.
3494.36 3500.68 speaker3  Yep. Did they ask good questions? Nope.
3500.12 3514.60 speaker0  Pressure's off.
3507.72 3518.60 speaker2  Is that something that you could tell from its appearance or sound or feel or taste?
3516.84 3520.12 speaker3  About how you perceive it. Okay.
3519.16 3529.08 speaker2  It's a good question. What's your name?
3525.32 3535.96 speaker3  Three yes, no questions or one question. Would you tell me if I asked a question that's already been asked? Okay. What's it smell like? Wait, no.
3535.16 3546.12 speaker2  How do I kill it? That's also not something you can perceive. Why not?
3545.08 3568.46 speaker3  I want to kill God.
3567.96 3574.22 speaker2  What?
3573.72 3580.68 speaker3  Did they? I've got intense decision paralysis here. I can't think of anything.
3579.56 3589.00 speaker2  Just go through the senses. I don't know. Well, they asked, look, what does it look like? I'm not going to tell you what they asked. I thought you said you would.
3586.12 3643.16 speaker3  If it had already been asked, you'd tell me to ask something. Okay. Luke asked me what it looks like, but okay. If you can hear me sign to me, I know one of them. Okay. How big is it? Great question. Yes. Just fucking tell me how big it is.
3641.48 3663.48 speaker2  Thousands of gallons of water? Yes. I need you to roll grip.
3662.68 3671.24 speaker3  19. Okay. All right.
3670.44 3673.56 speaker2  That was long.
3672.04 3690.60 speaker3  That was a long time rolling my ears. What'd you guys ask?
3684.20 3690.60 speaker0  Cause my life is great, and it's all mine. Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.
