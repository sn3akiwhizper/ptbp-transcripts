0.00 17.00 speaker0  Mmm, what happened to me? Damn, my arm hurts like a son of a gun.
14.08 357.14 speaker1  of some kind of alien stuff. What the hell? I did not order this treatment when I booked this place. Well, this is just totally shocking to me. I'm gonna have to leave a one-star review for this dimension on Dimensional Yelp. Poor service, would not recommend. to this here radio station. right when we are going live. anniversary here at the station. and I can bend it at my will, but it still feels real nice. Speaking of time, it's time for Howlin' with Wolf. And this edition of HWW is from At It's David Winters, which, legally speaking, is the best use of one's time. and doggy demeanor, but what I can't get behind is this cruelty your captors have inflicted upon you by trapping you down in this weird corner of Tennessee. You've seen some messed up stuff, things man or dog is not meant to see. You deserve to run wild and free, like the lone wolf deep inside. As a fellow captive also forced to perform against his will please know our time has come to make a break for freedom. Attached, please find a map. I too will be making my escape soon. See you on the other side, from David Winters. for I am incapable of being held within any kind of prison. I wait patiently in the dark ether, plotting, conniving, thinking, looking at this here map. We will feast and talk of our plans, dear David. If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram, tag pretending to be people on Facebook and let us know by email and pretending pod at gmail.com. Those five star reviews are really, really helpful for spreading the word about wolf and the podcast too, I guess. if they include the secret code phrase, fuck Zuck and pat all y'all cells on your sucker fucking backs. New and upgrading patrons over at patreon.com slash pretending pod have raised $433 in the month of November. We here at 694.2 PTPP are going to match that 433 to bring the grand total to $866 and counting. Wow, thank y'all. What a cool thing y'all helped us do to help some folks out in a real big way this winter. but first I've got some quick side notes to hit. The next episode you'll find in this feed is going to be part one of our four part run of control copy. The Delta green scenario chosen in a poll by the fine folks on Patreon. And it's my Christmas present to each and every one of you. So I'll drop that episode down your chimney on December 24th. So it's time for the news. Last time some secret spray from the handlers courier showed up purple on anyone infected, which was everyone but especially federal Marshall Harlan Nash. to ATF agent Tanner Tan-Luda hide why poor Jane had to die and his partner Cindy Woodabaga, along with the Marshall drove the teenage girl out to the sticks. They came back without Jane Allen with blood on their proverbial hands and dirt on their physical clothes. And that wasn't even the wildest shit that went down. Taking us now to an absolute shit show of a scene on the top floor of Groversville city hall in the alderman's conference room, which is covered in broken furniture and a metallic goo connected a bunch of alderman husks. It's Brad Pitt with Miss Mary.
353.14 387.74 speaker0  So I can't get high No, I can't get high I thought this stuff helped anxiety It must be something inside of me Does anybody know why I can't get high We're having a blast.
384.46 409.06 speaker2  Good. No, look, I want a satisfying conclusion here more than anything else. There are mechanisms where this could have ended that I will clue you into later.
406.06 415.14 speaker0  Also, we're going to do a recap and you're going to narrate it.
411.62 417.34 speaker2  And I get to do my own wolf, the dog too, as well.
415.14 426.58 speaker0  Can you give us a little sample of it?
423.78 429.10 speaker2  I can't do it for like the requisite five minutes in a row though. Right.
428.26 431.26 speaker0  What are you looking at? The air's not on, man.
429.94 490.54 speaker2  No. Okay, sorry. And welcome back to what has to be the finale as our guest handler. I am Zach and I'm playing Cindy Woodabaga. And I'm David and I'm being held against my will. Danny DeVito vibes.
487.14 507.30 speaker0  Would Tom Hanks play Swack Hammer in Space Jam Yeah, Tan has his 44 Magnum up to David's head and he's like, we're doing a fifth episode.
505.10 542.10 speaker2  at the end of the last one, huh? Hey, Luke, your Keith is showing. Yeah. He has to get out this episode because the contract he signs with us starts to kick in some really onerous terms for him if it does go to six. That was the one incentive to get me to end this quickly was that episode six clause. I hope you don't do that to my family members. I love them too much.
540.74 545.46 speaker0  Well, I hope we don't have to, David. I really hope we don't.
544.62 573.70 speaker2  That would be awful. Yeah, he knows if it goes to episode six, they're all getting squid gamed. Topical. Time stamp. This comes out in November. Maybe December for the fifth episode.
571.78 577.14 speaker0  Yeah, it's been a week since we recorded. What happened last week?
576.02 586.62 speaker2  Oh, on Squid Game? Well, last I checked, well, can I recap this one? Yeah, yeah, please do.
584.10 592.14 speaker0  He did it so beautifully at the end of the last episode. A week ago. Yeah, a week ago. It's wild that we spent five weeks with you already.
590.38 597.58 speaker2  I know, it's so much time. So much time. And this house is so small.
595.18 598.98 speaker0  We're gonna let you out pretty soon.
597.58 605.10 speaker2  Must be very hot where you are, the four of you crammed into there.
601.94 607.86 speaker0  Which you know because you're stuck in a cage in our house.
607.02 621.78 speaker2  That's true. I know this very well. He's like, wow, it looks hot where you guys are. Must be nice to just be hot. Through the peephole in the wall.
620.46 634.70 speaker0  Where the David can see it all. It's like him.
631.70 701.94 speaker2  that you just received from the FBI showing that this mysterious substance seems to be all over you, all over the place in the water supply. That made you not feel great. You went for a leisurely drive to the countryside. Well, two of you did. I believe it was Cindy and Harlan went to the countryside with young Jane Allen for a lovely scenic trip. And the rest of you rejoined each other at City Hall, went inside, passed the front desk agent, Miss Khan, ran upstairs, busted into the alderman's room to finally confront them. And what you were met with is a big pile of bodies and goo taking up almost half the room. And then a odd computer seems like a large laptop on a table near the front door. I really liked it a bunch. And when you were describing the metal goop
699.14 705.38 speaker0  I was getting chills like crazy.
702.78 718.90 speaker2  That's a really, really good transition, in fact, because the other thing we didn't do last episode is when you walked in the door, I need your real sanity. Yeah.
717.50 732.62 speaker0  I got a 13. And so Dan, when Dan enters the room, he lackadaisically sprays the solution at the blob.
730.38 781.60 speaker2  Leaving the spray bottle, you see a purple, it hits kind of the ground. The spray bottle itself, all the liquid inside of it just turns purple. I passed. I passed. I passed. you're only going to take one sanity damage from the unnatural. Otherwise it would have been a whopping eight. Now is not the time to lose one's head because there are several aldermen with their heads stuck in this pile of goo. that one would almost consider us to act
780.76 783.56 speaker0  Incredible.
781.60 787.40 speaker2  Are they laying down or are they sitting or are they standing around the table? How are they posed?
786.32 793.44 speaker0  They're like in a pile. Oh, right, right. The center of the room is the goo pile, yeah.
790.24 853.06 speaker2  Yeah, this is this massive heap of, instead of dirty clothes, it is metallic goo and the bodies are just kind of randomly thrown into it. Someone roll luck. Just give me a 50-50 luck roll. You do see him. He is arranged in such a fashion that his upper body is kind of oriented outward. He is still well into the goo, but you can kind of see his face towards the edge. He doesn't recognize you. None of these faces are looking at you, acknowledging you, but given their dexterity, it starts moving towards you. It's gonna move, cover about half the distance across the room. And I already took a glance at your character sheets. Jodine and Tan, I believe, both have a 14 dex.
850.56 911.02 speaker0  I want to say, gentlemen, aldermen, this is no way to account yourselves in the conference room and roll bureaucracy on them. Your fail is so bad that it seeps into my actions. Don't do this. What if you rolled and got something good? No, Tan's intent, no. spray them with the solution, but he grabs the wrong thing and he just shoots the blob with his gun.
909.92 921.16 speaker2  Correctamundo. You've been walking around with that thing, you've threatened the receptionist, you went to the bathroom with it out. So of course, it's already in your hand already.
920.32 924.08 speaker0  It's mechanical advantage, baby.
921.16 930.56 speaker2  Yeah, that's completely reasonable. Go for it, give me that firearms.
929.72 944.50 speaker0  Oh no. I pass it, easy peasy. 53 on a 70. Easy peasy, is that a new thing? You've been saying that. It is, I heard it from some guy I know.
941.32 974.00 speaker2  So that's within your range on a heavy pistol. So I believe that's gonna be 1D12 damage. So as you shoot at it, you kind of notice it just takes the bullet. It doesn't really seem to move, try to evade it or anything else. The bullet just punches into it. Yeah, you hit kind of the edge of it, so it doesn't hit center mass, if you will. Nothing really seems to happen.
972.16 977.42 speaker0  to see if there's any holes in this.
975.64 983.68 speaker2  Tiny cuts. As soon as Tan fires off his gun,
981.64 989.24 speaker0  because he did not intend to do that. And it was very loud too, because when you shoot a gun, it's loud. A magnum in a boardroom.
988.04 993.40 speaker2  Right, yeah. Pretty jarring.
991.40 1020.96 speaker0  The kind of sickness that he felt seeing this blob of stuff comes to a head, and I'll roll to see if I throw up. He holds it in. Oh no, you should have barfed. and he rolls the critical failure, he's gonna just bolt down the hallway.
1018.96 1025.78 speaker2  Same, both 12s.
1024.16 1034.52 speaker0  he assesses the situation pretty quick and sees that computer. You said it was a laptop, right?
1031.96 1059.32 speaker2  It's one of those thicker, more industrial or military models, where it's made to withstand falls. It is. In fact, those, because they're kind of so big and unwieldy, they actually have handles on them Like a very large briefcase, think of it that way. And you're strong enough to do that.
1058.24 1065.80 speaker0  That's what he wants to do, is he wants to grab it and get out of that room. I don't know how much I can do in a turn.
1064.64 1095.24 speaker2  and get most of the way out of the room. You're not gonna be down the hallway yet. Cool. Okay. So that brings us back to the top of the round. The Mound of Goo gets closer and closer and closer. You smiled so hard when you said that. You have a beautiful smile,
1092.84 1105.24 speaker0  but I don't like to see it when you're talking
1102.08 1136.74 speaker2  with Cindy standing there ready to slam the door, a pseudopod of goo comes lashing out, almost like a metallic whip. So this is gonna be basically an unarmed strike. So you can roll to dodge it. Cindy. And that's gonna be. Oh my God.
1134.98 1143.14 speaker0  That is over half of my hit points. I was gonna say how, what's your starting point?
1139.38 1178.06 speaker2  13 and I am now down to six current hit points. Hard. Hard. It lashes out with this metallic goo whip and hits you so hard, just right in the center mass, right in the stomach. I believe you also are stunned on the back end of that too, right? I believe I have to roll a constitution, is that? Is that what it is? A thing?
1176.02 1192.10 speaker0  So yeah, just roll con and. Yeah. Actually the damage it dealt to you, you counter attack and it actually gets dealt to them.
1191.26 1208.50 speaker2  Yeah. Wow, that's pretty interesting. How you play Delta Green. I think that works. Clearly I don't care about rules at all in any capacity.
1205.82 1219.20 speaker0  It is an automatic, I'm sorry, I'm being there. Oh, wow. We've got the real lawyer over here. There you go.
1218.36 1232.84 speaker2  You're stunned. Stunned. You wanted to close that door, but you kinda can't right now. Yeah, the stunner's stunned. But that's all the goo is gonna do.
1231.60 1243.14 speaker0  Okay, take a shot. 48 on a 70, he succeeds, he hits it. Give me damage. Six.
1238.14 1260.46 speaker2  You hit a chunkier portion of the slimy goo, but it doesn't slow down. And I just also wanna state mechanically, Cindy is stunned for this round, which means Cindy is not gonna be able to move or do anything and will have to make the con check to make sure she can act on her subsequent turn.
1259.62 1280.62 speaker0  No? Okay, sounds good. Joe Dean is running down this hallway and he's looking for a supply closet.
1278.06 1284.18 speaker2  It's a really odd architectural design. The janitor wears cargo pants.
1281.98 1286.44 speaker0  So then he busts into the first bathroom he sees after he doesn't see cars.
1285.14 1289.80 speaker2  Okay, if this goes long,
1286.44 1294.76 speaker0  you can get into this episode six closet.
1293.86 1297.90 speaker2  See what you did there. Call back.
1295.60 1324.06 speaker0  That's the best joke so far. So he, Kramer slides into this bathroom. 92 reference. Kramer versus Kramer? Kramer versus Kramer. You know, when Kramer famously, whichever Kramer, slides into Jerry's apartment. He slides into this bathroom and he's looking for any cleaning supplies.
1322.82 1330.50 speaker2  That's no problem. Some Clorox with bleach, some Windex.
1328.14 1359.78 speaker0  And he's specifically, he's remembering the solvent that Merle's bar reeked of. but maybe if we talked to them a little more, we might've found they were keeping some stuff at bay with that. But that's all he's got in this moment. I have 70 firearms, but my character doesn't carry a gun. any cleaner he can find. Okay, sure.
1354.86 1364.98 speaker2  Now, that is going to bring us to stunned Cindy
1364.14 1371.70 speaker0  Oh, go ahead.
1368.70 1375.84 speaker2  So you can't, she can roll now. So give me that con times five test.
1375.00 1380.66 speaker0  Con.
1378.70 1397.38 speaker2  All right, so success, not a crit success. So that means you're gonna be back normally next turn, but you are kind of dazed this turn. What you can do to help her, because you're basically adjacent right now, you have that suitcase of a computer in one hand. I'll say you can drag her. Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
1395.10 1403.44 speaker0  I didn't know if she was rooted in place or not. is just like pull her along. Okay.
1402.60 1408.14 speaker2  You can do that. So that'll be your turn. Get as far down the hallway as you can.
1406.96 1411.46 speaker0  We wanna get out of this building, I think. Exactly.
1408.96 1439.54 speaker2  So you do that and you notice as you get a little further away and as it would be kind of the ooze's turn, the ooze kind of stops at the threshold to the hallway and rumbles a bit and you can feel it in the floor, but doesn't follow. It stops right at the threshold. Yeah, we can drop out of initiative too. Joe Dean has cleaning materials.
1438.18 1443.56 speaker0  He's still in the room. It's blocking the doorway. Back out slowly.
1442.74 1452.02 speaker2  I thought he got out. I thought he got out. Yeah, I'm pretty sure you were out.
1449.70 1462.58 speaker0  But then we all ran out. I didn't run out though. But you described shooting at it from where Joe was.
1461.74 1466.06 speaker2  Maybe I was wrong.
1465.06 1475.22 speaker0  But thankfully you weren't, because then you'd be dead.
1474.38 1485.62 speaker2  This is an imagination.
1483.34 1502.90 speaker3  Four shots and then the chamber's empty. And they all hit.
1501.82 1533.26 speaker2  that you hit for one, nor this more center mass you hit for, I believe, six. You hit it, doesn't seem to do a lot. But now, apparently, your back is against the wall. Pseudopod is kind of blocking that double door Sounds about right. Okay, Joe Dean, you are in that current portion of initiative. You have cleaning supplies.
1531.62 1545.02 speaker0  He's gonna take his cigarette lighter and a half can of aerosol air spray from the bathroom and he's gonna fucking torch this thing.
1543.06 1567.90 speaker2  You are gonna be close enough, though, that it probably could lash out at you next turn, just as an FYI, but.
1566.62 1579.10 speaker0  Okay, great.
1574.42 1634.34 speaker2  Even though it was a two, it seems to actually affect it. The flame touching it seems to burn some of the metal, almost make the metallic goo kind of solidify and become solid, and there's no real sound, but it rumbles a bit, but that part of the surface towards the front that you were most adjacent to seems to cook a little bit. she yells to Tanner, who's trapped in this room with all of this broken down wood from the table. we need to get everything that can burn, we need to barricade this door, and we need to light it on fire from this side. We have lost Tanner, but he is gonna go out taking this thing down with him.
1630.86 1641.42 speaker0  and is now beelining for another office on this floor to find another table or chairs or anything to help with building a fire barricade.
1639.66 1652.82 speaker2  You can find that, no problem.
1650.14 1658.30 speaker0  for me to sit down and work on it. I thought about that. You've got all the stuff, that's good,
1655.90 1671.06 speaker3  now open up that laptop, start looking through it as we light this thing on fire.
1670.22 1682.02 speaker0  No! That's a 88. You're gonna make the metal stronger. You got nothing.
1678.26 1730.14 speaker2  In your panic, you start typing away at the computer, there's a password screen, and it's a military-grade laptop, like I said, and kind of in your haste, you mess something up and it went into a five-minute timeout. Football, one, two, three. Football, one, two, three, four. She's going to assist now that the barricade has been built Helping Jodine, Jodine has a lighter, she knows, so she's trying to help him start this fire. that she has in her backpack and pulls it out and it's just like a fire starter, this thing.
1729.30 1732.62 speaker0  Twisted fire starter?
1730.14 1748.58 speaker2  The whole thing is just going to go off. You just know it, David. Yeah, that was before they had good safety, like when it came to clothing, like those-
1746.54 1755.02 speaker0  Yeah, so rather than immolate herself, she's going to finally be rid of this dangerous sweater.
1753.90 1784.90 speaker2  it's going to be on Jodine's turn, right? Right. Okay, so sweater is down, great. Top of the round, pseudopod is going to lash out again from the slime, but unfortunately this time, tan is going to be on the receiving end of it. So you can feel free to roll me a dodge, but it does not like being shot at. I have a 14 under a 35, what do you got?
1781.38 1793.66 speaker3  Oh yeah, I have a hundred actually in dodge.
1791.54 1802.10 speaker0  Five points of damage.
1800.74 1814.06 speaker2  this time, so you're not stunned, but this time it lashes out and then cracks you. Can't lube hide.
1810.78 1817.82 speaker3  I couldn't see, I couldn't hear what you said. I just heard my name.
1815.94 1830.14 speaker0  I'm sorry, I didn't intend to interrupt. You can say it now. I pointed out, he can lube run, but he can't lube hide.
1827.74 1871.66 speaker2  It's good, you just have to put names in it and it gets even better. of it lashes out at you instead of hitting you right in the bread basket like Cindy, it hits you in the shins and cracks one of your shins and you feel your weight on that leg and it hurts, but you're still up, it doesn't knock you down. You still have your Magnum. You did not actually shoot four rounds last round. So you still have bullets in it. And that brings us to you.
1867.50 1908.22 speaker3  Like he sees them start barricading him inside of here and he's not happy about that at all. His shin is like all fucked up. He takes a package of skull out of his back pocket and puts the whole thing, huge dip in his mouth and it temporarily, you know. Unfortunately it is your whole turn. I was going to say, I think it temporarily gives me a little boost, but he holsters his Magnum and he wants to just try to jump over the barricade and out the door.
1907.14 1916.06 speaker2  A running leap.
1914.50 1925.90 speaker3  If he makes it out of here, he's going to have some choice words for these motherfuckers.
1922.86 1945.02 speaker2  because this is going to be an athletics role. This, remember, and here's the issue. This pile was like half the room. And so it's covering, this is a leap and not like leap and stay on your feet. This is like the full forward dive. I'm going head first.
1944.06 1956.42 speaker0  Yeah, yes.
1953.78 1974.54 speaker2  Otherwise you're landing in the goo.
1972.22 1989.06 speaker3  finishes the break in my leg and it just snaps underneath my weight.
1987.82 1997.14 speaker2  Before it, not after it. So you didn't? I didn't make it over.
1994.10 2005.38 speaker3  and I just fell down and my head is like two inches away from the edge of the goo blob. You fall down next to the blob
2003.66 2032.30 speaker2  like blank face. Just staring out in the distance, not at you, but just lifelessly peering out of the goo at you as you flop on the ground with your now broken,
2029.98 2072.82 speaker0  but if he looked up into the doorway whereas his fellow Delta Green or Greenies are, he would see Joe Dean's like face staring at him very intently and he looks sad and then he looks determined and you see Harlan on one side and Cindy on the other, like closing the big doors. and blast it onto the wood.
2069.86 2075.90 speaker2  I want the other three of you to roll sanity.
2075.06 2084.90 speaker1  Yeah.
2083.58 2094.30 speaker0  I actually fail.
2092.78 2096.74 speaker2  and then the other two of you are fine. That's a breaking point, sir.
2095.66 2101.06 speaker0  Oh, is it now?
2097.58 2151.18 speaker2  Unless you wanna project, but if you're anything like Luke, you like your bonds too much to do that. In what disorder do you have already? A need for making others uncomfortable. Okay. You're gonna cheat people at a distance. You're gonna pick up some amnesia.
2148.82 2164.10 speaker0  She watches these memories disappear. Oh, he got one in there.
2163.26 2173.14 speaker3  Slit it in. He got one in anyway.
2168.34 2224.42 speaker2  as Tan is no longer visible, as the doors ignite, the sweater ignites and whatever solvents you threw in. First, a check to see if we get a crit success or a crit failure firearms again to see the effectiveness of this. 60 on a 70. So success, that's good. And then I'm gonna need damage. There's a lot more accelerant now. So in fact, I'm gonna want you to roll 2D8 on this. You're not quite sure exactly what happened to it now that the doors are on fire and oh, the whole town hall is starting to catch a flame. Good. Good, yeah.
2222.66 2227.90 speaker0  Yeah, that was a plus in my mind from the get go.
2227.06 2229.98 speaker3  Yeah, right.
2229.14 2235.46 speaker0  What do you do?
2232.54 2245.78 speaker3  hopping over to the window that's like barricaded by the wood, the table, the whatever, you know, just trying to rip that off the window.
2244.38 2255.10 speaker2  Strength times five, I mean.
2251.50 2295.50 speaker3  the like barricade stuff off, I... That was good, yeah. As I'm trying to rip that off, I... You shout, winners is coming. he puts some weight on his broken leg is like poking out of his leg.
2293.74 2303.22 speaker0  As we're booking it down the stairs. Joe Dean is just like spraying everything he can with this flamethrower like lighter set up.
2300.38 2381.14 speaker2  Cindy takes one last look back down the hallway you're booking it down, you see the doors are burning, you can see smoke kind of coming through the crack of the door, see the fire starting to radiate out and catch more of the hallway. A lot of this town hall, even though it's stone on the outside, there's still a lot of wood inside. It's that old retro wooden paneling, similar to what you saw in the original room at the FBI briefing. And it's igniting. So the three of you are gonna be able to get outside There's a lot of smoke though. So for him to try one last time to rip open that window, I'm gonna need a con times five check first to see if he can overcome the smoke filling up his lungs to use just one last burst of strength. You're able to hold your breath. You don't let the smoke kind of overtake your lungs. You still have enough oxygen in your bloodstream to pull one more time at the board on the window.
2378.72 2404.74 speaker3  He checks the chamber of his gun and he's got three shots left. And at the edge of like the wood, this barricading the door, he just like fires into it to try to like break it up a little bit and then attempts to reach into the hole he's made and pull it off. Give me that strength. 35 pass.
2401.78 2440.42 speaker2  get it a little bit more loose, pops to the side. There's smoke now pouring out of that second story window of town hall and your body is kind of just hanging out at that first bit of fresh air, you gasp, but now you feel behind you the heat radiating and that hot, hot smoke coming out behind you. You can feel it almost discoloring your clothes. It's such an intense burning right now. What do you do? Would you?
2438.70 2456.82 speaker0  like assume we're passing her desk. Oh yeah, I shout, Khan! I didn't get it at first.
2454.48 2473.38 speaker2  There's no Khan, no response from Khan. if he's trying to get out that window, which we know he's trying to survive this, then maybe we can grab that fitted sheet on three sides
2470.74 2491.30 speaker0  Yeah, or maybe we put one in his corpse when he hits, you know, when he hits the ground, put one in his head. We scream. Right clicker! There!
2488.48 2499.58 speaker3  is there like a ledge that I can like get onto and try to like at least lower myself like five more feet before I just.
2498.06 2507.46 speaker2  it's somewhat garden. There's some really low bushes and then also just some ground.
2506.62 2510.78 speaker3  Roll him luck.
2509.96 2511.62 speaker0  Roll luck.
2510.78 2516.90 speaker2  You set it up.
2513.74 2520.98 speaker3  He like crawls down and like hangs off the ledge. So he's, you know, like a little bit closer to the ground.
2520.02 2526.52 speaker0  And it's like a really short, and basically his feet are just like pretty much dangling right above the ground.
2525.34 2557.06 speaker3  He looks down and he sees, there's either like pavement or bushes and he's going to like try to swing himself into the bushes and try to land like horizontally onto them. And it, and he loses his grip. Just so you know that a fail, a fail on my luck check.
2553.94 2599.74 speaker2  you went from a distance where we'd be rolling a lethality roll to actually control the amount of damage. no hedges, maybe some low flowers. Now I need a contest as well. Con times five check that comes after the fall. but not hard enough for you to lose your breath and become stunned. Anyone who survives the fall has to see if they're stunned.
2597.94 2606.42 speaker3  I'm down to four hit points. So I took more than half, took more than half. But was that what that role was? No, that was for the fall.
2604.74 2610.82 speaker0  So you're stunned anyway. Yeah. Fair.
2609.22 2626.52 speaker3  I land horizontally. I like brace my head with my arm as I fall. So I don't like whack my head. Breath is knocked out of me and I'm like, I can't move. I can't function right now. At least you got out.
2623.52 2665.00 speaker0  and he, he looks at the gun he carries and he says, do you have what it takes to do it? Or will you give me that gun? Who's screaming. You need to. You piece of shit. Fair. But you got to keep your voice down kid. Can't be heard screaming like this.
2663.74 2672.04 speaker3  I reach my hands out.
2671.20 2680.48 speaker0  Birds? No.
2679.36 2684.36 speaker2  Holy shit, dude.
2682.92 2704.78 speaker0  He turns and looks at Cindy. And I, yeah, I pick his broken body up from the ground and, and like fireman carry him away from there.
2703.08 2810.42 speaker2  You get him into the Bronco. The building is burning. It is a raging inferno now. You don't see Khan, no matter how loud you scream. But remember the town hall is right in the center of Grover'sville and around it, there was the Sheriff's office next door, the town library, the post office. Just as you're getting into the Bronco and the inferno, you're confident that pile of goo is thoroughly cooked at this point. It seemed as though fire is what really could damage it. But almost as soon as fire fully engulfs the upper floor of the building, you see people in town walking out of their places of business. You see the Sheriff, Dan Oakley, who you would talk to, some of his deputies kind of just walking out in front of the Sheriff's office. You see the presumably librarian walk out of the library. Some postal workers walk out of the post office. Murrell's auto and body is right there. Some of the mechanics walk out. And you can see even in the distance, some of the further businesses, everyone's walking out, but they're not walking out looking at the fire or looking at you. They walk out and you see them grasping at their necks and coughing so loud and violently. You can see almost their eyes go bloodshot. They're coughing so hard as capillaries burst in their eyes and slowly they all just keel over. And everyone that walked out, whether it's the Sheriff's librarian, you're sitting in the Bronco watching this
2809.58 2824.06 speaker0  What about us? Yeah, how are we feeling? We don't give a shit about them. Yeah. No, that's fucking crazy though.
2821.06 2825.02 speaker2  Joe, unfortunately, and by Joe, I mean, Harlan.
2824.06 2839.38 speaker0  My partner, oh. Oh, Joe. Yeah.
2837.86 2843.26 speaker3  Did he fall out a fucking window?
2842.02 2855.74 speaker0  I should have shot him. He's very mad.
2852.46 2876.90 speaker2  around where your kidneys are, your intestines, an intense amount of pain. And as you feel that pain, it starts to move further up almost as if your organs are reorganizing themselves up into your stomach, into your chest and it gets harder and harder to breathe
2875.06 2896.50 speaker0  I imagine that he was in the back seat and he is now pushing himself against the back of the seat in that space back there.
2895.66 2905.70 speaker3  No.
2902.22 2919.74 speaker0  I mean, I try to show him his own pistol. or do I feel like I could do something?
2917.26 2938.06 speaker2  it happened to everyone else much quicker, but you can feel those coughs coming on. You can feel your eyes, just the pressure against it from gasping for breath plus the coughs. You're not vomiting uncontrollably or anything at this point, but it doesn't look good.
2935.06 2974.34 speaker0  he is trying his hardest to nod yes with eyes bleeding. and I just drag Harlan out like a sack of potatoes by the scruff of his shirt. I'm sorry, I liked your polos and he puts one between the eyes. Oh, the alien got him. We have to call. Where's the Crown Vic? It's at the hotel. All right, let's go. No, it's here, it's here.
2973.14 2989.14 speaker2  We get in the DEA car. We need to get on the phone and call Derringer, stat.
2987.74 2990.86 speaker0  Not really.
2990.02 2993.94 speaker2  It's fitting.
2990.86 3007.58 speaker0  And she's gonna call our handler Derringer
3006.14 3030.22 speaker2  Yeah? They haven't really learned to track those or listen to those as well.
3027.82 3076.02 speaker0  Grover'sville needs a cleanup crew ASAP. I would say literally everyone. What do you have, Joe? Well, when we say cleanup, first of all, When we say cleanup, you might have to burn this place to the ground. you probably need to send a more specialist team to maybe investigate the water supply.
3075.18 3097.26 speaker2  Wait, what do you have? Hold on, you have a laptop. All right, get the laptop here now. Memphis Field Office, I'll have a room set up with someone ready to go. The issue is I cannot get a team there for at least six to eight hours. It has to come from DC. We can't get those resources here.
3094.18 3099.86 speaker0  so I don't think anyone will show up for six to eight hours.
3098.18 3114.42 speaker2  You guys just get out of there. Hopefully the rest of you are fine, but just give me that laptop now. No one is going to be there for at least six hours.
3112.02 3130.38 speaker0  There's no one left in Grover'sville. So I think the dead will be fine for the next six or eight hours.
3126.86 3135.38 speaker2  in a Crown Vic or a Ford Bronco?
3132.30 3139.90 speaker0  if you could let local authorities know to not pull us over,
3136.58 3155.86 speaker3  And Tan is still sitting in the back of the Bronco Cause no one got me.
3154.46 3197.58 speaker0  Cindy was yelling shut the fuck up to no one in particular in the back seat. So we got to go get that fucking piece of shit. We saved him once. So now I like owe him my air, whatever, how that works. You know- Jar Jar Binks clause, I know. Yeah, exactly. It's a Jar Jar situation. Who was a guy we know. Yeah. We don't dislike you. It's just the mission. They called for it. You're lying in extreme pain in the back of this Bronco, just like looking at the felt on the roof of it.
3196.18 3206.32 speaker3  Well, I was trying to get out, but the child blocks are on, so I'm like stuck in there.
3202.14 3210.34 speaker0  Yeah, you hear the Crown Vic like crunch back up and roll to a stop. As soon as I hear that,
3208.26 3219.06 speaker3  like all my energy has been expended trying to get out of here, but I hear you guys coming back and I just pass out.
3216.74 3227.66 speaker0  throws him into the back of the Crown Vic and we bust it to the Memphis field office.
3225.38 3273.50 speaker2  and Jodine sitting shotgun. Yeah. And then a passed out tan in the back and then a dead Harlan in the trunk. and you're heading Southwest towards Memphis, lying low in the opposite direction towards town are three Blackhawk helicopters. Fuck yeah. as you drive towards Memphis and scene. That's scene as far as you know it. Ooh, hit us with the next scene. Well, no, I mean, there's not really much of the next scene. It's kind of how much.
3272.38 3279.54 speaker0  Tell us secrets.
3277.80 3326.10 speaker2  What doesn't add up at this point? And what do you want to know? Who called in that Blackhawk? and as long as it stays in Delta Green's hands and they correctly look at it, it was a communication device between the aldermen in town and some other civilians, Majestic 12 and the Grays. It was the aliens the whole time abducting these citizens to form the experiments. where you could have actually confronted the aliens and fought the aliens themselves.
3322.96 3333.06 speaker0  I tried to ask the aldermen to behave themselves. They were not interested in discourse.
3330.32 3400.98 speaker2  A small farm about three miles outside of town. Where you shot Jane Allen. That was converted into basically an experimentation area where all these people were, where they stored all the gray goo and they were just injecting this gray goo into people, more or less replacing people's organs. So that's what happened to Billy Ray. They replaced all of his musculature with this goo. Joe had his digestive organs replaced last night while he was sleeping. Because it was just him in a room. They were able to just slip in, grab him, return him afterwards. or they just lived in town long enough that they had ingested enough of this material that it was just all in their bloodstream and everywhere. Even if they didn't replace a particular organ, it was all inside of them. To make matters worse, once you have that much of it inside of you, so none of you except maybe Joe, but maybe still not even Joe, the aliens can see through your eyes, the aliens can control you, and they use it mostly for security.
3399.50 3405.34 speaker0  And they know who your crush is. Don't tell.
3404.34 3418.46 speaker2  They use it for security. So they're often controlling the sheriff, but they'll use other kind of senior people and stuff. That's why everyone was being so weird about people not being missing. Yeah, I was gonna ask,
3416.86 3430.22 speaker3  the people that we talked to, were they just like lying to us and they knew about the alien stuff or did they not have any clue? There's just too much of it in them already?
3428.46 3442.14 speaker2  and it's called work, work, work, work. And basically everyone can just in their brain reason as to why people aren't around and it's totally fine. Like the mom is just like, yeah, my daughter, like she's cool. What, like why should I be worried? Yeah, that was really sad.
3441.10 3443.10 speaker0  Or my husband's like, I'm a cool mom.
3442.14 3483.38 speaker2  She's a cool kid. But yeah, that's one of the questions, I guess. And it's kind of a tier based system. There's the Single Deuce, The Double Deuce, which is a double cheeseburger with a medium shake. And then the Mega Deuce, which is eight patties. extra large milkshake. And the slogan is, it's so good,
3482.06 3498.02 speaker3  That is, it's a good slogan. It's catchy.
3496.42 3511.38 speaker2  He really wasn't. He was not. He was just an alderman, but all the alderman.
3509.62 3520.66 speaker0  We noticed that, yeah, but we did notice that it was all the alderman, we're all the men. And so we smashed the patriarchy tonight, boys.
3519.26 3536.10 speaker2  And killed everyone else down there.
3534.24 3540.54 speaker0  She would have died either way.
3538.02 3584.88 speaker2  You didn't really go around spraying the purple stuff on her or on Joe, for that matter. You probably would have realized Joe was actually completely screwed Yeah, stripped down and started like spraying your bodies. You would have seen the same incision marks kind of on Billy Ray's arms. Oh shit, the one person whose arms we didn't look at. She was just recently pregnant with Billy Ray about a week before he went on his crime spree. She didn't even know, she was abducted. They took out her uterus with the baby, gave her this, it's called proto-matter, the goo, then put something, you don't know.
3582.28 3588.00 speaker0  like coughed and died slowly? Yeah.
3585.72 3607.42 speaker2  Can you choose like one child out of the town and describe that in detail for us? Well, I can tell you about, so a lot of people had experiments, right? So the little kids that you met at the reservoir that were pounding seven and a half pieces a piece, they had work done on their livers. They had super livers.
3606.02 3629.30 speaker0  Oh wow. This was such a blast and thank you for sticking around for this extended episode.
3626.14 3633.18 speaker2  because we could have just thoroughly harassed citizens for presumably. So many more.
3631.70 3637.72 speaker0  If we didn't even touch the bowling alley, we could have like.
3636.88 3643.50 speaker3  No, not at all.
3640.32 3647.80 speaker2  largely because Zach gave me very few options as far as things he has not looked at before. That's my way.
3646.96 3651.22 speaker0  I liked it.
3649.48 3664.74 speaker2  It's only like a dozen pages. It's something you could hypothetically do with efficient players who stay on track for things.
3661.86 3673.94 speaker0  David, those are, that's just an urban legend. Oh, those players don't exist. I think they just play different games, maybe.
3671.68 3680.04 speaker2  But no, thank you very much for having me. This was a fun crossover event. Like I said, I love you guys' stuff.
3677.90 3681.48 speaker0  Yeah, the pleasure was all ours, completely.
3680.04 3707.60 speaker2  Thank you for all of this. Thanks for everyone, I guess, who listened and put up with me for the last five episodes. Blessed with your presence. Those people who know me from elsewhere, who followed along, hopefully I haven't totally ruined Delta Green for you either.
3705.78 3709.76 speaker0  You've got plenty to catch up on.
3707.60 3715.52 speaker2  You can see where they cut their teeth by harassing random civilians.
3712.48 3783.14 speaker0  Yep, it's kind of our trademark. Just authority figures abusing that power for petty reasons and little gain. Okay, well, David, we're gonna open the cage now. He's scampering. He's scampering. Oh, wow. When I make a scamper, that's what I think of. There's a little dust trail. His calves are good. He did not want to be here. I can't get high. I can't get high.
3781.14 3846.58 speaker1  Does anybody know why?
3841.58 3901.58 speaker3  And I can't help the feeling I'll always be at the bottom. I think I'm allergic or something. Better go on with nothing so I won't get high. No, I won't get high. By all means, do it if it helps. For me, it makes my brain melt easy. Does anybody know why? I can't get high. Thank you for watching.
